                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 1996 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new Compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 1996 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 6860 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
  abbreviated citation for Section 100.735-1, appearing in Chapter I of 
                                      this book, is ``3 CFR 100.735-1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  1997, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
Division by Carolyn Wood Hill, Anna Glover, John S. Ashlin, Maxine Hill, 
                                                        and Brad Brooks.

Proclamation 6860 of January 2, 1996
Death of Admiral Arleigh A. Burke
A Proclamation
As a mark of respect for the memory of Admiral Arleigh Burke, one of our 
Nation's foremost naval heroes, I hereby order, by the authority vested 
in me as President of the United States of America by section 175 of 
title 36 of the United States Code, that the flag of the United States 
shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at 
all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the 
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United 
States and its Territories and possessions until interment. I also 
direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at 
all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other 
facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels 
and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6861 of January 12, 1996
Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 1996
A Proclamation
Our country's motto, ``E Pluribus Unum''--out of many, we are one--
charges us to find common values among our varied experience and to 
forge a national identity out of our extraordinary diversity. Our great 
leaders have been defined not only by their actions, but also by their 
ability to inspire people toward a unity of purpose. Today we honor Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., who focused attention on the segregation that 
poisoned our society and whose example moved our Nation to embrace a new 
standard of openness and inclusion.
From Montgomery to Birmingham, from the Lincoln Memorial to Memphis, Dr. 
King led us to see the great contradiction between our founders' 
declaration that ``all men are created equal'' and the daily reality of 
oppression endured by African Americans. His words have become such a 
part of our moral fabric that we may forget that only a generation ago, 
children of different races were legally forbidden to attend the same 
schools, that segregated buses and trains traveled our neighborhoods, 
and that African Americans were often prevented from registering to 
vote. Echoing Abraham Lincoln's warning that a house divided against 
itself cannot stand, Dr. King urged, ``We must learn to live together as 
brothers, or we will perish as fools.''
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call for American society to truly reflect the 
ideals on which it was built succeeded in galvanizing a political and 
moral consensus that led to legislation guaranteeing all our citizens 
the right to vote, to obtain housing, to enter places of public 
accommodation, and to participate in all aspects of American life 
without regard to race, gender, background, or belief.
But despite the great accomplishments of the Civil Rights Movement, we 
have not yet torn down every obstacle to equality. Too many of our 
cities are still racially segregated, and remaining barriers to 
education and opportunity have caused an array of social problems that 
disproportionately affect African Americans. As a result, blacks and 
whites often see the world in strikingly different ways and too often 
view each other through a lens of mistrust or fear.
Today we face a choice between the dream of racial harmony that Martin 
Luther King, Jr., described and a deepening of the rift that divides the 
races in America. We must have the faith and wisdom that Dr. King 
preached and the convictions he lived by if we are to make this a time 
for healing and progress--and each of us must play a role. For only by 
sitting down with our neighbors in the workplace and classroom, reaching 
across racial lines in our places of worship and community centers, and 
examining our own most deep-seated beliefs, can we have the honest 
conversations that will enable us to understand the different ways we 
each experience the challenges of modern life. This is the peaceful 
process of reconciliation that Dr. King fought and died for, and we must 
do all we can to live and teach his lesson.

[[Page 3]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 15, 1996, as the 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this occasion with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
                                                              Proc. 6862
<R05>
Proclamation 6862 of January 12, 1996
Religious Freedom Day, 1996
A Proclamation
On this day over 200 years ago, Virginia's General Assembly passed a law 
that created the first legal protection for religious freedom in this 
country. Introducing his bill to the Virginia Assembly, Thomas Jefferson 
stated that he was not creating a new right confined simply to the State 
of Virginia or to the United States, but rather declared religious 
liberty to be one of the ``natural rights of mankind'' that should be 
shared by all people. Jefferson's language was shepherded through the 
legislature by James Madison, who later used it as a model for the First 
Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Americans have long benefited from our founders' wisdom, and the 
Constitution's twin pillars of religious liberty--its protection of the 
free exercise of religion and its ban on the establishment of religion 
by the Government--have allowed an enormous diversity of spiritual 
beliefs to thrive throughout our country. Today, more than 250,000 
churches, synagogues, mosques, meeting houses, and other places of 
worship serve to bring citizens together, strengthening families and 
helping communities to keep their faith traditions alive. We must 
continue to ensure full protection for religious liberty and help people 
of different faiths to find common ground.
Our Nation's profound commitment to religious freedom reminds us that 
many people around the world lack the safeguard of law to protect them 
from prejudice and persecution. We deplore the religious intolerance 
that too often tears neighbor from neighbor, and we must remain an 
international advocate for the ideal of human brotherhood and sisterhood 
and for the basic rights that sustain human dignity and personal 
freedom. Let us pledge our support to all who struggle against religious 
oppression and rededicate ourselves to fostering peace among people with 
divergent beliefs so that what Americans experience as a ``natural 
right'' may be enjoyed by individuals and societies everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitu

[[Page 4]]

tion and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 1996, 
as Religious Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs, 
and I urge all Americans to reaffirm their devotion to the fundamental 
principles of religious freedom and religious tolerance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
                                                              Proc. 6863
<R05>
Proclamation 6863 of January 30, 1996
National African American History Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Today's schoolchildren are fortunate to grow up in classrooms where they 
are taught to appreciate all of the many heroes of American history. 
While previous generations read textbooks that told only part of our 
Nation's story, materials have been developed in recent years that give 
our students a fuller picture--textured and deepened by new characters 
and themes. African American History Month provides a special 
opportunity for teachers and schools to celebrate this ongoing process 
and to focus on the many African Americans whose lives have shaped our 
common experience.
This year, our observance emphasizes black women and the strides made to 
bring their achievements to the fore. From Sojourner Truth's sermons, to 
Mary McLeod Bethune's speeches, to the contemporary novels of Nobel 
laureate Toni Morrison, the voices of African American women have called 
attention to the twin burdens of racism and sexism and have invited 
listeners to discover the richness of traditions kept alive in back 
kitchens and workrooms. In churches and communities, and more recently 
in universities and statehouses across America, these women have fought 
extraordinary battles for social, economic, and political empowerment.
Barbara Jordan once wrote,

  `We the people'; it is a very eloquent beginning. But when the 
Constitution of the United States was completed on the seventeenth of 
September, 1787, I was not included in that `We the people.'

As we mourn the loss of this great American, let us honor her by seeking 
to further the progress made since those early days toward true equality 
and inclusion. During African American History Month and throughout the 
year, we must embrace the diverse strands of our story so that all 
children can see themselves in our Nation's past and know that they have 
a role to play in seizing the future's countless opportunities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitu

tion and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 1996, as 
National African American History Month. I call upon Government 
officials, educators in schools, colleges, universities, and libraries, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this month with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs that raise awareness of 
African American history and invite further inquiry into this area of 
study.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6864 of February 1, 1996
American Heart Month, 1996
A Proclamation
There are few among us whose lives have not been touched by the 
devastating effects of heart disease. Cardiovascular disease, which 
includes heart disease and stroke, takes one million of our citizens 
each year, and heart disease remains the single leading cause of death 
in this country. Millions of Americans suffer from high blood pressure, 
and millions more have high levels of blood cholesterol. Studies also 
show sharp increases in the number of people who are overweight and 
physically inactive.
It is, however, encouraging that public health efforts are raising 
awareness of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Though some--
family history and age--are inescapable, the risks posed by high blood 
pressure and high cholesterol, lack of exercise, smoking, diabetes, and 
obesity can be greatly reduced through modifications to personal 
behavior. Advances in research have helped us to gain a better 
understanding of heart disease, provided new diagnostic methods, and 
helped develop treatments that save lives and vastly improve the outlook 
for stricken patients.
We can be proud that the Federal Government has contributed to the fight 
against heart disease by supporting the efforts of the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, 
and by promoting new dietary and health guidelines. The American Heart 
Association, through research, education programs, and the work of its 
vital network of volunteers, has also played a crucial role.
As we observe American Heart Month, let us build on our achievements by 
learning more about the causes of heart disease and by making the 
changes we can to improve our cardiovascular health. Recognizing that 
even small adjustments to diet and exercise habits can yield significant 
benefits, we can help those who already suffer from heart disease and 
encourage those who are taking their first steps toward better, 
healthier lives.
In recognition of the need for all Americans to become involved in the 
work to stop heart disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 169b), has requested that the 
Presi

[[Page 6]]

dent issue an annual proclamation designating February as ``American 
Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 1996, as American Heart Month. I 
call upon the Governors of the several States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in reaffirming our 
commitment to combatting cardiovascular disease, including heart disease 
and stroke.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6865 of February 7, 1996
150th Anniversary of the Smithsonian Institution
A Proclamation
When James Smithson, an English scientist, died in 1829, he gave his 
entire estate ``to the United States of America, to found at Washington, 
under the name Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the 
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.'' This extraordinary 
gift, amounting to one and one-half times the Federal budget of the day, 
led to passage of an Act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian 
Institution. Signed by President James Polk on August 10, 1846, this 
legislation created a Board of Regents to oversee the execution of 
Smithson's trust.
Today, 150 years later, the Smithsonian Institution is famed around the 
globe, and its collections are enjoyed by thousands of Americans and 
foreign visitors every day. Through dedicated original research, the 
preservation of an unequaled collection of artifacts, and the 
presentation of public exhibitions and programs, the Smithsonian truly 
embodies its benefactor's dream. As one of the foremost repositories of 
American heritage and culture, the Institution provides unique insight 
into our history and the development of our vibrant national character.
As we celebrate the sesquicentennial of the Smithsonian Institution, let 
us recognize the work done by its many museums, research facilities, and 
educational endeavors and rededicate ourselves to the ``increase and 
diffusion of knowledge'' James Smithson sought to advance. In doing so, 
we can more fully explore the wonders of our world and continue to bring 
people together for the common pursuit of knowledge.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, and in honor of the memory of James Smithson 
and to commemorate the accomplishments of the Smithsonian Institution, 
do hereby proclaim August 10, 1996, as the 150th Anniversary

[[Page 7]]

of the Smithsonian Institution and urge the people of the United States 
to observe this anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6866 of February 26, 1996
American Red Cross Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Since its founding in 1881 by Clara Barton, the American Red Cross has 
brought hope and healing to citizens and communities across the country. 
Today, some 1.4 million trained volunteers work to fulfill the Red 
Cross' mission by providing relief to disaster victims; by ensuring that 
our Nation has an adequate and safe blood supply; by training millions 
of Americans in essential lifesaving and safety techniques; and by 
assisting members of our Armed Forces, their families, and our 
distinguished veterans.
This past year, the American Red Cross has carried on its extraordinary 
legacy across the country and around the world. When a bomb destroyed 
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, the 
Red Cross was there within minutes to assist those whose loved ones were 
killed in the tragic blast. After a series of record-breaking storms and 
hurricanes ruined houses and displaced people, the Red Cross served more 
than a million meals and helped victims to begin rebuilding their lives. 
And today, as OPERATION JOINT ENDEAVOR works to secure the peace in 
Bosnia, the Red Cross is facilitating emergency communications between 
our troops and their families at home.
The Red Cross has earned our Nation's deepest respect and appreciation 
for its important lifesaving and life-rebuilding work and for its 
countless daily efforts to promote health and safety. This month and 
throughout the year, let us take time to recognize this vital 
organization and do all we can to further its goals of preventing, 
preparing for, and responding to emergencies.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 1996, as American Red Cross Month. I 
urge all the people of the United States to support Red Cross chapters 
nationwide by volunteering and participating in Red Cross blood drives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six,

Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996
Declaration of a National Emergency and Invocation of Emergency 
Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement of 
Vessels
A Proclamation
WHEREAS, on February 24, 1996, Cuban military aircraft intercepted and 
destroyed two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international 
airspace north of Cuba;
WHEREAS the Government of Cuba has demonstrated a ready and reckless 
willingness to use excessive force, including deadly force, in the 
ostensible enforcement of its sovereignty;
WHEREAS, on July 13, 1995, persons in U.S.-registered vessels who 
entered into Cuban territorial waters suffered injury as a result of the 
reckless use of force against them by the Cuban military; and
WHEREAS the entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial 
waters could again result in injury to, or loss of life of, persons 
engaged in that conduct, due to the potential use of excessive force, 
including deadly force, against them by the Cuban military, and could 
threaten a disturbance in international relations;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws 
of the United States of America, including section 1 of title II of 
Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (50 U.S.C. 191), 
sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, find and do 
hereby proclaim that a national emergency does exist by reason of a 
disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations. In 
order to address this national emergency and to secure the observance of 
the rights and obligations of the United States, I hereby authorize and 
direct the Secretary of Transportation (the ``Secretary'') to make and 
issue such rules and regulations as the Secretary may find appropriate 
to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels, and delegate to the 
Secretary my authority to approve such rules and regulations, as 
authorized by the Act of June 15, 1917.
Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the 
anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the 
territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or is 
susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and 
that may create unsafe conditions and threaten a disturbance of 
international relations. Any rule or regulation issued pursuant to this 
proclamation may be effective imme

diately upon issuance as such rule or regulation shall involve a foreign 
affairs function of the United States.
Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized to inspect any vessel, foreign or 
domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, at any time; 
to place guards on any such vessel; and, with my consent expressly 
hereby granted, take full possession and control of any such vessel and 
remove the officers and crew, and all other persons not specifically 
authorized by the Secretary to go or remain on board the vessel when 
necessary to secure the rights and obligations of the United States.
Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such departments, 
agencies, officers, or instrumentalities of the United States as the 
Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this 
proclamation. Such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities 
shall, consistent with other provisions of law and to the extent 
practicable, provide requested assistance.
Sec. 4. The Secretary may seek assistance from State and local 
authorities in carrying out the purposes of this proclamation. Because 
State and local assistance may be essential for an effective response to 
this emergency, I urge all State and local officials to cooperate with 
Federal authorities and to take all actions within their lawful 
authority necessary to prevent the unauthorized departure of vessels 
intending to enter Cuban territorial waters.
Sec. 5. All powers and authorities delegated by this proclamation to the 
Secretary may be delegated by the Secretary to other officers and agents 
of the United States Government unless otherwise prohibited by law.
Sec. 6. This proclamation shall be immediately transmitted to the

Proclamation 6868 of March 1, 1996
Irish-American Heritage Month, 1996
A Proclamation
I am pleased to count myself among the over 40 million Americans who can 
trace their heritage back to Ireland. Like so many of our forebears, 
immigrants from the Emerald Isle came to this country seeking dignity 
and prosperity, and they brought with them traditions rooted in the 
values of family and faith. Some arrived on our shores even before our 
Nation was founded, lending their energy to the establishment of our 
Republic; nine sons of Ireland signed the Declaration of Independence, 
and our first President, George Washington, proudly claimed Irish 
ancestry.

[[Page 10]]

The largest wave of Irish immigration occurred 150 years ago, when more 
than 1 million people left Ireland for America as potato blight and 
famine devastated their homeland. These sons and daughters of Erin 
transformed our cities, stimulating industry and commerce from New York 
to Boston to Chicago. In pursuing the American Dream, they set an 
example of courage, hard work, and determination that was to be followed 
again and again by hopeful newcomers.
Today, Irish Americans celebrate this history and the contributions that 
their brethren have made to all aspects of American life--providing 
leadership in Government, the law, business, finance, literature, and 
the arts. Renewed interest in Gaelic culture has led to university 
courses in Irish studies, and hundreds of Saint Patrick's Day parades 
across the country attest to the vigor of Irish American communities. 
This month and throughout the year, let us recognize the gifts brought 
to America by children of Ireland and honor the strengths they have 
added to our national character.
In tribute to all Irish Americans, the Congress, by Public Law 103-379, 
has designated March 1996 as ``Irish-American Heritage Month'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in 
observance of this month.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1996 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all the people of the United States 
to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6869 of March 1, 1996
Save Your Vision Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Vision is a remarkable gift. Our eyes allow us to read, to see the faces 
of our loved ones, and to experience many of life's greatest pleasures. 
Too often, we take our sight for granted and must be reminded that our 
eyes require regular care and attention. The more we learn about 
preventing eye disease and vision loss, the better equipped we will be 
to take care of these vital organs.
Many young people suffer from vision-related learning disabilities that 
jeopardize their academic success. However, with early intervention, 
such sight problems are often easily correctable. Senior citizens, too, 
are particularly vulnerable to eye difficulties, but we are fortunate 
that advances in

[[Page 11]]

medical research are improving our understanding of the diseases that 
often rob older Americans of their sight.
As a result of these new technologies and discoveries in the field of 
eye care, many diseases that would have caused permanent sight loss just 
decades ago can now be treated with excellent prospects for full 
recovery. For example, people with diabetes can reduce their risk of 
blindness with timely laser surgery, the effects of glaucoma can often 
be prevented, and studies are exploring the role of vitamins and 
minerals in slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration 
and cataract.
To educate people about these strides and to encourage all Americans to 
protect their precious eyesight, the Congress, by joint resolution 
approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 169a), has 
authorized and requested the President to proclaim the first week in 
March of each year as ``Save Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 3 through March 9, 1996, as Save Your 
Vision Week. I urge all the people of the United States to participate 
in this observance by making eye care and eye safety a priority and to 
recognize the important contributions that vision research makes to our 
lives. I invite eye care professionals, the media, and all public and 
private organizations committed to the goal of sight preservation to 
join in activities that educate our citizens about the simple steps they 
can take to save their vision.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6870 of March 8, 1996
National Park Week, 1996
A Proclamation
For millions of visitors every year, America's 369 national parks serve 
as living examples of the diversity, history, and natural wonders that 
have always defined this country. We owe a debt of gratitude to the men 
and women of the National Park Service, whose outstanding work to 
preserve and protect these treasures ensures that they will be available 
to educate and enrich generations of Americans to come.
The National Park Service also reaches beyond the boundaries of our 
parks to share knowledge and expertise with other nations, State and 
local governments, American Indian tribes and Alaska Natives, agencies, 
and thousands of organizations and individuals. National Park Service 
programs are helping community leaders to create green spaces in urban 
areas from Seattle to Philadelphia; to rehabilitate the historic canal 
in Augusta, Georgia; and to return grey wolves to Yellowstone, red 
wolves to the Great Smoky

[[Page 12]]

Mountains, big horn sheep to the Rocky Mountains, and the peregrine 
falcon to parks nationwide.
Our national parks benefit from the work of many citizens dedicated to 
environmental stewardship and historic preservation. By working directly 
with the National Park Service or through the National Park Foundation, 
its congressionally chartered nonprofit corollary, park partners sponsor 
educational programs, raise funds, provide visitor services, and donate 
time and materials to support our great public resources. These partners 
include the Student Conservation Association, the Boy Scouts and Girl 
Scouts, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and hundreds of 
other interested organizations. Drawn from corporations, associations, 
and communities everywhere, over 100,000 Americans volunteer annually to 
keep our park system strong.
This year, National Park Week is dedicated to recognizing and 
celebrating the commitment of the National Park Service and its partners 
to America's unique historical, cultural, and natural heritage. I urge 
all the people of the United States to learn more about our national 
parks, the programs available in their communities, and to seek out 
opportunities to become a national park partner.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22 through April 28, 
1996, as National Park Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6871 of March 11, 1996
National Poison Prevention Week, 1996
A Proclamation
As we recognize National Poison Prevention Week, we can be proud of the 
35 years of public health efforts that have dramatically reduced the 
number of childhood deaths caused by poisoning. Measures such as child-
resistant packaging and the lifesaving work of poison prevention experts 
have raised awareness of this important issue and given families and 
caregivers strategies to safeguard young people from harm.
Nevertheless, the American Association of Poison Control Centers 
estimates that over one million children each year are exposed to 
potentially toxic household materials. The Poison Prevention Week 
Council, a coalition of 38 national organizations dedicated to ending 
this threat, distributes valuable information to poison control centers, 
pharmacies, public health departments, and others to aid community 
poison prevention efforts. In addition, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission has long required child-re

[[Page 13]]

sistant packaging for a number of medicines and household chemicals. The 
recent development of such packaging that is easier for adults to open 
will mean more conscientious use of hazardous products and a decreased 
risk of accidental poisoning.
This week and throughout the year, we must remember that small safety 
measures--such as using child-resistant packaging correctly and keeping 
harmful substances locked away from children--can save lives. And if a 
poisoning occurs, a poison control center can offer emergency 
intervention. By keeping these simple measures in mind, we can better 
protect our children and make home safety a routine part of our daily 
lives.
To encourage the American people to learn more about the dangers of 
accidental poisoning and to take preventive steps, the Congress, by 
Public Law 87-319 (75 Stat. 681), has authorized and requested the 
President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March of 
each year as ``National Poison Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 17 through March 23, 1996, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week 
by participating in appropriate ceremonies, activities, and educational 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6872 of March 19, 1996
Women's History Month, 1996
A Proclamation
It is impossible to fully appreciate America's proud history without 
recognizing the extraordinary contributions that women have made to our 
country since its founding. Women's History Month provides an 
opportunity to celebrate the countless women who have enriched our 
Nation and to ensure that their achievements--in homes and businesses, 
schools and hospitals, courtrooms and statehouses--will always be 
remembered.
We have come a long way since Abigail Adams asked her husband John to 
``remember the ladies'' when drafting the Constitution, and we recognize 
that women not only have broadened and reshaped the path laid by our 
Founding Fathers, but also have made new avenues toward progress and 
justice. Female workers filled the textile mills that drove the 
Industrial Revolution. Women like Susan B. Anthony, Ida B. Wells-
Barnett, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton fought tirelessly for suffrage and 
women's rights. Jane Addams founded America's first settlement house for 
poor immigrants and established social work as a new and respected 
field. And farm and mi

[[Page 14]]

grant laborers across the country gained the leadership of Dolores 
Huerta when she joined the newly created United Farm Workers Union.
Indeed, there is no aspect of our history left untouched by women--from 
the first published American poet, Anne Bradstreet; to Sacajawea, Lewis 
and Clark's interpreter and guide; to Harriet Tubman, heroine of the 
Underground Railroad; to Margaret Mead, who revolutionized the study of 
anthropology. Writers and artists such as Laura Ingalls Wilder, Mary 
Cassatt, Beverly Sills, Amy Tan, and Martha Graham have captured our 
imaginations. Champions like Wilma Rudolph and Bonnie Blair have taken 
America to great heights in the international sports world.
Today, women make up close to half of our Nation's labor force, and 
women-owned businesses are changing the face of the American and global 
economies. But barriers to equality remain. Despite the efforts of women 
like Esther Peterson, a leader in the effort to end gender-based salary 
differences, many women are still paid considerably less than their male 
counterparts. Often these women also struggle with the dual 
responsibilities of raising a family and meeting the demands of a full-
time job.
Last September, thousands of women from around the globe met to discuss 
these issues at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in 
Beijing, China, and to develop a Platform for Action. The resulting 
document represents a powerful consensus on the need to advance women's 
status by improving access to education, health care, jobs, and credit. 
It describes the fundamental desire of all women to enjoy basic legal 
and human rights and to take part in political life. Only through our 
commitment to these principles can we forever end discrimination and 
injustice based on gender, promote women's full participation in all 
aspects of American life, and join people everywhere who seek true 
equality.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1996, as Women's 
History Month. I call upon Government officials, educators, and all 
Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and activities; to remember year-round the many important contributions 
that women make to our country each day; and to learn and share

Proclamation 6873 of March 22, 1996
Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 1996
A Proclamation
While Hellenic literature, art, architecture, and philosophy have 
profoundly influenced western civilization for over 2,000 years, 
democracy remains the most precious gift to our world from the Greeks of 
ancient times. This manner of government, placing authority directly 
into the hands of the people, has long fulfilled the needs and 
aspirations of freedom-loving nations around the world. Our founders 
chose to adopt the democratic system when declaring America's liberty, 
just as the Greek Constitution enshrines democracy as the governing rule 
of the Hellenic Republic.
It is one of history's great ironies that Greece, the birthplace of 
democracy, was subject for centuries to foreign domination, culminating 
in almost four hundred years of political suppression by the Ottoman 
Empire. The Greeks' age-old love of liberty remained strong, however, 
and in 1821, Greece began its successful struggle for self-
determination.
Today, as we commemorate the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary 
of Greek independence, the citizens of Greece and the United States 
remember that with democracy come great responsibilities--to seek 
peaceful solutions to civil differences, to foster freedom and human 
rights in all nations, and to ensure that our laws continue to build 
upon our strong democratic foundation.
Standing shoulder to shoulder, Americans and Greeks fought for these 
principles on the battlefields of World War II and through the dark days 
of the Cold War. Today, while we celebrate Greek independence, we also 
remember all those around the world who still endure oppression and are 
denied economic, social, or political freedom. In recent years we have 
seen many nations break the bonds of tyranny, and we must continue to 
support others who seek to embrace democracy's promise. In doing so, we 
look forward to a day when people everywhere enjoy the rights and 
liberties that Greeks and Americans are so proud to share.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 1996, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Death of Edmund Sixtus Muskie
A Proclamation
As a mark of respect for the memory of Edmund Sixtus Muskie, one of our 
Nation's foremost public servants, I hereby order, by the authority 
vested in me as President of the United States of America by section 175 
of title 36 of the United States Code, that the flag of the United 
States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and 
grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval 
vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and 
throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions on 
Saturday, March 30, 1996. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at 
half-staff on that day at all United States embassies, legations, 
consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military 
facilities and naval vessels and stations.

Proclamation 6875 of March 29, 1996
Cancer Control Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Research and the prompt application of research results have proved to 
be the strongest weapons we have against cancer. And we are making great 
strides in the study of this deadly disease. Indeed, the understanding 
of the processes by which a normal cell is transformed into a cancer 
cell is one of the great achievements of cancer research. Genetic 
studies are leading to better understanding of many cancers and 
improving our ability to intervene and stop their spread. While the 
implications of some findings are still unclear, we know that further 
progress hinges on continued scientific inquiry, and we understand that 
basic research must remain a national priority. In addition, all of us 
can act on information already at hand to make lifestyle choices that 
reduce the risk of developing cancer.
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States 
and contributed to nearly one-third of all cancer deaths in our Nation 
last year. In addition to causing 400,000 deaths, smoking left others 
living with cancer, respiratory illness, heart disease, and other 
illnesses. Despite the clear link between smoking and these illnesses 
and deaths, each day 3,000 young Americans begin to smoke--a habit that 
will shorten the lives of 1,000 of them. We must address this problem. 
That is why the Food and Drug Administration proposed ways to limit 
young people's access to tobacco, as well as ways to limit the 
advertising that is so appealing to our youth. That

[[Page 17]]

is also why this Administration published the Synar regulation--to 
ensure that States have and enforce laws prohibiting sales of tobacco to 
young people.
Scientific evidence has also led to an increased understanding of the 
links between the foods we eat and certain types of cancer. By reducing 
dietary fat, increasing fiber intake, consuming a variety of fruits and 
vegetables, and avoiding obesity, every American can take steps to 
reduce the risk of cancer. The National Cancer Institute, in 
collaboration with the food industry, sponsors ``5 A Day For Better 
Health,'' a national program that encourages people to eat five or more 
servings of fruits and vegetables daily. And researchers continue to 
investigate nutrition programs that may have the potential to prevent 
cancer.
Mammography is another resource that can make a vital contribution to 
cancer control efforts, helping doctors detect breast tumors at an 
early, more treatable stage. Indeed, 93 percent of all women diagnosed 
with early breast cancer this year will live 5 years or longer. 
Recognizing the importance of this diagnostic tool, third-party 
reimbursement for mammograms is on the rise, and Medicare covers most of 
the cost of screening mammography for women over the age of 65. I 
encourage State governments, insurance providers, medical facilities, 
and employers to develop policies that improve women's access to this 
life-saving, affordable procedure.
In another step forward, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed 
changing its review process for new cancer therapies. This new approach 
will shorten development time by several years, and the FDA is also 
cutting its own review time in half--from a year to about 6 months. All 
of these changes mean new therapies will be available sooner and will be 
accessible to more of our Nation's cancer patients. The FDA's initiative 
could immediately affect at least 100 drugs now being studied--with 
dozens of them getting to the market sooner--and improve the lives of 
millions of Americans who can take advantage of those therapies.
To publicize these advances and options, the National Cancer Institute's 
Cancer Information Service helps patients, health professionals, and the 
public in all 50 States and Puerto Rico. Toll-free telephone service 
provides accurate, up-to-date information about prevention and detection 
methods, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and research. In 
addition, the CIS' outreach system has developed partnerships with other 
cancer organizations and Federal, State, and local health agencies to 
promote cancer education initiatives aimed at medically underserved and 
other special populations.
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the National Cancer Act, which 
expanded and intensified America's efforts to stop cancer. We can take 
pride in the gains that have been made toward this goal during the past 
quarter-century, but we must also remember the essential work that 
remains. As we observe Cancer Control Month, let us renew and strengthen 
our abiding commitment to controlling and eliminating this disease so 
that our children and grandchildren can lead longer, healthier lives.
In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution 
requesting the President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April 
as ``Cancer Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 1996, as Cancer Control

[[Page 18]]

Month. I invite the Governors of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and the appropriate 
officials of all other areas under the American Flag to issue similar 
proclamations. I also call upon health care professionals, private 
industry, community groups, insurance companies, and all interested 
organizations and individuals to unite in support of our Nation's 
determined efforts to control cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6876 of March 29, 1996
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 1996
A Proclamation
In looking forward to the 21st century, we recognize that excellence in 
education is the key to our Nation's future. At a time when we face 
difficult choices about how best to strengthen that future, our 
commitment to meaningful education for our youth must remain absolutely 
firm--we have a profound obligation to put children's needs first and to 
make the essential investments that will help them succeed.
Throughout his distinguished life, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson was 
an advocate for the high-quality education and strong values young 
people need to become productive and caring citizens. Drawing on a deep 
tradition of faith and a dedication to strengthening family and 
community ties, the Lubavitcher Rebbe sought to help our youth become 
responsible leaders and moral thinkers.
On this day and throughout the year, let us join parents, teachers, and 
concerned people everywhere who are following Rabbi Schneerson's example 
by empowering young people with essential skills and knowledge. By 
nurturing their minds and spirits together, we can help our children to 
embrace all of the exciting challenges ahead.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 1996, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon educators, volunteers, and 
all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation 6877 of April 2, 1996
National Day of Prayer, 1996
A Proclamation
America's heritage is rich with expressions of faith in God. Indeed, the 
desire for religious freedom was one of the chief reasons that early 
settlers risked their lives to come to this land. Many of those who 
braved the long ocean journey were men and women of devout religious 
beliefs who sought a new home where they might worship without 
persecution. The authors of our Constitution recognized this history in 
the language of the first amendment, and through times of uncertainty, 
sorrow, and pain, the citizens of the United States have called upon the 
wisdom and mercy of the Almighty for guidance and strength.
A National Day of Prayer, first proclaimed by the Continental Congress 
in 1775, stems from the understanding that faith is a fundamental part 
of our Nation's social fabric. In an impassioned speech before the 
Constitutional Convention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin put the importance 
of prayer in perspective, proposing that ``. . . prayers imploring the 
assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in 
this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business . . . . '' And 
so it has been to this day in statehouses all over our great land.
Today we cherish the liberties the first immigrants fought so hard to 
obtain, and we enjoy a degree of freedom and prosperity only dreamed of 
200 years ago. And though our citizens come from every nation on Earth 
and observe an extraordinary variety of religious faith and traditions, 
prayer remains at the heart of the American spirit. We face many of the 
same challenges as our forebears--ensuring the survival of freedom and 
sustaining faith in an often hostile world--and we continue to pray, as 
they did, for the blessings of a just and benevolent God to guide our 
Nation's course.
This occasion calls us to affirm our country's spiritual roots and to 
humbly express our gratitude to the source of our abundant good fortune. 
As we seek to renew the values that have long strengthened America's 
families and communities, let us reach out to God and to one another for 
wisdom and courage. We should celebrate this day in the tradition of our 
founders who believed that God governs in the affairs of men and women, 
and who based their greatest hopes, dreams, and aspirations on the 
surety of divine protection.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, has called on our citizens to 
reaffirm annually our dependence on Almighty God by recognizing a 
``National Day of Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 2, 1996, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
encourage every citizen of this great Nation to pray, each in his or her 
own manner, seeking strength from God to face the challenges of today, 
requesting guidance for the uncertainties of tomorrow, and giving thanks 
for the rich blessings that our Nation has enjoyed throughout our 
history. ``Do not pray for easy lives,'' said John F. Kennedy in 1963, 
``Pray to be stronger . . . .'' May it be so with each of us.

Proclamation 6879 of April 5, 1996
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Throughout our history, America's Armed Forces have stood proudly in 
defense of the United States and of freedom everywhere. Countless 
courageous service men and women have given their lives for our Nation, 
and many others have sacrificed their own freedom as prisoners of war so 
that the cause of liberty might prevail.
Enduring with patience and determination, prisoners of war are a 
powerful reminder that the indomitable spirit of the American soldier 
cannot be broken, even by brutal treatment in violation of international 
law and morality. In Nazi Germany, Japan, North Korea, Vietnam, and 
Iraq, prisoners of war repeatedly demonstrated their devotion to duty, 
honor, and country, despite the often terrible suffering inflicted upon 
them by their captors.

[[Page 21]]

On this day and throughout the year, let us honor all who have borne the 
indignities of captivity in service to our country, remember the brave 
soldiers who died as prisoners in foreign lands during our Nation's past 
struggles, and recognize those at home who anxiously awaited their loved 
ones' return. Their faith in God, love of family, and trust in our 
Nation are an inspiration to all Americans, and we will always remember 
their sacrifices.
NOW, THEREFORE I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 1996, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I ask all Americans to join me 
in honoring former American prisoners of war who suffered at the hands 
of our enemies, and I call upon Federal, State, and local officials and 
private organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
programs, and activities.

Proclamation 6880 of April 5, 1996
National Day of Remembrance of the Oklahoma City Bombing
A Proclamation
On the morning of April 19, 1995, America was devastated by news of an 
explosion at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. As 
rescuers rushed to the scene, citizens across the country waited by 
their televisions and radios for information, and we prayed for the 
children, Federal workers, and many others caught by the bomb's deadly 
blast. Despite heroic efforts of emergency personnel and countless 
samaritans, 168 people lost their lives as a result of the brutal 
attack.
For a year we have mourned the dead, aided the residents of Oklahoma 
City in their struggle to rebuild, and strengthened our resolve to fight 
terrorism. And though it has been a sad and challenging time, the 
outpouring of love and support for those affected by the tragedy has 
helped our Nation to come together in common purpose. As we mark the 
first anniversary of the bombing, we remember the victims and honor 
their memory with a moment of silence. In prayer and quiet reflection, 
let us move forward together to foster peace in our land.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, April 19, 1996, as

Proclamation 6881 of April 8, 1996
National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 1996
A Proclamation
America is a country of many blessings--a rich land, a thriving 
democracy, a diverse and determined people. Our culture is built on 
faith in freedom and on the spirit of community. In a Nation of such 
infinite promise, the continuing problem of child abuse is a national 
tragedy. When any American child experiences the horrors of physical or 
emotional abuse, the future of our Nation also suffers. We must always 
remember that today's children will be tomorrow's leaders, educators, 
and parents, and we must help them to look forward with hope and 
enthusiasm to the future.
My Administration is working hard to make this country a better place 
for all our children. Although domestic violence and child abuse are 
primarily matters for State and local authorities, we have taken 
significant steps at the Federal level to prevent the conditions that 
can lead to abuse. Both the National Child Protection Act of 1993 and 
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 contain 
provisions that help communities identify offenders who may pose a 
threat to children's well-being.
In addition, our Family Preservation and Family Support Services were 
designed to give parents the tools they need to keep their families 
intact and raise healthy, happy children. These include parenting 
classes, programs that send a visitor to the homes of first-time parents 
to provide support and guidance, and early developmental screening of 
children. Bipartisan support for this initiative--the first Federal 
investment in child welfare protection in more than a decade--has 
enabled States to use resources flexibly and creatively to strengthen 
families and work to reduce child abuse.
But government alone cannot end mistreatment. Social service agencies, 
schools, religious organizations, law enforcement agencies, businesses, 
and concerned citizens are all working to help children live up to their 
full potential. These efforts to provide loving and protective 
environments for our Nation's children exemplify the finest traditions 
of service and compassion. This month and throughout the year, let us 
each do everything we can to strengthen families and ease the pain of 
abused children. Together, we can make an investment in the future by 
putting the needs of our most precious and vulnerable citizens first.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitu

[[Page 23]]

tion and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 1996, as 
National Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to

that raise awareness of the need to help our children lead happy, 
productive lives.

Proclamation 6882 of April 10, 1996
National D.A.R.E. Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Drug abuse and violence pose serious threats to the health and well-
being of American youth. We must redouble our efforts to help children 
understand the consequences of destructive behaviors and give them the 
tools they need to succeed. This critical endeavor requires all of us--
government, law enforcement, schools, religious communities, and 
families--to work together.
Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is a proven means of 
communicating a strong anti-drug, anti-violence message to students of 
all ages. This year, D.A.R.E. will provide 33 million young people, from 
kindergartners to 12th graders, with information and strategies to help 
them resist peer pressure and to avoid drugs, tobacco, inhalants, and 
alcohol abuse throughout their lives. Reaching children in 30 countries, 
all 50 States, and 70 percent of our Nation's school districts, D.A.R.E. 
also empowers students with vital conflict resolution and anger 
management skills.
Today and throughout the year, let us recognize this program as a model 
of effective, grassroots organization and commend D.A.R.E. officers for 
their dedicated efforts to promote health and safety. As an integral and 
valued part of countless American schools, these caring men and women 
are joining parents, teachers, and concerned citizens everywhere to help 
children lead safe, healthy, productive lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 11, 1996, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon families, educators, and all the

Proclamation 6883 of April 11, 1996
National Pay Inequity Awareness Day, 1996
A Proclamation
More than three decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act and Title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act, women and people of color continue to 
suffer the consequences of unfair pay differentials. In comparing median 
weekly earnings, last year American women earned only 75 cents for every 
dollar a man brought home, with African American women and Hispanic 
women collecting just 66 cents and 57 cents, respectively. Significant 
wage gaps exist for African American and Hispanic men, Asians, Pacific 
Islanders, and Native Americans as well.
April 11 is the day on which American women's wages for 1996, when added 
to their entire 1995 earnings, finally equal what men earned in 1995 
alone. Unfair pay practices exist at all education levels and in every 
occupation. Last year, women physicians and lawyers earned substantially 
less than their male counterparts. The problem is particularly acute in 
female-dominated professions and in jobs where minority groups are 
disproportionately represented. Though changing technologies and a 
growing demand for services have made their positions increasingly 
vital, America's child care providers, secretaries, textile workers, 
telephone operators, social workers, and maintenance people are among 
those who bear the greatest wage discrepancies.
Ensuring fair pay is an essential part of helping women and their 
families become and remain self-sufficient. According to 1993 data, the 
vast majority of households depend on the wages of a working mother, and 
12 percent of all families are supported by a woman working as the 
single head of household. Studies show that salary inequities often 
force women to turn to public assistance to keep a roof over their 
children's heads and food on the table.
Fair pay equity policies can be implemented simply and without incurring 
undue costs. Twenty States have already established programs aimed at 
increasing the wages of employees in female-dominated jobs, and many 
private sector businesses have implemented voluntary policies. These 
employers understand that fair pay is an invaluable human resource 
management tool that helps attract and retain the best workers.
At the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, China, the 
United States joined more than 180 other countries to address problems 
facing women and to promote workers' basic rights. This was an important 
step, and we must build on it to further the dialogue about fair pay and 
treatment in this country. Women and minority workers have long fueled 
our Nation's progress, and we must do all we can to recognize their 
achievements and to leave a legacy of equality and justice for their 
children to cherish.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 11, 1996, as 
National Pay Inequity Awareness Day. I call upon Government officials,

[[Page 25]]

law enforcement agencies, business and industry leaders, educators, and 
all the people of the United States to recognize the full value of 
women's skills and contributions to the labor force. I urge all 
employers to review their wage-setting practices and to see that their 
employees, particularly women and people of color, are paid fairly for 
their work.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6884 of April 11, 1996
Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Today, the nations of the Western Hemisphere share a greater commitment 
to peace and democracy than they have at any other time in history. This 
consensus has at its core the ideas that liberalized markets work, that 
democracy is the foremost means of protecting individual human rights, 
that free trade is the best mechanism to promote growth, and that all of 
these principles combine to offer hope for improving people's lives. The 
interdependence of our many countries ensures our united efforts toward 
these common goals.
We have seen remarkable success from hemispheric cooperation in recent 
years--from migration issues, to counter-narcotics measures, to 
promoting trade. This cooperative spirit energized the Summit of the 
Americas in 1994, where representatives from 34 democratically-elected 
governments committed themselves to democratic principles, effective 
governance, sustainable economic growth, and a cleaner global 
environment. This historic gathering recognized that peace and economic 
prosperity in any one country are contingent on the health of its 
neighbors.
We can also take pride in our hemisphere's abilities to address the 
challenges of our rapidly changing world. The Mexican financial crisis 
that shook markets last year was contained and reversed because of U.S.-
led international support and the region's governments' redoubled 
commitment to economic reform. Similarly, the progress toward resolving 
the border dispute between Peru and Ecuador demonstrated the dedication 
of the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol and others to keeping our 
hemisphere on a steady course. Nevertheless, recent violations of 
international law and human rights are sad reminders that one country 
continues to refuse to join our family of democratic nations.
As we approach the next century, let us celebrate our achievements and 
maintain high expectations for the continued progress of our hemispheric 
partnerships. In doing so, we can ensure that the Americas will continue 
to prosper, integrate, and solve problems in a cooperative, mutually 
beneficial manner.

NOW, THEREFORE I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

American Day and April 14 through April 20, 1996, as Pan American Week. 
I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and officials of all other areas under the flag of the 
United States to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies, 
programs, and activities.

Proclamation 6885 of April 17, 1996
National Volunteer Week, 1996
A Proclamation
The history of America is a history of volunteerism. Our people have 
always worked together to resolve concerns, to fight injustice, to 
rebuild communities, and to comfort those in need. And though some 
regard today's society with cynicism and doubt, we need only look to the 
more than 89.2 million volunteers who work tirelessly throughout the 
year to see that we are still a people who care for one another and who 
daily seek positive change by reaching out to others.
We owe a great debt to the many volunteers who work to stem the tides of 
poverty, hunger, homelessness, crime, and abuse. Examples of unsung 
heroes exist in every neighborhood--a mother starts an after-school 
program in her garage to tutor young people in a crime-ridden area; a 
group of teenagers takes youngsters from a local shelter to the movies 
or a cultural event a few times a month; an elderly man looks after his 
neighbor's children so that she can run errands; a family makes regular 
visits to seniors at a local home. Citizens from all walks of life are 
working together to claim our Nation's challenges as their own, building 
bridges among people and setting a powerful example of leadership and 
compassion.
This week and throughout the year, let us salute all those who devote 
their time, their talents, and sometimes even their lives to the 
betterment of our communities. And let us recognize organizations like 
the Corporation for National and Community Service and the Points of 
Light Foundation that foster the spirit of service across America. In 
partnership with government, schools, and religious communities, these 
caring individuals and groups are expanding and encouraging the great 
American legacy of volunteerism.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April 27, 
1996, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to

[[Page 27]]

observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities 
to express appreciation for volunteers and to encourage volunteer 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6886 of April 19, 1996
National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Thousands of lives have been saved by the miracle of organ and tissue 
transplantation, a medical procedure made possible only by the 
extraordinary generosity of those who agree to donate and the profound 
compassion of their loved ones. Recipients are often able to resume 
normal lives after their transplants, working and caring for their 
families, and many children are in school today due to a donated liver 
or bone marrow. Still, the need for organs far exceeds the number 
donated, and many Americans wait--and some will die waiting--for 
suitable organs or tissues to become available.
Although our Nation has a potentially adequate supply of organs and 
tissues, there are more than 45,000 patients on the national transplant 
waiting list, and some 2,000 new names are added each month. We must 
educate all Americans about transplantation and its successes and raise 
public awareness of the urgent need for increased donation. All of our 
citizens should know that by completing a donor card and carrying it, 
and particularly by making family members aware of the wish to donate, 
they may save the health, or even the life, of someone in need.
Americans are a caring people, and our Nation's citizens have always 
reached out to one another in times of trouble. Organ donation is a 
unique example of that spirit of giving, and many who have lost loved 
ones have found comfort in knowing that their loss means the promise of 
life for others. This week and throughout the year, let us recognize the 
advances made in organ and tissue transplant techniques, honor those who 
have already pledged their organs, and encourage people to make the 
life-giving decision to donate.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April 27, 
1996, as National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. I call upon 
health care professionals, educators, the media, public and private 
organizations concerned with organ donation and transplantation, and all 
the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate 
activities and programs that promote organ donation and invite new 
donors to get involved.

Proclamation 6887 of April 19, 1996
Jewish Heritage Week, 1996
A Proclamation
The Jewish experience in America has been a mutually rewarding one for 
this country and for the Jewish people. Jewish Americans have made great 
contributions in such fields as the arts and sciences, business, 
government, law and medicine, enriching America's heritage with the 
resonant tradition of an ancient people. And America, for its part, has 
been a land of opportunity for its Jewish citizens.
In many ways, the Jewish experience is unique, freighted with the 
anguish of frequent persecution, but ennobled by an unyielding spirit 
that has always found a way to turn darkness into light. In the crucible 
of sorrow, the Jewish people have reaffirmed, time and again, the basic 
human values of faith, community, justice, and hope.
On the tolerant soil of American democracy, the Jewish people have 
flourished. We will be forever grateful for the remarkable contributions 
of our Jewish citizens, and it is fitting that we set aside a week to 
give thanks for their inestimable gifts and to honor the traditions of 
their remarkable religion and heritage.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April 28, 
1996, as Jewish Heritage Week. I call upon the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.

Proclamation 6888 of April 19, 1996
National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 1996
A Proclamation
On April 19, 1995, millions of Americans witnessed the chaos and anguish 
wrought by a single bomb blast in Oklahoma City that took 168 lives and 
injured scores of others. For days afterwards, our Nation joined the 
survivors in a grim vigil as somber work crews entered the wreckage 
again and again to locate victims.
That bomb blast in Oklahoma City was a devastating reminder that too 
many Americans have become victims of crime. Although violent crime has 
decreased every year for the last 3 years, 83 percent of our citizens 12 
years of age and above will experience violent or attempted violent 
crime in their lifetimes. And worse, 52 percent will be victimized more 
than once. Added to these grim statistics is the reality that violent 
crime is increasingly a problem of our youth. For 12- to 19-year-olds, 
the chance of being assaulted, robbed, or raped is two to three times 
higher than for adults, and perpetrators of crime are both younger and 
more violent. In 1994, for example, about 33 percent of all violent 
crimes were committed by those under 21 years of age.
There is another, more positive, dimension to the aftermath of crime: 
the multitude of dedicated professionals and volunteers who support and 
assist crime victims. They are emergency medical technicians and 
firefighters, law enforcement officers and rescue teams, victim 
assistance providers and shelter workers. At the darkest of moments, 
these selfless men and women renew our Nation's faith in humanity, and 
their advocacy embodies the time-honored American traditions of 
compassion and service. They constitute a community of caring whose 
healing work helps victims to become survivors. As a Nation, we owe 
these generous individuals our deepest gratitude for making our 
communities better and safer places in which to live and work.
While 1995 brought tragedy, it also brought the implementation of one of 
the most comprehensive crime laws ever enacted. The Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 furthered the rights of victims 
in the Federal justice system and targeted resources for criminal 
justice improvements. The Crime Act's provisions include truth-in-
sentencing provisions that ensure longer sentences for violent offenders 
and allocution rights for victims that give them the right to speak in 
court before the imposition of a sentence. The Crime Act also provides 
hundreds of communities around the Nation with increased law enforcement 
personnel, and its Violence Against Women Act is the first comprehensive 
Federal effort to combat violence against women.
The Crime Act is just one landmark in a crime victims' movement that has 
spanned 20 years and brought many hard-won reforms. A victims' bill of 
rights--once a novel idea--is now a reality in virtually every State. 
Victim assistance programs, which were few in the 1960s, now number in 
the thousands. Every State has a compensation program to help reimburse 
victims for mental health, medical, and other expenses resulting from 
the crimes committed against them. And in 1995, the Crime Victims Fund 
in

[[Page 30]]

the U.S. Treasury, which supports many of these programs, surpassed the 
one-billion-dollar mark in funds collected and distributed to the 
States.
As we reflect on the events of 1995, let us remember both the horror and 
the compassion we felt last April. Let us not slip into complacency when 
we hear or read about another crime victim. Whether we are business 
owners or teachers, clergy or physicians, neighbors or colleagues, we 
must join the community of caring and lessen the burdens on our Nation's 
crime victims. Let us join together to build safe and responsive 
communities and to promote justice and healing for all who have suffered 
from violent crime.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April 27, 
1996, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge all Americans to 
pause and remember crime victims and their families by working to reduce 
violence, to assist those harmed by crime, and to make our homes and 
communities safer places in which to live and raise our families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6889 of April 30, 1996
Loyalty Day, 1996
A Proclamation
In his inaugural address, President John F. Kennedy said, ``Since this 
country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to 
give testimony to its national loyalty.'' The members of our Armed 
Forces have long responded to such a call, though their task has often 
been difficult and fraught with peril. Drawing on an abiding devotion to 
country, America's service men and women have faced loneliness and 
danger, grave injury and death, to protect our Nation's interests and to 
reach out to others by providing humanitarian assistance.
In pausing to honor all those who have dedicated their lives to our 
freedom, let us reflect on their deep commitment to the fundamental 
ideals of independence, justice, and equality--the very foundations of 
our way of life--and draw inspiration from their shining example. For 
more than 200 years, America's shores have embraced immigrants seeking 
opportunity, while our system of government has encouraged people around 
the world who struggle against tyranny and oppression. Following the 
brave men and women who wear our Nation's uniform, let us each do our 
part to strengthen this legacy and to ensure that future generations 
will enjoy and cherish the precious liberties we hold so dear.

[[Page 31]]

To nurture loyalty to and love of country, the Congress, by Public Law 
85-529, has designated May 1 of each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' We spend 
this day in celebration of our Constitution and Bill of Rights, and we 
honor the extraordinary sacrifices made by the members of our Armed 
Forces throughout our Nation's proud history.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1996, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities, including recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. I also 
call upon government officials to display the flag on all government 
buildings and grounds.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6890 of April 30, 1996
Law Day, U.S.A., 1996
A Proclamation
For more than three decades, we have set aside the first day of May to 
honor the role our legal system plays in maintaining our country's 
greatness, to celebrate the precious freedoms our citizens have enjoyed 
since America's beginnings, and to recognize the crucial role of the law 
in ensuring our security and prosperity. Today, as we confront the 
threats of domestic and international terrorism and the violence that 
plagues our neighborhoods and schools, it is more important than ever 
for Americans to understand the extraordinary legacy left to us by our 
Founders and to reaffirm the ideals of liberty, equality, and justice.
This year's theme, ``The Constitution: The Original American Dream,'' 
underscores the centrality of this precious document in our national 
life. The doctrines set forth in our Constitution have made possible our 
progress and unparalleled history of freedom. Written more than 200 
years ago, its measures were crafted by people who believed in 
individual rights and who understood that liberty must be the basis for 
our system of laws. As we approach a new century, we can be proud that 
our remarkable, dynamic Constitution, while reflecting the mores and 
culture of its time, continues to express America's profound commitment 
to human dignity.
We celebrate the Constitution as a model for other nations around the 
world, as the purest expression of American law, and as the ultimate 
authority for our statutes, judicial decisions, and Executive actions. 
But its power also depends on an informed, involved citizenry. Each of 
us must take personal responsibility for our actions and respect the 
rights of others. In homes, schools, neighborhoods, and businesses we 
must honor the rule of law and cherish the promise of equality and 
opportunity for all people.

[[Page 32]]

Every American must work to see that our Nation's legal system remains a 
model for the rest of the world and that future generations will 
continue to share its blessings.
On this day and throughout the year, let us consider the written 
instruments that have so profoundly shaped our experience and pay 
tribute to all those who enforce and maintain our legal and judicial 
systems--including police officers, community policing volunteers, 
lawyers, and members of our independent judiciary. Their efforts help to 
ensure that Americans will always enjoy individual liberties and a just 
society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20 of April 7, 1961, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 1996, as Law Day, U.S.A. I urge all Americans to 
recognize the rule of law as the basis for freedom in our democratic 
society and to learn more about the United States Constitution. I call 
upon members of the legal profession, civic associations, educators, 
librarians, public officials, and the media to promote the observance of 
this day with appropriate programs and activities. I also call upon 
public officials to display the flag of the United States on all 
government buildings throughout the day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6891 of May 3, 1996
Labor History Month, 1996
A Proclamation
In the early 1900s, millions of Americans left their farms to begin new 
lives as factory workers. Sadly, many of these citizens found neither 
secure employment nor higher wages at their new jobs, and the industrial 
economy brought them exploitation, continued poverty, and the risk of 
injury and death. No student of American history can forget the images 
of filthy children emerging from mills and mines, the stories of 
terrible fires and explosions, or the grim legacy of the slums that grew 
up in factory towns.
Although child labor, sweatshops, and workplace disasters are largely 
horrors of the past, efforts to eliminate them began to succeed only 
after workers organized and spoke with a united, independent voice. The 
American labor movement helped the first generation of industrial 
employees to express their aspirations and insecurities, empowering them 
with the necessary tools to define the terms and conditions of their 
employment and to expand the role of labor in the larger society.
As we approach the 21st century, our Nation's economy is undergoing a 
transformation as momentous as the change that spurred the exodus from 
farms to factories 100 years ago. And in facing the challenges posed by

[[Page 33]]

global competition and rapid technological advances, the workers of the 
Information Age need the same effective leadership that allowed their 
forbears to succeed. Each new generation of workers must embrace the 
activism that has characterized labor's rich history, and all Americans 
should recognize the role that labor has played in the continuing 
progress of our democracy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1996, as Labor History 
Month. I call upon Government officials, educators, the media, and all 
the people of the United States to observe this month with ceremonies, 
activities, and programs that encourage reflection on the labor 
movement's heritage and its many contributions to the creation and 
maintenance of a just America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6892 of May 6, 1996
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Our national character has been enhanced by citizens who maintain and 
honor cultural values and customs brought from other lands. Americans of 
Asian and Pacific Islander ancestry have long been a part of that 
tradition, enriching the fabric of our society with their unique talents 
and abilities. This month provides a welcome opportunity to recognize 
these gifts and to celebrate the daily contributions that Asian and 
Pacific Americans make to our country's progress.
Every sector of American life has benefited from the extraordinary 
leadership of those who trace their roots back to Asia and the Pacific 
Island region. In the arts and sciences, the business world, law, 
academia, and government, these remarkable individuals have expanded our 
horizons, achieving exceptional success and demonstrating a dedicated 
belief in equal opportunity. Asian and Pacific Americans have worked to 
overcome challenges, often in the face of discrimination and prejudice, 
and have successfully embraced the opportunities of the American Dream.
As we stand on the threshold of the 21st century, ready to compete in 
the global marketplace and strengthen our partnerships with the nations 
of the Pacific Rim, let us draw on the strengths added by Asian and 
Pacific Americans and applaud their proud legacy of service and 
dedication to this country.
To honor the accomplishments of Asian and Pacific Americans and to 
recognize their many contributions to our Nation, the Congress, by 
Public Law

[[Page 34]]

102-450, has designated the month of May as ``Asian/Pacific American 
Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of

Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
occasion with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Mother's Day, 1996
A Proclamation
America's mothers hold a special place in our hearts, providing the 
lessons and care that have enabled generations of children to embrace 
the opportunities of this great land. They embody the compassion, 
devotion, and energy that have always defined our national character, 
and their daily efforts anchor our country's commitment to the 
fundamental values of respect and tolerance. Mothers impart both the 
strength that enables us to face our challenges and the love that 
comforts and sustains us.
As we honor our Nation's mothers for past and present accomplishments, 
we recognize that mothers' roles have changed significantly in recent 
years. Today, mothers are CEOs and teachers, physicians and nurses, 
elected officials and PTA presidents, police officers and volunteers, 
homemakers and heads of households. Many serve on the front lines of the 
struggle against violence and poverty. These women--problem-solvers, 
caregivers, and teachers--are using their talents in every sector of our 
society, helping all Americans to look forward with hope and faith in 
the future.
Mother's Day has long been a welcome opportunity to celebrate motherhood 
and to remember our mothers--whether biological, foster, or adoptive. To 
reflect on all we have gained from our mothers' guidance and to remember 
their sacrifices, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 
1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year 
as ``Mother's Day'' and requested the President to call for its 
appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 12, 1996, as Mother's Day. I urge all 
Americans to express their gratitude for the many contributions made by 
our mothers and to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the

Proclamation 6894 of May 13, 1996
Older Americans Month, 1996
A Proclamation
America's high standard of living, advanced health care system, and 
commitment to better nutrition and physical fitness have allowed 
millions of our citizens the luxury of long and fulfilling lives. 
Because current estimates indicate that one in six Americans will be 65 
or older by the year 2020, our Nation faces new challenges as we seek to 
address the needs of this growing population of seniors.
Fortunately, many of our older Americans--who have already led the way 
in setting a sound course for our country's future--are helping us to 
meet these new challenges as well. Having lived through times of 
depression and war, peace and prosperity, they have shaped our progress 
with their achievements. The safety net they created--including Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the provisions of the Older Americans 
Act--helps us to honor our debt to senior citizens and ensures that 
Americans who have worked hard throughout their lives can look forward 
to a secure retirement.
Each year, we set aside the month of May as a special time to pay 
tribute to older Americans and to affirm our obligation to sustain and 
improve their quality of life. The theme of this year's observance, 
``Aging: A Lifetime Opportunity,'' underscores the gifts that older 
people offer to our country every day. Thanks to senior citizens, our 
communities are stronger, our Nation is more diverse, and we are better 
prepared to meet the challenges of the next century.
As we celebrate the contributions of all those in their golden years, 
let us recognize that long life is a gift we must cherish and a 
responsibility for which we must prepare. With an eye toward the future 
and with the example of today's seniors firmly before us, we can prepare 
for a better tomorrow for ourselves and for the generations of Americans 
to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1996, as Older 
Americans Month. I call upon Government officials, businesses, 
communities, volunteers, educators, and all the people of the United 
States to acknowledge the contributions made by older Americans this 
month and throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of

Proclamation 6895 of May 13, 1996
Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Despite the dangers they face while patrolling our Nation's cities, 
neighborhoods, and highways, America's law enforcement officers continue 
to serve with commitment and distinction every day. They put themselves 
in harm's way to safeguard our fellow citizens, and their dedication to 
the rule of law is essential to maintaining a just and orderly society. 
Each year, Police Week is a welcome opportunity to recognize the brave 
men and women of the law enforcement professions, and on Peace Officers 
Memorial Day we pause to honor those who have given their lives while 
protecting others.
According to recent figures, 161 law enforcement officers were killed in 
the line of duty during 1995. And let us not forget the law enforcement 
personnel who died in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City on April 19--the single deadliest day in law 
enforcement history. Since police deaths were first recorded in this 
country, in 1794, more than 14,000 officers have lost their lives 
working to keep the peace in our communities. On average, more than 
66,000 are assaulted every year, and some 24,000 are injured.
To pay tribute to the law enforcement officers who have made the 
ultimate sacrifice for our country and to voice our appreciation for all 
those who currently serve on the front lines of the battle against 
crime, the Congress, by joint resolution approved October 1, 1962 (76 
Stat. 676), has authorized and requested the President to designate May 
15 of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day,'' and the week in 
which it falls as ``Police Week,'' and by Public Law 103-322 (36 U.S.C. 
175) has directed that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers 
Memorial Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 1996, as Peace Officers Memorial 
Day, and May 12 through May 18, 1996, as Police Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to observe these occasions with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs. I also request the Governors of 
the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the 
appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the 
flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day on all 
buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and 
all areas under its jurisdiction and control. In addition, I invite all 
Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes on that 
day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of

Proclamation 6896 of May 15, 1996
National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
1996
A Proclamation
Americans derive daily benefits from the finest transportation system in 
the world. Our Nation's network of land, sea, and air travel allows for 
the efficient movement of goods and people, strengthening our economy, 
uniting our citizens, and linking us to other countries around the 
globe. As we strive to compete in an international marketplace, we must 
deepen our commitment to this infrastructure and continue the long-
standing partnership between government and industry that has made our 
successes possible.
Transportation has played a vital role in America's recent economic 
recovery, creating some 400,000 new jobs in the last 3 years. Fields 
that faced financial difficulties just a short time ago, such as 
aerospace, shipbuilding, and airlines, are now profitable and growing. 
My Administration has been proud to sign more than 30 new market-opening 
aviation agreements, including an agreement with Canada, our biggest 
trading partner, that has generated significant economic activity in 
just one year and facilitated air travel between our two countries.
In an effort to build on this progress and further improve efficiency, 
we have increased our national investment in infrastructure--by some 11 
percent a year over early 1990s levels--while streamlining the 
Department of Transportation by 10,000 employees and cutting red tape to 
speed the financing and construction of highway projects. Safety remains 
a top priority in these efforts, and communities across the country are 
working to protect drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and bicyclists. 
Sophisticated communications technology helps relieve traffic congestion 
in urban areas and expanded mass transit systems move people more 
quickly and safely with minimal environmental impact.
To celebrate these accomplishments and to honor the millions of men and 
women, both government and private sector employees, who maintain 
America's transportation system and contribute so much to our Nation's 
activities, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (36 
U.S.C. 160), has designated the third Friday in May of each year as 
``National Defense Transportation Day'' and, by joint resolution 
approved May 14, 1962 (36 U.S.C. 166), declared that the week within 
which that Friday falls be designated ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 17, 1996, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 12 through May 18, 1996, as National

[[Page 38]]

Transportation Week. I urge all Americans to observe these occasions 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities, giving due recognition to 
the countless individuals and organizations that build, secure, and 
operate this country's modern transportation system.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6897 of May 17, 1996
National Safe Boating Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Each year, more Americans choose recreational boating as a means of 
appreciating our Nation's scenic lakes, beautiful rivers, and vast ocean 
waterways. Boating is a leisure activity that can be enjoyed by people 
of all ages and abilities, offering a unique perspective on an 
unparalleled variety of natural landscapes. This pastime is not without 
risk, however, and a thorough knowledge of water safety techniques and 
equipment is an essential part of being a responsible boater.
Studies show that in more than 77 percent of the fully documented 
recreational boating fatalities that occur every year, the victim was 
not wearing a life jacket. Falling overboard and capsizing are the 
leading causes of these deaths, and more than half of all boating 
accidents are alcohol-related--facts that clearly illustrate the 
importance of not mixing alcohol and boating, and of properly using 
personal flotation devices. Skippers, crew members, passengers, and all 
those who participate in nautical sports should wear safety equipment 
every time they take to the water.
I commend the United States Coast Guard and the many State and local 
recreational boating organizations that are working with Government 
agencies and volunteers across the country to promote the use of life 
jackets and to educate the public about other lifesaving measures. As we 
look forward to the summer months and spending time with family and 
friends on America's waterways, such efforts are vital to ensuring our 
citizens' health and safety.
In recognition of the value of safe boating practices, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 161), as amended, has 
authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the seven 
day period prior to the Memorial Day Weekend as ``National Safe Boating 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 18 through May 24, 1996, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors of the 50 States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing this occasion. I

[[Page 39]]

urge all Americans to practice safe boating habits during this week and 
throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Death of Admiral Jeremy M. Boorda
A Proclamation
As a mark of respect for the memory of Admiral Jeremy M. Boorda, Chief 
of Naval Operations, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as 
President of the United States of America by section 175 of title 36 of 
the United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be 
flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all 
military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the 
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United 
States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on the day of 
interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for 
the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular 
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities 
and naval vessels and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6899 of May 20, 1996
World Trade Week, 1996
A Proclamation
International commerce is vital to domestic economic growth--perhaps 
more so now than at any other time in recent U.S. history. Our Nation's 
prosperity depends in large part on our ability to develop and produce 
high-quality products, identify and open markets, and promote American 
goods and services across the globe. The U.S. jobs supported by exports 
are increasingly important, paying an average of 13 percent more than 
other positions and accounting for nearly one out of ten American 
workers and one in five of those in the manufacturing sector. The theme 
of this year's World Trade Week, ``Winning with Exports,'' is an 
invitation and a challenge to U.S. firms to reap the benefits of doing 
business abroad.

[[Page 40]]

My Administration has developed a National Export Strategy that places 
special emphasis on helping small- and medium-sized companies seize 
trade opportunities. As part of this plan, we have created a country-
wide network of U.S. Export Assistance Centers to provide information 
and capital to businesses seeking to expand. The results speak for 
themselves; in 1995, actions taken by Centers like those in Chicago and 
Baltimore dramatically increased the number of U.S. firms entering new 
markets and boosting export sales.
Trade is also a means of fostering understanding and stability around 
the world, helping our Nation to build partnerships founded on mutual 
prosperity. American commerce and investments are strengthening new 
democracies whose viability depends on economic growth and raised 
standards of living. From South Africa, to Central Europe, the Baltic 
States, Russia, Ukraine, and the Newly Independent States, exporting is 
allowing our country to play a pivotal role in settling and solidifying 
crucial foreign markets. Trade is also essential to troubled regions 
such as the Middle East, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia, where job 
creation and economic improvements play an important role in efforts to 
achieve peace.
As we observe World Trade Week, 1996, let us strive to give our Nation's 
exporters every opportunity to sell products freely and fairly and help 
our companies to meet the challenge of exploring markets abroad. Their 
efforts to maintain efficient, high-quality production and to promote 
American goods and services to an international clientele will lead to a 
stronger economy and a brighter future for us all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 19 through May 25, 
1996, as World Trade Week. I call upon the people of the United States 
to observe this week with ceremonies, activities, and programs that 
celebrate the potential of international trade.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6900 of May 21, 1996
National Maritime Day, 1996
A Proclamation
The men and women of the United States Merchant Marine stand prepared to 
help our Nation in times of crisis. Their outstanding professionalism 
and performance have been manifest throughout America's proud history, 
most recently in the Persian Gulf, Haiti, and Somalia. Today, these 
brave individuals continue to bring honor to the maritime community and 
to our country through their steadfast service to our troops in Bosnia.

[[Page 41]]

Those working on and in support of U.S. vessels play another important 
role by strengthening our economy. Every day, merchant ships carry the 
Nation's domestic and foreign commerce, acting as an integral part of 
our seamless transportation system. Those aboard go to sea to move 
American goods and materials, to help provide aid and comfort to others 
around the world, and, when necessary, to defend our interests and to 
seek international peace.
The Maritime Security Program legislation currently before the Congress 
will preserve a strong sealift capability so that critical military 
cargoes can reach American troops and our allies abroad as they strive 
to fulfill their peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. It will protect 
American jobs and foster our efforts to expand international trade. In 
standing behind this important measure, we affirm our commitment to 
maintaining a strong U.S.-flag presence on the high seas for our 
continued national security and economic growth.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated 
May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its 
observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 1996, as National Maritime Day. I 
urge all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs and by displaying the flag of the United States 
at their homes and in their communities. I also request that all ships 
sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 1996
A Proclamation
On the last Monday of May each year, our Nation takes time to remember 
those who have given their lives to safeguard America's freedom. 
Courageous and loyal citizens have died on battlefields around the world 
in defense of the United States, our interests, and our values, thus 
ensuring more than two centuries of independence and a society based on 
individual rights. Their selflessness demands our profound gratitude and 
calls us to consider anew the awesome price of liberty.
On this special day, let us reflect upon the supreme sacrifice made by 
our fellow citizens lost in battle. All were proud members of our 
national community, and all perished while protecting our country's 
honor and the American way of life. Let us share in the grief of the 
families whose loved

[[Page 42]]

ones remain unaccounted for or fell while defending this great Nation. 
And let us pray, each in our own way, for peace throughout this land and 
across the globe. As beneficiaries of the freedoms our troops secured, 
we can best pay tribute to their deeds by leaving to future generations 
an America that continues to be a beacon of justice and freedom for 
people everywhere.
In respect and recognition of the courageous men and women to whom we 
pay tribute, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950 
(64 Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a proclamation 
calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial 
Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on 
that day when the American people might unite in prayer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 27, 1996, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to join in prayer. I urge 
the press, radio, television, and all other information media to take 
part in this observance.
I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff during this 
Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the 
United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control, and I 
request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-
staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6902 of May 31, 1996
Small Business Week, 1996
A Proclamation
The American Dream has long held out the promise of a better life to our 
citizens--one of prosperity, security, and personal fulfillment for all 
those who are willing to work hard to reach their goals. Our Nation's 22 
million small business owners possess the determination and initiative 
to make that promise a reality, and their entrepreneurial spirit helps 
to drive the engine of our economy. In addition, products developed by 
small firms such as the artificial heart valve, the pacemaker, and the 
personal computer, have revolutionized our daily lives and made this an 
age of extraordinary possibility.
The number of new small businesses has increased steadily over the last 
three decades, with 800,000 new businesses incorporated in 1995 alone. 
Small businesses employ some 53 percent of the private work force, ac

[[Page 43]]

count for 47 percent of all sales in the country, and generate more than 
half of our private gross domestic product. In addition, industries 
dominated by small business were responsible for 75 percent of the 1.66 
million new jobs created during 1995.
Last year, delegates to the White House Conference on Small Business 
forged an agenda that will continue such progress and prepare our 
economy for the challenges of the next century. By implementing their 
recommendations, ``reinventing'' the U.S. Small Business Administration, 
and pursuing other incentives and initiatives, we can establish an even 
better environment for small business creation and growth. These efforts 
are vital to keeping our economy strong and strengthening the proud 
legacy of innovation that has always inspired our people and made 
America great.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2 through June 8, 
1996, as Small Business Week. I call upon Government officials and all 
the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs that celebrate the achievements of 
small business owners and encourage the formation of new firms.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6903 of June 7, 1996
Flag Day and National Flag Week, 1996
A Proclamation
There is no better symbol of our country's values and traditions than 
the Flag of the United States of America. Chosen by the Continental 
Congress in 1777, it continues to exemplify the profound commitment to 
freedom, equality, and opportunity made by our founders more than two 
centuries ago. Our flag's proud stars and stripes have long inspired our 
people, and its beautiful red, white, and blue design is known around 
the world as a beacon of liberty and justice.
Today, America's flag graces classrooms, statehouses, courtrooms, and 
churches, serving as a daily reminder of this Nation's past 
accomplishments and ongoing dedication to safeguarding individual 
rights. The brave members of our Armed Forces carry ``Old Glory'' with 
them as they fulfill their mission to defend the blessings of democracy 
and peace across the globe; our banner flies from public buildings as a 
sign of our national community; and its folds drape the tombs of our 
distinguished dead. The flag is a badge of honor to all--a sign of our 
citizens' common purpose.
This week and throughout the year let us do all we can to teach younger 
generations the significance of our flag. Its 13 red and white stripes 
rep

[[Page 44]]

resent not only the original colonies, but also the courage and purity 
of our Nation, while its 50 stars stand for the separate but united 
States of our Union. Let us pledge allegiance to this flag to declare 
our patriotism and raise its colors high to express our pride and 
respect for the American way of life.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of 
each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested the President to issue an annual 
proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the Flag 
of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress 
also requested the President, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966 
(80 Stat. 194), to issue annually a proclamation designating the week in 
which June 14 falls as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all 
citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 1996, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 9, 1996, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
suitable places.
I also call upon the people of the United States to observe with pride 
and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, 
also set aside by Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor our 
Nation, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, 
and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6904 of June 13, 1996
Father's Day, 1996
A Proclamation
America owes a debt of gratitude to the fathers that help our Nation's 
children grow up safe and happy. Providing a wellspring of love for 
their families to draw upon, these men strengthen our communities and 
enable their daughters and sons to master life's lessons with 
confidence. They share with us their experiences and energies, creating 
the strong foundation on which our children build their lives. A 
father's arm is there to protect and steer--whether cradling a newborn 
baby, steadying the rider of a first two-wheeler, or walking his child 
down the aisle.
Fatherhood provides one of life's most profound joys and one of its most 
solemn responsibilities. Everyone who has been blessed by a father's 
love

[[Page 45]]

knows the abiding respect it inspires and the self-esteem that can grow 
from a dad's affectionate guidance. We must do all we can to encourage 
fathers as they strive to provide the fundamental emotional and economic 
support that helps ensure their families' well-being. Programs like the 
Fatherhood Initiative, the Responsible Fatherhood Project, and Parent's 
Fair Share work to support American fathers, emphasize their role as 
mentors and providers, and advocate their involvement in their 
children's health and education.
On this Father's Day and throughout the year, let us thank fathers for 
their sacrifices and struggles and celebrate the special care they give 
their loved ones every day. With grateful words and actions, we honor 
all those who have embraced fatherhood's unique rewards.
NOW THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972 (36 U.S.C. 142a), do hereby proclaim Sunday, June 16, 
1996, as Father's Day. I invite the States, communities, and all the 
citizens of the United States to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities that demonstrate our deep appreciation and 
affection for our fathers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6905 of June 24, 1996
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Day, 1996
A Proclamation
This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
celebrates 50 years of service to our Nation and to people around the 
world. Created from a small organization whose mission was to combat the 
spread of malaria among our troops during World War II, the CDC has 
become our first line of defense against disease, injury, and 
disability.
The CDC's history boasts a number of notable achievements, including its 
key role in the eradication of smallpox and the discovery of the causes 
of Legionnaire's disease and toxic shock syndrome. The agency has also 
led efforts to control and prevent polio and other vaccine-preventable 
diseases, breast and cervical cancer, lead poisoning, tuberculosis, and 
AIDS. Recently, the CDC has been a leader in the global efforts to fight 
emerging infectious illnesses by investigating and containing diseases 
such as the outbreak of plague in India and the Ebola outbreak in 
Africa.
The CDC's innovative programs also address our national challenges of 
chronic disease, workplace and environmental hazards, injuries, birth 
defects, disabilities, and new infectious threats. In addition, the 
agency gath

[[Page 46]]

ers and analyzes scientific data to better monitor public health, 
provide a solid foundation for decision-making, and detect risk factors.
While technology and medical progress have worked wonders for many, such 
advances are not always available or practicable. The CDC's prevention 
efforts are essential if we are to ensure that all Americans can live in 
safe, healthy communities. By immunizing our children, exercising 
regularly, and making other healthy choices, each of us can join the 
CDC's efforts to build a brighter future and a stronger Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 1, 1996, as Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention Day. I call upon all the people of 
the United States to join me in observing this tribute to the CDC, to 
recognize the need for preventive health measures, and to strive 
throughout the year to realize the CDC's vision: Healthy people in a 
healthy world--through prevention.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Victims of the Bombing in Saudi Arabia
A Proclamation
As a mark of respect for those killed in the June 25, 1996, bombing of 
the Military Housing Complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, I hereby order, 
by the authority vested in me as President of the United States of 
America by section 175 of title 36 of the United States Code, that the 
flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White 
House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts 
and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government 
in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions until sunset, Sunday, June 30, 1996. I also 
direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of 
time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and 
other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval 
vessels and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of

Declaration of a State of Emergency and Release of Feed Grain From the 
Disaster Reserve
A Proclamation
WHEREAS, an extended drought and other natural disasters in feed grain-
producing areas of the United States have caused significant reductions 
in feed grain supplies and severe hardship to livestock producers;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including sections 201 and 301 of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and section 813 of the 
Agricultural Act of 1970 (7 U.S.C. 1427a) (the ``Act''), do hereby find 
and proclaim that the extended drought in the Southwest and other 
natural disasters in other feed grain areas of the United States have 
resulted in a state of emergency and that the state of emergency 
warrants the release of the reserve established pursuant to section 
813(a) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1427a(a)). Accordingly, I hereby declare 
that such amounts of the reserve as determined necessary by the 
Secretary of Agriculture (``the Secretary'') should be disposed of by 
the Secretary as authorized by the Act.

Proclamation 6908 of July 1, 1996
A National Month of Unity, 1996
A Proclamation
Our Nation was founded by people who sought the right to worship freely, 
and religious liberty is enshrined in our Constitution as the ``first 
freedom'' granted by our Bill of Rights. The United States is now the 
most multi-ethnic, multi-religious democracy in history, and we must 
preserve this precious freedom while making the most of our diversity. 
Ours is a great and noble struggle to make our national voice a chorus 
of unity--varied by differing intonations, but carried and lifted by a 
rich harmony.
The recent rash of arson attacks against black churches and other houses 
of worship is a stark reminder that our work to build common ground is 
far from over and that our progress can be threatened by forces that 
tear at the very fabric of our society. It is hard to think of a more 
heinous act than the destruction of a sacred structure. The violence 
that charred and defaced these buildings challenges our fundamental 
right to worship in safety, and has left us grim emblems of the hatred 
and alienation that too often darken our daily experience.

[[Page 48]]

And so we must look into our hearts as America approaches the new 
century, pledging to devote our energies to reinvigorating the shared 
values that will enable us to embrace the future together. We must never 
go back to the terrible days of racial and ethnic division, nor can we 
afford to dismiss our problems by ascribing them to isolated groups or 
areas of the country. Instead, let us join hands to lighten our burdens 
and build bridges among people and communities so that we can be one 
America--a Nation of extraordinary possibility with opportunity, 
freedom, and respect for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 1996, as A National 
Month of Unity. I call upon religious leaders of all faiths to emphasize 
the need for healing and tolerance. I ask all Americans to join these 
efforts by working together to mend divisions and promote understanding; 
by reaching out to friends and neighbors of all races and faiths in a 
spirit of fellowship; and by seeking to strengthen, through words and 
actions, the ideals of equality and community cherished by generations 
of Americans. In this birth month of our Nation, let us set an example 
for the world we welcome to Atlanta for the Centennial Olympic Games by 
rededicating ourselves to America's fundamental truth: E pluribus unum--
from many, one.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twentieth.

Proclamation 6909 of July 18, 1996
Captive Nations Week, 1996
A Proclamation
This year marks the 38th commemoration of Captive Nations Week--a 
national expression of solidarity and support for all those around the 
globe who suffer the harshness of oppressive rule. Democracy and human 
rights have made great advances in recent years, thanks to the 
courageous efforts of determined men and women. Yet, despite these 
strides, far too many people throughout the world live without the 
benefits of freedom. As this century draws to a close, we must remember 
the millions who still live in fear and the countless children denied 
the prospect of a bright future by authoritarian regimes.
The United States' commitment to liberty has ensured over 200 years of 
justice and individual rights for our citizens. We have worked hard to 
realize our founders' vision of independence, and we cherish our proud 
history of offering support and encouragement to others who share that 
dream. In this post-Cold War era, when ethnic, racial, and religious 
conflicts pose new challenges to the global community, we must honor 
that legacy and continue to build a future of international stability 
and peace.
This week and throughout the year, let us rededicate ourselves to the 
promotion of liberty and universal human rights for those who suffer 
under

[[Page 49]]

the yoke of tyranny in other lands. The United States will continue to 
champion political freedom for all races, religions, creeds, and 
nationalities, pledging to keep faith with people everywhere who cherish 
the fundamental values that Americans have always held dear.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 21 through July 27, 1996, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities celebrating the 
principles on which this Nation was established and by which it will 
forever prosper.

July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6910 of July 25, 1996
National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Forty-three years ago, a negotiated cease-fire ended 3 years of open 
warfare on the Korean peninsula. This cease-fire came after more than 
54,000 American deaths and the capture of thousands of our brave 
soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. For those who returned home, the 
armistice brought mixed emotions--too many of their comrades-in-arms 
remained prisoners of war or missing in action, and the importance of 
this Cold War conflict was yet to be fully understood.
Today, as the United States and South Korea maintain a strong 
partnership and democracy continues to sweep the globe, we remember the 
extraordinary sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform during the 
Korean conflict, and we pay tribute to their courage and their 
commitment to freedom. As American service men and women support the 
cause of peace around the world, we honor the proud legacy of our Korean 
War veterans who gave of themselves so that others might live in 
liberty. And as a testament to their proud and selfless service and 
sacrifice, the Korean War Veterans Memorial stands today in our Nation's 
Capital.
The Congress, by Public Law 104-19 (36 U.S.C. 169m) has designated July 
27, 1996, as ``National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in 
observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 27, 1996, as National Korean

[[Page 50]]

War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon Government officials, educators, 
and the American people to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities that recognize and give thanks to our Nation's 
distinguished Korean War veterans. I also ask Federal departments and 
agencies, interested groups, organizations, and individuals to fly the 
American flag at half-staff on July 27, 1996, in memory of the Americans 
who died as a result of their service in Korea.

July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6911 of July 25, 1996
Parents' Day, 1996
A Proclamation
No job presents greater challenges, demands broader responsibilities, or 
promises more profound rewards than parenthood. Parents are daily 
caretakers and lifelong role models. They guide us and share the values 
and lessons that enable us to grow and flourish. Throughout our lives, 
we remember our parents' example, recognizing that their joys and 
aspirations, triumphs and disappointments, have shaped our experience 
and given us meaningful direction.
Our Nation has always depended on strong families, and we must continue 
to do all we can to help hardworking men and women shoulder the duties 
of parenthood. It is vital to support today's parents, to honor those 
who have taught us so much, and to impress upon young people the awesome 
responsibility of parenthood.
On this day and throughout the year, let us take time to celebrate the 
special, enduring bond between parents and children. Foster parents and 
stepparents, biological and adoptive mothers and fathers--all deserve 
our respect and gratitude. Parents open their homes and hearts to 
nurture and protect us; let us offer in return our deepest appreciation 
for their devotion and care.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, do 
hereby proclaim Sunday, July 28, 1996, as Parents' Day. I call upon the 
States, communities, and all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities to express affectionate thanks to 
our Nation's parents.

Proclamation 6912 of August 21, 1996
Women's Equality Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Since America's earliest days, our citizens have engaged in a passionate 
struggle to create a Nation where all can enjoy the benefits of 
democracy in equal measure. In 1920, we took a great step toward that 
noble goal by declaring that the right to vote could not be denied on 
the basis of gender. This 76th anniversary of the adoption of the 19th 
Amendment to the Constitution gives us an opportunity to celebrate the 
advances made in empowering women to fully participate in the political, 
cultural, social, and economic life of our country.
At long last we are seeing the fruits of our efforts to establish a 
society made strong by its vast diversity--a place where women not only 
make gains in traditionally male fields, but also use their talents and 
perspectives to enlarge the scope of public life. The extraordinary 
success of our female athletes at the Centennial Olympic Games in 
Atlanta is one stirring example of this progress. Historically excluded 
from so many arenas, today's women are carrying a shining torch of hope 
for younger generations to follow.
Now the challenge is to keep the doors of opportunity open and to build 
on the changes begun by the ratification of the 19th Amendment. We must 
continue to encourage women to pursue elected office and to contribute 
to the civil discourse. Every American stands to gain when women and men 
of all backgrounds participate in the political process and exercise 
their right to vote. This is a right that we must never take for 
granted-- and a responsibility we must never shirk--because it gives 
each of us a voice in our national debate and calls every citizen to 
join in the pursuit of our Nation's fundamental ideals.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 1996, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon all Americans to reflect on both the 
struggles and accomplishments of all women and to promote the observance 
of this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6913 of August 23, 1996
Minority Enterprise Development Week, 1996
A Proclamation
As our Nation continues to surge forward in the competitive arena of 
international business, minority entrepreneurs are playing an 
increasingly important role. In the new global economy, minority-owned 
businesses represent a unique advantage for the United States; the 
diversity of our national business community is one of its main 
strengths. Behind this success lies the daily work of thousands of 
minority business men and women who are continuing to renew the validity 
of the American Dream. Moreover, they are showing that the Dream is 
strongest when all can participate.
These Americans have stepped forward to accept several challenges: the 
challenge of opening economic participation to all citizens; the 
challenge of overcoming the under-representation of minorities in 
business ownership and management; and the challenge of creating jobs in 
the communities where they are needed most. These minority entrepreneurs 
entered the marketplace with no guarantees of success, and their 
achievements have helped level the playing field for others who wish to 
follow in their footsteps.
Minority business leaders contribute to our country's cultural and 
social heritage as well as to its economic health. As business pioneers, 
they are valuable role models to our youth, living heroes whose hard 
work and self-empowerment are strong examples for others to follow. 
These are the people whose work we celebrate during this 14th annual 
observance of Minority Enterprise Development Week. This year's 
observance is particularly poignant. It comes just months after our 
Nation lost Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and a group of talented and 
dedicated Federal employees and American business people in a tragic 
plane crash during a trade mission to open commercial opportunities for 
American businesses in Bosnia.
Ron Brown worked hard to include minority business interests in our 
Nation's business and economic development policies, and as we carry 
forward his legacy, it is our responsibility to ensure that all 
Americans can see business ownership as more than just a dream. Our 
future as a world economic power rests on the notion that business 
ownership can be attained by anyone willing to work toward that goal. 
Minority Enterprise Development Week is a time to spotlight the minority 
men and women who provide the goods, services, and jobs that keep this 
Nation strong. These Americans support their communities and inspire 
future generations. They are confident and competent people whose 
commercial accomplishments show them to be equal to any fair 
competition, whether here or abroad.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 22 through 
September 28, 1996, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call on 
all citizens to commemorate this week with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities, joining together to recognize the contributions that 
minority entrepreneurs make to our Nation's economy.

Proclamation 6914 of August 26, 1996
To Modify the Allocation of Tariff-Rate Quotas for Certain Cheeses
A Proclamation
1. On January 1, 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden acceded to the 
European Communities (EC), and the EC customs union of 12 member 
countries (``EC-12'') was enlarged to a customs union of 15 member 
countries (``EC-15''). At that time, the EC-12, Austria, Finland, and 
Sweden withdrew their tariff schedules under the World Trade 
Organization and applied the common external tariff of the EC-12 to 
imports into the EC-15. The United States and the EC then entered into 
negotiations under Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 to compensate the United States for 
the resulting increase in some tariffs on U.S. exports to Austria, 
Finland, and Sweden.
2. On July 22, 1996, the United States and the EC signed an agreement 
concluding the negotiations on compensation. To recognize the membership 
of Austria, Finland, and Sweden in the EC-15, the tariff-rate quota 
(TRQ) allocations for cheeses from these countries will become part of 
the total TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be 
reserved for use by these countries through 1997.
3. Section 404(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 
U.S.C. 3601(d)(3)) authorizes the President to allocate the in-quota 
quantity of a tariff-rate quota for any agricultural product among 
supplying countries or customs areas and to modify any allocation as the 
President determines appropriate. Pursuant to section 404(d)(3) of the 
URAA, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the TRQ 
allocations for cheeses by providing that the TRQ allocations for 
cheeses from Austria, Finland, and Sweden will become part of the total 
TRQ allocations for cheeses from the EC-15, but will be reserved for use 
by these countries through 1997.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``Trade Act'') (19 
U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction. The modification of the TRQ allocations for cheeses is such 
an action.
5. In paragraph (3) of Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, I 
delegated my authority under section 404(d)(3) of the Trade Act to the 
United States Trade Representative (USTR). I have determined that it is 
appropriate to

[[Page 54]]

authorize the USTR to exercise my authority under section 604 of the 
Trade Act to embody in the HTS the substance of any action taken by the 
USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 301 
of title 3, United States Code, section 404(d)(3) of the URAA, and 
section 604 of the Trade Act do proclaim that:
    (1) Additional U.S. notes to chapter 4 of the HTS are modified as 
specified in the Annex to this proclamation.
    (2) The USTR is authorized to exercise my authority under section 
604 of the Trade Act to embody in the HTS the substance of any actions 
taken by USTR under section 404(d)(3) of the URAA.
    (3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (4) This proclamation is effective on the date of signature of this 
proclamation, and the modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this 
proclamation shall be effective on the dates that are specified in that 
Annex.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6915 of September 9, 1996
America Goes Back to School, 1996
A Proclamation
Education is the foundation of our economy and society as we stand at 
the dawn of the 21st century. Education provides every American with the 
tools to make the most of their own lives and to seize the tremendous 
opportunities of economic growth and change. Education also passes along 
to our young people the most fundamental American values: family, 
responsibility, and community. To make the next century another American 
century--and to help all of our communities to become prosperous and 
strong--more parents and community members must become involved in 
improving our local schools and colleges. Better education is 
everybody's business. When families, educators, and communities work 
together, we can truly build a bridge to a better, stronger 21st 
century.
The American people want the best for their children. Our schools should 
be safe, disciplined, and drug-free environments where parents are 
involved and children can learn. Our educators and administrators should 
continue to aim for the highest standards of academic excellence and 
professional accountability. Together we must rebuild the Nation's 
schools for the 21st century. We must make the investments needed to 
allow our children to learn about the computers and technology that are 
the building blocks of the future. We must make college more accessible. 
We must expand public school choice and competition. And we must make it 
easier to move from school to work.
Children are our greatest natural resource: Although they are only 20 
percent of our population, they are 100 percent of our future. From safe 
schools to better training for our teachers, from raising standards in 
our schools to increasing financial aid for college for middle-income 
and working families, from literacy for children to retraining for 
adults, we must ensure that all of our children get a chance to fulfill 
the American Dream.
I urge all Americans to be meaningfully involved in their local schools 
and colleges and to make a commitment to support educational improvement 
throughout the year. I applaud the Partnership for Family Involvement in 
Education, a joint effort involving the Department of Education and more 
than 700 schools, family organizations, community groups, religious 
communities, family-oriented businesses, and the men and women of our 
Armed Forces, for sponsoring ``America Goes Back to School: Get 
Involved!'' I hope that this observance will foster grass-roots support 
for better education by engaging parents, educators, and community 
groups as active partners in strengthening schools and strengthening 
families. When Americans come together as a community, we can make real 
progress. By taking a more active role, we as a Nation will raise our 
expectations for both our children and ourselves.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 8 through 
September 14, 1996, as a time when America Goes Back to School. I invite 
parents, schools, community and State leaders, businesses, civic

[[Page 60]]

and religious organizations, and the people of the United States to 
observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities expressing 
support for high academic standards and family and community involvement 
in schools and colleges, and to continue their active involvement on 
behalf of America's children throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6916 of September 13, 1996
National Farm Safety and Health Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Farming is an occupation, both personally rewarding and vitally 
important, keeping grocery store shelves stocked with affordable and 
healthful food products for consumers. American farmers, ranchers, and 
their families are dedicated to producing crops and livestock that not 
only feed the American people, but also have become increasingly 
important to the global economy.
The 2.1 million farms in the United States are predominately operated by 
farm and ranch families, who work long, grueling hours, exposed to 
hazards ranging from complicated machinery, to farm chemicals, 
unpredictable livestock, and variable weather. They also face danger 
from potentially toxic dusts and gases found in and around farm silos, 
manure storage facilities, and livestock confinement buildings. Workers 
must be constantly on guard as they face these hazardous by-products of 
agricultural work.
Education and training programs, including ``hands-on'' intensive 
activities, have created an awareness among farmers and ranchers that 
personal safety equipment is a good investment for preventing injuries 
and illnesses related to their work.
Linked to these safety initiatives are programs that bring about a 
higher level of personal health awareness. This helps to reduce the 
levels of noise-induced hearing loss, sun exposure-related skin cancer, 
and the occupational respiratory ailments prevalent among agricultural 
workers in the United States.
On America's farms, young people are routinely exposed to some of the 
same risks as adults. Their level of maturity, training, and experience 
should be considered when assigning chores on the farm. Since many 
children live on farms, safe play areas should be designated to minimize 
their exposure to danger.
In setting aside this special week each year to focus on the safety and 
health of farmers, ranchers, and their families, we demonstrate to our 
Nation's citizens the importance of a strong agricultural industry as we 
approach the 21st century.

[[Page 61]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through 
September 21, 1996, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
government agencies, businesses, and professional associations that 
serve our agricultural sector to strengthen efforts to promote safety 
and health measures among our Nation's farm and ranch workers. I also 
call upon our Nation to recognize Wednesday, September 18, 1996, as a 
day set aside during the week to pay special attention to the risks and 
hazards facing young people on farms and ranches. I would ask 
agricultural workers to take advantage of educational programs and 
technical advances that can help them avoid injury and illness. Finally, 
I call upon the citizens of our Nation to reflect upon the bounty we 
enjoy thanks to the labor of agricultural workers across our land. Join 
me in renewing our commitment to making their health and safety a 
national priority.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6917 of September 17, 1996
Citizenship Day and Constitution Week, 1996
A Proclamation
At a time when many nations around the world are becoming ever more 
factionalized, the citizens of the United States are blessed with an 
overarching identity as Americans. The wisdom of our Nation's founders, 
as embodied in our Constitution, still binds us in a united community of 
purpose and ideals. Our Constitution invites us all to recognize 
ourselves as Americans first--not to de-emphasize our personal or 
familial roots, but to celebrate the diversity that adds strength to our 
national character. As Daniel Webster put it more than a century ago, we 
share ``One country, one constitution, one destiny.''
This week we celebrate the Constitution of the United States of America. 
This remarkably flexible document has stood for more than two centuries 
as a unique achievement in the world of nations. The more we study and 
understand the Constitution, the more we grow, mature, and blossom as 
citizens. This process links us to the Nation's founders by making us 
part of their great adventure in democracy. By living our daily lives 
according to the founders' principles, we keep alive their vision and 
demonstrate its truth and wisdom.
 In order to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, immigrants undertake a 
formal study of the guiding principles and institutions of American 
government. Those who choose to become citizens proudly welcome this 
responsibility. In fact, all of us would do well to emulate the zeal and 
interest shown by these newest Americans, who deeply appreciate their 
bond with

[[Page 62]]

the noble tradition of our Constitution. Therefore, on this occasion I 
call upon all Americans to consider the wonderful blessings of their 
United States citizenship and to look upon our Constitution and 
celebrate the freedom and protection that it has always afforded us.
In commemoration of the signing of our Constitution and in recognition 
of the importance of informed, responsible citizenship, the Congress, by 
joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 153), designated 
September 17 as ``Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 
2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 159), requested the President to proclaim the week 
beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as 
``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 1996, as Citizenship Day and 
September 17 through September 23, 1996, as Constitution Week, and urge 
all Americans to join in observing these occasions with appropriate 
programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

<R05>
Proclamation 6918 of September 18, 1996
National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Since our country's birth, Americans have responded to military threats 
against liberty and democracy, whether at home or in remote areas of the 
world. The young men and women of our Armed Forces understand the need 
to resist oppression, and they have willingly put themselves in harm's 
way around the globe to do so. Those young Americans who stand in the 
defense of freedom are our country's most precious natural resource.
It is particularly painful when these brave Americans are made Prisoners 
of War, or are classified as Missing in Action. They have earned our 
deep appreciation and respect for the great sacrifices they have made so 
that all of us can continue to enjoy the privileges of liberty. In 
keeping faith with them, we continue our concerted efforts to determine 
the fate of all those who are unaccounted for and to bring home the 
remains of those who have perished.
The grief for our prisoners of war and those missing in action is most 
intense, of course, among their families and loved ones at home, who 
wait--often for years, and sometimes in vain--for confirmation of their 
fate. These families display their own courage too, by their endurance 
in the face of deep anxiety. Their cause is our cause, and we pledge 
ourselves to them anew on this special day.
On September 20, 1996, the flag of the National League of Families of 
American Prisoners of War and Missing in Southeast Asia, a black-and-

[[Page 63]]

white banner symbolizing all of America's missing, will be flown over 
the White House, the United States Capitol, the United States 
Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, the Selective 
Service System headquarters, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean 
War Veterans Memorial, and national cemeteries across the country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 20, 1996, as 
National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I ask all Americans to join me in 
honoring former American POWs and those Americans still unaccounted for 
as a result of their service to our great Nation. I also encourage the 
American people to express their gratitude to the families of these 
missing Americans for their perseverance through the many years of 
waiting. Finally, I urge Federal, State, and local officials and private 
organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, programs, 
and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6919 of September 18, 1996
National Hispanic Heritage Month, 1996
A Proclamation
America draws strength from the extraordinary diversity of its people. 
Our national character is enhanced by citizens who maintain and honor 
cultural customs brought from other lands. Hispanics, who have long been 
part of this tradition, were the earliest European settlers of this 
great Nation, with the Spanish founding cities in Florida in the 1500's, 
and Mexicans establishing homesteads in the Southwest in the 1600's. 
Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens in 1917, and other Latinos over the 
years, including Cubans and Central Americans, came to the United States 
in search of democracy, freedom, and a better way of life.
Hispanics, who are of all races, distinguish themselves as a community 
by fostering connections rooted in the Spanish language. Their diverse 
and vibrant culture includes elements originating in Spain, North 
America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Hispanics 
share deep family values, recognize their obligations to the less 
fortunate of our society, protect their children, cherish freedom, and 
fulfill their patriotic duty to defend their country.
Earlier this month, I awarded our Nation's highest civilian honor, the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, to Dr. Antonia Pantoja. Dr. Pantoja has 
inspired generations of Latino youth to ``dare to dream.'' Believing 
that hard work can overcome any obstacle, she went from factory worker 
to college professor and has dedicated her life to bringing educational 
and economic opportunities to the Puerto Rican community.

[[Page 64]]

Sadly, we recently lost one of our great countrymen, Dr. Hector P. 
Garcia of Corpus Christi, Texas. A member of the U.S. Commission on 
Civil Rights and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, he is 
best remembered for his service to the Latino community, founding the 
American GI Forum to defend the civil rights of Hispanic veterans and 
organizing one of the first civil rights marches in the 1940's.
Many other Hispanic sons and daughters have served our country with 
distinction, making important contributions in the arts and sciences, 
the business world, academia, government, agriculture, and the Armed 
Forces. Helping to preserve the democracy and freedom all Americans 
enjoy, Hispanics have served in the United States Armed Forces in 
proportions much larger than their percentage of the population. Since 
World War I, our Nation has awarded the Medal of Honor, our highest 
military honor, to more Latinos than any other ethnic group.
Today, let us honor Hispanics for their example of community and 
patriotism, and for the richness of their contribution to this great 
land.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 1996, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon all government officials, 
educators, and people of the United States to honor this observance with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and encourage all 
Americans to rededicate themselves to the pursuit of equality.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6920 of September 18, 1996
Establishment of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument
A Proclamation
The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument's vast and austere 
landscape embraces a spectacular array of scientific and historic 
resources. This high, rugged, and remote region, where bold plateaus and 
multi-hued cliffs run for distances that defy human perspective, was the 
last place in the continental United States to be mapped. Even today, 
this unspoiled natural area remains a frontier, a quality that greatly 
enhances the monument's value for scientific study. The monument has a 
long and dignified human history: it is a place where one can see how 
nature shapes human endeavors in the American West, where distance and 
aridity have been pitted against our dreams and courage. The monument 
presents exemplary opportunities for geologists, paleontologists, 
archeologists, historians, and biologists.

[[Page 65]]

The monument is a geologic treasure of clearly exposed stratigraphy and 
structures. The sedimentary rock layers are relatively undeformed and 
unobscured by vegetation, offering a clear view to understanding the 
processes of the earth's formation. A wide variety of formations, some 
in brilliant colors, have been exposed by millennia of erosion. The 
monument contains significant portions of a vast geologic stairway, 
named the Grand Staircase by pioneering geologist Clarence Dutton, which 
rises 5,500 feet to the rim of Bryce Canyon in an unbroken sequence of 
great cliffs and plateaus. The monument includes the rugged canyon 
country of the upper Paria Canyon system, major components of the White 
and Vermilion Cliffs and associated benches, and the Kaiparowits 
Plateau. That Plateau encompasses about 1,600 square miles of 
sedimentary rock and consists of successive south-to-north ascending 
plateaus or benches, deeply cut by steep-walled canyons. Naturally 
burning coal seams have scorched the tops of the Burning Hills brick-
red. Another prominent geological feature of the plateau is the East 
Kaibab Monocline, known as the Cockscomb. The monument also includes the 
spectacular Circle Cliffs and part of the Waterpocket Fold, the 
inclusion of which completes the protection of this geologic feature 
begun with the establishment of Capitol Reef National Monument in 1938 
(Proclamation No. 2246, 50 Stat. 1856). The monument holds many arches 
and natural bridges, including the 130-foot-high Escalante Natural 
Bridge, with a 100 foot span, and Grosvenor Arch, a rare ``double 
arch.'' The upper Escalante Canyons, in the northeastern reaches of the 
monument, are distinctive: in addition to several major arches and 
natural bridges, vivid geological features are laid bare in narrow, 
serpentine canyons, where erosion has exposed sandstone and shale 
deposits in shades of red, maroon, chocolate, tan, gray, and white. Such 
diverse objects make the monument outstanding for purposes of geologic 
study.
The monument includes world class paleontological sites. The Circle 
Cliffs reveal remarkable specimens of petrified wood, such as large 
unbroken logs exceeding 30 feet in length. The thickness, continuity and 
broad temporal distribution of the Kaiparowits Plateau's stratigraphy 
provide significant opportunities to study the paleontology of the late 
Cretaceous Era. Extremely significant fossils, including marine and 
brackish water mollusks, turtles, crocodilians, lizards, dinosaurs, 
fishes, and mammals, have been recovered from the Dakota, Tropic Shale 
and Wahweap Formations, and the Tibbet Canyon, Smoky Hollow and John 
Henry members of the Straight Cliffs Formation. Within the monument, 
these formations have produced the only evidence in our hemisphere of 
terrestrial vertebrate fauna, including mammals, of the Cenomanian-
Santonian ages. This sequence of rocks, including the overlaying Wahweap 
and Kaiparowits formations, contains one of the best and most continuous 
records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.
Archeological inventories carried out to date show extensive use of 
places within the monument by ancient Native American cultures. The area 
was a contact point for the Anasazi and Fremont cultures, and the 
evidence of this mingling provides a significant opportunity for 
archeological study. The cultural resources discovered so far in the 
monument are outstanding in their variety of cultural affiliation, type 
and distribution. Hundreds of recorded sites include rock art panels, 
occupation sites, campsites and granaries. Many more undocumented sites 
that exist within the monument are

[[Page 66]]

of significant scientific and historic value worthy of preservation for 
future study.
The monument is rich in human history. In addition to occupations by the 
Anasazi and Fremont cultures, the area has been used by modern tribal 
groups, including the Southern Paiute and Navajo. John Wesley Powell's 
expedition did initial mapping and scientific field work in the area in 
1872. Early Mormon pioneers left many historic objects, including 
trails, inscriptions, ghost towns such as the Old Paria townsite, rock 
houses, and cowboy line camps, and built and traversed the renowned 
Hole-in-the-Rock Trail as part of their epic colonization efforts. Sixty 
miles of the Trail lie within the monument, as does Dance Hall Rock, 
used by intrepid Mormon pioneers and now a National Historic Site.
Spanning five life zones from low-lying desert to coniferous forest, 
with scarce and scattered water sources, the monument is an outstanding 
biological resource. Remoteness, limited travel corridors and low 
visitation have all helped to preserve intact the monument's important 
ecological values. The blending of warm and cold desert floras, along 
with the high number of endemic species, place this area in the heart of 
perhaps the richest floristic region in the Intermountain West. It 
contains an abundance of unique, isolated communities such as hanging 
gardens, tinajas, and rock crevice, canyon bottom, and dunal pocket 
communities, which have provided refugia for many ancient plant species 
for millennia. Geologic uplift with minimal deformation and subsequent 
downcutting by streams have exposed large expanses of a variety of 
geologic strata, each with unique physical and chemical characteristics. 
These strata are the parent material for a spectacular array of unusual 
and diverse soils that support many different vegetative communities and 
numerous types of endemic plants and their pollinators. This presents an 
extraordinary opportunity to study plant speciation and community 
dynamics independent of climatic variables. The monument contains an 
extraordinary number of areas of relict vegetation, many of which have 
existed since the Pleistocene, where natural processes continue 
unaltered by man. These include relict grasslands, of which No Mans Mesa 
is an outstanding example, and pinon-juniper communities containing 
trees up to 1,400 years old. As witnesses to the past, these relict 
areas establish a baseline against which to measure changes in community 
dynamics and biogeochemical cycles in areas impacted by human activity. 
Most of the ecological communities contained in the monument have low 
resistance to, and slow recovery from, disturbance. Fragile cryptobiotic 
crusts, themselves of significant biological interest, play a critical 
role throughout the monument, stabilizing the highly erodible desert 
soils and providing nutrients to plants. An abundance of packrat middens 
provides insight into the vegetation and climate of the past 25,000 
years and furnishes context for studies of evolution and climate change. 
The wildlife of the monument is characterized by a diversity of species. 
The monument varies greatly in elevation and topography and is in a 
climatic zone where northern and southern habitat species intermingle. 
Mountain lion, bear, and desert bighorn sheep roam the monument. Over 
200 species of birds, including bald eagles and peregrine falcons, are 
found within the area. Wildlife, including neotropical birds, 
concentrate around the Paria and Escalante Rivers and other riparian 
corridors within the monument.
Section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431) 
authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public 
proclamation historic

[[Page 67]]

landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of 
historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned 
or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national 
monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits 
of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible 
with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Act of June 
8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that there are hereby 
set apart and reserved as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National 
Monument, for the purpose of protecting the objects identified above, 
all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the United 
States within the boundaries of the area described on the document 
entitled ``Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument'' attached to and 
forming a part of this proclamation. The Federal land and interests in 
land reserved consist of approximately 1.7 million acres, which is the 
smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the 
objects to be protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from entry, location, 
selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the public land 
laws, other than by exchange that furthers the protective purposes of 
the monument. Lands and interests in lands not owned by the United 
States shall be reserved as a part of the monument upon acquisition of 
title thereto by the United States.
The establishment of this monument is subject to valid existing rights.
 Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to diminish the 
responsibility and authority of the State of Utah for management of fish 
and wildlife, including regulation of hunting and fishing, on Federal 
lands within the monument.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to affect existing permits 
or leases for, or levels of, livestock grazing on Federal lands within 
the monument; existing grazing uses shall continue to be governed by 
applicable laws and regulations other than this proclamation.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing 
withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the national 
monument shall be the dominant reservation.
The Secretary of the Interior shall manage the monument through the 
Bureau of Land Management, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, to 
implement the purposes of this proclamation. The Secretary of the 
Interior shall prepare, within 3 years of this date, a management plan 
for this monument, and shall promulgate such regulations for its 
management as he deems appropriate. This proclamation does not reserve 
water as a matter of Federal law. I direct the Secretary to address in 
the management plan the extent to which water is necessary for the 
proper care and management of the objects of this monument and the 
extent to which further action may be necessary pursuant to Federal or 
State law to assure the availability of water.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, 
injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to 
locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.

Proclamation 6921 of September 20, 1996
National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 1996
A Proclamation
 Since the Reconstruction period, when 24 private black colleges were 
founded within 10 years, our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs) have played a central role in providing access to 
higher education for many Americans. Growing steadily after this early 
burst, HBCUs fought a hard struggle for survival over many decades, 
ultimately proving themselves to be not only factories of learning, but 
also bastions of the core American ideals of freedom, diversity, and 
enterprise.
 Today, more than 100 HBCUs throughout our country serve a unique role 
in educating African Americans. Although as a group they make up only 3 
percent of American institutions of higher learning, they award one-
third of all bachelor's degrees--and a major proportion of the graduate 
degrees--earned by African Americans each year. Their alumni rolls 
include scores of leaders in fields ranging from law to the sciences, 
and from the arts to medicine. Often working with limited resources, 
these institutions have earned a reputation for achieving ``the most 
with the least'' public dollars--consistently keeping tuition costs 
affordable, for example, or accepting higher numbers of students who 
need special educational or financial assistance.
 Our Historically Black Colleges and Universities are an enduring beacon 
of hope offering thousands of our citizens a critical opportunity to 
achieve their full potential. HBCUs give these students not only access 
to a quality education, but also a supportive environment in which to 
learn and positive role models whose lives they can strive to emulate. 
In addition, these institutions contribute to the pluralism of American 
education, giving students a broader choice. Ultimately, they also help 
instill and preserve the African American cultural heritage, in the 
process educating all Americans to the richness of the Black experience.
 The future of HBCUs is as bright as their past, and they are busy 
developing ways to meet the challenges of a new century: special 
outreach initiatives designed to spread their wealth of resources into 
the communities that have grown up around them; cutting-edge projects in 
science and technology involving corporate and governmental 
partnerships; and international educational efforts spanning the entire 
globe.
They will continue at the creative forefront of American education, 
offering the tools and skills necessary to prepare students for today's 
competitive and technological society. In this coming week, let us honor 
the contributions--past and present--of Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities, and let us treasure forever the rich resource they provide 
to our Nation: a proud tradition of well-educated Americans, eager to 
make this a better world for all of us.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States 
of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution 
and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 22

[[Page 71]]

through September 28, 1996, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon the people of the United States, 
including government officials, educators, and administrators, to 
observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities 
honoring America's black colleges and universities, and their graduates.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6922 of September 27, 1996
To Extend Nondiscriminatory Treatment (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment) to 
the Products of Bulgaria
A Proclamation
The United States has had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade 
Relations with Bulgaria since 1991, which was last renewed for an 
additional 3-year term in 1994. Pursuant to my authority under 
subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I 
reconfirm that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and 
services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement and that 
actual or foreseeable reductions in U.S. tariffs and nontariff barriers 
to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are, and continuously 
have been, satisfactorily reciprocated by Bulgaria.
Moreover, pursuant to section 2 of Public Law 104-162, and having due 
regard for the findings of the Congress in section 1 of said Law, I 
hereby determine that title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431-
2441) should no longer apply to Bulgaria.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 2 of 
Public Law 104-162, do proclaim that:
    (1) Nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) 
shall be extended to the products of Bulgaria, which will no longer be 
subject to title IV of the Trade Act of 1974.
    (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (3) The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of 
Bulgaria shall be effective as of the date of publication of this 
proclamation in the Federal Register.

Proclamation 6923 of September 27, 1996
Gold Star Mother's Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Of all the many bonds between one human and another, the love of a 
mother for her children touches the deepest chords of passion and 
selfless devotion. A mother willingly gives her affection, her work, and 
her spirit to prepare her children to go forth into the world and make 
their own way. Few of us can appreciate the strength of this tie more 
keenly than a mother whose son or daughter has died while serving our 
country.
 Every Gold Star Mother has lived through this tragedy. She has 
experienced firsthand the shock of having a child taken away abruptly, 
at the brink of achieving his or her promise for fulfillment; she has 
suffered the terrible realization that years of love, nurturing, and 
teaching have been lost in a seemingly random event; and, ultimately, 
she has faced the need to rededicate her life in a way that will give 
continued meaning to the precious memory of her child's existence on 
earth.
Instead of withdrawing into the privacy of their anguish, these 
courageous women channel their grief into constructive service, 
memorializing their children by living lives dedicated to helping 
others. Gold Star Mothers do this not for personal gain, but in the hope 
of making our world a better place.
Whether comforting a disabled veteran in a VA hospital, counseling the 
family of a recently fallen member of our Armed Forces, or working for a 
community volunteer group, America's Gold Star Mothers make a real 
difference to those in need. They also serve our national community by 
fostering and promoting patriotism and respect for our Nation, our flag, 
and our men and women in uniform. Their unselfish leadership helps 
strengthen communities and sets an example for people across our 
country.
As we honor America's Gold Star Mothers and observe this special day, we 
also pray for them and for their families, that they may find peace and 
reconciliation in the knowledge that their work keeps alive the noble 
spirit of their sons and daughters. Having lost their most precious 
gift--their children--they deserve no less than our eternal gratitude.
In recognition of the outstanding courage of our Gold Star Mothers, the 
Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold Star 
Mother's Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue a 
proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 29, 1996, as

[[Page 73]]

Gold Star Mother's Day. I call upon all government officials to display 
the United States flag on government buildings on this solemn day. I 
additionally urge the American people to display the flag and to hold 
appropriate meetings in their homes, places of worship, or other 
suitable places, as public expression of the sympathy and the respect 
that our Nation holds for its Gold Star Mothers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-first.

Proclamation 6924 of October 2, 1996
National Student Voter Education Day, 1996
A Proclamation
This election season marks the 25th anniversary of suffrage for 
Americans between the ages of 18 and 20. With the ratification of the 
26th amendment to the Constitution in July of 1971, which lowered the 
voting age from 21 to 18, our Nation placed its trust in these young 
people and gave them a clearer voice in the halls of government.
America's bold experiment in self-government has inspired over 200 years 
of struggle for a more complete sense of justice and freedom, an effort 
etched in the history of the Constitution and its amendments. 
Emancipation, women's suffrage, civil rights, voting rights--all of 
these battles were fought and won by citizens of conscience and 
conviction who joined together to bring our Nation closer to the ideals 
enshrined in our Constitution of full and equal representation and 
participation.
Since 1971, America's young adults have taken their rightful place in 
this march toward true democracy and opportunity. Living up to the trust 
placed in them and meeting this profound responsibility of citizenship, 
they have voted in large numbers and have played a crucial role in 
choosing leaders and defining issues at the local, State, and national 
levels. Generous in spirit, optimistic and idealistic in outlook, they 
have often proved to be the conscience of our Nation.
Now we are entering a new era in our national existence. We are 
approaching a time unlike any in our past, in which ideas and 
information will move around the world at unprecedented speed, and in 
which there will be more opportunity for people to live out their dreams 
than ever before. I strongly urge today's young Americans to step 
forward and accept the challenge of helping to shape our Nation as we 
move into the 21st century.
Register to vote, study the issues and the candidates, and think 
seriously about what kind of country you want America to be. And then, 
like the millions of Americans who have gone before you, exercise what 
may be your most important right--the right to vote.

[[Page 74]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2, 1996, as 
National Student Voter Education Day, I call upon Federal, State, and 
local officials, as well as leaders of civic, educational, and religious 
organizations to conduct meaningful ceremonies and programs in their 
schools, churches, and other community gathering places to foster a 
better understanding of the 26th amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 
the rights and duties of citizenship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6925 of October 3, 1996
Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who 
Formulate or Implement Policies That Are Impeding the Transition to 
Democracy in Burma or Who Benefit From Such Policies
A Proclamation
The current regime in Burma continues to detain significant numbers of 
duly elected members of parliament, National League for Democracy 
activists, and other persons attempting to promote democratic change in 
Burma. The regime has failed to enter into serious dialogue with the 
democratic opposition and representatives of the country's ethnic 
minorities, has failed to move toward achieving national reconciliation, 
and has failed to meet internationally recognized standards of human 
rights.
In light of this continuing political repression, I have determined that 
it is in the interests of the United States to restrict the entrance 
into the United States as immigrants and nonimmigrants of certain 
Burmese nationals who formulate or implement policies that impede 
Burma's transition to democracy or who benefit from such policies, and 
the immediate families of such persons.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by the power vested in me as 
President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, including sections 212(f) and 215 of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f), 1185), and 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the 
unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of 
persons described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as 
provided for in section 2 or 3 of this proclamation, be detrimental to 
the interests of the United States. I therefore, do proclaim that:
Section 1. The entry into the United States as immigrants and 
nonimmigrants of persons who formulate, implement, or benefit from 
policies

[[Page 75]]

that impede Burma's transition to democracy, and the immediate family 
members of such persons, is hereby suspended.
Sec. 2. Section 1 shall not apply with respect to any person otherwise 
covered by section 1 where the Secretary of State determines that the 
entry of such person would not be contrary to the interests of the 
United States. Section 1 shall not apply to officials assigned to 
Burmese missions in the United States or working-level support staff and 
visitors who support the work of Burmese missions in the United States.
Sec. 3. Persons covered by sections 1 and 2 shall be identified pursuant 
to procedures established by the Secretary of State, as authorized in 
section 6 below.
Sec. 4. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to derogate from 
United States Government obligations under applicable international 
agreements.
Sec. 5. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in 
effect until such time as the Secretary of State determines that it is 
no longer necessary and should be terminated.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of State shall have responsibility to implement 
this proclamation pursuant to procedures the Secretary may establish. 
The Secretary of State may subdelegate the authorities set forth herein 
as he deems necessary and appropriate to implement this proclamation.
Sec. 7. This proclamation may be repealed, in whole or in part, at such 
time as the Secretary of State determines that the Burmese regime has 
released National League for Democracy members currently being held for 
political offenses and other pro-democracy activists, enters into 
genuine dialogue with the democratic opposition, or makes significant 
progress toward improving the human rights situation in the country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6926 of October 3, 1996
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Each year we set aside the month of October as a time to assess the toll 
that breast cancer takes on our society and the progress we have made in 
our battle to overcome it. For those of us who have lost loved ones to 
this disease--mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, and friends--the 
battle holds special urgency.
Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of all deaths among women 
ages 40 to 55. In 1996, a woman will die from breast cancer every 12 min

[[Page 76]]

utes, and 184,300 women in the United States will be diagnosed with the 
disease. Every one of these diagnoses changes not only that woman's 
life, but the lives of all who love and care for her.
We have embarked on an all-out assault to combat this threat. The 
Federal Government has nearly doubled funding for breast cancer 
research, detection, and treatment since 1993, from $271 million to $476 
million in the Department of Health and Human Services alone. And in 
response to requests from 2.6 million of our Nation's citizens, we 
launched the National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, an innovative 
public-private partnership to develop a national strategy for 
prevention, education and care.
We can be proud of the progress we are making in the fight against 
breast cancer. During the most recent 5-year period for which data are 
available (1989-1993), age-adjusted mortality rates for white women fell 
almost 6 percent. Although mortality rates among African American women 
are still increasing, the rate of increase has slowed to 1 percent, 
compared to 16 percent during the 1980's.
One of our most successful weapons in the fight against breast cancer is 
early detection. The new Mammography Quality Standards Act now ensures 
that every woman who obtains a mammogram to detect breast cancer in its 
earliest, curable, stages can be certain that facilities meet the 
highest quality standards for equipment and personnel. We are 
implementing the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection 
Program to make free or low-cost mammography available to medically 
under-served women. The First Lady launched an education campaign to 
inform and encourage older women to use Medicare's mammography screening 
benefit. And to improve early detection, we are transferring imaging 
technologies from the space, defense, and intelligence communities.
I urge women throughout our nation to have appropriate mammograms, to 
perform routine self-examination, and to take advantage of the latest in 
preventive medical care. Armed with this commonsense approach and the 
promising advances in research and treatment, we can look forward with 
confidence to the day when breast cancer is finally eradicated.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1996 as National 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, volunteers, educators, and all the people of 
the United States to celebrate the successes we have had in advancing 
our knowledge of breast cancer, and to reaffirm our commitment to 
continue to work together to fight this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6927 of October 3, 1996
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Domestic violence threatens the very core of what we hold dear. Millions 
of women and children throughout our nation are plagued by the terror of 
family violence each year, and approximately 20 percent of all hospital 
emergency room visits by women result from such violence. Family 
violence is a crime that transcends race, religion, ethnicity, and 
economic stature, and one of its greatest tragedies is its effect on our 
young people: as many as 3 million children witness violence in their 
homes each year.
We must never give up in our efforts to transform despair into hope for 
the women and families across this country who suffer violence at home. 
We must encourage all Americans to increase public awareness and 
understanding of domestic abuse as well as the needs of its victims. My 
Administration is fully engaged in this struggle, coordinating our 
efforts through the Violence Against Women Office at the Department of 
Justice and through the Department of Health and Human Services.
Legislation enacted during the past several years is also helping to 
overcome the scourge of domestic violence. The Violence Against Women 
Act that I signed into law has given law enforcement critical new tools 
with which to prosecute and punish criminals who intentionally prey upon 
women and children. The Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention 
Act of 1996, enacted just last month, makes it a Federal crime for any 
stalker to cross State lines to pursue a victim, whether or not there is 
a protection order in effect, whether or not an actual act of violence 
has been committed, and whether or not the stalker is the victim's 
spouse. And I am pleased that the Congress has just taken action to keep 
guns out of the hands of people with a history of domestic violence.
My Administration has also worked to increase the support available for 
battered women and other victims of domestic violence, including the 
elderly. In February, I announced the creation of a 24-hour, toll-free 
National Domestic Violence Hotline, 1-800-799-SAFE. The response to this 
service has been overwhelming, and the hotline has already received over 
50,000 calls--the majority from women and men who have never before 
reached out for assistance. This year, we will also provide increased 
and unprecedented resources for battered women's shelters, domestic 
violence prevention efforts, and children's counseling services.
There is still much more to do, however. The welfare reform legislation 
that I recently signed recognizes the special needs of domestic violence 
victims, and I urge all States to accept the option of implementing the 
new law's Family Violence provisions. I have also directed the 
Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice to 
develop guidance for States and assist them in implementing the 
provisions. As we help families move from welfare to work, we must 
ensure that they remain safe from violence in their homes and are given 
the support they need to achieve independence.

[[Page 78]]

As a result of these and other efforts at the national, State, and local 
levels, we are one step closer to eliminating domestic violence and 
building in its place a brighter, more secure future for our families 
and loved ones. I salute all those whose efforts are helping us in this 
endeavor and pay special tribute to the survivors of domestic violence 
whose courage is an inspiration to us all. I urge all Americans to join 
me in working toward the day when no person raises a hand in violence 
against a family member.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1996 as National 
Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this month by demonstrating their respect and gratitude for all those 
individuals who unselfishly share their experiences, skills, and talents 
with those affected by domestic violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6928 of October 4, 1996
Roosevelt History Month, 1996
A Proclamation
The Roosevelt family has uniquely influenced the direction and quality 
of life in America for the last century. With two enormously successful 
Presidents, Teddy and FDR, and a precedent-setting First Lady, Eleanor, 
the Roosevelt family has left a lasting legacy of exemplary leadership 
and public service to our Nation.
In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt established our country's first 
National Wildlife Refuge. Thanks to his vision and determination, 
America today enjoys the natural treasures preserved in the largest and 
most varied conservation system in the world. From 1933 to 1945, 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with the support of his wife, Anna 
Eleanor Roosevelt, guided the United States through two of the gravest 
crises of the 20th century: the Great Depression and World War II. 
Universally recognized as one of the greatest American Presidents, FDR 
stands as a symbol of the greatness of our Nation itself. Eleanor 
Roosevelt, his lifelong companion and dearest friend, transformed the 
role of the First Lady, traveling the country as an advocate for the 
poor, the disenfranchised, and the disadvantaged.
Together, their partnership redefined the modern First Family, combining 
a broad concern for all Americans with a strong sense of the dignity and 
history of the Presidency. In a time of acute national anxiety, FDR 
promised Americans ``a leadership of frankness and vigor.'' He 
recognized that government had to be responsive to the needs of its 
people and that the Presidency is not merely an executive office but 
also a position of moral

[[Page 79]]

leadership. President Roosevelt moved Americans toward hope, through 
perseverance and faith in themselves. He spoke directly to average 
Americans, not only through his fireside chats on radio, but also 
through his insistence on honesty and justice.
He fought for fairness in government, working to establish Federal 
programs that met the needs of his time: a welcome job for an idle but 
eager worker; a government loan to help a family avoid foreclosure; and 
a retirement income system that still serves working Americans nearly 60 
years later. These achievements were steps on the road to FDR's dream of 
establishing a government that would serve as a model for the world.
In Franklin Roosevelt's view, government should be the perfect public 
system for fostering and protecting the ``Four Freedoms'' he enumerated 
when he addressed the Congress in January 1941. Intended as a rallying 
cry against the economic and military specters that had swept the globe 
during the previous decade, this speech recognized four essential 
freedoms: freedom of speech and expression; freedom of every person to 
worship God in his own way; freedom from want; and freedom from fear. 
Roosevelt made it clear that he enumerated these freedoms not as 
abstract ideals but as goals toward which Americans--and caring people 
everywhere--could direct their most strenuous public efforts.
Millions of people around the world remember with gratitude his 
determined leadership as the successful Commander in Chief of America's 
Armed Forces during this century's most terrible war. It is difficult to 
imagine any individual other than Franklin Roosevelt who would have been 
able to oversee the war effort--not only beating back the spreading 
stain of totalitarianism by achieving decisive military victories, but 
also adroitly maintaining unity among our allies. As the world moved 
under a deepening shadow of violence and terror, FDR displayed an 
unwavering personal character and resolve that inspired faith among the 
American people.
And even though FDR did not survive to witness the end of the war he 
helped so much to win, he nonetheless knew he had set our country's 
sights in the right direction by dedicating his public career to a 
safer, stronger America--citizens living and working together in a 
community of fairness, harmony, and peace. As the final words of his 
Four Freedoms speech expressed: ``To that high concept there can be no 
end save victory.''
After her husband's death, Eleanor Roosevelt continued the vigorous 
advocacy work she and FDR had begun in the White House, serving on the 
United States Delegation to the United Nations, acting as Chairperson of 
the Human Rights Commission during the drafting of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the U.N. in 1948, working as a 
member of the National Advisory Committee of the Peace Corps for 
President Kennedy, and finally serving as Chair of President Kennedy's 
Commission on the Status of Women. By the time of her death in 1962, she 
had earned the unofficial title of First Lady of the World, reaffirming 
the virtues to which she and her husband had dedicated their lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1996 as Roosevelt 
History Month. I call upon government officials, educators, labor 
leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 6929 of October 4, 1996
National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 1996
A Proclamation
As we rapidly approach the 21st century, we are entering an age 
dominated by information and technology, the microchip and the global 
marketplace. We can't afford to waste the talents of a single person if 
we are to succeed in this exciting and challenging new world, and people 
with disabilities have a major role to play in helping us to achieve a 
dynamic, productive work force in a united community.
In the darkest days of World War II, the American people looked to 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a person with a disability, for 
leadership and strength. Today, as college presidents and scientists, 
world-class athletes and physicians, our citizens with disabilities make 
their own invaluable contributions to our Nation's strength. From Main 
Street to Wall Street, they have performed successfully at every level 
of business and government, demonstrating in large ways and small that 
they can meet the same challenges as everyone else.
We can be proud of the great progress we have made in eliminating overt 
discrimination. Leaders of business and industry, veterans service 
organizations, and labor, as well as community leaders from all walks of 
life, have worked together to implement the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, which bans discrimination in recruitment, interviewing, hiring, and 
advancement.
Yet, 50 years after President Roosevelt's death, too many doors to 
employment remain closed to individuals with disabilities. We must work 
to eradicate more subtle forms of discrimination. We must make sure that 
our words of support for empowerment and inclusion continue to be 
reflected in our policies. It is up to all of us--employers, labor, 
educators,veterans, people with disabilities, and government--to stay 
the course until every barrier against individuals with disabilities 
comes down.
In recognition of the great potential of people with disabilities, and 
to encourage all Americans to work toward their full participation in 
our work force, the Congress, by Joint Resolution, approved August 11, 
1945, as amended (36 U.S.C. 155), has designated October of each year as 
``National Disability Employment Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 1996 as National Disability 
Employment Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, educators, 
labor leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe 
this month with appropriate programs and activities that reaffirm our

[[Page 81]]

determination to fulfill both the letter and the spirit of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6930 of October 5, 1996
Fire Prevention Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Our Nation has a long tradition of unity in the face of adversity, and 
Americans have always stood together to fight one of our most terrifying 
and preventable problems--fire. We are fortunate to have so many 
dedicated public and private organizations working diligently to promote 
fire prevention and safety. Each October, Fire Prevention Week gives us 
an opportunity to remember family and friends who have been the victims 
of fire, and to redouble our efforts to prevent these tragedies.
Uncontrolled, fire can destroy homes, livelihoods, and lives. This year, 
in the wake of one of the most serious wildland fire seasons in history 
and a troubling series of arsons at houses of worship, we must join 
together and rededicate ourselves to fire prevention efforts. Whether 
working to stop church arsons or to avoid accidental fires in the home, 
we all have an important role to play.
The National Fire Protection Association has selected ``Let's Hear it 
for Fire Safety: Test Your Detectors!'' as the theme for Fire Prevention 
Week, 1996, and joins with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
communicate this lifesaving message. This year's theme focuses on a 
vital and simple element of home fire protection--smoke detectors.
Smoke detectors can provide early warning and reduce the risk of dying 
in a home fire by almost half. The theme of this year's Fire Prevention 
Week reinforces the need for regular testing of home smoke detectors. 
The combination of a working smoke detector with a well-rehearsed escape 
plan can enable people to exit safely and quickly in the event of a 
fire.
Thanks to the commitment and support of our Nation's fire and emergency 
services, we continue to make fire prevention and fire safety a top 
priority in America. Too often, these dedicated champions of fire safety 
pay the ultimate price in service to their communities. Last year, 102 
firefighters died, and more than 94,500 were injured. On Sunday, October 
13, 1996, we will pay our respects to these courageous men and women at 
the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, Maryland.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6 through

[[Page 82]]

October 12, 1996, as Fire Prevention Week. I encourage the people of the 
United States to take an active role in fire prevention not only this 
week, but also throughout the year. I also call upon every citizen to 
pay tribute to the members of our fire services who have lost their 
lives or been injured in service to their communities, and to those men 
and women who carry on their noble tradition.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6931 of October 5, 1996
German-American Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Germans were among the first settlers of the United States. They, like 
other immigrants to our country, came to America seeking a better life 
for themselves and their families. In building this better life, they 
have immeasurably enriched the lives of their fellow Americans.
From the beginning of the colonial period and throughout the history of 
our republic, German Americans have contributed their intellect, wealth, 
and culture to building, defending, and improving American life. 
Organized settlement in America by Germans began as early as 1683, with 
the arrival of German Mennonites in Pennsylvania at the invitation of 
William Penn. Pennsylvania soon became the center and stronghold of 
German settlement throughout colonial times as small, vigorous 
communities spread to Maryland and the other colonies. Today, robust 
German-American communities can be found throughout the United States.
The strength of character and personal honor so important in the German 
cultural tradition have also found their way into the core values of 
American society. More U.S. citizens can claim German heritage than that 
of any other national group. And every successive generation of German 
Americans seems to produce new heroes and heroines who earn the 
admiration of a grateful world.
For example, Carl Schurz served as a Union General in the Civil War and 
later rose to become a distinguished American statesman, both as Senator 
from Missouri and as Secretary of the Interior. Johann Peter Zenger, the 
publisher of New York Weekly Journal in the early 18th century, was an 
early and vigorous champion of the free press in America. And German-
born Albert Einstein made monumental and historic contributions to our 
understanding of the universe.
Our culture has also benefited abundantly from German-American women. 
Anna Ottendorfer was a talented newspaper publisher and philanthropist. 
The four Klumpke sisters enriched American life with their contributions

[[Page 83]]

to art, medicine, music, and astronomy, while Lillian Blauvelt and 
Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler enhanced American music.
America has welcomed Germans in search of civic freedoms, and their 
idealism has reinforced what was best in their new country. German-
American men and women have contributed immensely to the fabric of our 
Nation, and it is appropriate that we pause to honor their important 
role in building our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, October 6, 1996, 
as German-American Day. I encourage Americans everywhere to recognize 
and celebrate the contributions that millions of people of German 
ancestry have made to our Nation's liberty, democracy, and prosperity.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6932 of October 7, 1996
National Wildlife Refuge Week, 1996
A Proclamation
As we prepare to meet the challenges of the 21st century, protecting the 
environment remains our sacred responsibility. Our National Wildlife 
Refuge System is a network of special places set aside to conserve the 
natural habitat of our fish and wildlife. My Administration is dedicated 
to strengthening this invaluable network of refuges that truly enhance 
the lives of all Americans.
President Theodore Roosevelt established the first National Wildlife 
Refuge in 1903, and his vision remains the guiding force for the Refuge 
System today: ``... keeping for our children's children, as a priceless 
heritage, all the delicate beauty of the lesser and all the burly 
majesty of the mightier forms of wild life .... Wild beasts and birds 
are by right not the property merely of the people alive today, but the 
property of the unborn generations whose belongings we have no right to 
squander.''
What began 93 years ago with a small island in Florida has grown into a 
system of more than 500 refuges spanning all 50 States and several trust 
territories. It is home to resident and migratory wildlife and includes 
lands of breathtaking beauty and diversity, from the tropical mangroves 
of Florida's Key Deer National Wildlife Refuge to the majestic peaks of 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. This mosaic of 
magnificent places provides Americans a wide range of opportunities--
both educational and recreational--to learn about our environment and 
our country's heritage, to observe and photograph, and to hunt and fish. 
Our national wildlife refuges are among our most treasured areas, and we 
must reaffirm our commitment

[[Page 84]]

to preserving these precious resources for our children, for our 
communities, and for future generations. Working together, we can ensure 
the health and vitality of our wildlife and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6 through October 
12, 1996, as National Wildlife Refuge Week. I invite all Americans to 
learn about, appreciate, and celebrate this magnificent collection of 
lands that we as a people have set aside for wildlife and for the 
enjoyment of future generations. I also ask all to join me in a renewed 
commitment to responsible stewardship of our country's irreplaceable 
natural resources.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6933 of October 7, 1996
Child Health Day, 1996
A Proclamation
The health of our children is part of our heritage as a Nation, passed 
from one generation to the next. It is also our hope for the future. Our 
children embody our dreams and are the vessel through which we seek an 
ever deeper understanding of the full reach of human promise. Their 
physical, mental, and social well-being is the fulfillment of that 
potential.
For previous generations, diseases were a deadly shadow hovering over 
every new birth. Thanks in large part to medical advances and improved 
public health practices, most of today's children are no longer 
threatened by these afflictions. Childhood immunizations alone have 
saved countless American lives in the past decade, and today we are 
increasing our efforts to identify and immunize children who need this 
protection.
Since we now have the knowledge and resources to protect our children 
from many childhood diseases--including diphtheria, pertussis, 
poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and rubella--we have the obligation to 
reach out to our population and do so. Immunization is a cost-effective, 
commonsense means of fighting disease, and States wisely require 
immunizations for schoolchildren and for children attending child care 
centers. I signed the Comprehensive Childhood Immunization Initiative so 
that children will receive the vaccinations they need. This initiative 
makes vaccines affordable for families and improves immunization 
outreach, with the goal that 90 percent of all two-year-olds should be 
fully vaccinated by the year 2000.
However, even if we achieve complete immunization of all American 
children, our youth today face another potential threat every bit as 
dangerous as disease--the devastation of violence. Children are becoming 
more frequent victims, and violence among children is increasing as they 
emulate

[[Page 85]]

the violence in their environment. Each year the tragic effects can be 
seen in the lives of millions of children. It can be observed among 
those who are neglected or abused, of whom more than 1,000 die each 
year. It can be found especially in the lives of those who witness 
violence against a parent--and who themselves face a significant chance 
of becoming victims of that same brutality.
As a Nation, we must continue our commitment to eliminating violence and 
to strengthening children and families. To that end, we have launched 
initiatives to encourage the use of school uniforms, the adoption of 
curfews, and the intensification of anti-truancy programs. And we have 
also expanded the drug-free school program to include anti-crime efforts 
as well, enhancing the overall safety of our schools.
America's future rests with healthy children and strong families. All 
across this land--within our homes and health care settings; our 
churches and communities; our schools and child care centers; our 
legislatures and halls of justice; our factories, shops, and offices--we 
are all charged with the responsibility to safeguard our legacy by 
protecting and nurturing the bodies, minds, and spirits of our children.
To emphasize the significance of fostering children's healthy 
development, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as 
amended (36 U.S.C. 143), has called for the designation of the first 
Monday in October as ``Child Health Day'' and has requested the 
President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 7, 1996, as Child Health 
Day. On that day and every day throughout the year, I urge all Americans 
to renew and deepen their commitment to protecting our most precious 
natural resource--our children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6934 of October 9, 1996
Leif Erikson Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Leif Erikson Day commemorates the life and the voyages of the great 
Nordic explorer who first set foot on the fertile soil of North America 
about one thousand years ago. On this day, we also celebrate the close 
bonds of friendship between the people of the United States and the 
Nordic peoples, as well as the outstanding contributions that Nordic 
Americans have made to our country.
We have good cause to mark this day. The pioneering spirit that Leif 
Erikson and his followers demonstrated embodies the virtues of independ

[[Page 86]]

ence, self-determination, and initiative that are firmly rooted in our 
national consciousness today. As a vital transatlantic bridge between 
the continents of America and Europe, the Nordic countries of Iceland, 
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland have repeatedly shown a bedrock 
commitment to the democratic values that contributed greatly to the 
formation of our own national ideals.
Just as our forebears persevered through what sometimes seemed 
insurmountable odds to transform adversity into prosperity, we have 
continued to champion the cause of liberty and to reach out without 
reservation or hesitation to our neighbors and those in need around the 
world. The same heritage that enabled our ancestors to brave wars and 
uncharted frontiers--because they were convinced that they were working 
to create a better world--also emboldens us today in our cooperative 
effort to integrate the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
into the Western community of nations.
Our immigrant ancestors survived unthinkable hardships to achieve 
economic, religious, and political freedom. Their dreams were big, but 
so was their willingness to work for them. The link they forged across 
the oceans is sustained today by a common commitment to freedom and the 
rule of law--ideals that have strong roots in the civic and legal 
traditions of Nordic countries dating back at least to medieval times.
In honor of Leif Erikson--son of Iceland, grandson of Norway--the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on September 2, 1964 (Public Law 
88-566), has authorized and requested the President to designate October 
9 of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 1996, as Leif Erikson Day. I 
encourage the people of the United States to observe this occasion with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities commemorating our rich Nordic-
American heritage.

October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 6935 of October 10, 1996
National Day of Concern About Young People and Gun Violence, 1996
A Proclamation
Few losses are more difficult to face than the death of a young person. 
Such deaths are even more appalling when they result from violence by 
another youth. It is a tragedy of modern American life that thousands of 
our young people each year suffer deadly violence initiated by their 
peers. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) data show that in the 
decade between

[[Page 87]]

1984 and 1993 the number of homicide arrests of juveniles skyrocketed by 
168 percent. Even more disturbing, the fastest increase in violent crime 
arrests of juveniles occurred among children 10 to 12 years old. 
Demographic experts predicted that, if those trends continued, juvenile 
violent crime arrests would double by the year 2010.
Now, new FBI data show reason for cautious optimism. For the first time 
in 7 years, the juvenile crime arrest rate decreased--by 2.9 percent in 
1995. In addition, juvenile arrests for murder declined by 15.2 percent 
in 1995--the largest 1-year decrease in more than 10 years. Since 1993, 
the arrest rate for murder among juveniles has decreased by 22.8 
percent.
Although this trend is encouraging, far too many of our young people 
still are committing violent acts. Fueling this problem is the 
prevalence of, and easy access to, illegal firearms on our Nation's 
streets. Between 1985 and 1992, the number of juvenile homicides not 
involving guns increased by 20 percent, while the number involving guns 
jumped by 300 percent. Because guns are easily available, routine fights 
among young people often turn into gun battles. Then, as the tragic 
cycle of violence repeats itself, more and more young people, fearing 
for their safety, arm themselves. The resulting escalation of gun 
violence and death threatens the Nation's most precious resource for the 
future--our young people.
We have expanded an experimental tracing program that targets those who 
provide or sell guns to young people. But we need to do more to keep 
guns out of the hands of our kids. We need to further improve and 
vigorously enforce our gun laws. And we need to reduce the sale and use 
of illegal drugs, which also fuel gun violence.
We also need to begin teaching children as early as possible how to 
choose not to be violent. All of us can take an active role in making 
sure that conflict resolution and other anti-violence programs are in 
place in our local schools, community centers, and places of worship. 
Community leaders, businesses, and other local institutions must create 
``safe havens'' where children can go after school. Such actions can be 
a tangible sign of care and concern on the part of the community. Most 
importantly, parents need to teach their children right from wrong, so 
that they can learn the core values of our society and live according to 
them. In this undertaking, parents must be sensitive, patient, diligent, 
and fair, in order to provide a proper nonviolent model.
While parents, teachers, clergy, and the community at large can provide 
encouragement, the ultimate responsibility for reducing youth violence 
lies with our young people themselves. They must commit to resolve 
disputes without violence and to avoid violent situations and friends. 
They must become positive role models for their peers, siblings, and 
younger children. Many young people have already made this commitment 
and are working in their schools and neighborhoods to end violence. For 
this, we salute them and urge them to continue to work for peaceful 
solutions. We call upon all young people to make this same commitment.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 10, 1996, as a 
National Day of Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this day 
I call upon young people in classrooms and playgrounds across the United 
States to make a solemn decision about their future. I call upon

[[Page 88]]

them voluntarily to sign a pledge promising that they will never take a 
gun to school, that they will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and 
that they will use their influence to prevent friends from using guns to 
settle disputes. Finally, I call upon all Americans to commit themselves 
anew to helping our Nation's young people avoid violence and grow up to 
be happy, healthy, and productive adults.

October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of

Proclamation 6936 of October 10, 1996
General Pulaski Memorial Day, 1996
A Proclamation
On October 11, we observe the 217th anniversary of the death of a great 
military hero from American history, General Casimir Pulaski. Every year 
on this date, Americans and Poles together honor this valiant soldier, 
who spent his life fighting for freedom on both sides of the Atlantic. 
General Pulaski's life and career are a vivid reminder of the strong 
historical bonds between Poland and the United States. These bonds have 
been forged not only by the millions of Polish Americans who have helped 
make our country great, but also by our two countries' shared dedication 
to the principles of liberty and independence.
Pulaski, born into a family of nobles, first fought oppression at his 
father's side, battling the forces of Prussia and Imperial Russia to 
preserve the liberty of his Polish homeland. Exiled by the Russians, he 
was recruited into the American colonies' Continental Army by Benjamin 
Franklin and brought his bravery and passion for freedom to numerous 
battles during the Revolutionary War. General Pulaski sacrificed his 
life for the cause of liberty during the siege of Savannah as he 
protected American troops.
In our own time, we have seen the Polish people follow the example of 
General Pulaski and renew their dedication to freedom--rebuilding their 
homeland in spite of Nazi oppression and, later, communist tyranny. 
Today, Poland has regained its sovereignty and fashioned a sturdy 
representative democracy. For Americans and Poles alike, Casimir 
Pulaski's sacrifice for independence remains a model of courage and 
commitment that can stir us to reach new heights of democratic justice 
and liberty.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, October 11, 1996, 
as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage Americans everywhere to 
commemorate this occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
paying tribute to Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who carry on 
his mission.

National Character Counts Week, 1996
A Proclamation
One of our most important goals as a Nation is to make this a better 
world for all people. Millions around the globe look to America as a 
champion of justice, and we must always strive to encourage the good and 
denounce the bad.
This week, as a Nation, we celebrate the fact that ``Character Counts.'' 
Whether in civic activities or in our daily lives at work and at home, 
we all contribute regularly to our American community and our national 
purpose--our sense of who we are as a people. In the end, the character 
of our Nation is determined by the character of our citizens.
During this special week, we recognize that character is not a quality 
we are born with; we must learn it. This means we must ensure that it is 
taught, clearly and thoughtfully, to our youth. Individual character 
involves honoring and embracing certain core ethical values: honesty, 
respect, responsibility, hard work, fairness, caring, civic virtue, and 
citizenship. Americans must do everything possible to create a society 
in which these virtues are not only taught but also acted out in daily 
life so that our young people can witness firsthand their value and 
learn right from wrong.
My Administration has made this effort a top priority. Our Improving 
America's Schools Act promotes initiatives in character education, just 
as the Goals 2000: Educate America Act recognizes the crucial role of 
the family in nurturing strong values and encouraging children to 
embrace academic achievement. Our AmeriCorps national service program 
offers young people a practical means through which to demonstrate their 
beliefs in the civic virtues that traditionally have given our Nation 
much of its strength of character.
The family remains, of course, the core source of our values. Parents 
must teach their children from the earliest age, the difference between 
right and wrong. But we all must do our part. Teachers, religious 
leaders, and other early-childhood role models must display the highest 
standards of respect for themselves and others; young people must commit 
themselves to dealing nonviolently with the inevitable problems and 
difficulties they will encounter; and both public- and private-sector 
institutions must adopt corporate behavior that encourages individual 
character development.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 13 through

[[Page 90]]

19, 1996, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon the people of 
the United States, Government officials, educators, and volunteers, to 
observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6938 of October 11, 1996
National School Lunch Week, 1996
A Proclamation
This school year, schools across the country are serving more healthful 
and more appealing school meals, and school-children are learning to 
make food choices for a nutritious diet. The National School Lunch 
Program, which began in 1946, is celebrating its 50th anniversary year 
with historic changes that will reduce diet-related diseases and improve 
the health outlook for America's children.
The 1996-97 school year is the first year that school meals must meet 
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans under the new School Meals 
Initiative for Healthy Children. This initiative, created to help 
schools make necessary improvements, is providing nutrition education 
for children and training and technical assistance for school food-
service professionals. Early reports from pilot communities tell us that 
we are getting results. Food-service professionals are seeing children 
eat more fruits and vegetables. With the help of dedicated teachers, 
they are becoming better educated about what their bodies need.
Improvements in school meals and nutrition education enhance the health 
of the 50 million children in the Nation's 94,000 schools--strengthening 
the safety net for poor children who rely on school meals as their 
primary source of daily nutrition. Wholesome meals improve our 
children's ability to learn today and brighten their health outlook for 
tomorrow.
These improvements are already a reality at the local level. Team 
Nutrition Schools--of which there are now more than 14,000--reach 8.1 
million children. These schools are community focal points for change, 
leading the way in bringing together teachers, parents, health 
professionals, local businesses, and industry leaders to promote 
nutrition education and to work for more healthful school meals. These 
schools benefit from the resources made available through an innovative 
network of public-private partnerships. More than 200 organizations are 
part of an extensive support network that dramatically increases the 
impact and reach of a relatively small Federal investment.
Since President Truman signed the National School Lunch Act 50 years 
ago, the Federal Government and local school food-service professionals 
have worked in partnership to meet the nutritional needs of America's 
chil

[[Page 91]]

dren. Now, together, they are ushering in an era of historic change and 
continuous improvement that promise a healthier future for all 
Americans.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch Program 
to the nutritional well-being of children, the Congress, by joint 
resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law No. 87-780), has designated 
the week beginning the second Sunday in October of each year as 
``National School Lunch Week'' and has requested the President to issue 
a proclamation in observance of that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 13, 1996, as 
National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize those 
individuals whose efforts contribute to the success of the National 
School Lunch Program and to observe this week with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6939 of October 11, 1996
National Children's Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Our Nation benefits when every American child is truly valued and 
cherished. We have no greater responsibility or hope for our future than 
our children, and the promise of a better tomorrow depends upon the 
love, support, education, and encouragement that we give to each of 
them. It is up to all of us--parents and families, schools, churches, 
and community organizations--to join in the critical endeavor of putting 
the needs of our children first. Only when we reaffirm our commitment to 
our children's well-being can we truly say that we are prepared for the 
challenges that await us in the next century.
America is a country of many blessings--a rich land, a thriving 
democracy, a diverse and determined people. Our culture is built on 
faith in freedom, and opportunity, and on the spirit of community. In a 
Nation of such infinite promise, too many of our children face great 
obstacles in reaching their full potential, and it is imperative that we 
not turn our backs on them.
Because safety, health, a clean environment, quality education, and 
economic security are the keys to a brighter future, they are necessary 
investments in the healthy growth and development of our children. 
Through measures such as expanding Head Start and child care, preserving 
Medicaid, enhancing child protection, protecting the environment, and 
increasing educational opportunity for all students, my Administration 
has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that every child has the 
tools to become a productive citizen.

[[Page 92]]

As we work together in a spirit of community, let us seek to instill 
confidence, hope, pride, and self-esteem in our young people. Because 
today's children are tomorrow's leaders, educators, and parents, all of 
us--adults and children--forever will benefit from this commitment.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 13, 1996, as 
National Children's Day. I urge all Americans to express their love and 
appreciation, not only on this day but also on all days, for their 
children and all of the children of this Nation. I invite Federal 
officials, State and local governments, and particularly the American 
family, to join in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities to honor our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6940 of October 11, 1996
Columbus Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Throughout our history, America has been inspired by the courage and 
daring of Christopher Columbus. Like him, we are a people who dare to 
dream, to chart a bold course, and to surmount formidable obstacles to 
reach new horizons.
Columbus' arrival in North America not only confirmed his beliefs about 
our planet, but also initiated an epic struggle between the Old and New 
Worlds. Yet out of that triumphant voyage and the meeting of many 
peoples developed a Nation and a way of life vastly unlike those 
Columbus left behind.
The expedition that Columbus--an Italian supported by the Spanish 
Crown--began more than 500 years ago, continues today as we experience 
and celebrate the vibrant influences of varied civilizations, not only 
from Europe, but also from around the world. America is stronger because 
of this diversity, and the democracy we cherish flourishes in the great 
mosaic we have created since 1492. Americans of Italian and Spanish 
heritage can be particularly proud, not only of Columbus' achievements, 
but also of their own contributions to our country.
As we honor and remember Christopher Columbus, let us use his example as 
a beacon to help guide us into the 21st century. His life, his voyages, 
and--above all--his vision can inspire us as we prepare for the 
challenges that lie ahead. Let us remember that all of us, regardless of 
our origins, are important participants in that journey, and that our 
uncertainty about what

[[Page 93]]

lies over the horizon should not shake our faith that, together, we will 
succeed.
In recognition of Columbus' epic achievement, the Congress, by joint 
resolution of April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), and an Act of June 28, 1968 
(82 Stat. 250), has requested the President to proclaim the second 
Monday in October of each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 14, 1996, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6941 of October 14, 1996
White Cane Safety Day, 1996
A Proclamation
In the summer of 1996, the remarkable display of athletic excellence at 
the Tenth Paralympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, inspired viewers around 
the world. Athletes from across our country, including many who are 
blind or visually impaired, participated in these games. The tenacity 
and commitment to excellence that these athletes showed in Atlanta are 
rich resources for our Nation. From their performance in the 
Paralympics, and indeed from their many contributions throughout our 
Nation's history, blind and visually impaired Americans have 
demonstrated how much they have to contribute.
Individuals with disabilities, like all people, use many tools in their 
everyday lives, some simple and some technologically sophisticated. The 
tool most commonly used by blind and visually impaired people is the 
white cane. This basic instrument enables them to detect obstacles, 
steps, drop-offs, and changes in surface textures. The independence that 
blind and visually impaired people gain through the use of the white 
cane enriches their lives--and those of all Americans--by allowing them 
to participate fully in and contribute generously to our society.
Blind and visually impaired individuals make valuable contributions to 
our society and our economy. But they need more than the white cane to 
achieve their full potential; they also need equal opportunity and 
protection from discrimination. That is why we must continue to 
vigorously enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits 
discrimination against blind and visually impaired people and those with 
other disabil

[[Page 94]]

ities, and ensures them access to services that all other Americans take 
for granted.
To honor the numerous achievements of blind and visually impaired 
individuals, and to recognize the significance of the white cane as a 
symbol of their freedom and independence in our society, the Congress of 
the United States, by joint resolution approved October 6, 1964, has 
designated October 15 of each year as ``White Cane Safety Day,'' and 
authorized the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
commemoration.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1996, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon the people of the United States, government officials, 
educators, and business leaders to observe this day with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6942 of October 17, 1996
To Amend the Generalized System of Preferences
A Proclamation
1. Sections 501(1) and (4) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``Trade 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2461(1) and (4)), provide that, in affording duty-free 
treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the 
President shall have due regard for, among other factors, the effect 
such action will have on furthering the economic development of a 
beneficiary developing country and the extent of the beneficiary 
developing country's competitiveness with respect to eligible articles. 
Section 502(c)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(2)) provides that, 
in determining whether to designate any country as a beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP, the President shall take 
into account various factors, including the country's level of economic 
development, the country's per capita gross national product, the living 
standards of its inhabitants, and any other economic factors he deems 
appropriate. Section 502(d) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)) 
authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application 
of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any country after 
considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 
Trade Act. Section 502(f)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)) 
requires the President to notify the Congress and the affected country, 
at least 60 days before termination, of the President's intention to 
terminate the affected country's designation as a beneficiary developing 
country for purposes of the GSP.
2. Section 502(e) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the 
President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
de

[[Page 95]]

veloping country if the President determines that such country has 
become a ``high income'' country as defined by the official statistics 
of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
Termination is effective on January 1 of the second year following the 
year in which such determination is made.
3. Section 502(c)(7) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(7)) provides 
that, in determining whether to designate any country a beneficiary 
developing country under this section, the President shall take into 
account whether the country has taken or is taking steps to afford 
internationally recognized worker rights to workers in the country.
4. Section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(1)) authorizes 
the President to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries 
for purposes of the GSP. Section 503(c)(2)(F) of the Trade Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)) authorizes the President to disregard the 
limitations provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Trade Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article if the 
aggregate appraised value of the imports of such article into the United 
States during the preceding calendar year is de minimis.
5. Section 502(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(2)) authorizes 
the President to designate any beneficiary developing country as a 
least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP 
based on the considerations in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act.
6. Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Trade Act, and having considered 
the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c)(2), I have determined 
that Malaysia is sufficiently advanced in economic development and 
improved in trade competitiveness that continued preferential treatment 
under the GSP is not warranted, and that it is appropriate to terminate 
the designation of Malaysia as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP effective January 1, 1997. In order to take into 
account the termination of benefits under the GSP for articles imported 
from Malaysia, I have determined that it is appropriate to: (i) 
terminate the designation of Malaysia for GSP purposes as a member of 
the Association of South East Asian Nations (``ASEAN'') and to modify 
general note 4(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(``HTS'') to reflect such termination, (ii) delete from general note 
4(d) of the HTS and from pertinent HTS subheadings all references to 
particular products of Malaysia which are currently excluded from 
preferential tariff treatment under the GSP, and (iii) to terminate any 
waivers of the competitive need limits granted to Malaysia pursuant to 
section 503(d) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)).
7. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the Trade Act, I have determined that 
Cyprus, Aruba, Macau, the Netherlands Antilles, Greenland, and the 
Cayman Islands meet the definition of a ``high income'' country as 
defined by the official statistics of the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development. As a result and pursuant to section 
502(e) of the Trade Act, I am terminating the preferential treatment 
under the GSP for articles that are currently eligible for such 
treatment and that are imported from Cyprus, Aruba, Macau, the 
Netherlands Antilles, Greenland, and the Cayman Islands effective 
January 1, 1998.
8. Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Trade Act, and having considered 
the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c)(7), I have determined 
that it is appropriate to suspend some of Pakistan's GSP benefits 
because of insuffi

[[Page 96]]

cient progress on affording workers in that country internationally 
recognized worker rights. In order to reflect the suspension of benefits 
under the GSP for certain articles imported from Pakistan, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to modify general note 4(d) of the HTS 
and pertinent HTS subheadings so that Pakistan will no longer receive 
preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to certain 
eligible articles effective July 1, 1996.
9. Pursuant to section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act, I am acting to 
correct the name of Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of Yemen in the HTS, 
beneficiary developing countries previously proclaimed. In addition, I 
have determined that it is appropriate to disregard section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Trade Act with respect to certain eligible 
articles from certain beneficiary developing countries based on imports 
for calendar year 1994 and to restore preferential treatment under the 
GSP to imports of such articles from such countries.
10. Pursuant to sections 502(a)(2) and 502(d) of the Trade Act, and 
having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I 
have determined that Botswana and Western Samoa should be deleted from 
the list of least-developed beneficiary developing countries and Angola, 
Ethiopia, Madagascar, Zaire, and Zambia should be added.
11. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the 
relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import 
treatment, and actions thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 301 
of Title 3, United States Code, and Title V and section 604 of the Trade 
Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to terminate the designation of Malaysia as a 
beneficiary developing country under the GSP and to modify the list of 
beneficiary developing countries designated as least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, the HTS is 
modified as provided in Annex I to this proclamation.
    (2) In order to terminate the designation of Cyprus, Aruba, Macau, 
the Netherlands Antilles, Greenland, and the Cayman Islands as 
beneficiary developing countries under the GSP, the HTS is modified as 
provided in Annex II to this proclamation.
    (3) In order to reflect the suspension of benefits under the GSP for 
certain articles imported from Pakistan, the HTS is modified as provided 
in Annex III to this proclamation.
    (4) In order to correct the name of Guinea-Bissau and Republic of 
Yemen and to restore preferential treatment to certain eligible articles 
from certain beneficiary developing countries as a result of granting of 
de minimis waivers to such articles, the HTS is modified as provided in 
Annex IV to this proclamation.
    (5) I delegate to the United States Trade Representative the powers 
granted to me in section 502(f)(2) of the Trade Act to notify a country 
of my

[[Page 97]]

intention to terminate that country's status as a beneficiary developing 
country for the purposes of the GSP.
    (6) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (7) The modifications to the HTS made in paragraphs (1) through (4) 
of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: 
(i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date specified in the 
respective Annex.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6943 of October 17, 1996
Honoring the Filipino Veterans of World War II
A Proclamation
During the dark days of World War II, nearly 100,000 soldiers of the 
Philippine Commonwealth Army provided a ray of hope in the Pacific as 
they fought alongside United States and Allied forces for 4 long years 
to defend and reclaim the Philippine Islands from Japanese aggression. 
Thousands more Filipinos joined U.S. Armed Forces immediately after the 
war and served in occupational duty throughout the Pacific Theater. For 
their extraordinary sacrifices in defense of democracy and liberty, we 
owe them our undying gratitude.
Valiant Filipino soldiers fought, died, and suffered in some of the 
bloodiest battles of World War II, defending beleaguered Bataan and 
Corregidor, and thousands of Filipino prisoners of war endured the 
infamous Bataan Death March and years of captivity. Their many guerrilla 
actions slowed the Japanese takeover of the Western Pacific region and 
allowed U.S. forces the time to build and prepare for the allied 
counterattack on Japan. Filipino troops fought side-by-side with U.S. 
forces to secure their island nation as the strategic base from which 
the final effort to defeat Japan was launched.
This month, as we mark the anniversary of General MacArthur's return to 
the Philippines, we acknowledge the important role Filipino soldiers 
played in turning back aggression, defending liberty, and preserving 
democracy, and we extend to them our abiding thanks.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 20, 1996, as a day 
Honoring the Filipino Veterans of World War II. I urge all Americans to 
recall the courage, sacrifice, and loyalty of Filipino veterans of World 
War II and honor them for their contributions to our freedom.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6944 of October 21, 1996
National Forest Products Week, 1996
A Proclamation
For much of our Nation's history, forests, like other natural resources, 
were considered inexhaustible. In this century, we began to recognize 
that forests are a precious birthright for all Americans--not only for 
us and for our

[[Page 103]]

children, but also for future generations. As part of this recognition, 
we observe National Forest Products Week.
Forests are an important source of fuel and building materials, and they 
provide many valuable jobs. They also offer us unmatched recreational 
environments, as well as a spiritual refuge from city life. They provide 
essential habitat for myriad species of plants and animals, including 
hundreds that are endangered or threatened. Increasingly, their trees, 
shrubs, herbs, fungi, and microorganisms are yielding new and wondrous 
medicinal products and foods. And thanks to better planning and resource 
management that replace harvested lands with new forests, thousands of 
Americans will continue to earn their livelihood from our Nation's 
forests, even as we protect them. Today, the same citizens who are 
reaping the forests' bounty are personally and professionally involved 
in efforts to preserve it for future generations.
Government, citizens, and the forestry industry now work hand-in-hand in 
a new cooperative stewardship that emphasizes healthy, diverse, and 
sustainable forests. Using the best available science and complying with 
all current environmental laws, we are examining past and present forest 
management practices to find the best mix of resource use, conservation, 
and recycling that will ensure continued productivity. America must 
promote environmental responsibility and observe the highest possible 
standards of conservation to lead the way for other nations.
One of our most important tools in this endeavor is investment in forest 
research. Forest research is developing new wood products that extend 
raw material supplies, new technologies to extract and process wood 
products with less waste and fewer harmful byproducts, and new ways of 
reducing demand for forest raw materials through recycling. It is also 
unlocking the potential of forests to provide new products that will 
benefit people. With proper care, these lands can remain healthy, 
diverse, and resilient, capable of sustaining the lives--human and 
animal--that are dependent on them.
In recognition of the central role forests play in the long-term welfare 
of our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 163), has 
designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October each year 
as ``National Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and requested 
the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
commemoration.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 20 through October 26, 1996, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call upon the people of the United 
States to honor the vital role forests play in our national life and to 
observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6945 of October 21, 1996
National Consumers Week, 1996
A Proclamation
This year's theme for National Consumers Week is ``service signals 
success.'' Service is an indispensable element of success over the long 
term in both business and government: service that is responsive, 
convenient, and courteous, service that meets the expectations of 
consumers and taxpayers. Clever promotions and deceptive pricing may 
generate short-term profits in business. Promises alone may gain brief 
support for Government agencies and programs. But American consumers and 
taxpayers aren't easily deceived. They expect quality service, and those 
who cannot or do not provide it will ultimately fail.
That is why I added the right to service to the Consumer Bill of Rights. 
It is why we have made the reinvention of government--requiring more 
responsiveness and efficiency--a keystone of my Administration. It is 
why I issued an Executive Order that directed all executive departments 
and agencies of the Federal Government to embark upon a revolution to 
change the way they do business and establish and implement customer 
service standards that match or exceed the best in the private sector. 
And it is why our policies continue to emphasize the paramount 
importance of service excellence to the success of our Nation, our 
economy, and our efforts to compete in the global marketplace.
The goal of service excellence is not easy to attain. Consumers must 
demand it, and everyone in an organization, be it a business or a 
government agency, must be committed to it, both in everyday 
interactions and in longer-term goals. Their ultimate success depends on 
it.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 20 through 
October 26, 1996, as National Consumers Week. I call upon government 
officials, industry leaders, and the people of the United States to 
recognize the vital relationship between our economy and our citizenry 
and to support the right of all Americans to excellence in products and 
services.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6946 of October 24, 1996
United Nations Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Each year we dedicate a day to celebrate the United Nations because it 
represents America's commitment to an institution dedicated to the 
promotion of peace and freedom.
The United Nations was born at the end of World War II, as the 
international community sent representatives to San Francisco to sign 
the official charter. The world's sovereign countries came in search of 
peace, freedom, tolerance, and cooperation after a period when many 
worried that the world had lost these ideals forever. These ideals 
became--and still remain--the bedrock principles of the United Nations 
Charter. And although the United Nations has not yet realized all its 
founders' aspirations, these ideals now touch more people in more 
nations than ever before.
International cooperation--as exemplified by the work of the United 
Nations--offers the opportunity for nations to work together in 
addressing worldwide problems like ethnic, tribal, or interreligious 
disputes; famine, drought, or epidemics; natural disasters, war, or 
refugee crises. On United Nations Day, we recognize this unique 
institution's role in helping individual nations come together as a 
community to make life better for all people.
To be sure, as we celebrate its 51st anniversary, the U.N.'s challenges 
are very different from those the world faced at the close of World War 
II. But the challenges are real and substantial. There are, for example, 
still too many places in the world where failed ideologies increase the 
suffering of people rather than making their lives easier; where human 
rights and human dignity are not officially recognized; where nuclear 
weapons remain a threat to the world's security; where honest and 
impartial observers are needed to ensure free democratic elections; and 
where international expertise is needed to replace ecological damage 
with sustainable development.
Americans are justifiably proud of the role our country played in 
creating the United Nations as part of a network of global institutions 
intended to reduce the chances of war and economic depression. We 
continue to recognize that, in a world of increasing interdependence, 
the United States' engagement and leadership in the United Nations is as 
important now as it has ever been. We will also persist in our efforts 
to achieve the reforms necessary to ensure that the organization is 
prepared to meet the demands of a new era and that we as a Nation honor 
our commitments to our fellow members.
On this special day, as we honor and celebrate the work of the United 
Nations, let us renew our commitment and determination to work with our 
fellow members to maintain international peace and security, to strive 
for a higher quality of life, and to champion human rights for all 
peoples.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 1996, as 
United Nations Day. I encourage all Americans to acquaint themselves 
with the activities and accomplishments of the United Nations and to ob

[[Page 106]]

serve this day with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities 
furthering the goal of international cooperation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6947 of October 29, 1996
National Adoption Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Thousands of American children have never known what it is like to 
belong to a family--to grow up with the comfort and security that most 
of us take for granted. They are children whose parents, for a variety 
of reasons, are unable or unwilling to care for them. Instead, these 
children often find themselves drifting from home to home in foster 
care. They live every day without mothers or fathers to guide them, 
nurture them, and tell them that they are special.
Adoption is a commonsense solution that places children in permanent 
homes with parents who will offer them love and security. National 
Adoption Month is a time for all Americans to reflect on the rewards of 
joining children who need families with adults who seek the 
responsibilities and joys of parenthood. This month is an opportunity to 
celebrate family, especially families formed by adoptions.
Our Nation has no greater responsibility than to ensure that every child 
has the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. We can help 
meet that challenge by identifying a permanent, loving family for every 
child waiting in the foster care system.
Among the approximately 86,000 children who will await adoption within 
the next few years are tens of thousands with special needs. Many of 
these, through no fault of their own, wait years for adoption. Yet when 
these children are accepted into loving family environments, they can 
bring the same joy, affection, and love to their adoptive families as 
other children bring.
In recent years, we have made important strides in encouraging parents 
to adopt. I have signed legislation to help facilitate adoptions by 
prohibiting discrimination based on race or ethnicity in placement 
decisions, increasing the recruitment of adoptive parents, and providing 
a tax credit to families who adopt children.
Much remains to be done, however. As a Nation, we must continue to work 
to remove obstacles to adoption, to recruit new adoptive families, to 
offer financial incentives for placements, and to provide support to 
parents adopting children with special needs. Nothing should stand in 
the way of providing every boy and girl in America the permanent, loving 
home each of them deserves. Children are, after all, our country's most 
precious resource and our most important responsibility.

[[Page 107]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1996 as National 
Adoption Month. I urge the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate activities and programs and to participate in 
efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6948 of October 29, 1996
To Modify Provisions on Upland Cotton and for Other Purposes
A Proclamation
1. (a) Presidential Proclamation 6301 of June 7, 1991, implemented 
import quotas for upland cotton by adding U.S. note 6 and subheadings 
9903.52.01 through 9903.52.20 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``the HTS'').
    (b) U.S. note 6(a) to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS 
provides that whenever the Secretary of Agriculture (``the Secretary'') 
determines and announces that specified conditions relating to the price 
of upland cotton exist, there shall be in effect, as of the effective 
date of such announcement, a special import quota applicable to upland 
cotton purchased not later than 90 days after the effective date of the 
Secretary's announcement and entered into the United States not later 
than 180 days after such date. U.S. note 6(a) further provides that a 
new 180-day quota period may be established that overlaps any existing 
quota period announced under paragraph (a) of the note, unless a quota 
period has been established under paragraph (b) of the note.
    (c) Subheadings 9903.52.01 through 9903.52.20 cover entries of 
upland cotton under 20 consecutively numbered announcements by the 
Secretary pursuant to U.S. note 6(a). Thus, the 180-day effective period 
of a special upland cotton import quota established under a particular 
announcement may still be in effect when the same announcement number 
may be assigned with respect to a different but overlapping quota 
period.
    (d) To avoid such overlap, and to permit the effective 
administration of these quotas by the U.S. Customs Service, I have 
decided that it is necessary and appropriate to provide six additional 
HTS subheadings corresponding to six additional announcements by the 
Secretary.
2. (a) Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (``the NAFTA'') with respect to 
the United States and incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications 
and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.

[[Page 108]]

    (b) Article 303 of the NAFTA provides for the amount of customs 
duties that may be claimed as drawback on goods originating outside the 
NAFTA region that are traded between the NAFTA Parties. Article 307.2 of 
the NAFTA provides that each Party shall grant temporary duty-free 
admission to specified goods when imported from the territory of another 
Party, regardless of the origin of such goods, for repair or alteration. 
Among the modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex II to Proclamation 
6641 was a new paragraph (c) of U.S. note 1 to subchapter XIII of 
chapter 98 of the HTS, which was intended to give effect to the 
provisions of Articles 303 and 307.2 of the NAFTA insofar as they are 
applicable to articles to be repaired, altered, or processed that are 
admitted temporarily free of duty under bond. Such new paragraph (c) 
does not reflect clearly that the provisions of Article 307.2 of the 
NAFTA apply to goods imported from a NAFTA Party, regardless of their 
origin, for repair or alteration.
    (c) Accordingly, I have decided that it is appropriate to modify 
paragraph (c) of U.S. note 1 to subchapter XIII of chapter 98 of the HTS 
to clarify implementation of the provisions of Article 307.2 of the 
NAFTA.
    (d) Certain provisions set forth in Annexes to Proclamation 6641 
contain technical errors in the instructions for implementing particular 
modifications. To clarify the intent of the modifications previously 
proclaimed, I have decided to correct such technical errors.
3. (a) Sections 1102(a) and (e) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
Act of 1988 (``the 1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)) authorize the 
President to enter into trade agreements and to proclaim such 
modification or continuance of any existing duty, such continuance of 
existing duty-free or excise treatment or such additional duties, as he 
determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any such trade 
agreement. In addition, section 111(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements 
Act (``the URAA'') (19 U.S.C. 3521(a)) authorizes the President to 
proclaim such other modifications of any duty, such other staged rate 
reduction, or such additional duties as the President determines to be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out Schedule XX-United States of 
America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade 1994 (``Schedule XX''). Presidential Proclamation 6763 
of December 23, 1994, implemented with respect to the United States the 
trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
negotiations, including Schedule XX.
    (b) Certain provisions set forth in Annexes to Proclamation 6763 
contain technical errors in the instructions for implementing particular 
modifications. To clarify the intent of the modifications previously 
proclaimed, I have decided to correct such technical errors.
4. (a) Presidential Proclamation 6821 of September 12, 1995, established 
a tariff-rate quota on certain tobacco and eliminated tariffs on certain 
other tobacco by adding additional U.S. note 5 and various subheadings 
to chapter 24 of the HTS. Additional U.S. note 5 to chapter 24 of the 
HTS provides that the tariff-rate quota applies to the aggregate 
quantity of tobacco entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, under enumerated HTS subheadings from specified countries 
or areas, except that products of Canada, Israel, or Mexico are not 
permitted or included under such quantitative limitation. I intended 
that tobacco entered with claims of eligibility for the tariff treatment 
under any provision of chapter 98 of the HTS and tobacco entered for 
marketing to the ultimate consumer as hand-rolled ciga

[[Page 109]]

rettes would not be counted toward the in-quota quantity provided for in 
additional U.S. note 5 of the HTS.
    (b) I have decided, in order to clarify the status of such 
importations with respect to the tariff-rate quota, that it is 
appropriate to modify the provisions of additional U.S. note 5 to 
chapter 24 of the HTS to ensure that such goods are properly classified.
    (c) Certain provisions of the HTS were modified in Proclamation 6821 
to correct certain technical errors that were made in Proclamation 6763. 
However, an error was made in the spelling of a chemical in Annex II to 
Proclamation 6821, and I have decided to correct this error.
5. (a) Presidential Proclamation 6857 of December 11, 1995, implemented 
with respect to the United States modifications in the HTS that I 
determined were in conformity with the obligations of the United States 
under the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity 
Description and Coding System and did not run counter to the national 
economic interest of the United States.
    (b) Such proclamation also modified the rules of origin set out in 
the NAFTA in order to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment 
accorded under the NAFTA would continue to be given to NAFTA originating 
goods.
    (c) Certain provisions set forth in Annexes to Proclamation 6857 
contain technical errors in the instructions for implementing particular 
modifications. To clarify the intent of the modifications previously 
proclaimed, I have decided to correct such technical errors.
6. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``the 1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 604 
of the 1974 Act, sections 1102(a) and (e) and 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, 
sections 201 and 202 of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3331 and 3332), sections 111(a) and 423 of 
the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521 and 3621), and section 136(b) of the Federal 
Agriculture Improvement Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7236) do proclaim that:
    (1) Subheadings 9903.52.21 through 9903.52.26, as set forth in Annex 
I to this proclamation, are hereby inserted in numerical sequence in 
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS, and shall become effective with 
respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, as of the dates and under the terms that may be set forth 
in the Secretary's special quota announcements pertaining to such 
subheadings.
    (2) In order to clarify the intent of modifications previously 
proclaimed in certain Annexes to Proclamations 6641, 6763, 6821, and 
6857, the HTS and the Annexes to such proclamations are modified as 
provided in Annex II to this proclamation.
    (3) The modifications made by the Annexes to this proclamation shall 
be effective on the dates set forth in such Annexes.

[[Page 110]]

    (4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions and provisions of this 
proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (5) This proclamation shall be effective upon publication in the 
Federal Register.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6949 of October 29, 1996
National American Indian Heritage Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Throughout our history, American Indian and Alaska Native peoples have 
been an integral part of the American character. Against the odds, 
America's first peoples have endured, and they remain a vital cultural, 
political, social, and moral presence. Tribal America has brought to 
this great country certain values and ideas that have become ingrained 
in the American spirit: the knowledge that humans can thrive and prosper 
without destroying the natural environment; the understanding that 
people from very different backgrounds, cultures, religions, and 
traditions can come together to build a great country; and the awareness 
that diversity can be a source of strength rather than division.
As we celebrate American Indian Heritage Month this year, we take note 
of the injustices that have been suffered by American Indian people. 
Even today, few enjoy the full bounty of America's prosperity. But even 
as we look to the past, we must also look to the future. Along with 
other Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives will face new 
challenges in the coming century. We can ill afford to leave any of our 
people behind. Tribal America must figure as prominently in our future 
as it has in our past.
Let us rededicate ourselves to the principle that all Americans have the 
tools to make the most of their God-given potential. For Indian tribes 
and tribal members, this means that the authority of tribal governments 
must be accorded the respect and support to which they are entitled 
under the law. It means that American Indian children and youth must be 
provided a solid education and the opportunity to go on to college. It 
means that more must be done to stimulate tribal economies, create jobs, 
and increase economic opportunities.
Our bridge to the 21st century will rest upon the foundation we build 
today. We must teach our children about our past--both the good and the 
bad--so that they may learn from our successes and mistakes. We must 
provide our children with the knowledge and skills to permit them to 
surpass our own achievements and create a stronger, more united American 
community. We must provide them greater opportunity. It was the Iroquois 
who taught that in every deliberation we should consider the impact of 
our decisions on the next 7 generations.
In recognition of the important contributions of American Indian and 
Alaska Native peoples to our country and in light of the special legal 
relationship between the tribes and the Government of the United States, 
and obligations pursuant thereto, we celebrate National American Indian 
Heritage Month.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1996 as National 
American Indian Heritage Month. I urge all Americans, as well as their 
elected representatives at the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels,

[[Page 121]]

to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6950 of October 31, 1996
Veterans Day, 1996
A Proclamation
This Veterans Day, Americans enjoy the fruits of peace, freedom, and 
prosperity in a world where too many must still struggle to live their 
lives free from conflict, violence, and repression.
As leaders in the fight for liberty, we have sought to advance the cause 
of freedom and democracy to people all over the world. The credit for 
our own freedom, as well as our continued security, belongs 
overwhelmingly to the men and women who have served in our Nation's 
Armed Forces--our veterans. Had they not been there yesterday, were they 
not with us today, our world would be far different.
Today we salute their service, honor their sacrifice, thank them for 
supporting this Nation in every hour of need. And we acknowledge that 
freedom's cost continues long after the guns fall silent. Many of our 
veterans bear the disabilities and scars of military service. The 
families of others--who never returned from their service--live always 
with a profound sense of loss. It is our duty to remember what our 
veterans have done and to uphold our commitments to them and their 
families.
As we mark the past achievements of our veterans, let us remember that 
they are a vital part of our present and future. Of the 40 million who 
have served in America's military since the Revolutionary War, 26.5 
million are with us today--not distant historical footnotes, but as 
close as a father or mother, brother or sister, grandfather or 
grandmother, friend or neighbor.
Their tradition of service extends beyond the battlefield and the 
barracks. Most veterans in civilian life continue devoting their 
energies to the service of their country and communities. They are 
civic-minded role models who challenge and inspire our young people. 
They are volunteers who work for neighbors in need. They represent what 
is best in the American spirit.
That is why we must help them make the transition from military to 
civilian careers and empower them with the opportunities to use their 
training, discipline, and motivation in good and rewarding jobs. We owe 
them as well a guarantee that we will continue to defend the American 
ideals for which they have served and sacrificed. As the strongest force 
for peace and freedom in the world, we recognize our responsibility to 
maintain a military capability second to none.

[[Page 122]]

In respect and recognition of the contributions our service men and 
women have made in defense of America and to advance the cause of peace, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to recognize America's 
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, November 11, 1996, as Veterans Day. 
I urge all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our 
veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States and to encourage and participate in patriotic activities 
in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6952 of November 8, 1996
National Farm-City Week, 1996
A Proclamation
In 1840 Daniel Webster said, ``when tillage begins, other arts follow. 
The farmers therefore are the founders of human civilization.'' We pause 
each year at this time to express our gratitude to American farmers and 
the millions of Americans working in agriculture-related jobs, and we 
recognize the importance of agriculture and the essential role that 
farmers play in our national life. Intertwined with our national 
history, culture, and economy, American farms continuously sustain us 
and people around the world with rich produce and crops. Thanks to the 
professionalism and care of American farmers, we enjoy an abundance of 
quality and affordable food.
American agriculture is among our Nation's most vital industries, alone 
generating more than 15 percent of our gross domestic product. 
Bolstering our economy with a bounty of healthful foods, American 
agriculture supports more than 21 million jobs, and agriculture-related 
industries continue to expand, producing good, high-paying jobs and 
creating $1 trillion for the American economy each year.
The success of American agriculture is a testament to the benefits of 
farm-city partnerships that stretch all the way from the farmer to the 
consumer, with thousands of participants in between--researchers, 
extension agents, scientists, agribusiness companies, shippers, 
inspectors, processors, manufacturers, marketers and retailers, all 
helping to guarantee Americans a safe, abundant food supply. For more 
than 40 years, Americans have observed National Farm-City Week in 
celebration of these partnerships.
During National Farm-City Week, we celebrate Thanksgiving when Americans 
will gather around the dinner table to count our Nation's many 
blessings. Among them is America's agricultural richness and the 
collaboration between rural and urban communities that helps guarantee 
our rich quality of life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 22 through 
November 28, 1996, as National Farm-City Week. I call upon all 
Americans, in rural and urban communities alike, to join in recognizing 
the accomplishments of our farmers and all the hardworking individuals 
who cooperate to produce an abundance of affordable, quality 
agricultural goods that strengthen and enrich our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6953 of November 11, 1996
National Family Caregivers Week, 1996
A Proclamation
At this special time each year, we give thanks for our many blessings. 
Among those blessings are the quiet but heartfelt contributions made on 
a daily basis by our Nation's caregivers, particularly on behalf of the 
elderly in our society.
The true value of the role that caregivers play in the lives of 
America's families is immeasurable. Providing physical comfort and 
emotional reassurance, these strong and selfless people care for loved 
ones who can no longer care for themselves. The vast majority of 
caregivers are family members--often older relatives--and women provide 
most of the informal care that their families receive. Of the millions 
of people who provide informal care to older adults, over half are 
spouses or children. While many caregivers experience stress and 
frustration in fulfilling their caregiving responsibilities, and many 
sacrifice personal opportunities to care for a loved one, most regard 
the challenges of caregiving as a rewarding and satisfying experience.
By the year 2030, one in five Americans will be at least 65 years old, 
compared to one in eight today. In addition, the number of older 
Americans will double, from the present 34 million to about 69 million. 
At the same time that our population is aging, more older persons are 
suffering from chronic illnesses and face potentially disabling 
conditions. Moreover, individuals with lifelong disabilities are living 
longer and may require assistance in caring for themselves as they age. 
The overwhelming majority of older Americans would prefer to remain in 
their homes while growing older--even when no coordinated system of 
home- and community-based care is available. As a result, more Americans 
are becoming involved in caring for family members who want to age with 
dignity and respect.
This week, as we celebrate the contributions of caregivers to their 
families and communities, let us recognize the challenges these generous 
individuals must confront on a daily basis--challenges that include 
fulfilling multiple and often conflicting roles of caregiving for their 
aging relatives, caring for young children, and working outside their 
homes. Let us promote community programs and encourage workplace 
policies that help to lighten or share the burden of their caregiving 
responsibilities. And let us, as a Nation, recognize and commend the 
vital role they play in ensuring that older Americans age with grace, 
dignity, and a precious measure of independence.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 24 through 
November 30, 1996, as National Family Caregivers Week. I call upon 
Government officials, businesses, communities, volunteers, educators, 
and all the people of the United States to acknowledge the contributions 
made by caregivers this week and throughout the year.

Proclamation 6954 of November 11, 1996
Thanksgiving Day, 1996
A Proclamation
America's oldest tradition, Thanksgiving is also a reaffirmation of our 
most deeply held values; a public recognition that, in the words of 
Thomas Jefferson, ``God who gave us life gave us liberty.'' In gratitude 
for God's gift of freedom and ``for all the great and various favors 
which he hath been pleased to confer upon us,'' George Washington made 
Thanksgiving his first proclamation for the new Nation, and it is one we 
are privileged to renew each year.
Much has changed for America in the two centuries since that first 
Thanksgiving proclamation. Generations of hardworking men and women have 
cultivated our soil and worked the land, and today America's bounty 
helps feed the world. The promise of freedom that sustained our founders 
through the hardships of the Revolution and the first challenging days 
of nationhood has become a reality for millions of immigrants who left 
their homelands for a new life on these shores. And the light of that 
freedom now shines brightly in many nations that once lived in the 
shadows of tyranny and oppression.
But across the years, we still share an unbroken bond with the men and 
women who first proclaimed Thanksgiving in our land. Americans today 
still cherish the fresh air of freedom, in which we can raise our 
families and worship God as we choose without fear of persecution. We 
still rejoice in this great land and in the civil and religious liberty 
it offers to all. And we still--and always--raise our voices in prayer 
to God, thanking Him in humility for the countless blessings He has 
bestowed on our Nation and our people.
Let us now, this Thanksgiving Day, reawaken ourselves and our neighbors 
and our communities to the genius of our founders in daring to build the 
world's first constitutional democracy on the foundation of trust and 
thanks to God. Out of our right and proper rejoicing on Thanksgiving 
Day, let us give our own thanks to God and reaffirm our love of family, 
neighbor, and community. Each of us can be an instrument of blessing to 
those we touch this Thanksgiving Day--and every day of the year.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 28, 
1996, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of 
the United States to assemble in their homes, places of worship, or com

[[Page 126]]

munity centers to share the spirit of goodwill and prayer; to express 
heartfelt gratitude for the blessings of life; and to reach out in 
friendship to our brothers and sisters in the larger family of mankind.

November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and

Strip and Qualifying Industrial Zones
A Proclamation
1. Section 9(a) of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area 
Implementation Act of 1985, as amended (the ``Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2112 
note), authorizes the President to proclaim elimination or modification

determines is necessary to exempt any article of the West Bank or Gaza 
Strip or a qualifying industrial zone from duty.
2. Section 9(c) of the Act authorizes the President to proclaim that 
articles of Israel may be treated as though they were articles directly

Agreement (the ``Agreement'') even if shipped to the United States from 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone, if the 
articles otherwise meet the requirements of the Agreement.
3. Section 9(d) of the Act authorizes the President to proclaim that the 
cost or value of materials produced in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or 
a qualifying industrial zone may be included in the cost or value of 
materials produced in Israel under section 1(c)(i) of Annex 3 of the 
Agreement, and the direct costs of processing operations performed in 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a qualifying industrial zone may be 
included in the direct costs of processing operations performed in 
Israel under section 1(c)(ii) of Annex 3 of the Agreement.
4. Section 9(e) of the Act authorizes the President to specify areas 
that constitute qualifying industrial zones for purposes of the Act.
5. Pursuant to section 9(a) of the Act, I have determined that the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) should be modified 
to provide duty-free entry to qualifying articles that are the product 
of the West Bank or Gaza Strip or a qualifying industrial zone and are 
entered in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of the Act.
6. I have decided that articles of Israel may be treated as though they 
were articles directly shipped from Israel for the purposes of the 
Agreement even if shipped to the United States from the West Bank, the 
Gaza Strip, or a

[[Page 127]]

qualifying industrial zone, if the articles otherwise meet the 
requirements of the Agreement.
7. I have decided that the cost or value of materials produced in the

processing operations performed in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or a 
qualifying industrial zone may be included in the direct costs of 
processing operations performed in Israel under section 1(c)(ii) of 
Annex 3 of the Agreement.
8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that 
Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 301 
of title 3, United States Code, section 9 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2112 
note), and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483), do 
proclaim that:
    (1) In order to provide the tariff treatment being accorded under 
the Act, the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this 
proclamation.
    (2) I delegate to the United States Trade Representative the powers 
granted to me in section 9(e) of the Act to specify through notice in 
the Federal Register areas constituting qualifying industrial zones.
    (3) The modifications to the HTS made by the Annex shall be 
effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on and after the third day after the date of publication of 
this proclamation in the Federal Register.
    (4) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are

Proclamation 6956 of November 19, 1996
National Family Week, 1996
A Proclamation
Our families are among the great blessings we acknowledge each year at 
Thanksgiving.
The influence of the family is profound. Families provide essential 
nurturing and unconditional love; share their values, wisdom, and 
religious convictions; and give their members the hope and self-
confidence they need to succeed. They form the foundation from which our 
Nation draws its strength and upon which we build our national 
character.
If our country is to succeed in the 21st century and beyond, we must 
commit ourselves now to ensuring the health and well-being of the 
American family. Parents, educators, business, religious, and community 
leaders must work together to strengthen our Nation's families. 
Government policies at the Federal, State, and local levels must support 
families with compassion and a willingness to give all Americans the 
tools they need to make the most of their own lives.
We must create economic opportunity so that hardworking parents can 
provide for their children and succeed both at work and at home. We must 
give our families safe neighborhoods in which to grow, free from guns 
and gangs, drugs and violence. We must reinforce parents' efforts to set 
a good example by helping to protect their children from the corrosive 
influences of alcohol and tobacco and to limit their exposure to 
explicit sexuality and violence in the entertainment media.
In doing so, we will reaffirm the vital lessons of love, responsibility, 
and compassion that so many of us have been fortunate to learn in our 
own families, and ensure that those lessons are passed on to the 
generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 24 through 
November 30, 1996, as National Family Week. I call upon all Americans to 
celebrate our Nation's families with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6957 of November 21, 1996
National Great American Smokeout Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Every day, nearly 3,000 young Americans become regular smokers, falling 
victim to negative influences and provocative advertisements and putting 
themselves at risk of diseases caused by nicotine addiction. Nearly 
1,000 of these children will die prematurely and be among the more than 
400,000 Americans who lose their lives to tobacco-related illnesses each 
year. Smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable illness and 
premature death in our society. The use of tobacco is responsible for 
nearly one in five deaths in the United States, and we anticipate that, 
unless smoking rates decline immediately, more than 5 million people 
under the age of 18 today will die from a smoking-related disease. For a 
country so deeply devoted to the protection of our children, such 
numbers are a national tragedy.
Recognizing the urgent need to reverse these devastating statistics, my 
Administration has announced tough, unprecedented measures to limit 
children's access to tobacco products and to reduce tobacco's appeal to 
children. In support of these efforts, I am pleased to join the millions 
of caring citizens who are observing the ``Great American Smokeout,'' an 
annual, nationwide effort to help millions of Americans give up tobacco 
and to raise awareness of nicotine addiction and the deadly risks 
associated with tobacco use.
Twenty years ago the American Cancer Society organized the first 
nationwide Great American Smokeout. Through the Society's leadership, 
the event has helped millions of Americans to stop smoking by proving to 
them that, if they can quit for a day, they can quit for a lifetime. In 
recent years the focus of the Great American Smokeout has broadened to 
include efforts to help our young people understand that they should 
never start smoking in the first place.
Since the inception of the Great American Smokeout, the smoking rate of 
American adults has dropped from 36 percent to 25 percent. Nonetheless, 
tobacco use continues to take an unacceptable toll. This year, 177,000 
new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed. Moreover, even as the number 
of adult smokers has declined, the use of tobacco among children is 
rising.
On this 20th anniversary of the Smokeout, local offices of the American 
Cancer Society are hosting a variety of events, including the Great 
American SmokeScream for middle school students, the Great American 
Smokeout Pledge for high school students, and the launching of an 
exciting and interactive Internet web page for teenagers.
The Great American Smokeout is an opportunity for all Americans to renew 
their commitment to a smoke-free environment for themselves and 
particularly for their children. Working together on this day and every 
day throughout the year, we can create a brighter, healthier future for 
all Americans--young and old.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitu

[[Page 133]]

tion and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21, 
1996, as National Great American Smokeout Day. I call upon all Americans 
to join together in an effort to educate our children about the dangers 
of tobacco use, and I urge smokers and nonsmokers alike to take this 
opportunity to begin healthier lifestyles that set a positive example 
for young people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6958 of November 22, 1996
Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Are 
Members or Officials of the Sudanese Government or Armed Forces
A Proclamation
In light of the refusal of the Government of Sudan to comply with United 
Nations Security Council Resolution 1044 of January 31, 1996, and in 
furtherance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1054 of April 
26, 1996, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interests 
of the United States to restrict the entry into the United States of 
aliens described in paragraph 3 of United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1054 and in section 1 of this proclamation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by the power vested in me as 
President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, 
including sections 212(f) and 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185), and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant 
and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in 
section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided for in section 
2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the interests of the United 
States. I therefore, do proclaim that:
Section 1. The entry into the United States as immigrants and 
nonimmigrants of members of the Government of Sudan, officials of that 
Government, and members of the Sudanese armed forces, is hereby 
suspended.
Sec. 2. Section 1 shall not apply with respect to any person otherwise 
covered by section 1 where the entry of such person would not be 
contrary to the interests of the United States.
Sec. 3. Persons covered by section 1 and 2 shall be identified by the 
Secretary of State.
Sec. 4. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to restrict the 
entry of Sudanese officials coming to the United States on official 
business of the

[[Page 134]]

United Nations other than in a manner consistent with the obligations of 
the United States to the United Nations.
Sec. 5. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in 
effect until such time as the Secretary of State determines that it is 
no longer necessary and should be terminated.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of State is hereby authorized to implement this 
proclamation pursuant to such procedures as he may establish.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-first.

Proclamation 6959 of November 26, 1996
World AIDS Day, 1996
A Proclamation
We dedicate World AIDS Day to the memory of those we have lost to HIV 
and AIDS and to our quest to help those who are living with this 
disease. The theme of this ninth observance of World AIDS Day, ``One 
World, One Hope,'' reminds us that AIDS is a global pandemic and that 
HIV recognizes no geographic boundaries. Today, an estimated 21.8 
million adults and children worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, and we 
anticipate that as many as 3 million more will become infected with HIV 
in this year alone.
Of the almost 6 million men, women, and children around the world who 
have died of AIDS, more than 330,000 have been Americans. Each day, 100 
of our fellow citizens lose their lives to this disease, and nearly 200 
more are diagnosed with AIDS. The threat that HIV and AIDS pose to our 
Nation and the world has demanded a national response involving 
government, industry, communities, families, and individuals. We have 
put our best scientific minds to work on research, and our most talented 
public health professionals have strived to prevent the spread of this 
epidemic. Parents, teachers, clergy, and other civic leaders have worked 
together to educate and protect young people and other groups who are so 
vulnerable to--and devastated by--the scourge of HIV and AIDS.
At long last, this investment of our time, attention, and resources in 
science and public health has begun to pay dividends. The past 12 months 
have offered us reasons for real hope and optimism after so many years 
of sadness and despair. New treatments, approved in record time, are 
showing remarkable results in arresting the development of HIV disease 
and are beginning to improve the health of those who are living with the 
virus. We have worked hard to provide access to these promising 
treatments for as many people as possible. We have tripled funding for 
AIDS drug assistance programs, and we have increased support for the 
Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act by 30 percent 
during the past 12 months. We have also preserved the Medicaid program, 
which provides

[[Page 135]]

care to more than half of Americans living with AIDS, including more 
than 90 percent of the children with AIDS.
We are heartened by our success in reducing the risk of perinatal 
transmission of HIV from mother to child. For the first time since this 
epidemic began in 1981, we have seen an actual reduction in the number 
of infants born with HIV. It is within our grasp to virtually eradicate 
pediatric HIV disease by the end of this century. Our efforts to prevent 
other types of HIV transmission are also showing signs of progress. But 
we must remain vigilant to the continuing need for prevention, reducing 
the number of new infections year by year until the day when we can 
eliminate this disease.
As we move forward in this battle, we do so with renewed hope for the 
future. Let us observe World AIDS Day by intensifying our search for an 
end to the epidemic, for a cure for those who are living with HIV and 
AIDS, and for a vaccine to protect all citizens of the world from this 
relentless killer. And let us reaffirm our commitment to protecting the 
rights of all those who are living with HIV.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 1996, as World 
AIDS Day, and I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other territories subject to the jurisdiction 
of the United States, and the American people to join me in reaffirming 
our commitment to combating HIV and AIDS and to reach out to those 
living with this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and

Proclamation 6960 of November 27, 1996
National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 1996
A Proclamation
Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol is a scourge on our 
society that we cannot ignore or treat lightly. Drunk and drugged 
driving has no geographic limits; it is a problem that afflicts cities 
and rural areas alike in every region of our country. And, most 
disturbing of all, it is a growing problem--last year, alcohol-related 
traffic deaths increased for the first time in a decade. Each of us and 
our loved ones are at risk of becoming victims of a driver impaired by 
drugs or alcohol. However, we can solve this problem if we make a 
national commitment to do so.
Two months ago, we charted a course that demands that those who drive 
must assume the responsibility of staying sober and drug-free behind the 
wheel. Targeting our youngest drivers first, we began by requiring, as a

[[Page 136]]

condition of receiving Federal highway funds, that every State pass a 
law making it illegal for anyone under 21 to drive with alcohol in their 
bloodstream.
Now, we must take the next step toward ridding our highways of drunk 
drivers.
Drivers between 21 and 34 years of age are most likely to drive under 
the influence of alcohol or other mind-altering drugs. We must not only 
redouble our efforts to educate those in this age group about the 
terrible risks posed by drunk and drugged driving, but we must also 
strengthen our law enforcement efforts to make clear that this behavior 
will not be tolerated.
Addressing impaired driving by teens and young adults is important but, 
unfortunately, is not enough to solve the problem. No age group is 
immune to the temptation to drive under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs. Through peer pressure and education, we must convince all who 
would get behind the wheel drunk or drugged to change their behavior.
All of us can do our part to reduce the tragic loss of life and limb 
caused by drunk and drugged drivers. Parents can thoughtfully and 
candidly discuss the dangers with their children who drive; more States 
can pass Zero Tolerance laws; more citizens can prevent friends or 
acquaintances from getting behind the wheel while under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol; and more of us can volunteer to be ``designated 
drivers,'' pledged to abstain from alcohol when we are with others who 
might be drinking. By making clear that drunk and drugged driving is 
unacceptable and by resolving firmly to stop it, we can prevent 
thousands of tragic deaths and injuries each year.
I ask all Americans to observe a special day of remembrance of the 
victims of drunk and drugged driving by participating this year in 
``National Lights on for Life Day.'' On Friday, December 20, I ask that 
drivers nationwide keep their headlights illuminated to call attention 
to this threat to the health and safety of our citizens. And I ask that 
we rededicate ourselves as a Nation to preventing drunk and drugged 
driving in our communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1996 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to 
recognize the dangers of impaired driving; to take responsibility for 
themselves and others around them; to stop anyone under the influence of 
alcohol or drugs from getting behind the wheel of a vehicle; and to help 
teach our young people about the lifesaving benefits of safe driving 
habits.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6961 of November 28, 1996
To Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Broom 
Corn Brooms
A Proclamation
1. On July 2, 1996, the United States International Trade Commission 
(``USITC'') made an affirmative determination in its investigation under 
section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``Trade Act'')(19 
U.S.C. 2252), with respect to imports of broom corn brooms provided for 
in heading 9603 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(``HTS''). Under section 202 of the Trade Act, the USITC determined that 
such brooms are being imported into the United States in such increased 
quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the 
domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article. 
Further, the USITC found, pursuant to section 311(a) of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (``the NAFTA 
Implementation Act'')(19 U.S.C. 3371(a)), that imports of such brooms 
produced in Mexico, considered individually, account for a substantial 
share of total imports of broom corn brooms and contribute importantly 
to the serious injury caused by imports, but that such brooms produced 
in Canada do not so account or contribute. The USITC's determination and 
its recommendations to address the serious injury were reported to me on 
August 1, 1996.
2. On August 30, 1996, I determined, pursuant to section 312(a) of the 
NAFTA Implementation Act (19 USC 3372(a)), that imports of broom corn 
brooms from Mexico, considered individually, account for a substantial 
share of total imports and contribute importantly to the serious injury 
caused by imports; but that imports of broom corn brooms from Canada do 
not so account or contribute. Acting pursuant to section 203 of the 
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), I determined to take appropriate and 
feasible action within my power that will facilitate efforts by the 
domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to competition from 
imports of broom corn brooms. I further determined that action would not 
be implemented at that time and directed the United States Trade 
Representative (``USTR'') to negotiate and conclude, within 90 days, 
agreements pursuant to the terms of section 203(a)(3)(E) of the Trade 
Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(3)(E)) concerning broom corn brooms exported to 
the United States, and to carry out any agreements reached. Moreover, I 
determined that, not later than the end of this 90-day period (November 
28, 1996), I would implement action of a type described in section 
203(a)(3). Such negotiations were undertaken by the USTR but have failed 
to achieve satisfactory agreements concerning such brooms exported to 
the United States.
3. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and after 
taking into account the considerations specified in section 203(a)(2) of 
the Trade Act, I have determined to implement action of a type described 
in section 203(a)(3). Such action shall take the form of an increase in, 
or imposition of, any duty on imported brooms (except whisk brooms), 
wholly or in part of broom corn and provided for in HTS subheading 
9603.10.50 and, with respect to imports that exceed certain specified 
annual levels, HTS subheading 9603.10.60. Such increase in, or 
imposition of, duty on

[[Page 138]]

such goods shall be effective for a three-year period, and shall apply 
to imports from all countries, except Canada and Israel and developing 
countries that account for less than three percent of the relevant 
imports over a recent representative period. Pursuant to section 
203(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)(A)), I have further 
determined that these actions will facilitate efforts by the domestic 
industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide 
greater economic and social benefits than costs.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 203 
and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
    (1)(a) In order to apply to specified broom corn brooms (except 
whisk brooms) that are either produced in Mexico or goods of Mexico 
under the terms of general note 12 to the HTS for purposes of the NAFTA, 
or that are products of countries other than Canada or Israel and other 
than countries enumerated in general note 4(a) to the HTS as that note 
existed on November 28, 1996 (except as otherwise specified), the 
foregoing goods classifiable under HTS subheading 9603.10.50, rates of 
duty other than those specified for such subheadings in the rates of 
duty column 1 of the HTS during the three-year period beginning on the 
effective date of this proclamation, the HTS is modified as provided in 
section A of the Annex to this proclamation.
      (b) During the period from November 28, 1996, through November 27, 
1999, inclusive, the symbol ``MX'' in parentheses following the ``Free'' 
rate of duty in the special subcolumn of rates of duty column 1 of the 
HTS for subheading 9603.10.50 shall be deleted. Upon the close of 
November 27, 1999, such symbol ``MX'' shall be reinserted in subheading 
9603.10.50 in alphabetical sequence in the parentheses following the 
``Free'' rate of duty in the special subcolumn of HTS rates of duty 
column 1, unless the actions taken in this proclamation are earlier 
expressly modified or terminated.
      (c) In order to provide that such goods of Mexico under the terms 
of general note 12 shall be subject to a NAFTA rate of duty during the 
period from November 28, 1999, through December 31, 2004, inclusive, the 
HTS is further modified as provided in section B of the Annex to this 
proclamation.
    (2) In order to establish tariff-rate quotas for brooms classifiable 
in HTS subheading 9603.10.60 (except such brooms that are the product of 
Israel or goods of Canada under the terms of general note 12 to the HTS) 
during the period from November 28, 1996, through November 27, 1999, 
inclusive, the HTS is further modified as provided in section C of the 
Annex to this proclamation.
    (3)(a) All broom corn brooms (except whisk brooms) the product of 
designated beneficiary countries under the CBERA and the ATPA pursuant 
to HTS general note 7(a) and general note 11(a), respectively, the 
foregoing

[[Page 139]]

goods classifiable under HTS subheadings 9603.10.50 and 9603.10.60, 
shall cease to be accorded duty-free entry into the customs territory of 
the United States during the period from November 28, 1996, through the 
close of November 27, 1999, inclusive, except as provided in section C 
of the Annex to this proclamation.
      (b) During the time period specified in paragraph (3)(a), the 
symbols ``E,'' and ``J,'' in parentheses following the ``Free'' rate of 
duty in the special subcolumn of rates of duty column 1 of the HTS for 
subheadings 9603.10.50 and 9603.10.60 shall be deleted. Upon the close 
of November 27, 1999, such symbols ``E,'' and ``J,'' shall be reinserted 
in such subheadings in alphabetical sequence in the parentheses 
following the ``Free'' rate of duty in the special subcolumn of HTS 
rates of duty column 1, and eligible goods the product of designated 
CBERA and ATPA beneficiary countries shall again be accorded duty-free 
entry into the customs territory of the United States without 
quantitative limitation, unless the actions taken in this proclamation 
are earlier expressly modified or terminated.
    (4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (5) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, 
including the Annex thereto, shall be effective with respect to goods 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 
a.m. on November 28, 1996, as provided in the Annex to this 
proclamation, unless such actions are earlier expressly modified or 
terminated.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6962 of December 2, 1996
To Implement the United States-Israel Agreement on Trade in Agricultural 
Products
A Proclamation
1. On April 22, 1985, the United States entered into the Agreement on 
the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of Israel (``the FTA 
Agreement''), approved by the Congress in the United States-Israel Free 
Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (``the FTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2112 
note).
2. The United States and Israel acknowledge that they have differing 
interpretations as to the meaning of certain rights and obligations in 
the FTA Agreement, in particular with respect to market access for 
certain United States agricultural products. In order to maintain the 
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with 
respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on November 4, 1996, the 
Government of the United States entered into an agreement with the 
Government of Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural 
products, effective December 4, 1996, through December 31, 2001 (``the 
1996 Agreement'').
3. Section 4(b) of the FTA Act provides that, whenever the President 
determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
provided for by the FTA Agreement, the President may proclaim such 
withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or 
such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such 
additional duties as the President determines to be required or 
appropriate to carry out the FTA Agreement.
4. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the FTA Act, I have determined that it is 
necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and 
mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel, to provide 
through the close of December 31, 2001, access into the United States 
customs territory for specified quantities of certain agricultural 
products of Israel free of duty or certain fees or other import charges.
5. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483)(``the 1974 
Act''), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (``HTS'') the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 4 of 
the FTA Act and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do hereby proclaim:

    (1) In order to implement aspects of the 1996 Agreement with the 
Government of Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural 
products, the HTS is modified as provided in the Annex to this 
proclamation.

[[Page 146]]

    (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (3) The modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set 
forth in such Annex, and the tariff treatment set forth therein shall be 
effective as provided in such Annex through December 31, 2001.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6963 of December 5, 1996
National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Fifty-five years ago, on a calm Hawaiian morning, Imperial Japan 
launched a surprise attack against the U.S. Armed Forces stationed at 
Pearl Harbor, shattering the peace of our land and drawing America into 
World War II. The assault of December 7, 1941, lasted only two hours, 
but it killed or injured almost 3,600 Americans, destroyed a major 
portion of our Nation's Pacific Fleet, and damaged more than 325 
aircraft, severely weakening our air power.
The attack jolted our Nation and forced us into a war unlike any 
previous conflict, waged across the globe in places most Americans had 
never heard of, in dense jungles and on an ocean we once thought too 
large for an enemy to cross. It was a war that would require 
unparalleled courage and determination from soldier and civilian alike, 
and all Americans rose to the monumental challenge.
During this time, our Nation stood united in purpose and in spirit as 
never before. Millions of brave and patriotic men and women served the 
Armed Forces in the struggle for freedom; millions of others sacrificed 
on the home front. On farms and in factories, mines, and shipyards, 
Americans labored around the clock to supply the food, weapons, and 
equipment needed to win the war. In our homes, schools, and places of 
worship, Americans from every walk of life prayed and worked together 
for victory. And--as a powerful testament to America's resilience--
battleships damaged at Pearl Harbor returned to service and helped break 
the back of the Japanese fleet.
The generation that fought World War II came home to build new careers 
and communities and made America the richest, freest nation in history. 
Some men and women remained in uniform, safeguarding our liberties and 
ensuring that tyranny would never again threaten our shores. In peace, 
this generation vowed never again to be unprepared and gave our Nation 
the security and progress that we have known and cherished for over 50 
years.
This is the precious legacy bestowed on us by the men and women of the 
World War II generation. We can best honor their deeds of courage and 
determination by maintaining their vigil in defense of freedom and 
striving, as they did, to make the world a better place for all its 
peoples.
As we mark the 55th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, let us 
remember in prayer all those who died on that day and throughout World 
War II. Let us also honor all World War II veterans and their families, 
those who lost loved ones, and those who worked on the home front. 
Finally, let us give thanks once again for the peace and freedom secured 
by their service and their sacrifice.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, has designated December 7, 1996, as 
``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 1996, as National Pearl

[[Page 151]]

Harbor Remembrance Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in honor of the 
Americans who served at Pearl Harbor. I also ask all Federal departments 
and agencies, organizations, and individuals to fly the flag of the 
United States at halfstaff on this day in honor of those Americans who 
died as a result of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6964 of December 10, 1996
Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week
A Proclamation
When America's founders crafted the Constitution and Bill of Rights more 
than two centuries ago, they not only created a blueprint for the 
conduct of American government, but they also gave expression to a 
vision of human dignity that inspires people to this day the world over. 
Our Nation's commitment to the freedoms enumerated in the Bill of 
Rights--among them freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, and the 
right to due process and a fair trial--serves as a beacon of hope to 
oppressed peoples everywhere.
Americans continue to work to improve our application of equality under 
the law for all our own citizens, as we believe that freedom and justice 
are the birthright of humankind. We are also working daily to foster and 
promote the growth of these rights in other countries. Indeed, the 
championing of democracy and human rights serves as a cornerstone of my 
Administration's foreign policy.
As we observe Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights 
Week, we can take satisfaction in our progress in advancing human rights 
around the world in the past decade. In fact, more than half the people 
in the world now live under democratic political systems. Even in 
countries still struggling to establish basic human rights and freedoms, 
we are seeing some progress. And brave reformers such as Aung San Suu 
Kyi of Burma continue to press their rightful demand for freedom.
It is also encouraging that, with the growth and development of the 
human rights movement, there has been greater awareness and appreciation 
that women's rights are human rights.
Just over a year ago, representatives from 189 countries met in Beijing 
at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women. That historic 
gathering focused the attention of the world on women's rights and 
needs. Now, we are beginning to see some progress. In many countries, 
increasing numbers of women are contesting and attaining public office 
and playing a vital role in shaping the political agenda. In Romania, 
women gathered

[[Page 152]]

from around Central and Eastern Europe to promote the goals of the 
Beijing women's conference. Thailand has passed a new anti-prostitution 
law. Women in Namibia are now afforded equal rights with men in 
marriage. Chile has made a serious commitment to expanding educational 
opportunities for girls. And in the United States, the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act, that I signed into law in September of 
1994, reflects our profound national commitment to ending abuse against 
women. These are just a few hopeful signs of improvement in global 
respect for women's rights, and it is fitting that we celebrate them.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1996, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 1996, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 1996, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to celebrate these observances with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that demonstrate our 
national commitment to the Constitution and the promotion of human 
rights for all people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6965 of December 13, 1996
Wright Brothers Day, 1996
A Proclamation
Ninety-three years ago, on a windswept North Carolina beach, air travel 
by hot air balloon and gliders gave way to American ingenuity and the 
era of powered flight. Wilbur and Orville Wright--employing innovations 
like the wind tunnel and single component testing--designed, built, and 
ultimately flew the first powered, heavier-than-air craft on the dunes 
of Kitty Hawk. Years later, Wilbur was to say of this historic event, 
``It is the complexity of the flying problem that makes it so difficult. 
It is not . . . solved by stumbling upon a secret, but by the patient 
accumulation of information upon a hundred different points.'' No longer 
would the ability to travel by air be bounded by the simple physics of 
wind and weather, but by the power of the human imagination.
As we have expanded the scope of our dreams, our love of flight has 
extended our command of the sky. Today, air travel is not only the 
fastest means of transportation, but the safest as well, and the United 
States air transportation system, which continues to improve every year, 
serves as the model to which all others are compared.
My Administration continues to work to make the skies ever safer. 
Integral to this effort has been the dedicated service of thousands of 
men and women throughout the air transportation community who strive 
daily to

[[Page 153]]

protect air travelers. Indeed, this month, the Vice President and I were 
pleased to announce that the major airlines have agreed to install fire 
detection systems in the cargo holds of some 3,700 airliners that carry 
the vast majority of Americans flying each year. We cannot make the 
world risk free, but we can reduce the risks we face. Working together, 
we have taken another important step to ensure the safety of the flying 
public.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of Federal aid for our Nation's 
airports. Working in partnership with State and local governments, 
private airport operators, and the air carrier and general aviation 
communities, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assisted 
numerous airports with critical safety, security, and capacity projects 
that directly benefit the American traveling public. It is particularly 
fitting, as Americans celebrate an important milestone in the history of 
air transportation, that this year also marks the beginning of important 
reforms for the FAA that recognize its vital role in advancing sound 
aviation management and development in the United States and around the 
world.
On April 1, 1996, the FAA began transforming itself from the model 
previously mandated by law into a more effective, streamlined system, 
better designed for the challenges of the twenty-first century. In the 
recently enacted Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, the 
Congress, working with my Administration, complemented those important 
reforms with a new financial model for the agency to help it meet the 
safety and capacity challenges it faces. This legislation also provided 
the FAA with improved tools to perform its mission more effectively. It 
builds on security recommendations of the Vice President's Commission on 
Aviation Safety and Security that will improve the FAA's ability to more 
comprehensively address the threat posed by terrorists to civil air 
transportation. With these statutory improvements, the world of aviation 
will be an exciting one in which future aviation pioneers may fulfill 
their dreams and aspirations.

Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue 
annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to 
observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 1996, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and

Executive Order 12985 of January 11, 1996
Establishing the Armed Forces Service Medal
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including my authority as 
Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, it is 
hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment. There is hereby established the Armed Forces 
Service Medal with accompanying ribbons and appurtenances, for award to 
members of the Armed Forces of the United States who, on or after June 
1, 1992, in the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: (a) Participate, 
or have participated, as members of United States military units in a 
United States military operation in which personnel of any Armed Force 
participate that is deemed to be significant activity; and
    (b) Encounter no foreign armed opposition or imminent hostile 
action.

Sec. 2. Approval and Award. The medal, with ribbons and appurtenances, 
shall be of an appropriate design approved by the Secretary of Defense 
and shall be awarded by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating 
as a service in the Navy, under uniform regulations, as prescribed by 
the Secretary of Defense. The regulations shall place the Armed Forces 
Service Medal in an order of precedence immediately before the 
Humanitarian Service Medal.
Sec. 3. Criteria. The medal shall be awarded only for operations for 
which no other United States service medal is approved. For operations 
in which personnel of only one Military Department or the Coast Guard 
participate, the medal shall be awarded only if there is no other 
suitable award available to the department or the Coast Guard. No more 
than one medal shall be awarded to any one person, but for each 
succeeding operation justifying such award a suitable device may be 
awarded to be worn on the medal or ribbon as prescribed by appropriate 
regulations.
Sec. 4. Posthumous Provision. The medal may be awarded posthumously and, 
when so awarded, may be presented to such representative of the de

<R05>
Executive Order 12988 of February 5, 1996
Civil Justice Reform
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, and in order to improve access to justice for all 
persons who wish to avail themselves of court and administrative 
adjudicatory tribunals to resolve disputes, to facilitate the just and 
efficient resolution of civil claims involving the United States 
Government, to encourage the filing of only meritorious civil claims, to 
improve legislative and regulatory drafting to reduce needless 
litigation, to promote fair and prompt adjudication before 
administrative tribunals, and to provide a model for similar reforms of 
litigation practices in the private sector and in various states, it is 
hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Guidelines to Promote Just and Efficient Government Civil 
Litigation. To promote the just and efficient resolution of civil 
claims, those Federal agencies and litigation counsel that conduct or 
otherwise participate in civil litigation on behalf of the United States 
Government in Federal court shall respect and adhere to the following 
guidelines during the conduct of such litigation:
    (a) Pre-filing Notice of a Complaint. No litigation counsel shall 
file a complaint initiating civil litigation without first making a 
reasonable effort to notify all disputants about the nature of the 
dispute and to attempt to achieve a settlement, or confirming that the 
referring agency that previously handled the dispute has made a 
reasonable effort to notify the disputants and to achieve a settlement 
or has used its conciliation processes.
    (b) Settlement Conferences. As soon as practicable after 
ascertaining the nature of a dispute in litigation, and throughout the 
litigation, litigation counsel shall evaluate settlement possibilities 
and make reasonable efforts to settle the litigation. Such efforts shall 
include offering to participate in a settlement conference or moving the 
court for a conference pursuant to

[[Page 158]]

Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in an attempt to resolve 
the dispute without additional civil litigation.
    (c) Alternative Methods of Resolving the Dispute in Litigation. 
Litigation counsel shall make reasonable attempts to resolve a dispute 
expeditiously and properly before proceeding to trial.
      (1) Whenever feasible, claims should be resolved through informal 
discussions, negotiations, and settlements rather than through 
utilization of any formal court proceeding. Where the benefits of 
Alternative Dispute Resolution (``ADR'') may be derived, and after 
consultation with the agency referring the matter, litigation counsel 
should suggest the use of an appropriate ADR technique to the parties.
      (2) It is appropriate to use ADR techniques or processes to 
resolve claims of or against the United States or its agencies, after 
litigation counsel determines that the use of a particular technique is 
warranted in the context of a particular claim or claims, and that such 
use will materially contribute to the prompt, fair, and efficient 
resolution of the claims.
      (3) To facilitate broader and effective use of informal and formal 
ADR methods, litigation counsel should be trained in ADR techniques.
    (d) Discovery. To the extent practical, litigation counsel shall 
make every reasonable effort to streamline and expedite discovery in 
cases under counsel's supervision and control.
      (1) Review of Proposed Document Requests. Each agency within the 
executive branch shall establish a coordinated procedure for the conduct 
and review of document discovery undertaken in litigation directly by 
that agency when that agency is litigation counsel. The procedure shall 
include, but is not necessarily limited to, review by a senior lawyer 
prior to service or filing of the request in litigation to determine 
that the request is not cumulative or duplicative, unreasonable, 
oppressive, unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the 
requirements of the litigation, the amount in controversy, the 
importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and whether the 
documents can be obtained from some other source that is more 
convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.
      (2) Discovery Motions. Before petitioning a court to resolve a 
discovery motion or petitioning a court to impose sanctions for 
discovery abuses, litigation counsel shall attempt to resolve the 
dispute with opposing counsel. If litigation counsel makes a discovery 
motion concerning the dispute, he or she shall represent in that motion 
that any attempt at resolution was unsuccessful or impracticable under 
the circumstances.
    (e) Sanctions. Litigation counsel shall take steps to seek sanctions 
against opposing counsel and opposing parties where appropriate.
      (1) Litigation counsel shall evaluate filings made by opposing 
parties and, where appropriate, shall petition the court to impose 
sanctions against those responsible for abusive practices.
      (2) Prior to filing a motion for sanctions, litigation counsel 
shall submit the motion for review to the sanctions officer, or his or 
her designee, within the litigation counsel's agency. Such officer or 
designee shall be a senior supervising attorney within the agency, and 
shall be licensed to practice law before a State court, courts of the 
District of Columbia, or courts of any territory or Commonwealth of the 
United States. The sanctions officer or

[[Page 159]]

designee shall also review motions for sanctions that are filed against 
litigation counsel, the United States, its agencies, or its officers.
    (f) Improved Use of Litigation Resources. Litigation counsel shall 
employ efficient case management techniques and shall make reasonable 
efforts to expedite civil litigation in cases under that counsel's 
supervision and control. This includes but is not limited to:
      (1) making reasonable efforts to negotiate with other parties 
about, and stipulate to, facts that are not in dispute;
      (2) reviewing and revising pleadings and other filings to ensure 
that they are accurate and that they reflect a narrowing of issues, if 
any, that has resulted from discovery;
      (3) requesting early trial dates where practicable;
      (4) moving for summary judgment in every case where the movant 
would be likely to prevail, or where the motion is likely to narrow the 
issues to be tried; and
      (5) reviewing and revising pleadings and other filings to ensure 
that unmeritorious threshold defenses and jurisdictional arguments, 
resulting in unnecessary delay, are not raised.
Sec. 2. Government Pro Bono and Volunteer Service. All Federal agencies 
should develop appropriate programs to encourage and facilitate pro bono 
legal and other volunteer service by government employees to be 
performed on their own time, including attorneys, as permitted by 
statute, regulation, or other rule or guideline.
Sec. 3. Principles To Enact Legislation and Promulgate Regulations Which 
Do Not Unduly Burden the Federal Court System. 
    (a)  General Duty to Review Legislation and Regulations. Within 
current budgetary constraints and existing executive branch coordination 
mechanisms and procedures established in OMB Circular A-19 and Executive 
Order No. 12866, each agency promulgating new regulations, reviewing 
existing regulations, developing legislative proposals concerning 
regulations, and developing new legislation shall adhere to the 
following requirements:
      (1) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be 
reviewed by the agency to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity;
      (2) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be 
written to minimize litigation; and
      (3) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall 
provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a 
general standard, and shall promote simplification and burden reduction.
    (b) Specific Issues for Review. In conducting the reviews required 
by subsection (a), each agency formulating proposed legislation and 
regulations shall make every reasonable effort to ensure:
      (1) that the legislation, as appropriate--
        (A) specifies whether all causes of action arising under the law 
are subject to statutes of limitations;
        (B) specifies in clear language the preemptive effect, if any, 
to be given to the law;

[[Page 160]]

        (C) specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal 
law, if any, including all provisions repealed, circumscribed, 
displaced, impaired, or modified;
        (D) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct;
        (E) specifies whether private arbitration and other forms of 
private dispute resolution are appropriate under enforcement and relief 
provisions; subject to constitutional requirements;
        (F) specifies whether the provisions of the law are severable if 
one or more of them is found to be unconstitutional;
        (G) specifies in clear language the retroactive effect, if any, 
to be given to the law;
        (H) specifies in clear language the applicable burdens of proof;
        (I) specifies in clear language whether it grants private 
parties a right to sue and, if so, the relief available and the 
conditions and terms for authorized awards of attorney's fees, if any;
        (J) specifies whether State courts have jurisdiction under the 
law and, if so, whether and under what conditions an action would be 
removable to Federal court;
        (K) specifies whether administrative proceedings are to be 
required before parties may file suit in court and, if so, describes 
those proceedings and requires the exhaustion of administrative 
remedies;
        (L) sets forth the standards governing the assertion of personal 
jurisdiction, if any;
        (M) defines key statutory terms, either explicitly or by 
reference to other statutes that explicitly define those terms;
        (N) specifies whether the legislation applies to the Federal 
Government or its agencies;
        (O) specifies whether the legislation applies to States, 
territories, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealths of Puerto 
Rico and of the Northern Mariana Islands;
        (P) specifies what remedies are available such as money damages, 
civil penalties, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees; and
        (Q) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and 
general draftsmanship of legislation set forth by the Attorney General, 
with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (``OMB'') and after consultation with affected agencies, that are 
determined to be in accordance with the purposes of this order.
      (2) that the regulation, as appropriate--
        (A) specifies in clear language the preemptive effect, if any, 
to be given to the regulation;
        (B) specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal 
law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed, 
circumscribed, displaced, impaired, or modified;
        (C) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather 
than a general standard, while promoting simplification and burden 
reduction;

[[Page 161]]

        (D) specifies in clear language the retroactive effect, if any, 
to be given to the regulation;
        (E) specifies whether administrative proceedings are to be 
required before parties may file suit in court and, if so, describes 
those proceedings and requires the exhaustion of administrative 
remedies;
        (F) defines key terms, either explicitly or by reference to 
other regulations or statutes that explicitly define those items; and
        (G) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and 
general draftsmanship of regulations set forth by the Attorney General, 
with the concurrence of the Director of OMB and after consultation with 
affected agencies, that are determined to be in accordance with the 
purposes of this order.
    (c) Agency Review. The agencies shall review such draft legislation 
or regulation to determine that either the draft legislation or 
regulation meets the applicable standards provided in subsections (a) 
and (b) of this section, or it is unreasonable to require the particular 
piece of draft legislation or regulation to meet one or more of those 
standards.
Sec. 4. Principles to Promote Just and Efficient Administrative 
Adjudications.
    (a) Implementation of Administrative Conference Recommendations. In 
order to promote just and efficient resolution of disputes, an agency 
that adjudicates administrative claims shall, to the extent reasonable 
and practicable, and when not in conflict with other sections of this 
order, implement the recommendations of the Administrative Conference of 
the United States, entitled ``Case Management as a Tool for Improving 
Agency Adjudication,'' as contained in 1 C.F.R. 305.86-7 (1991).
    (b) Improvements in Administrative Adjudication. All Federal 
agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes and 
develop specific procedures to reduce delay in decision-making, to 
facilitate self-representation where appropriate, to expand non-lawyer 
counseling and representation where appropriate, and to invest maximum 
discretion in fact-finding officers to encourage appropriate settlement 
of claims as early as possible.
    (c) Bias. All Federal agencies should review their administrative 
adjudicatory processes to identify any type of bias on the part of the 
decision-makers that results in an injustice to persons who appear 
before administrative adjudicatory tribunals; regularly train all fact-
finders, administrative law judges, and other decision-makers to 
eliminate such bias; and establish appropriate mechanisms to receive and 
resolve complaints of such bias from persons who appear before 
administrative adjudicatory tribunals.
    (d) Public Education. All Federal agencies should develop effective 
and simple methods, including the use of electronic technology, to 
educate the public about its claims/benefits policies and procedures.
Sec. 5. Coordination by the Department of Justice.
    (a) The Attorney General shall coordinate efforts by Federal 
agencies to implement sections 1, 2 and 4 of this order.
    (b) To implement the principles and purposes announced by this 
order, the Attorney General is authorized to issue guidelines 
implementing sec

[[Page 162]]

tions 1 and 4 of this order for the Department of Justice. Such 
guidelines shall serve as models for internal guidelines that may be 
issued by other agencies pursuant to this order.
Sec. 6. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
    (a) The term ``agency'' shall be defined as that term is defined in 
section 105 of title 5, United States Code.
    (b) The term ``litigation counsel'' shall be defined as the trial 
counsel or the office in which such trial counsel is employed, such as 
the United States Attorney's Office for the district in which the 
litigation is pending or a litigating division of the Department of 
Justice. Special Assistant United States Attorneys are included within 
this definition. Those agencies authorized by law to represent 
themselves in court without assistance from the Department of Justice 
are also included in this definition, as are private counsel hired by 
any Federal agency to conduct litigation on behalf of the agency or the 
United States.
Sec. 7. No Private Rights Created. This order is intended only to 
improve the internal management of the executive branch in resolving 
disputes, conducting litigation in a reasonable and just manner, and 
reviewing legislation and regulations. This order shall not be construed 
as creating any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, 
its officers, or any other person. This order shall not be construed to 
create any right to judicial review involving the compliance or 
noncompliance of the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any 
other person with this order. Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to obligate the United States to accept a particular settlement or 
resolution of a dispute, to alter its standards for accepting 
settlements, to forego seeking a consent decree or other relief, or to 
alter any existing delegation of settlement or litigating authority.
Sec. 8. Scope. 
    (a) No Applicability to Criminal Matters or Proceedings in Foreign 
Courts. This order is applicable to civil matters only. It is not 
intended to affect criminal matters, including enforcement of criminal 
fines or judgments of criminal forfeiture. This order does not apply to 
litigation brought by or against the United States in foreign courts or 
tribunals.
    (b) Application of Notice Provision. Notice pursuant to subsection 
(a) of section 1 is not required (1) in any action to seize or forfeit 
assets subject to forfeiture or in any action to seize property; (2) in 
any bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship, receivership, or 
liquidation proceeding; (3) when the assets that are the subject of the 
action or that would satisfy the judgment are subject to flight, 
dissipation,or destruction; (4) when the defendant is subject to flight; 
(5) when, as determined by litigation counsel, exigent circumstances 
make providing such notice impracticable or such notice would otherwise 
defeat the purpose of the litigation, such as in actions seeking 
temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctive relief; or (6) in 
those limited classes of cases where the Attorney General determines 
that providing such notice would defeat the purpose of the litigation.
    (c) Additional Guidance as to Scope. The Attorney General shall have 
the authority to issue further guidance as to the scope of this order, 
except section 3, consistent with the purposes of this order.

[[Page 163]]

Sec. 9. Conflicts with Other Rules. Nothing in this order shall be 
construed to require litigation counsel or any agency to act in a manner 
contrary to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Tax Court Rules of 
Practice and Procedure, State or Federal law, other applicable rules of 
practice or procedure, or court order.
Sec. 10. Privileged Information. Nothing in this order shall compel or 
authorize the disclosure of privileged information, sensitive law 
enforcement information, information affecting national security, or 
information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law.
Sec. 11. Effective Date. This order shall become effective 90 days after 
the date of signature. This order shall not apply to litigation 
commenced prior to the effective date.
Sec. 12. Revocation. Executive Order No. 12778 is hereby revoked.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    February 5, 1996.
                                                                EO 12989
<R05>
Executive Order 12989 of February 13, 1996
Economy and Efficiency in Government Procurement Through Compliance With 
Certain Immigration and Naturalization Act Provisions
This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government 
procurement. Stability and dependability are important elements of 
economy and efficiency. A contractor whose work force is less stable 
will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and 
efficiently than a contractor whose work force is more stable. It 
remains the policy of this Administration to enforce the immigration 
laws to the fullest extent, including the detection and deportation of 
illegal aliens. In these circumstances, contractors cannot rely on the 
continuing availability and service of illegal aliens, and contractors 
that choose to employ unauthorized aliens inevitably will have a less 
stable and less dependable work force than contractors that do not 
employ such persons. Because of this Administration's vigorous 
enforcement policy, contractors that employ unauthorized alien workers 
are necessarily less stable and dependable procurement sources than 
contractors that do not hire such persons. I find, therefore, that 
adherence to the general policy of not contracting with providers that 
knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers will promote economy and 
efficiency in Federal procurement.
NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration 
and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority 
vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United 
States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is 
hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring 
goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient 
administration

[[Page 164]]

and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies 
should not contract with employers that have not complied with section 
274A(a)(1)(A) and 274A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A), 1324a(a)(2)) (the ``INA employment provisions'') 
prohibiting the unlawful employment of aliens. All discretion under this 
Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.
    (b) It remains the policy of this Administration to fully and 
aggressively enforce the antidiscrimination provisions of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act to the fullest extent. Nothing in this 
order relieves employers from their obligation to avoid unfair 
immigration-related employment practices as required by the 
antidiscrimination provisions of section 1324(b) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 
1324b) and all other antidiscrimination requirements of applicable law, 
including the requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(6) concerning the 
treatment of certain documentary practices as unfair immigration-related 
employment practices.
Sec. 2. Contractor, as used in this Executive order, shall have the same 
meaning as defined in subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
Sec. 3. Using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), 
the Attorney General: (a) may investigate to determine whether a 
contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with 
the INA employment provisions;
    (b) shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any 
entity covered under section 3(a) of this order where such complaints 
allege noncompliance with the INA employment provisions; and
    (c) shall hold such hearings as are required under 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e) 
to determine whether an entity covered under section 3(a) is not in 
compliance with the INA employment provisions.
Sec. 4. (a) Whenever the Attorney General determines that a contractor 
or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA 
employment provisions, the Attorney General shall transmit that 
determination to the appropriate contracting agency and such other 
Federal agencies as the Attorney General may determine. Upon receipt of 
such determination from the Attorney General, the head of the 
appropriate contracting agency shall consider the contractor or an 
organizational unit thereof for debarment as well as for such other 
action as may be appropriate in accordance with the procedures and 
standards prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
    (b) The head of the contracting agency may debar the contractor or 
an organizational unit thereof based on the determination of the 
Attorney General that it is not in compliance with the INA employment 
provisions. The Attorney General's determination shall not be reviewable 
in the debarment proceedings.
    (c) The scope of the debarment generally should be limited to those 
organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Attorney General 
finds are not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.
    (d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year and may be 
extended for additional periods of 1 year if, using the procedures 
established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Attorney General 
determines that the organizational unit of the Federal contractor 
continues to be in violation of the INA employment provisions.

<R05>
Executive Order 12993 of March 21, 1996
Administrative Allegations Against Inspectors General
Certain executive branch agencies are authorized to conduct 
investigations of allegations of wrongdoing by employees of the Federal 
Government. For certain administrative allegations against Inspectors 
General (``IGs'') and, as explained below, against certain staff members 
of the Offices of Inspectors General (``OIGs''), it is desirable to 
authorize an independent investigative mechanism.
The Chairperson of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency 
(``PCIE'') and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency 
(``ECIE''), in consultation with members of the Councils, has 
established an Integrity

[[Page 172]]

Committee pursuant to the authority granted by Executive Order No. 
12805.
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure that 
administrative allegations against IGs and certain staff members of the 
OIGs are appropriately and expeditiously investigated and resolved, it 
is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. The Integrity Committee. (a) To the extent permitted by law, 
and in accordance with this order, the Integrity Committee shall 
receive, review, and refer for investigation allegations of wrongdoing 
against IGs and certain staff members of the OIGs.
    (b) The Integrity Committee shall consist of at least the following 
members:
      (1) The official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'') 
serving on the PCIE, as designated by the Director of the FBI. The FBI 
member shall serve as Chair of the Integrity Committee.
      (2) The Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel;
      (3) The Director of the Office of Government Ethics;
      (4) Three or more IGs, representing both the PCIE and the ECIE, 
appointed by the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE.
    (c) The Chief of the Public Integrity Section of the Criminal 
Division of the Department of Justice, or his designee, shall serve as 
an advisor to the Integrity Committee with respect to its 
responsibilities and functions in accordance with this order.
Sec. 2. Referral of Allegations. (a) The Integrity Committee shall 
review all allegations of wrongdoing it receives against an IG who is a 
member of the PCIE or ECIE, or against a staff member of an OIG acting 
with the knowledge of the IG or when the allegation against the staff 
person is related to an allegation against the IG, except that where an 
allegation concerns a member of the Integrity Committee, that member 
shall recuse himself from consideration of the matter.
    (b) An IG shall refer any administrative allegation against a senior 
staff member to the Integrity Committee when:
      (1) review of the substance of the allegation cannot be assigned 
to an agency of the executive branch with appropriate jurisdiction over 
the matter; and
      (2) the IG determines that an objective internal investigation of 
the allegation, or the appearance thereof, is not feasible.
    (c) The Integrity Committee shall determine if there is a 
substantial likelihood that the allegation, referred to it under 
paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, discloses a violation of any law, 
rule or regulation, or gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds or 
abuse of authority and shall refer the allegation to the agency of the 
executive branch with appropriate jurisdiction over the matter. However, 
if a potentially meritorious administrative allegation cannot be 
referred to an agency of the executive branch with appropriate 
jurisdiction over the matter, the Integrity Committee shall certify the 
matter to its Chair, who shall cause a thorough and timely investigation 
of the allegation to be conducted in accordance with this order.

[[Page 173]]

    (d) If the Integrity Committee determines that an allegation does 
not warrant further action, it shall close the matter without referral 
for investigation and notify the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE of its 
determination.
Sec. 3. Authority to Investigate. (a) The Director of the FBI, through 
his designee serving as Chairperson of the Integrity Committee, is 
authorized and directed to consider and, where appropriate, to 
investigate administrative allegations against the IGs and, in limited 
cases as described in sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, against other staff 
members of the OIGs, when such allegations cannot be assigned to another 
agency of the executive branch and are referred by the Integrity 
Committee pursuant to section 2(c) of this order.
    (b) At the request of the Director of the FBI, through his designee 
serving as Chairperson, heads of agencies and entities represented in 
the PCIE and ECIE may, to the extent permitted by law, provide resources 
necessary to the Integrity Committee. Employees from those agencies and 
entities will be detailed to the Integrity Committee, subject to the 
control and direction of the Chairperson, to conduct an investigation 
pursuant to section 2(c): Provided, that such agencies or entities shall 
be reimbursed by the agency or entity employing the subject of the 
investigation. Reimbursement for any costs associated with the detail 
shall be consistent with applicable law, including but not limited to 
the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535 and 1536), and subject to the 
availability of funds.
    (c) Nothing in the above delegation shall augment, diminish, or 
otherwise modify any existing responsibilities and authorities of any 
other executive branch agency.
Sec. 4. Results of Investigation. (a) The report containing the results 
of the investigation conducted under the supervision of the Chair of the 
Integrity Committee shall be provided to the members of the Integrity 
Committee for consideration.
    (b) With respect to those matters where the Integrity Committee has 
referred an administrative allegation to an agency of the executive 
branch with appropriate jurisdiction over the matter, the head of that 
agency shall provide a report to the Integrity Committee concerning the 
scope and results of the inquiry.
    (c) The Integrity Committee shall assess the report received under 
(a) or (b) of this section and determine whether the results require 
forwarding of the report, with Integrity Committee recommendations, to 
the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE for resolution. If the Integrity 
Committee determines that the report requires no further referral or 
recommendations, it shall so notify the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE.
    (d) Where the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE determines that 
dissemination of the report to the head of the subject's employing 
agency or entity is appropriate, the head of the agency or entity shall 
certify to the Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE within sixty 60 days that he 
has personally reviewed the report, what action, if any, has been or is 
to be taken, and when any action taken will be completed. The PCIE/ECIE 
Chairperson may grant the head of the entity or agency a 30-day 
extension when circumstances necessitate such extension.
    (e) The Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE shall report to the Integrity 
Committee the final disposition of the matter, including what action, if 
any, has

[[Page 174]]

been or is to be taken by the head of the subject's employing agency or 
entity. When the Integrity Committee receives notice of the final 
disposition, it shall advise the subject of the investigation that the 
matter referred to the Integrity Committee for review has been closed.
Sec. 5. Procedures. (a) The Integrity Committee, in conjunction with the 
Chairperson of the PCIE/ECIE, shall establish the policies and 
procedures necessary to ensure consistency in conducting investigations 
and reporting activities under this order.
    (b) Such policies and procedures shall specify the circumstances 
under which the Integrity Committee, upon review of a complaint 
containing allegations of wrongdoing, may determine that an allegation 
is without merit and therefore the investigation is unwarranted. A 
determination by the Integrity Committee that an investigation is 
unwarranted shall be considered the Integrity Committee's final 
disposition of the complaint.
    (c) The policies and procedures may be expanded to encompass other 
issues related to the handling of allegations against IGs and others 
covered by this order.
Sec. 6. Records Maintenance. All records created and received pursuant 
to this order are records of the Integrity Committee and shall be 
maintained by the FBI.
Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve the 
internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to 
create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 
law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or 
any person.

enjoy a quality of life that promotes independence, self-determination,

The achievement of these goals will require the most effective possible 
use of public and private resources.

mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System (``Refuge System'') is to

Sec. 2. Guiding Principles. To help ensure a bright future for its

System:
    (a) Public Use. The Refuge System provides important opportunities 
for compatible wildlife-dependent recreational activities involving 
hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and 
environmental education and interpretation.
    (b) Habitat. Fish and wildlife will not prosper without high-quality 
habitat, and without fish and wildlife, traditional uses of refuges 
cannot be sustained. The Refuge System will continue to conserve and 
enhance the quality and diversity of fish and wildlife habitat within 
refuges.
    (c) Partnerships. America's sportsmen and women were the first 
partners who insisted on protecting valuable wildlife habitat within 
wildlife refuges. Conservation partnerships with other Federal agencies, 
State agencies, Tribes, organizations, industry, and the general public 
can make significant contributions to the growth and management of the 
Refuge System.
    (d) Public Involvement. The public should be given a full and open 
opportunity to participate in decisions regarding acquisition and 
management of our National Wildlife Refuges.
Sec. 3. Directives to the Secretary of the Interior. To the extent 
consistent with existing laws and interagency agreements, the Secretary 
of the Interior, in carrying out his trustee and stewardship 
responsibilities for the Refuge System, is directed to:
    (a) recognize compatible wildlife-dependent recreational activities 
involving hunting, fishing, wildlife observation and photography, and 
environmental education and interpretation as priority general public 
uses of the Refuge System through which the American public can develop 
an appreciation for fish and wildlife;

[[Page 179]]

    (b) provide expanded opportunities for these priority public uses 
within the Refuge System when they are compatible and consistent with 
sound principles of fish and wildlife management, and are otherwise in 
the public interest;
    (c) ensure that such priority public uses receive enhanced attention 
in planning and management within the Refuge System;
    (d) provide increased opportunities for families to experience 
wildlife-dependent recreation, particularly opportunities for parents 
and their children to safely engage in traditional outdoor activities, 
such as fishing and hunting;
    (e) ensure that the biological integrity and environmental health of 
the Refuge System is maintained for the benefit of present and future 
generations of Americans;
    (f) continue, consistent with existing laws and interagency 
agreements, authorized or permitted uses of units of the Refuge System 
by other Federal agencies, including those necessary to facilitate 
military preparedness;
    (g) plan and direct the continued growth of the Refuge System in a 
manner that is best designed to accomplish the mission of the Refuge 
System, to contribute to the conservation of the ecosystems of the 
United States, and to increase support for the Refuge System and 
participation from conservation partners and the public;
    (h) ensure timely and effective cooperation and collaboration with 
Federal agencies and State fish and wildlife agencies during the course 
of acquiring and managing National Wildlife Refuges;
    (i) ensure appropriate public involvement opportunities will be 
provided in conjunction with refuge planning and management activities; 
and
    (j) identify, prior to acquisition, existing compatible wildlife-
dependent uses of new refuge lands that shall be permitted to continue 
on an interim basis pending completion of comprehensive planning.
Sec. 4. Judicial Review. This order does not create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a 
party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any 
person.

<R05>
Executive Order 12999 of April 17, 1996
Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the 
Next Century
In order to ensure that American children have the skills they need to 
succeed in the information-intensive 21st century, the Federal 
Government is committed to working with the private sector to promote 
four major developments in American education: making modern computer 
technology an integral part of every classroom; providing teachers with 
the professional development they need to use new technologies 
effectively; connecting classrooms to the National Information 
Infrastructure; and encouraging the creation of excellent educational 
software. This Executive order streamlines the transfer of excess and 
surplus Federal computer equipment to our Nation's classrooms and 
encourages Federal employees to volunteer their time and expertise to 
assist teachers and to connect classrooms.
Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the 
provisions of

[[Page 181]]

the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 
U.S.C. 3701 et seq.), the Federal Property and Administrative Services 
Act of 1949, ch. 288, 63 Stat. 377, and the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law 104-106, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Protection of Educationally Useful Federal Equipment. (a) 
Educationally useful Federal equipment is a vital national resource. To 
the extent such equipment can be used as is, separated into parts for 
other computers, or upgraded--either by professional technicians, 
students, or other recycling efforts--educationally useful Federal 
equipment is a valuable tool for computer education. Therefore, to the 
extent possible, all executive departments and agencies (hereinafter 
referred to as ``agencies'') shall protect and safeguard such equipment, 
particularly when declared excess or surplus, so that it may be recycled 
and transferred, if appropriate, pursuant to this order.
Sec. 2. Efficient Transfer of Educationally Useful Federal Equipment to 
Schools and Nonprofit Organizations. (a) To the extent permitted by law, 
all agencies shall give highest preference to schools and nonprofit 
organizations, including community-based educational organizations, 
(``schools and nonprofit organizations'') in the transfer, through gift 
or donation, of educationally useful Federal equipment.
    (b) Agencies shall attempt to give particular preference to schools 
and nonprofit organizations located in the Federal enterprise 
communities and empowerment zones established in the Omnibus 
Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103-66.
    (c) Each agency shall, to the extent permitted by law and where 
appropriate, identify educationally useful Federal equipment that it no 
longer needs and transfer it to a school or nonprofit organization by:
      (1) conveying research equipment directly to the school or 
organization pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 3710(i); or
      (2) reporting excess equipment to the General Services 
Administration (GSA) for donation when declared surplus in accordance 
with section 203(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services 
Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 484(j). Agencies shall report such 
equipment as far as possible in advance of the date the equipment 
becomes excess, so that GSA may attempt to arrange direct transfers from 
the donating agency to recipients eligible under this order.
    (d) In transfers made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
title shall transfer directly from the agency to the schools or 
nonprofit organizations as required by 15 U.S.C. 3710(i). All such 
transfers shall be reported to the GSA. At the direction of the 
recipient institution or organization, and if appropriate, transferred 
equipment may be conveyed initially to a nonprofit reuse or recycling 
program that will upgrade it before transfer to the school or nonprofit 
organization holding title.
    (e) All transfers to schools or nonprofit organizations, whether 
made directly or through GSA, shall be made at the lowest cost to the 
school or nonprofit organization permitted by law.
    (f) The availability of educationally useful Federal equipment shall 
be made known to eligible recipients under this order by all practicable 
means, including newspaper, community announcements, and the Internet.

[[Page 182]]

    (g) The regional Federal Executive Boards shall help facilitate the 
transfer of educationally useful Federal equipment from the agencies 
they represent to recipients eligible under this order.
Sec. 3. Assisting Teachers' Professional Development: Connecting 
Classrooms. (a) Each agency that has employees who have computer 
expertise shall, to the extent permitted by law and in accordance with 
the guidelines of the Office of Personnel Management, encourage those 
employees to:
      (1) help connect America's classrooms to the National Information 
Infrastructure;
      (2) assist teachers in learning to use computers to teach; and
      (3) provide ongoing maintenance of and technical support for the 
educationally useful Federal equipment transferred pursuant to this 
order.
    (b) Each agency described in subsection (a) shall submit to the 
Office of Science and Technology Policy, within 6 months of the date of 
this order, an implementation plan to advance the developments described 
in this order, particularly those required in this section. The plan 
shall be consistent with approved agency budget totals and shall be 
coordinated through the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
    (c) Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to bar a recipient of 
educationally useful Federal equipment from lending that equipment, 
whether on a permanent or temporary basis, to a teacher, administrator, 
student, employee, or other designated person in furtherance of 
educational goals.
Sec. 4. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: (a) ``Schools'' 
means individual public or private education institutions encompassing 
prekindergarten through twelfth grade, as well as public school 
districts.
    (b) ``Community-based educational organizations'' means nonprofit 
entities that are engaged in collaborative projects with schools or that 
have education as their primary focus. Such organizations shall qualify 
as nonprofit educational institutions or organizations for purposes of 
section 203(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act 
of 1949, as amended.
    (c) ``Educationally useful Federal equipment'' means computers and 
related peripheral tools (e.g., printers, modems, routers, and servers), 
including telecommunications and research equipment, that are 
appropriate for use in prekindergarten, elementary, middle, or secondary 
school education. It shall also include computer software, where the 
transfer of licenses is permitted.
    (d) ``Nonprofit reuse or recycling program'' means a 501(c) 
organization able to upgrade computer equipment at no or low cost to the 
school or nonprofit organization taking title to it.
    (e) ``Federal Executive Boards,'' as defined in 5 C.F.R. Part 960, 
are regional organizations of each Federal agency's highest local 
officials.
Sec. 5. This order shall supersede Executive Order No. 12821 of November 
16, 1992.
Sec. 6. Judicial Review. This order is not intended, and should not be 
construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable

[[Page 183]]

at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, 
or its employees.

the Act (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board (``Board''). There is 
established effective May 8, 1996, a Board of three members to be 
appointed by the President to investigate the dispute. No member shall 
be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad 
employees or any railroad carrier. The Board shall perform its functions 
subject to the availability of funds.
Sec. 2. Report. The Board shall report to the President with respect to 
the dispute within 30 days of its creation.
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 10 of the Act, 
from the date of the creation of the Board and for 30 days after the 
Board has made its report to the President, no change, except by 
agreement of the parties shall be made by the railroads or the employees 
in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.
Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of the Board are 
records of the Office of the President and upon the Board's termination 
shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation 
Board.
Sec. 5. Expiration. The Board shall terminate upon the submission of the 
report provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this order.

the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) (the ``Act'').
In the judgment of the National Mediation Board, these disputes threaten 
substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree that would 
deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service.
NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 10 of 
the Act (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board (``Board''). There is 
established effective May 17, 1996, a Board of three members to be 
appointed by the President to investigate the disputes. No member shall 
be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad 
employees or any railroad carrier. The Board shall perform its functions 
subject to the availability of funds.
Sec. 2. Report. The Board shall report to the President with respect to 
the dispute within 30 days of its creation.
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 10 of the Act, 
from the date of the creation of the Board and for 30 days after the 
Board has made its report to the President, no change, except by 
agreement of the parties, shall be made by the railroads or the 
employees in the conditions out of which the disputes arose.
Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of the Board are 
records of the Office of the President and upon the Board's termination 
shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation 
Board.

[[Page 191]]

Sec. 5. Expiration. The Board shall terminate upon the submission of the 
report provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this order.

Executive Order 13005 of May 21, 1996
Empowerment Contracting
In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, it is 
necessary to secure broad-based competition for Federal contracts. This

[[Page 193]]

broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of 
potential contractors capable of producing quality goods and services at 
competitive prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for 
expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation's 
economically distressed communities.
Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed 
communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses 
for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal 
procurement and help to empower those communities. Fostering growth of 
long-term viable contractors will be promoted by offering appropriate 
incentives to qualified businesses.
Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 486(a) 
of title 40, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United 
States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
 Section 1. Policy. The purpose of this order is to strengthen the 
economy and to improve the efficiency of the Federal procurement system 
by encouraging business development that expands the industrial base and 
increases competition.
 Sec. 2. Empowerment Contracting Program. In consultation with the 
Secretaries of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Labor, 
and Defense; the Administrator of General Services; the Administrator of 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Administrator of 
the Small Business Administration; and the Administrator for Federal 
Procurement Policy, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall 
develop policies and procedures to ensure that agencies, to the extent 
permitted by law, grant qualified large businesses and qualified small 
businesses appropriate incentives to encourage business activity in 
areas of general economic distress, including a price or an evaluation 
credit, when assessing offers for government contracts in unrestricted 
competitions, where the incentives would promote the policy set forth in 
this order. In developing such policies and procedures, the Secretary 
shall consider the size of the qualified businesses.
 Sec. 3. Monitoring and Evaluation. The Secretary shall:
    (a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and 
procedures developed in accordance with this order;
    (b) develop a process to ensure the proper administration of the 
program and to reduce the potential for fraud by the intended 
beneficiaries of the program;
    (c) develop principles and a process to evaluate the effectiveness 
of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order; 
and
    (d) by December 1 of each year, issue a report to the President on 
the status and effectiveness of the program.
 Sec. 4. Implementation Guidelines. In implementing this order, the 
Secretary shall:
    (a) issue rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement 
this order, including a requirement for the periodic review of the 
eligibility of qualified businesses and distressed areas;

[[Page 194]]

    (b) draft all rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to 
implement this order within 90 days of the date of this order; and
    (c) ensure that all policies and procedures and all rules, 
regulations, and guidelines adopted and implemented in accordance with 
this order minimize the administrative burden on affected agencies and 
the procurement process.
 Sec. 5. Definitions. For purposes of this Executive order:
    (a) ``Agency'' means any authority of the United States that is an 
``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be 
independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).
    (b) ``Area of general economic distress'' shall be defined, for all 
urban and rural communities, as any census tract that has a poverty rate 
of at least 20 percent or any designated Federal Empowerment Zone, 
Supplemental Empowerment Zone, Enhanced Enterprise Community, or 
Enterprise Community. In addition, the Secretary may designate as an 
area of general economic distress any additional rural or Indian 
reservation area after considering the following factors:
      (1) Unemployment rate;
      (2) Degree of poverty;
      (3) Extent of outmigration; and
      (4) Rate of business formation and rate of business growth.
    (c) ``Qualified large business'' means a large for-profit or not-
for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number of 
residents from the area of general economic distress; and (2) either has 
a significant physical presence in the area of general economic distress 
or has a direct impact on generating significant economic activity in 
the area of general economic distress.
    (d) ``Qualified small business'' means a small for-profit or not-
for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number of 
residents from the area of general economic distress; (2) has a 
significant physical presence in the area of general economic distress; 
or (3) has a direct impact on generating significant economic activity 
in the area of general economic distress.
    (e) ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Commerce.
 Sec. 6. Agency Authority. Nothing in this Executive order shall be 
construed as displacing the agencies' authority or responsibilities, as 
authorized by law, including specifically other programs designed to 
promote the development of small or disadvantaged businesses.
 Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This Executive order does not create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a 
party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its 
officers or employees, or any other person.

<R05>
Executive Order 13006 of May 21, 1996
Locating Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Nation's 
Central Cities
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the National Historic 
Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) and the Public Buildings 
Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2505), and in furtherance of and 
consistent with Executive Order No. 12072 of August 16, 1978, and 
Executive Order No. 11593 of May 13, 1971, it is hereby ordered as 
follows:
 Section 1. Statement of Policy. Through the Administration's community 
empowerment initiatives, the Federal Government has undertaken various 
efforts to revitalize our central cities, which have historically served 
as the centers for growth and commerce in our metropolitan areas. 
Accordingly, the Administration hereby reaffirms the commitment set 
forth in Executive Order No. 12072 to strengthen our Nation's cities by 
encouraging the location of Federal facilities in our central cities. 
The Administration also reaffirms the commitments set forth in the 
National Historic Preservation Act to provide leadership in the 
preservation of historic resources, and in the Public Buildings 
Cooperative Use Act of 1976 to acquire and utilize space in suitable 
buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance.
To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and maintain, wherever 
operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties 
and districts, especially those located in our central business areas. 
When implementing these policies, the Federal Government shall institute 
practices and procedures that are sensible, understandable, and 
compatible with current authority and that impose the least burden on, 
and provide the maximum benefit to, society.
 Sec. 2. Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities on Historic 
Properties in Our Central Cities. When operationally appropriate and 
economically prudent, and subject to the requirements of section 601 of 
title VI of the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
3122), and Executive Order No. 12072, when locating Federal facilities, 
Federal agencies shall give first consideration to historic properties 
within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then Federal 
agencies shall consider other developed or undeveloped sites within 
historic districts. Federal agencies shall then consider historic 
properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a 
district exists. Any rehabilitation or construction that is undertaken 
pursuant to this order must be architecturally compatible with the 
character of the surrounding historic district or properties.
 Sec. 3. Identifying and Removing Regulatory Barriers. Federal agencies 
with responsibilities for leasing, acquiring, locating, maintaining, or 
managing Federal facilities or with responsibilities for the planning 
for, or managing of, historic resources shall take steps to reform, 
streamline, and otherwise minimize regulations, policies, and procedures 
that impede the Federal Government's ability to establish or maintain a 
presence in historic districts or to acquire historic properties to 
satisfy Federal space needs, unless such regulations, policies, and 
procedures are designed to protect human health and safety or the 
environment. Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the

[[Page 196]]

assistance of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when taking 
these steps.
 Sec. 4. Improving Preservation Partnerships. In carrying out the 
authorities of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Secretary of 
the Interior, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and each 
Federal agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with States, local 
governments, Indian tribes, and appropriate private organizations with 
the goal of enhancing participation of these parties in the National 
Historic Preservation Program. Such partnerships should embody the 
principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and 
increased service to the public.
 Sec. 5. Judicial Review. This order is not intended to create, nor does 
it create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
at law by a party against the United States, its agencies or 
instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

    May 21, 1996.
                                                                EO 13007
<R05>
Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996
Indian Sacred Sites
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, in furtherance of Federal treaties, and in 
order to protect and preserve Indian religious practices, it is hereby 
ordered:
Section 1. Accommodation of Sacred Sites. (a) In managing Federal lands, 
each executive branch agency with statutory or administrative 
responsibility for the management of Federal lands shall, to the extent 
practicable, permitted by law, and not clearly inconsistent with 
essential agency functions, (1) accommodate access to and ceremonial use 
of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious practitioners and (2) avoid 
adversely affecting the physical integrity of such sacred sites. Where 
appropriate, agencies shall maintain the confidentiality of sacred 
sites.
    (b) For purposes of this order:
      (i) ``Federal lands'' means any land or interests in land owned by 
the United States, including leasehold interests held by the United 
States, except Indian trust lands;
      (ii) ``Indian tribe'' means an Indian or Alaska Native tribe, 
band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the 
Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to Public Law 
No. 103-454, 108 Stat. 4791, and ``Indian'' refers to a member of such 
an Indian tribe; and
      (iii) ``Sacred site'' means any specific, discrete, narrowly 
delineated location on Federal land that is identified by an Indian 
tribe, or Indian individual determined to be an appropriately 
authoritative representative of an Indian religion, as sacred by virtue 
of its established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an 
Indian religion; provided that the tribe or ap

[[Page 197]]

propriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion has 
informed the agency of the existence of such a site.
Sec. 2. Procedures. (a) Each executive branch agency with statutory or 
administrative responsibility for the management of Federal lands shall, 
as appropriate, promptly implement procedures for the purposes of 
carrying out the provisions of section 1 of this order, including, where 
practicable and appropriate, procedures to ensure reasonable notice is 
provided of proposed actions or land management policies that may 
restrict future access to or ceremonial use of, or adversely affect the 
physical integrity of, sacred sites. In all actions pursuant to this 
section, agencies shall comply with the Executive memorandum of April 
29, 1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American 
Tribal Governments.''
    (b) Within 1 year of the effective date of this order, the head of 
each executive branch agency with statutory or administrative 
responsibility for the management of Federal lands shall report to the 
President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, 
on the implementation of this order. Such reports shall address, among 
other things, (i) any changes necessary to accommodate access to and 
ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites; (ii) any changes necessary to 
avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of Indian sacred sites; 
and (iii) procedures implemented or proposed to facilitate consultation 
with appropriate Indian tribes and religious leaders and the expeditious 
resolution of disputes relating to agency action on Federal lands that 
may adversely affect access to, ceremonial use of, or the physical 
integrity of sacred sites.
Sec. 3. Nothing in this order shall be construed to require a taking of 
vested property interests. Nor shall this order be construed to impair 
enforceable rights to use of Federal lands that have been granted to 
third parties through final agency action. For purposes of this order, 
``agency action'' has the same meaning as in the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551(13)).
Sec. 4. This order is intended only to improve the internal management 
of the executive branch and is not intended to, nor does it, create any 
right, benefit, or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or equity by any party against the United States, its 
agencies, officers, or any person.

<R05>
Executive Order 13010 of July 15, 1996
Critical Infrastructure Protection
Certain national infrastructures are so vital that their incapacity or 
destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic 
security of the United States. These critical infrastructures include 
telecommunications, electrical power systems, gas and oil storage and 
transportation, banking and finance, transportation, water supply 
systems, emergency services (including medical, police, fire, and 
rescue), and continuity of government. Threats to these critical 
infrastructures fall into two categories: physical threats to tangible 
property (``physical threats''), and threats of electronic, radio-
frequency, or computer-based attacks on the information or 
communications components that control critical infrastructures (``cyber 
threats''). Because many of these critical infrastructures are owned and 
operated by the private sector, it is essential that the government and 
private sector work together to develop a strategy for protecting them 
and assuring their continued operation.
NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment. There is hereby established the President's 
Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection (``Commission'').
    (a) Chair. A qualified individual from outside the Federal 
Government shall be appointed by the President to serve as Chair of the 
Commission. The Commission Chair shall be employed on a full-time basis.

[[Page 199]]

    (b) Members. The head of each of the following executive branch 
departments and agencies shall nominate not more than two full-time 
members of the Commission:
      (i) Department of the Treasury;
      (ii) Department of Justice;
      (iii) Department of Defense;
      (iv) Department of Commerce;
      (v) Department of Transportation;
      (vi) Department of Energy;
      (vii) Central Intelligence Agency;
      (viii) Federal Emergency Management Agency;
      (ix) Federal Bureau of Investigation;
      (x) National Security Agency.
One of the nominees of each agency may be an individual from outside the 
Federal Government who shall be employed by the agency on a full-time 
basis. Each nominee must be approved by the Steering Committee.
Sec. 2. The Principals Committee. The Commission shall report to the 
President through a Principals Committee (``Principals Committee''), 
which shall review any reports or recommendations before submission to 
the President. The Principals Committee shall comprise the:
    (i) Secretary of the Treasury;
    (ii) Secretary of Defense;
    (iii) Attorney General;
    (iv) Secretary of Commerce;
    (v) Secretary of Transportation;
    (vi) Secretary of Energy;
    (vii) Director of Central Intelligence;
    (viii) Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
    (ix) Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency;
    (x) Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs;
    (xi) Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs.
Sec. 3. The Steering Committee of the President's Commission on Critical 
Infrastructure Protection. A Steering Committee (``Steering Committee'') 
shall oversee the work of the Commission on behalf of the Principals 
Committee. The Steering Committee shall comprise four members appointed 
by the President. One of the members shall be the Chair of the 
Commission and one shall be an employee of the Executive Office of the 
President. The Steering Committee will receive regular reports on the 
progress of the Commission's work and approve the submission of reports 
to the Principals Committee.
Sec. 4. Mission. The Commission shall: (a) within 30 days of this order, 
produce a statement of its mission objectives, which will elaborate the 
gen

[[Page 200]]

eral objectives set forth in this order, and a detailed schedule for 
addressing each mission objective, for approval by the Steering 
Committee;
    (b) identify and consult with: (i) elements of the public and 
private sectors that conduct, support, or contribute to infrastructure 
assurance; (ii) owners and operators of the critical infrastructures; 
and (iii) other elements of the public and private sectors, including 
the Congress, that have an interest in critical infrastructure assurance 
issues and that may have differing perspectives on these issues;
    (c) assess the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities of, and 
threats to, critical infrastructures;
    (d) determine what legal and policy issues are raised by efforts to 
protect critical infrastructures and assess how these issues should be 
addressed;
    (e) recommend a comprehensive national policy and implementation 
strategy for protecting critical infrastructures from physical and cyber 
threats and assuring their continued operation;
    (f) propose any statutory or regulatory changes necessary to effect 
its recommendations; and
    (g) produce reports and recommendations to the Steering Committee as 
they become available; it shall not limit itself to producing one final 
report.
Sec. 5. Advisory Committee to the President's Commission on Critical 
Infrastructure Protection. (a) The Commission shall receive advice from 
an advisory committee (``Advisory Committee'') composed of no more than 
ten individuals appointed by the President from the private sector who 
are knowledgeable about critical infrastructures. The Advisory Committee 
shall advise the Commission on the subjects of the Commission's mission 
in whatever manner the Advisory Committee, the Commission Chair, and the 
Steering Committee deem appropriate.
    (b) A Chair shall be designated by the President from among the 
members of the Advisory Committee.
    (c) The Advisory Committee shall be established in compliance with 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.). The 
Department of Defense shall perform the functions of the President under 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act for the Advisory Committee, except 
that of reporting to the Congress, in accordance with the guidelines and 
procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.
Sec. 6. Administration. (a) All executive departments and agencies shall 
cooperate with the Commission and provide such assistance, information, 
and advice to the Commission as it may request, to the extent permitted 
by law.
    (b) The Commission and the Advisory Committee may hold open and 
closed hearings, conduct inquiries, and establish subcommittees, as 
necessary.
    (c) Members of the Advisory Committee shall serve without 
compensation for their work on the Advisory Committee. While engaged in 
the work of the Advisory Committee, members may be allowed travel 
expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by 
law for persons serving intermittently in the government service.

[[Page 201]]

    (d) To the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability 
of appropriations, the Department of Defense shall provide the 
Commission and the Advisory Committee with administrative services, 
staff, other support services, and such funds as may be necessary for 
the performance of its functions and shall reimburse the executive 
branch components that provide representatives to the Commission for the 
compensation of those representatives.
    (e) In order to augment the expertise of the Commission, the 
Department of Defense may, at the Commission's request, contract for the 
services of nongovernmental consultants who may prepare analyses, 
reports, background papers, and other materials for consideration by the 
Commission. In addition, at the Commission's request, executive 
departments and agencies shall request that existing Federal advisory 
committees consider and provide advice on issues of critical 
infrastructure protection, to the extent permitted by law.
    (f) The Commission, the Principals Committee, the Steering 
Committee, and the Advisory Committee shall terminate 1 year from the 
date of this order, unless extended by the President prior to that date.
Sec. 7. Interim Coordinating Mission. (a) While the Commission is 
conducting its analysis and until the President has an opportunity to 
consider and act on its recommendations, there is a need to increase 
coordination of existing infrastructure protection efforts in order to 
better address, and prevent, crises that would have a debilitating 
regional or national impact. There is hereby established an 
Infrastructure Protection Task Force (``IPTF'') within the Department of 
Justice, chaired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to undertake 
this interim coordinating mission.
    (b) The IPTF will not supplant any existing programs or 
organizations.
    (c) The Steering Committee shall oversee the work of the IPTF.
    (d) The IPTF shall include at least one full-time member each from 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense, and the 
National Security Agency. It shall also receive part-time assistance 
from other executive branch departments and agencies. Members shall be 
designated by their departments or agencies on the basis of their 
expertise in the protection of critical infrastructures. IPTF members' 
compensation shall be paid by their parent agency or department.
    (e) The IPTF's function is to identify and coordinate existing 
expertise, inside and outside of the Federal Government, to:
      (i) provide, or facilitate and coordinate the provision of, expert

THE WHITE HOUSE,
     July 15, 1996.
                                                                EO 13011
<R05>
Executive Order 13011 of July 16, 1996
Federal Information Technology
A Government that works better and costs less requires efficient and 
effective information systems. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and 
the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 provide the 
opportunity to improve significantly the way the Federal Government 
acquires and manages information technology. Agencies now have the clear 
authority and responsibility to make measurable improvements in mission 
performance and service delivery to the public through the strategic 
application of information technology. A coordinated approach that 
builds on existing structures and successful practices is needed to 
provide maximum benefit across the Federal Government from this 
technology.
Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States 
Government that executive agencies shall: (a) significantly improve the 
management of their information systems, including the acquisition of 
information technology, by implementing the relevant provisions of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-13), the Information 
Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (Division E of Public Law 104-
106) (``Information Technology Act''), and the Government Performance 
and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-62);
    (b) refocus information technology management to support directly 
their strategic missions, implement an investment review process that 
drives budget formulation and execution for information systems, and 
rethink and restructure the way they perform their functions before 
investing in information technology to support that work;

[[Page 203]]

    (c) establish clear accountability for information resources 
management activities by creating agency Chief Information Officers 
(CIOs) with the visibility and management responsibilities necessary to 
advise the agency head on the design, development, and implementation of 
those information systems. These responsibilities include: (1) 
participating in the investment review process for information systems; 
(2) monitoring and evaluating the performance of those information 
systems on the basis of applicable performance measures; and, (3) as 
necessary, advising the agency head to modify or terminate those 
systems;
    (d) cooperate in the use of information technology to improve the 
productivity of Federal programs and to promote a coordinated, 
interoperable, secure, and shared Governmentwide infrastructure that is 
provided and supported by a diversity of private sector suppliers and a 
well-trained corps of information technology professionals; and
    (e) establish an interagency support structure that builds on 
existing successful interagency efforts and shall provide expertise and 
advice to agencies; expand the skill and career development 
opportunities of information technology professionals; improve the 
management and use of information technology within and among agencies 
by developing information technology procedures and standards and by 
identifying and sharing experiences, ideas, and promising practices; and 
provide innovative, multi-disciplinary, project-specific support to 
agencies to enhance interoperability, minimize unnecessary duplication 
of effort, and capitalize on agency successes.
Sec. 2. Responsibilities of Agency Heads. The head of each executive 
agency shall: (a) effectively use information technology to improve 
mission performance and service to the public;
    (b) strengthen the quality of decisions about the employment of 
information resources to meet mission needs through integrated analysis, 
planning, budgeting, and evaluation processes, including:
      (1) determining, before making investments in new information 
systems, whether the Government should be performing the function, if 
the private sector or another agency should support the function, and if 
the function needs to be or has been appropriately redesigned to improve 
its efficiency;
      (2) establishing mission-based performance measures for 
information systems investments, aligned with agency performance plans 
prepared pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 
(Public Law 103-62);
      (3) establishing agency-wide and project-level management 
structures and processes responsible and accountable for managing, 
selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments in information 
systems, with authority for terminating information systems when 
appropriate;
      (4) supporting appropriate training of personnel; and
      (5) seeking the advice of, participating in, and supporting the 
interagency support structure set forth in this order;
    (c) select CIOs with the experience and skills necessary to 
accomplish the duties set out in law and policy, including this order, 
and involve the

[[Page 204]]

CIO at the highest level of the agency in the processes and decisions 
set out in this section;
    (d) ensure that the information security policies, procedures, and 
practices of the executive agency are adequate;
    (e) where appropriate, and in accordance with the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation and guidance to be issued by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), structure major information systems 
investments into manageable projects as narrow in scope and brief in 
duration as practicable, consistent with the Information Technology Act, 
to reduce risk, promote flexibility and interoperability, increase 
accountability, and better correlate mission need with current 
technology and market conditions; and
    (f) to the extent permitted by law, enter into a contract that 
provides for multiagency acquisitions of information technology as an 
executive agent for the Government, if and in the manner that the 
Director of OMB considers it advantageous to do so.
Sec. 3. Chief Information Officers Council. (a) Purpose and Functions. A 
Chief Information Officers Council (``CIO Council'') is established as 
the principal interagency forum to improve agency practices on such 
matters as the design, modernization, use, sharing, and performance of

technology management policy, procedures, and standards;
      (2) share experiences, ideas, and promising practices, including 
work process redesign and the development of performance measures, to

      (3) identify opportunities, make recommendations for, and sponsor 
cooperation in using information resources;
      (4) assess and address the hiring, training, classification, and 
professional development needs of the Federal Government with respect to 
information resources management;

<R05>
Executive Order 13019 of September 28, 1996
Supporting Families: Collecting Delinquent Child Support Obligations
The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134 (110 
Stat. 1321-358 et seq.), was enacted into law on April 26, 1996, as part 
of

[[Page 217]]

the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996. 
While the primary purpose of the Debt Collection Improvement Act is to 
increase the collection of nontax debts owed to the Federal Government, 
the Act also contains important provisions that can be used to assist 
families in collecting past-due child support obligations.
The failure of some parents to meet their child support obligations 
threatens the health, education, and well-being of their children. 
Compounding this problem, States have experienced difficulties enforcing 
child support obligations once a parent has moved to another State. With 
this Executive order, my Administration takes additional steps to 
support our children and strengthen American families by facilitating 
the collection of delinquent child support obligations from persons who 
may be entitled or eligible to receive certain Federal payments or 
Federal assistance.
Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Administrative Offsets. (a)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury 
(``the Secretary''), in accordance with the provisions of the Debt 
Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and to the extent permitted by law, 
and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and 
other affected agencies, shall promptly develop and implement procedures 
necessary for the Secretary to collect past-due child support debts by 
administrative offset, and shall issue such rules, regulations, and 
procedures as the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of affected 
agencies, deems appropriate to govern administrative offsets by the 
Department of the Treasury and other executive departments and agencies 
that disburse Federal payments.
      (2) The Secretary may enter into reciprocal agreements with States 
concerning the collection by the Secretary of delinquent child support 
debts through administrative offsets.
    (b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within 120 
days of the date of this order, implement procedures necessary to report 
to the Secretary of the Treasury information on past-due child support 
claims referred by States (including claims enforced by States pursuant 
to cooperative agreements with or by Indian tribal governments) to the 
Department of Health and Human Services.
    (c) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies 
payments to the Secretary or to another disbursing official shall review 
each class of payments that the department or agency certifies to 
determine if any such class should be exempt from offset and, if any 
class is so identified, submit to the Secretary a request for such an 
exemption together with the reasons therefor. With respect to classes of 
payments under means-tested programs existing on the date of this order, 
such submission shall be made within 30 days of the date of this order. 
With respect to classes of payments other than payments under means-
tested programs existing on the date of this order, such submissions 
shall be made within 30 days of the date the Secretary establishes 
standards pursuant to section 3716(c)(3) of title 31, United States 
Code. With respect to a class of payments established after the date of 
this order, such submissions shall be made not later than 30 days after 
such class is established.

[[Page 218]]

    (d) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies 
payments to the Secretary shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, 
or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section.
    (e) The head of each executive department and agency that is 
authorized by law to disburse payments shall promptly implement any 
rule, regulation, or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this 
section and shall:
      (1) match, consistent with computer privacy matching laws, the 
payment certification records of such department or agency with records 
of persons delinquent in child support payments as directed by the 
Secretary; and
      (2) conduct administrative offsets to collect delinquent child 
support payments.
    (f) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, share with 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services any information contained in 
payment certification records of persons who are delinquent in child 
support obligations that would assist in the collection of such debts, 
whether or not an administrative offset is conducted.
Sec. 2. Denial of Federal Assistance. (a) The Secretary shall, to the 
extent permitted by law, ensure that information concerning individuals 
whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of 
delinquent child support obligations is made available to the head of 
each executive department and agency that provides Federal financial 
assistance to individuals.
    (b) In conformance with section 2(e) of this order, the head of each 
executive department and agency shall, with respect to any individuals 
whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of a 
delinquent child support obligation, promptly implement procedures to 
deny Federal financial assistance to such individuals.
    (c) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly 
issue guidelines for departments and agencies concerning minimum due-
process standards to be included in the procedures required by 
subsection (b) of this section.
    (d) For purposes of this section, Federal financial assistance means 
any Federal loan (other than a disaster loan), loan guarantee, or loan 
insurance.
    (e)(1) A class of Federal financial assistance shall not be subject 
to denial if the head of the concerned department or agency determines:
        (A) in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services, that such action:
          (i) is not permitted by law; or
          (ii) would likely result in valid legal claims for damages 
against the United States;
        (B) that such action would be inconsistent with the best 
interests of the child or children with respect to whom a child support 
obligation is owed; or
        (C) that such action should be waived.

[[Page 219]]

      (2) The head of each executive department and agency shall provide 
written notification to the Secretary upon determining that the denial 
of a class of Federal financial assistance is not permitted by law or 
should be waived.
    (f) The head of each executive department and agency shall:
        (1) review all laws under the jurisdiction of the department or 
agency that do not permit the denial of Federal financial assistance to 
individuals and whose payments are subject to administrative offset 
because of a delinquent child support obligation and, where appropriate, 
transmit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
recommendations for statutory changes; and
        (2) to the extent practicable, review all rules, regulations, 
and procedures implementing laws under the jurisdiction of the 
department or agency governing the provision of any Federal financial 
assistance to individuals and, where appropriate, conform such rules, 
regulations, and procedures to the provisions of this order and the 
rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the Secretary pursuant to 
section 1 of this order.
Sec. 3. Reports. (a) The head of each executive department and agency 
shall provide to the Secretary such information as the Secretary may 
request concerning the implementation of this order, the provisions of 
the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 applicable to delinquent 
child support obligations, and the rules, regulations, and procedures 
issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1 of this order.
    (b) The Secretary shall report annually to the President concerning 
the implementation by departments and agencies of this order and the 
provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 applicable to 
delinquent child support obligations.
Sec. 4. Judicial Review. This order does not create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party 
against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

Amendment to Executive Order 12981
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), 
and in order to take additional steps with respect to the national 
emergency described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 
1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, in order to 
amend Executive Order 12981 as that order applies to the processing of 
applications for the export of any commercial communication satellites

[[Page 220]]

tions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to regulations issued 
by the Departments of Commerce and State after the effective date of 
this order, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Amendment of Executive Order 12981. (a) Section 5(a)(3)(B) of 
Executive Order 12981 is amended to read as follows:

      (B) The OC shall review all license applications on which the 
reviewing departments and agencies are not in agreement. The Chair of 
the OC shall consider the recommendations of the reviewing departments 
and agencies and inform them of his or her decision on any such matters 
within 14 days after the deadline for receiving department and agency 
recommendations. However, for license applications concerning commercial 
communication satellites and hot-section technologies for the 
development, production, and overhaul of commercial aircraft engines 
that are transferred from the United States Munitions List to the 
Commerce Control List pursuant to regulations issued by the Departments 
of Commerce and State after the date of this order, the Chair of the OC 
shall inform reviewing departments and agencies of the majority vote 
decision of the OC. As described below, any reviewing department or 
agency may appeal the decision of the Chair of the OC, or the majority 
vote decision of the OC in cases concerning the commercial communication 
satellites and hot-section technologies described above, to the Chair of 
the ACEP. In the absence of a timely appeal, the Chair's decision (or 
the majority vote decision in the case of license applications 
concerning the commercial communication satellites and hot-section 
technologies described above) will be final.
    (b) Section 5(b)(1) of Executive Order 12981 is amended to read as 
follows:

    (1) If any department or agency disagrees with a licensing 
determination of the Department of Commerce made through the Chair of 
the OC (or a majority vote decision of the OC in the case of license 
applications concerning the commercial communication satellites and the 
hot-section technologies described in section 5(a)(3)(B)), it may appeal 
the matter to the ACEP for resolution. A department or agency must 
appeal a matter within 5 days of such a decision. Appeals must be in 
writing from an official appointed by the President, by and with the 
advice and consent of the Senate, or an officer properly acting in such 
capacity, and must cite both the statutory and the regulatory bases for 
the appeal. The ACEP shall review all departments' and agencies' 
information and recommendations, and the Chair of the ACEP shall inform 
the reviewing departments and agencies of the majority vote decision of 
the ACEP within 11 days from the date of receiving notice of the appeal. 
Within 5 days of the majority vote decision, any dissenting department 
or agency may appeal the decision by submitting a letter from the head 
of the department or agency to the Secretary in his or her capacity as 
the Chair of the Board. Such letter shall cite both the statutory and 
the regulatory bases for the appeal. Within the same 5-day period, the 
Secretary may call a meeting on his or her own initiative to consider a 
license application. In the absence of a timely appeal, the majority 
vote decision of the ACEP shall be final.
Sec. 2. Judicial Review. This order is not intended to create, nor does 
it create, any rights to administrative or judicial review, or any other 
right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable by a

[[Page 221]]

party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its 
officers or employees, or any other person.
Sec. 3. Effective Date. This order shall be effective immediately and

extent permitted by law and regulations, each Federal agency shall 
cooperate in providing resources, including personnel detailed to the 
Initiative, to meet the objectives of the order.

official, who is a full-time officer of the Federal Government and who 
is responsible for management or program administration, to serve as 
liaison to the White House Initiative. The official shall report 
directly to the agency head, or agency representative, on agency 
activity under this order and serve as liaison to the White House 
Initiative. To the extent permitted by law and regulation, each agency

[[Page 223]]

Sec. 5. Five-Year Federal Plan. (a) Content. Each agency shall, in 
collaboration with tribal colleges, develop and document a Five-Year

      (1) barriers impeding the access of tribal colleges to funding 
opportunities and to participation in Federal programs, and ways to 
eliminate the barriers;
      (2) technical assistance and information that will be made 
available to tribal colleges regarding the program activities of the 
agency and the preparation of applications or proposals for grants, 
cooperative agreements, or contracts; and
      (3) an annual goal for agency funds to be awarded to tribally 
controlled colleges and universities in:
        (A) grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and procurement;
        (B) related excess property-type acquisitions under various 
authorities such as section 923 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement 
and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 2206a) and the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, chapter 288, 63 Stat. 377 (codified 
as described at 40 U.S.C. 471 note); and

to the attainment of the participation goals described in Executive 
Order 12928, ``Promoting Procurement with Small Businesses Owned and 
Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals, 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority 
Institutions.'' The Plans may also emphasize access to high-quality 
educational opportunity for economically disadvantaged Indian students; 
the preservation and revitalization of American Indian and Alaska Native 
languages and cultural traditions; innovative approaches to better link 
tribal colleges with early childhood, elementary, and secondary 
education programs; and the National Education Goals.

White House Initiative Office. In consultation with the Board, the White 
House Initiative Office shall then review these Five-Year Plans and 
develop an integrated Five-Year Plan for Assistance to Tribal Colleges,

Year Plan for Assistance to Tribal Colleges may be revised within the 5-
year period.
    (c) Annual Performance Reports. Each agency shall submit to the 
White House Initiative Office an Annual Performance Report that shall 
measure each agency's performance against the objectives set forth in 
its Five-Year Plan. In consultation with the Board, the White House 
Initiative Office shall review and combine Annual Performance Reports 
into one annual report, which shall be submitted to the Secretary for 
review, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget.
Sec. 6. Private Sector. In cooperation with the Board, the White House 
Initiative Office shall encourage the private sector to assist tribal 
colleges

[[Page 224]]

through increased use of such strategies as: (a) matching funds to 
support increased endowments;
    (b) developing expertise and more effective ways to manage finance, 
improve information systems, build facilities, and improve course 
offerings; and
    (c) increasing resources for and training of faculty.
Sec. 7. Termination. The Board shall terminate 2 years after the date of 
this Executive order unless the Board is renewed by the President prior 
to the end of that 2-year period.
Sec. 8. Administration. (a) Compensation. Members of the Board shall 
serve without compensation, but shall be allowed travel expenses, 
including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for 
persons serving intermittently in Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-
5707).
    (b) Funding. The Board and the Initiative shall be funded by the 
Department of Education.
    (c) Administrative Support. The Department of Education shall 
provide appropriate administrative services and staff support for the 
Board and the Initiative. With the consent of the Department of 
Education, other agencies participating in the Initiative shall provide 
administrative support to the White House Initiative Office consistent 
with statutory authority and shall make use of section 112 of title 3, 
United States Code, to detail agency employees to the extent permitted 
by law. The Board and the White House Initiative Office shall have a 
core staff and shall be supported at appropriate levels.

<R05>
Executive Order 13026 of November 15, 1996
Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), 
and in order to take additional steps with respect to the national 
emergency described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 
1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996, I, 
WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, have 
decided that the provisions set forth below shall apply to 
administration of the export control system maintained by the Export 
Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq. (``the EAR''). 
Accordingly, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Treatment of Encryption Products. In order to provide for 
appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of 
encryption products, export controls of encryption products that are or 
would be, on this date, designated as defense articles in Category XIII 
of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States 
Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 
2778 et seq. (``the AECA''), but that subsequently are placed on the 
Commerce Control List in the EAR, shall be subject to the following 
conditions: (a) I have determined that the export of encryption products 
described in this section could harm national security and foreign 
policy interests even where comparable products are or appear to be 
available from sources outside the United States, and that facts and 
questions concerning the foreign availability of such encryption 
products cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review 
without revealing or implicating classified information that could harm 
United States national security and foreign policy interests. 
Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of the Export Administration 
Act of 1979 (``the EAA''), 50 U.S.C. App. 2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as 
amended and as continued in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 
19, 1994, and by notices of August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all 
other analogous provisions of the EAA relating to foreign availability, 
and the regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall 
not be applicable with respect to export controls on such encryption 
products. Notwithstanding this, the Secretary of Commerce 
(``Secretary'') may, in his discretion, consider the foreign 
availability of comparable encryption products in determining whether to 
issue a license in a particular case or to remove controls on par

[[Page 229]]

ticular products, but is not required to issue licenses in particular 
cases or to remove controls on particular products based on such 
consideration;
    (b) Executive Order 12981, as amended by Executive Order 13020 of 
October 12, 1996, is further amended as follows:
    (1) A new section 6 is added to read as follows:

``Sec. 6. Encryption Products. In conducting the license review 
described in section 1 above, with respect to export controls of 
encryption products that are or would be, on November 15, 1996, 
designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the United States 
Munitions List and regulated by the United States Department of State 
pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but 
that subsequently are placed on the Commerce Control List in the Export 
Administration Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, 
and Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency shall have the 
opportunity to review any export license application submitted to the 
Department of Commerce. The Department of Justice shall, with respect to 
such encryption products, be a voting member of the Export 
Administration Review Board described in section 5(a)(1) of this order 
and of the Advisory Committee on Export Policy described in section 
5(a)(2) of this order. The Department of Justice shall be a full member 
of the Operating Committee of the ACEP described in section 5(a)(3) of 
this order, and of any other committees and consultation groups 
reviewing export controls with respect to such encryption products.''
    (2) Sections 6 and 7 of Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, 
are renumbered as new sections 7 and 8, respectively.
    (c) Because the export of encryption software, like the export of 
other encryption products described in this section, must be controlled 
because of such software's functional capacity, rather than because of 
any possible informational value of such software, such software shall 
not be considered or treated as ``technology,'' as that term is defined 
in section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR (61 Fed. 
Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996);
    (d) With respect to encryption products described in this section, 
the Secretary shall take such actions, including the promulgation of 
rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as may be necessary to 
control the export of assistance (including training) to foreign persons 
in the same manner and to the same extent as the export of such 
assistance is controlled under the AECA, as amended by section 151 of 
Public Law 104-164;
    (e) Appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of 
encryption products described in this section may include, but are not 
limited to, measures that promote the use of strong encryption products 
and the development of a key recovery management infrastructure; and
    (f) Regulation of encryption products described in this section 
shall be subject to such further conditions as the President may direct.
Sec. 2. Effective Date. The provisions described in section 1 shall take 
effect as soon as any encryption products described in section 1 are 
placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR.
Sec. 3. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve the 
internal management of the executive branch and to ensure the 
implementation of appropriate controls on the export and foreign 
dissemination of encryption

[[Page 230]]

products. It is not intended to, and does not, create any rights to 
administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or 
trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party 
against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its 
officers or employees, or any other person.

organization of railroad employees or any carrier. The board shall 
perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.
Sec. 2. Report. Within 30 days after creation of the board, the parties 
to the dispute shall submit to the board final offers for settlement of 
the dispute. Within 30 days after submission of final offers for 
settlement of the dispute, the board shall submit a report to the 
President setting forth its selection of the most reasonable offer.
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 9A(h) of the Act, 
from the time a request to establish a board is made until 60 days after 
the board makes its report, no change, except by agreement, shall be 
made by the parties in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.

[[Page 231]]

Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of the board are

    December 12, 1996.
                                                                EO 13031
<R05>
Executive Order 13031 of December 13, 1996
Federal Alternative Fueled Vehicle Leadership
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), the Energy Policy 
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486) (``the Act''), and section 301 of title 
3, United States Code, and with the knowledge that the use of 
alternative fueled motor vehicles will, in many applications, reduce the 
Nation's dependence on oil, and may create jobs by providing an economic 
stimulus for domes

[[Page 242]]

tic industry, and may improve the Nation's air quality by reducing 
pollutants in the atmosphere, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Federal Leadership and Goals. (a) The purpose of this order 
is to ensure that the Federal Government exercise leadership in the use 
of alternative fueled vehicles (AFVs). To that end, each Federal agency 
shall develop and implement aggressive plans to fulfill the alternative 
fueled vehicle acquisition requirements established by the Act. The Act 
generally requires that, of the vehicles acquired by each agency for its 
fleets, subject to certain conditions specified in section 303(b)(1) of 
the Act, 25 percent should be AFVs in fiscal year (FY) 1996, 33 percent 
in FY 1997, 50 percent in FY 1998, and 75 percent in FY 1999 and 
thereafter. These requirements apply to all agencies, regardless of 
whether they lease vehicles from the General Services Administration 
(GSA) or acquire them elsewhere. That section also defines which Federal 
agency vehicles are covered by the AFV acquisition requirements; this 
order applies to the same vehicles, which are primarily general-use 
vehicles located in metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 
250,000 or more.
    (b) To the extent practicable, agencies shall use alternative fuels 
in all vehicles capable of using them. Agencies shall continue to work 
together in interagency committees recommended by the Federal Fleet 
Conversion Task Force established by Executive Order 12844 of April 21, 
1993, to coordinate their vehicle acquisitions and placement.
Sec. 2. Submission of Agency Plans and Reports on Statutory Compliance. 
(a) Sixty (60) days after the date of this Executive order, and annually 
thereafter as part of its budget submission to the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, each agency shall submit a report on 
its compliance with sections 303 and 304 of the Act. A copy of the 
report shall also be submitted to the Secretary of Energy and to the 
Administrator of General Services. The report shall state whether the 
agency is in compliance with the Act, and substantiate that statement 
with quantitative data including numbers and types of vehicles acquired 
and the level of their use. At a minimum, the report shall indicate the 
number of vehicles acquired or converted for each fuel type and vehicle 
class, and the total number of vehicles of each fuel type operated by 
the agency. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall 
issue further reporting guidance as necessary.
    (b) If an agency has failed to meet the statutory requirements, it 
shall include in its report an explanation for such failure and a plan, 
consistent with the agency's current and requested budgets, for 
achieving compliance with the Act. The plan shall include alternative 
sources of suitable AFVs if the agency's primary vehicle supplier is 
unable to meet the AFV requirements.
    (c) The Secretary of the Department of Energy and the Administrator 
of General Services shall cooperatively analyze the agency AFV reports 
and acquisition plans, and shall submit jointly a summary report to the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Sec. 3. Exceptions for Law-Enforcement, Emergency, and National Defense 
Vehicles. Section 303 of the Act allows exemptions to the acquisition 
requirements for law-enforcement, emergency, and vehicles acquired and 
used for military purposes that the Secretary of Defense has certified 
must be exempt for national security reasons. Law enforcement vehicles 
shall include vehicles used for protective activities. Each agency that 
acquires or

[[Page 243]]

utilizes any such vehicles shall include in its report an explanation of 
why an exemption is claimed with respect to such vehicles.
Sec. 4. Fulfilling the Acquisition Requirement. (a) Agencies may acquire 
alternative fueled vehicles to meet the requirements of this order 
through lease from GSA, acquisition of original equipment manufacturer 
models, commercial lease, conversion of conventionally fueled vehicles, 
or any combination of these approaches. All vehicles, including those 
converted for alternative fuel use, shall comply with all applicable 
Federal and State emissions and safety standards.
    (b) Based on its own plans and the plans and reports submitted by 
other agencies, the Administrator of General Services shall provide 
planning information to potential AFV suppliers to assist in production 
planning. After consulting with AFV suppliers, the Administrator of 
General Services shall provide to Federal agencies information on the 
production plans of AFV suppliers well in advance of budget and ordering 
cycles.
    (c) As required by section 305 of the Act, the Secretary of Energy, 
in cooperation with the Administrator of General Services, shall 
continue to provide technical assistance to other Federal agencies that 
acquire alternative fueled vehicles and shall facilitate the 
coordination of the Federal Government's alternative fueled vehicle 
program.
Sec. 5. Vehicle Reporting Credits. The gains in air quality and energy 
security that this order seeks to achieve will be even larger if medium- 
and heavy-duty vehicles are operated on alternative fuels, and if 
``zero-emissions vehicles'' (ZEVs) are used. Therefore, for the purposes 
of this order, agencies may acquire medium- or heavy-duty dedicated 
alternative fueled vehicles or ZEVs to meet their AFV acquisition 
requirements, and they shall be given credits for compliance with their 
AFV targets as follows. Each medium-duty and ZEV shall count the same as 
two light-duty AFVs, and each dedicated alternative fueled heavy-duty 
vehicle shall count as three light-duty AFVs. The ZEV credits may be 
combined with vehicle size credits. The Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, 
shall issue detailed guidance on the classification and reporting of 
medium-duty, heavy-duty, and ZEVs. In the reports mandated in section 2 
of this order, medium- and heavy-duty AFVs and ZEVs shall be identified 
separately from light-duty vehicles.
Sec. 6. Funding Alternative Fueled Vehicle Acquisition. (a) The 
Department of Energy will no longer request or require specific 
appropriations to fund the incremental costs of alternative fueled 
vehicles, including any incremental costs associated with acquisition 
and disposal, for other agencies. Agencies shall formulate their 
compliance plans based on existing and requested funds, but shall not be 
exempt from the requirements of the Act or this order due to limited 
appropriations.
    (b) An exception regarding funding assistance shall be made for 
electric vehicles, which are in an earlier stage of development than 
other alternative fueled vehicles. The Secretary of Energy shall 
establish a program beginning in FY 1997 to provide partial funding 
assistance for agency purchases of electric vehicles. Up to $10,000 or 
one-half the incremental cost over a comparable gasoline-powered 
vehicle, whichever is less, may be provided as funding assistance for 
each electric vehicle, subject to the availability of funds.

[[Page 244]]

Sec. 7. Agency Cooperation with Stakeholders on Alternative Fueled 
Vehicle Placement and Refueling Capabilities. The Secretary of Energy 
shall work with agencies procuring AFVs to coordinate the placement of 
their vehicles with the placement of similar vehicles by nonfederal 
alternative fuel stakeholders. Federal planning and acquisition efforts 
shall be coordinated with the efforts of the Department of Energy's 
``Clean Cities'' participants, private industry fuel suppliers, and 
fleet operators, and State and local governments to ensure that adequate 
private sector refueling capabilities exist or will exist wherever 
Federal fleet alternative fueled vehicles are located. Each agency's 
fleet managers shall work with appropriate organizations at their 
respective locations, whether in a ``Clean Cities'' location or not, on 
initiatives to promote alternative fueled vehicle use and expansion of 
refueling infrastructure.
Sec. 8. Definitions. For the purpose of this order, the terms 
``agency,'' ``alternative fueled vehicle,'' and ``alternative fuel'' 
have the same meaning given such terms in sections 151 and 301 of the 
Act.
Sec. 9. Executive Order 12844. This order supersedes Executive Order 
12844.
Sec. 10. Judicial Review. This order is not intended to, and does not, 
create any right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or 
procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its 
agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other 
person.

Notice of January 3, 1996
Continuation of Libyan Emergency
On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12543, President Reagan 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Libya. On 
January 8, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12544, the President took 
additional measures to block Libyan assets in the United States. The 
President has transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the 
Congress and the Federal Register every year since 1986.
The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been 
resolved. The Government of Libya has continued its actions and policies 
in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United Nations 
Security Council, in Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993) 
that it demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of such 
terrorism. Such Libyan actions and policies pose a continuing unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign 
policy interests of the United States. For these reasons, the national 
emergency declared on January 7, 1986, and the measures adopted on 
January 7 and January 8, 1986, to deal with that emer

[[Page 256]]

gency, must continue in effect beyond January 7, 1996. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to 
Libya. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
    January 3, 1996.
Presidential Determination No. 96-8 of January 4, 1996
Suspending Restrictions on U.S. Relations With the Palestine Liberation 
Organization
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Middle East Peace 
Facilitation Act of 1994, part E of title V, Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, Public Law 103-236, as 
amended, (``the Act''), I hereby:
    (1) certify that it is in the national interest to suspend 
application of the following provisions of law until March 31, 1996:
      (A) Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended 
(22 U.S.C. 2227), as it applies with respect to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization or entities associated with it;
      (B) Section 114 of the Department of State Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (22 U.S.C. 287e note), as it applies with 
respect to the Palestine Liberation Organization or entities associated 
with it;
      (C) Section 1003 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 2502); and
      (D) Section 37, Bretton Woods Agreement Act (22 U.S.C. 286w), as 
it applies to the granting to the Palestine Liberation Organization of 
observer status or other official status at any meeting sponsored by or 
associated with the International Monetary Fund.
    (2) certify that the Palestine Liberation Organization continues to 
abide by the commitments described in section 583(b)(4) of the Act.
You are authorized and directed to transmit this determination to the 
Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.

Notice of January 18, 1996
Continuation of Emergency Regarding Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt 
The Middle East Peace Process
On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order No. 12947, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists 
that disrupt the Middle East peace process. By Executive Order No. 12947 
of January 23, 1995, I blocked the assets in the United States, or in 
the control of United States persons, of foreign terrorists who threaten 
to disrupt the Middle East peace process. I also prohibited transactions 
or dealings by United States persons in such property. Because terrorist 
activities continue to threaten the Middle East peace process and vital 
interests of the United States in the Middle East, the national 
emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures that took 
effect on January 24, 1995, to deal with that emergency must continue in 
effect beyond January 23, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who 
threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Presidential Determination No. 96-9 of January 22, 1996
Presidential Determination on Food Security Wheat Reserve Release
By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
and laws of the United States, including the Food Security Wheat Reserve 
Act of 1980 (the ``Act'') (7 U.S.C. 1736f-1) and section 301 of title 3 
of the United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Secretary of 
Agriculture the authority to release up to 1,500,000 metric tons of 
wheat from the reserve established under the Act (the ``reserve''). 
Wheat released from the reserve will be used to provide, on a sale or 
donation basis, emergency food assistance to developing countries during 
fiscal year 1996 under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance 
Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1691, 1701 et seq.) to the extent that the 
Secretary of Agriculture determines that the domestic supply of wheat is 
so limited that quantities of wheat could not otherwise be made 
available for disposition consistent with the criteria set forth in the 
Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, except for 
urgent humanitarian purposes.

Certification for Major Narcotics Producing and Transit Countries
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 490(b)(1)(A) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, (``the Act''), I hereby 
determine and certify that the following major drug producing and/or

I have made there determinations, taking into account the factors set

Presidential Determination No. 96-17 of March 7, 1996

Drawdown of Commodities and Services From the Departments of Defense, 
the Treasury, Transportation, and Justice and Drawdown of Defense 
Articles, Defense Services, and Training From the Department of Defense 
for Israel
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the 
``Act''), I hereby determine that:
    (1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of 
funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the 
national interests of the United States; and

    (2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(1) of the Act, 
22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1) (the ``Act''), I hereby determine that:

[[Page 264]]

    (1) an unforeseen emergency exists that requires immediate military 
assistance to a foreign country or international organization; and

    (2) the emergency requirement cannot be met under the authority of 
the Arms Export Control Act or any other law except section 506 of the 
Act.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the 
inventory and resources of the Departments of the Treasury, 
Transportation, Defense, and Justice of an aggregate value not to exceed 
$12 million and authorize the furnishing of up to $10 million in defense 
articles, defense services, and military education and training from the 
Department of Defense for detecting and disarming explosive devices.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, March 7, 1996.
Justification for Drawdown Under Sections 552(c)(2) and 506(a)(1) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act To Support the Provision of Emergency Anti-
Terrorism Assistance to the Government of Israel
The State of Israel has been struck by four massive suicide bombing 
attacks during the past week. These attacks have resulted in heavy loss 
of life and property and threaten further progress in the Middle East 
peace process. Such an outcome would severely damage a major historic 
initiative that is a top U.S. foreign policy priority.
Israel has requested assistance to obtain explosive detection and 
disarming equipment for use at Gaza and other border crossings and to 
protect transport and infrastructure. We have determined that the most 
effective way to respond to this request is to provide to Israel 
equipment and supplies to help counter this terrorist threat, along with 
associated transport. The equipment and supplies are mostly made by U.S. 
suppliers. Training and services on the use of the equipment as well as 
assistance in assembling it will also be provided as needed. This 
assistance will be used by Israeli security forces to detect and disarm 
explosive devices.
For this purpose the President intends to exercise the special drawdown 
authorities in section 552(c)(2) and section 506(a)(1 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. Such assistance will help the 
Israeli government combat an immediate and deadly terrorist threat aimed 
at undermining the security of Israel and subverting the Middle East 
peace process.
For these reasons, the use of the emergency authorities discussed above 
to provide the goods and services described above is important to the 
national interests of the United States.

Notice of March 8, 1996
Continuation of Iran Emergency
On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order No. 12957, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, 
including its support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine 
the Middle East peace process, and acquisition of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means to deliver them. On May 6, 1995, I issued 
Executive Order No. 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to 
further respond to this threat.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must 
continue in effect beyond March 15, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the 
emergency declared by Executive Order No. 12957 constitutes an emergency 
separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order No. 
12170, this renewal is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 
1995. This Notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Memorandum of Justification for Determinations and Certifications Under 
the Heading ``International Organizations and Programs'' in Title IV of 
the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 1996 in Connection With the

Organization (KEDO)
Pursuant to the requirements set forth under the heading ``International

Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-107), I have determined that:
    (a) in accordance with Section 1 of the Agreed Framework, KEDO has 
designated a Republic of Korea company, corporation or entity for the 
purpose of negotiating a prime contract to carry out construction of the 
light water reactors provided for in the Agreed Framework; and
    (b) the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is maintaining

    (c) the United States is taking steps to assure that progress is

barriers to trade and investment, such as removing restrictions on 
travel, telecommunications services and financial transactions; and (2) 
implementation of the January 1, 1992, Joint Declaration on the 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
The justification for these determinations is set forth below.
(a)--Designation of ROK Company
    In section I of the Agreed Framework between the United States of 
America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), signed in 
Geneva on October 21, 1994, the two parties stated that they would 
cooperate in replacing the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and 
related facilities with light-water reactor (LWR) power plants. The U.S. 
further stated that it would undertake to make arrangements for the 
provision of the LWR project to the DPRK, including organizing under its 
leadership an international consortium to finance and supply the 
project. This organization, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development 
Organization (KEDO), was created on March 9, 1995, by agreement of the 
U.S., Japan, and the ROK. These parties have agreed that the ROK will 
assume the central role in financing and building the LWR project.
    On June 13, 1995, in Kuala Lumpur, the United States and the DPRK 
issued a joint statement providing that KEDO will select both the LWR 
reactor model and the prime contractor to carry out the project. (These 
points were confirmed in the LWR supply agreement between KEDO and the 
DPRK, signed December 15, 1995 in New York City.) On the same date as 
the Kuala Lumpur statement (June 13, 1995), the KEDO Executive Board 
decided by Board resolution that an ROK reactor model (Ulchin \3/4\) 
would be built in the DPRK by an ROK firm. The Executive Board 
resolution designated the Korean Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) as 
the firm with which KEDO would begin negotiating a prime contract for 
the light-water reactor project. These negotiations are under way.
(b)--DPRK Maintenance of the Freeze
    Section I(3) of the U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework provides for the 
immediate freeze and eventual dismantlement of all graphite-moderated 
reactors and related facilities in the DPRK. Within this context, the 
DPRK agreed to implement the freeze on its nuclear facilities within one 
month after the signing of the Agreed Framework and to allow the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to monitor the freeze on its 
facilities, with the full cooperation of the DPRK. In addition, the U.S. 
and DPRK agreed to cooperate in finding a method to store safely the 
spent fuel from the DPRK's 5 MW(e) experimental reactor during the 
construction of the LWR project, and to dispose of the fuel in a safe 
manner that does not involve reprocessing in the DPRK.
    Since November 1994, all of North Korea's graphite-moderated nuclear 
facilities have been frozen. Specifically, this means no refueling or 
operation of the 5MW research reactor; no construction on the 50 and 200 
MW reactors; no reprocessing and sealing of the reprocessing facility; 
no operation of the fuel fabrication plant; and no construction of new 
graphite-moderated reactors or related facilities. The IAEA has 
maintained a continuous presence at the Nyongbyon nuclear facility and 
has continued with inspection activities related to verifying and 
monitoring the freeze in the

[[Page 270]]

DPRK according to the terms of the Agreed Framework. In addition to IAEA 
monitoring activities, the United States continues to monitor the freeze 
through National Technical Means.
    With the successful conclusion of the December 15, 1995 agreement on 
the supply of light-water reactors (LWRs) to the DPRK, signed between 
the DPRK and KEDO in New York City, the IAEA will resume ad hoc and 
routine inspections under the DPRK's safeguards agreement with the IAEA 
with respect to the facilities not subject to the freeze. The IAEA and 
DPRK meet periodically to discuss any outstanding safeguards issues that 
arise, most recently on January 22, 1996. During this meeting, both 
sides agreed to measures for safely storing the DPRK's spent nuclear 
fuel from its 5 MW(e) research reactor. When the first LWR unit is 
completed, the IAEA will have oversight over the dismantlement of the 
DPRK's nuclear facilities which will be completed when the second LWR 
unit is completed.
    In January 1995, the U.S. and DPRK agreed on the method for safely 
storing the DPRK's spent nuclear fuel as an interim step before it is 
shipped out of the DPRK, as defined in the Agreed Framework. U.S. 
technical experts have been in the DPRK since July 1995 preparing the 
fuel for canning in a cooperative joint effort with the DPRK. Actual 
canning is expected to commence soon and will last approximately three 
months.
(c)--North-South Dialogue and the Joint Declaration
    The U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework provides that ``the DPRK will engage 
in North-South dialogue.'' Since then, the U.S. has taken steps to 
support South Korean initiatives toward the North and to encourage the 
DPRK to fulfill its commitment to engage in dialogue as soon as 
possible. In all of our bilateral contacts with the DPRK, the U.S. has 
made clear that improvement in North-South relations is the key to peace 
and security on the Korean peninsula, and a requirement if U.S.-DPRK 
bilateral relations are to continue to move forward. Ambassador Robert 
L. Gallucci, during his tenure as Chairman of the Senior Steering 
Committee on Korea, had frequent occasion to raise the issue of North-
South relations in his correspondence with his North Korean counterpart, 
First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Sok Ju. Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State Thomas Hubbard raised the North-South issue 
repeatedly during the May-June 1995 negotiations with the North Koreans 
in Kuala Lumpur on the LWR supply agreement. Most recently, Mr. Hubbard 
raised this issue when he met with North Korean Ambassador-at-Large Ho 
Jung in December 1995. Finally, working level officials have repeatedly 
stressed to their North Korean counterparts the importance of the DPRK 
improving relations with the South. Over the last year, these points 
have been made at all three rounds of U.S.-DPRK negotiations on the 
opening of liaison offices, and repeatedly in contacts with officials of 
the DPRK Mission to the UN.
    In support of ROK initiatives, we have conveyed South Korean 
positions--and U.S. support for those positions--to the DPRK and others. 
At South Korea's request we have raised several particular issues with 
the DPRK, sometimes with positive effect. The South Korean government 
has expressed its appreciation for these U.S. efforts. During this 
period North and South Korea held a series of bilateral meetings in 
Beijing that produced an agreement whereby the South provided 150,000 
tons of rice to the North as a grant. In December 1995, the DPRK 
released the crew of a South Ko

[[Page 271]]

rean fishing vessel which strayed into North Korean waters earlier in 
the year, a step which the ROK had been urging the DPRK to take.
    On January 1, 1992, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea issued the Joint Declaration of the 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The provisions of the Joint 
Declaration state that the North and South:
    --shall not test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, 
deploy or use nuclear weapons;
    --shall use nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes;
    --shall not possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment 
facilities, and;
    --in order to verify the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, 
shall conduct inspections of the objects selected by the other side and 
agreed upon between the two sides, in accordance with procedures and 
methods to be determined by the South-North Nuclear Control Commission 
which shall be established within one month of the effectuation of this 
joint declaration.
    The DPRK and the ROK held a series of South-North Joint Nuclear 
Control Commission meetings in early 1992 as specified in the Joint 
Declaration, but these were discontinued as relations between the two 
Korean states worsened and the DPRK threatened to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and refused to cooperate with the 
IAEA. As a result, the absence of sustained governmental talks between 
the ROK and DPRK has delayed further implementation of the 
Denuclearization Declaration.
    The United States has, however, taken steps to encourage DPRK 
compliance with the Joint Declaration by encouraging North-South 
dialogue and ensuring DPRK implementation of the Agreed Framework. The 
Agreed Framework, as a step towards full implementation of the 
Denuclearization Declaration, has succeeded in illiciting positive DPRK 
movement on key provisions of the Declaration. Specifically, North 
Korea's willingness to freeze immediately and eventually dismantle its 
graphite-moderated nuclear reactors and related facilities has halted 
activities which would, had they not been stopped, given the DPRK a 
nuclear weapons capability. Such a capability would have been a threat 
to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula as well as to Northeast 
Asia. The DPRK agreement to forego reprocessing under the Agreed 
Framework and to replace its existing nuclear reactors with 
proliferation-resistant LWRs represents a major step toward assuring the 
DPRK will not test, manufacture, produce, store, deploy or possess 
nuclear weapons. In addition, by agreeing to allow a continuous IAEA 
inspector presence on the ground and to come into full compliance with 
its IAEA safeguards obligations, including taking all steps that may be 
deemed necessary by the IAEA with regard to verifying the accuracy and 
completeness of the DPRK's initial report on all nuclear material in the 
DPRK, the DPRK has not only gone beyond its NPT and IAEA safeguards 
obligations but also is taking steps related to the inspection 
objectives set forth in the Denuclearization Declaration.

Memorandum of Justification Under Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance 
Act To Provide U.S. Contributions to the Korean Peninsula Energy 
Development Organization (KEDO)
The Administration proposes that up to $22.0 million in FY 1996 
International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) funds be used for a U.S. 
contribution to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization 
(KEDO), an international consortium established to implement the Agreed 
Framework signed between the United States and the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on October 21, 1994. This funding level for 
U.S. contributions to KEDO was specified in the Administration's 
congressional presentation documents for the Foreign Operations 
Appropriations Act, 1996 (P.L. 104-107). KEDO would be permitted to use 
the U.S. contribution to help cover the FY 1996 administrative and heavy 
fuel oil shipment expenses.
In order to make available the funds appropriated for this contribution, 
the President intends to exercise his authority under section 614(a)(1) 
of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to authorize the 
voluntary contribution to KEDO without regard to applicable statutory 
restrictions within the scope of this section, including any 
restrictions in sections 307, 620A, 620(f), or 530 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act or sections 507, 516, 523, or 527A of the Foreign 
Operations Appropriations Act.
The Agreed Framework addresses U.S. and international concerns about the 
DPRK's nuclear weapons program and, if fully implemented, will lead 
ultimately to the complete dismantlement of North Korea's current 
nuclear program. Under the U.S.--DPRK Agreed Framework, the U.S. 
represented that it would ``organize under its leadership an 
international consortium to finance and supply the light-water reactor 
(LWR) project to be provided to the DPRK.'' In order to meet this 
pledge, the U.S., South Korea (ROK) and Japan agreed on the creation of 
an international organization, KEDO, to implement the reactor project, 
the annual delivery of 500,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil delivery to 
North Korea and other possible projects called for in the Agreed 
Framework (e.g., the transfer of spent fuel out of the DPRK for ultimate 
disposition). The U.S., ROK and Japan have played and will continue to 
play leading roles in KEDO.
KEDO's purpose is to coordinate cooperation among interested parties in 
the international community and to facilitate the financing and 
execution of projects needed to implement the Agreed Framework. KEDO 
members have agreed to cooperate in taking the steps necessary to 
implement the Agreed Framework consistent with the Charter of the United 
Nations, the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the 
North-South Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, 
and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Moreover, 
KEDO will obtain assurances that nuclear materials, equipment, or 
technology transferred to the DPRK in connection with projects 
undertaken by KEDO will be used exclusively for such projects, only for 
peaceful purposes, and in a manner that ensures the safe use of nuclear 
energy. The continued funding of KEDO is critical to the success of the 
specific objectives of the Agreed Framework, the general goals of 
international nuclear nonproliferation, and the aim of maintaining peace 
and security on the Korean Peninsula.

[[Page 273]]

KEDO is located in New York and is directed by an Executive Board 
consisting of representatives of the original member countries--the 
U.S., Japan, and the ROK. Other members may participate in its 
activities by serving on advisory committees covering the organization's 
projects, attending the KEDO General Conference, participating in ad hoc 
technical meetings relating to KEDO projects and, in some cases, sending 
technical experts to serve in the KEDO secretariat. The day-to-day 
operations of KEDO are directed by Executive Director Stephen Bosworth, 
former U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, assisted by two Deputy 
Executive Directors (one from Japan and one from the ROK). KEDO is 
seeking to contract with private firms for the bulk of the legal, 
technical, and financial expertise required to oversee the LWR project 
and other projects. It will have a secretariat consisting of 
approximately 30 people to carry out its functions.
The U.S. contribution to KEDO will help fund: 1) KEDO's FY 1996 costs 
for office space, office supplies, communications, consulting costs and 
legal services, and employee remuneration for a staff of thirty people, 
including the Executive Director, the two Deputy Directors, and support 
personnel; and 2) a portion of the estimated $50 million worth of heavy 
fuel oil due to be shipped in 1996. These funds are essential to KEDO's 
ability to meet the terms of the U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework regarding 
the provision of heavy fuel oil. Should KEDO fail to meet these 
deliveries, the DPRK might renege on its Agreed Framework obligations, 
including possibly breaking the freeze on its nuclear program. Hence, 
early transfer of these funds is essential to meeting our 
nonproliferation objectives in the DPRK.
Memorandum of April 8, 1996
Strengthening Drug Control Cooperation With Mexico
This memorandum is to direct actions that will be taken by executive 
departments and agencies to improve the effectiveness of United States-
Mexico drug control cooperation.
The Seriousness of the Drug Trafficking Threat to the United States and 
Mexico:
Drug abuse and drug trafficking pose enormous threats to the American 
and Mexican people. The health of our youth and the safety of our 
neighborhoods are at stake. The powers of our democratic institutions 
and of our law enforcement organizations are challenged by international 
criminal organizations that operate seamlessly across our borders. 
Multi-ton quantities of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and now 
methamphetamine, find their way to American streets far from our 
borders, much of it having come across our common border.
A Joint United States-Mexico Commitment to Confront Drug Trafficking:
On March 1, I certified to the Congress that the Government of Mexico 
cooperated fully to comply with the objectives of the 1988 United 
Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances. President Zedillo and I have agreed to mount a 
sustained offensive against drug use, production, and trafficking 
organizations. We will arrest

[[Page 274]]

and bring drug traffickers to justice. We will make it more difficult 
for illegal profits to be laundered, and we will seize drug assets at 
every opportunity. We will work together to stop the illegal diversion 
of chemicals for drug manufacturing, and improve our capabilities to 
stop drugs at our border. To coordinate our efforts, Mexico and the 
United States formed a High Level Contact Group on Drug Control, which 
met for the first time March 27 in Mexico City. That group will continue 
indefinitely. It will meet next at the end of June in the United States, 
and thereafter in December, in Mexico.
A United States Plan of Action for Increased Cooperation With Mexico:
This directive prescribes specific measures that will be taken to 
accomplish these shared objectives; measures that will increase the 
effectiveness of the counter-drug cooperation between our two 
governments.
1. Quantifying the Drug Trafficking Threat to Our Two Nations
A prerequisite for more effective bilateral action is a shared and 
objective assessment of the level of drug production, trafficking 
activities, and the threat of corruption in both countries.
In order to establish a common view of the problem, the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) will coordinate other United States 
Government agencies in order to work effectively with officials 
designated by President Zedillo to produce a white paper that 
comprehensively describes the threat posed by cultivation, production, 
and trafficking of drugs such as cocaine, heroin, marijuana, 
methamphetamine, and diversion of pharmaceuticals such as rohypnol, in 
both the United States and Mexico. Particular attention will be paid to 
drug trafficking activities across the Southwest border.
This report will be presented to the U.S.-Mexico High Level Contact 
Group on Drugs during its next meeting in June.
2. Developing a Joint Drug Control Strategy
We need a strategy to provide general guidance and specific direction to 
the efforts of the departments and agencies of our two countries.
I have directed the Director of National Drug Control Policy to 
expeditiously develop a binational drug control strategy in conjunction 
with the Government of Mexico. The strategy must increase the security 
and integrity of our shared border, while respecting the sovereign 
rights of each nation.
3. Reducing the Demand for Illegal Drugs in Our Two Countries
Prevention and treatment programs have contributed to a marked reduction 
in the number of drug users in the United States in the past decade. The 
number of casual drug users has dropped by almost half and the number of 
cocaine users by over a third. Mexico, likewise, has enjoyed positive 
results in its drug prevention programs. Both the United States and 
Mexico stand to benefit by sharing information on demand reduction 
programs that work.
The Office of National Drug Control Policy will organize multi-agency 
United States Government efforts to exchange expertise with appropriate 
organizations within the Mexican Government for information on 
successful reduction programs.

[[Page 275]]

In the interests of enriching bilateral information exchange, U.S. 
agencies should take steps to ensure that the Mexican Government 
receives copies of relevant public reports and published studies 
relating to drug abuse education, trafficking patterns, money 
laundering, and so forth. The two governments will also work jointly to 
develop a protocol for exchange of more sensitive information.
4. Assessing U.S. Counter-drug Programs Along the Southwest Border
The increasing two-way trade between our nations must not be permitted 
to be used as a cover for drug trafficking.
I have directed the Departments of the Treasury, Justice, Defense, and 
other relevant agencies to conduct a comprehensive review of all 
Federal, State, and local efforts to prevent drug trafficking across the 
Southwest border.
This review will be coordinated by the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy. It will also consider bilateral measures that can be taken to 
decrease the flow of drugs across the Southwest border. The results of 
this review shall be submitted to the President's Council on Counter-
Narcotics within 180 days.
5. Attacking Methamphetamine Production and Trafficking
Methamphetamine has become the drug of choice in California and is 
becoming more common across the rest of the United States. Clandestine 
labs in both countries produce tons of this dangerous drug. The 
Department of Justice (DOJ) has just developed a concept to address 
domestic consumption, production, and trafficking of methamphetamine.
The Department of Justice will continue to lead the U.S.-Mexico Plenary 
Group of Senior Law Enforcement Officials to produce a binational and 
interagency methamphetamine strategy. The DOJ will make regular reports 
to the High Level Contact Group through ONDCP of the progress and plans 
that result from the working sessions, and will report methamphetamine 
accomplishments at the next meeting of the High Level Contact Group.
6. Controlling Essential and Precursor Chemicals
Essential and precursor chemicals for the manufacture of all types of 
illegal drugs must be more carefully controlled.
The Department of Justice will continue to lead the U.S.-Mexico Plenary 
Group of Senior Law Enforcement Officials to produce a binational and 
interagency strategy and action plan for chemical controls not included 
in the methamphetamine action plan. The DOJ will make regular reports on 
plans and progress through ONDCP to the High Level Contact Group.
7. Combating Money Laundering and Other Financial Crimes
Drug trafficking organizations are profit oriented. Their illicit gains 
must be converted into legal instruments if the profit is to be 
realized. Money laundering is an essential component of the drug 
trafficking cycle.
Working through the U.S.-Mexico Plenary Group of Senior Law Enforcement 
Officials, the Departments of State, Justice, and the Treasury will 
develop recommendations for strengthening legislation to combat drug and 
other serious crime-related money laundering activities in Mexico 
through a combination of criminal penalties, large value and suspicious 
transaction reporting, as well as laws providing for the seizure and 
forfeiture of the

[[Page 276]]

proceeds and instrumentalities of crime and for international 
cooperation in the tracing, forfeiting, and equitable sharing of such 
assets. In addition, the Departments that comprise the Plenary Group 
will produce a plan for training anti-money-laundering law enforcement 
specialists, and a plan to expand the exchange of information to protect 
the integrity of financial institutions. They will report progress and 
plans through ONDCP to the High Level Contact Group.
A report on progress achieved in this area will be presented to the 
U.S.-Mexico High Level Contact Group on Drugs during its next meeting in 
June.
8. Improving Bilateral Law Enforcement Cooperation
Bilateral U.S.-Mexican law enforcement cooperation is at an historic 
high. However, more can be done.
The U.S.-Mexico Plenary Group of Senior Law Enforcement Officials will 
continue to be the principal coordinating mechanism for bilateral law 
enforcement cooperation. The Department of Justice will continue to lead 
that Group. The DOJ will make regular reports to the High Level Contact 
Group through ONDCP of the progress and plans that result from the 
working sessions, and will report law enforcement cooperation 
accomplishments at the next meeting of the High Level Contact Group. The 
basic principle to be followed is that coordination will be facilitated 
at the lowest possible echelons and produce measurable results.
Recommendations from the Plenary Group will also be presented to the 
U.S.-Mexico High Level Contact Group on Drugs during its next meeting in 
June.
9. Capturing Fugitives from Justice
The principle that no felon should be able to escape justice by using a 
border defines the joint U.S.-Mexico approach to fugitive issues.
The Department of Justice, operating through the U.S.-Mexico Plenary 
Group of Senior Law Enforcement Officials will improve the mechanism for 
return of fugitives from one country to the other. Those mechanisms will 
fully respect the absolute sovereignty of each nation's laws.
The DOJ will make regular reports to the High Level Contact Group 
through ONDCP of the progress and plans that result from the Plenary 
Group sessions, and will report law enforcement cooperation 
accomplishments at the next meeting of the High Level Contact Group.
10. Sharing Information and Helping Criminal Prosecution
We must assure that criminals do not escape punishment because of an 
inability to investigate or produce evidence for trial.
The U.S.-Mexico Plenary Group of Senior Level Law Enforcement Officials 
will produce recommendations for both countries to improve access to law 
enforcement and prosecutorial evidence and information. The Group will 
report its progress at the June meeting of the High Level Contact Group.
11. Denying Our Sovereign Territory to Drug Trafficking
International drug trafficking organizations routinely violate the 
sovereign air, land, and sea space of nations. We must find ways to 
shield our sovereign territories from these criminal violations.

[[Page 277]]

The ONDCP will coordinate an interagency effort to develop unilateral 
and bilateral measures to prevent drug traffickers from violating our 
sovereignty. Such measures must fully respect the undisputed sovereign 
authority of each government within its national territory. 
Participating departments will include Justice, State, the Treasury, and 
Defense. Particular attention will be paid to large shipments of illegal 
drugs to Mexico and the United States.
An interim report will be presented to the U.S.-Mexico High Level 
Contact Group on Drugs during its next meeting in June.
12. Employing High Technology
Mexico eradicated more drug crops than any other country in the world in 
1995. The United States, likewise, has pursued a nationwide eradication 
effort. Technical exchanges, in such areas as use of high technology and 
environmental protection, will benefit the eradication programs of both 
countries.
The ONDCP will coordinate an interdepartmental study on these issues. 
The study will be conducted in conjunction with the Government of 
Mexico. The Departments of Defense and State, and other relevant U.S. 
agencies will participate in this study.
Specific recommendations will be submitted to the U.S.-Mexico High Level 
Contact Group on Drugs within 180 days.
13. Summarizing Success
The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy is directed 
to submit a review of the results of cooperative U.S.-Mexico efforts 
against drug production and trafficking to the President's Council on 
Counter-Narcotics, prior to December 31, 1996.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, April 8, 1996.
Presidential Determination No. 96-22 of April 18, 1996
Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act of 1962, as Amended
Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act 
of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is 
important to the national interest that up to $22 million be made 
available from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration 
Assistance Fund to meet the urgent needs of refugees and victims of 
conflict from the former Yugoslavia. These funds may be used as 
necessary to provide U.S. contributions in response to the appeals of 
international and nongovernmental organizations for funds to meet the 
urgent and unforeseen humanitarian needs of victims of conflict from the 
former Yugoslavia.

[[Page 278]]

You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of 
the Congress of the determination and the obligation of funds under this 
authority and to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, April 18, 1996.
Memorandum of April 22, 1996
Additional Transportation Planning To Address Impacts of Transportation 
on National Parks
Transportation in national parks--including ground transportation of 
visitors into the parks and airplane flights over the parks--has a 
significant impact on a visitor's experience of the park and on park 
management. The Secretary of Transportation has both valuable expertise 
and regulatory authority to address certain of these issues, and has 
been working on them with the Secretary of the Interior and others.
Aircraft flying at low altitudes over national parks can, if not 
properly managed, mar the natural beauty of the parks and create 
significant noise problems as well. The intrusion of such aircraft can 
interfere with wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), 
cultural resources and ceremonies, and visitors' enjoyment of parks, 
including the ability to experience natural sounds without interruption 
from mechanical noise. Several parks face overflight problems, including 
Grand Canyon National Park where substantial restoration of natural 
quiet is mandated by law, and several others identified by the National 
Park Service (NPS). It is important to the future of parks to address 
these problems quickly and in a fair and reasonable manner.
In addition, the National Park System contains thousands of miles of 
roads. All too often in peak visitor periods roads are so crowded with 
cars that the congestion and competition for space diminish the quality 
of the public's experience. Parks are not too full of people, but the 
roads and parking areas often are jammed. With modern technology and 
alternative transportation systems, the parks can continue to be 
accessible to all, and can be more enjoyable places to experience and 
learn about nature and history.
Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Secretary 
of Transportation in consultation with the heads of relevant departments 
and agencies to continue the ongoing development of rules as set out 
below to address overflights of the National Parks:
    1. For Grand Canyon National Park,
      (a) issue proposed regulations within 90 days to place appropriate 
limits on sightseeing aircraft over the Grand Canyon National Park to 
reduce the noise immediately and make further substantial progress 
toward restoration of natural quiet, as defined by the Secretary of the 
Interior, while maintaining aviation safety in accordance with the 
Overflights Act (Public

[[Page 279]]

Law 100-91). Action on this rulemaking to accomplish these purposes 
should be completed by the end of 1996; and
      (b) should any final rulemaking determine that issuance of a 
further management plan is necessary to substantially restore natural 
quiet in the Grand Canyon National Park, complete within 5 years a plan 
that addresses how the Federal Aviation Administration and NPS will 
complete the ``substantial restoration and maintenance of natural 
quiet,'' as defined by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with 
the Overflights Act. Any such plan shall ensure that the restoration of 
natural quiet required by the Overflights Act shall be completed in the 
park not more than 12 years from the date of issuance of this directive 
as recommended in NPS's 1994 ``Report on Effects of Aircraft Overflights 
on the National Park System.''
    2. For Rocky Mountain National Park, complete and issue, if 
appropriate, within 90 days, a notice of proposed rulemaking to address 
the potential adverse impact on the park and its visitors of overflights 
by sightseeing aircraft, keeping in mind the value of natural quiet and 
the natural experience in the park, as well as protection of public 
health and safety.
    3. Issue by the end of 1996 a notice of proposed rulemaking for the 
management of sightseeing aircraft in those National Parks where it is 
deemed necessary to reduce or prevent the adverse effects of such 
aircraft. The regulation should, at a minimum, establish a framework for 
managing air traffic over those park units identified in the 1994 NPS 
study, as priorities for (1) resolution of airspace issues and (2) 
maintaining or restoring natural quiet.
    4. Develop appropriate educational and other materials for the 
public at large and all aviation interests that describe the importance 
of natural quiet to park visitors and the need for cooperation from the 
aviation community. This guidance shall also recognize that, in some 
parks, air tours provide important access to approved areas in those 
parks, especially with regard to the disabled communities.
In addition, with respect to ground transportation in the parks, the 
Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Transportation, is directed as follows:
    To develop a plan for a comprehensive effort to improve public 
transportation in the national parks. This plan should include:
      1. design of pilot programs for improved public transportation in 
the Grand Canyon, Zion, and Yosemite National Parks;
      2. plans to work with relevant State, local, and tribal 
governments on this effort;
      3. options to increase access to the parks by rebuilding 
infrastructure in the parks; and
      4. recommendations to enhance resource protection and the quality 
of visitor experience through innovative transportation planning 
including, where possible and appropriate, the use of alternative fuel 
vehicles.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Memorandum of April 22, 1996
Facilitating Public-Private Partnerships for Protection of the National 
Parks
Many important efforts are already underway in which the private sector 
works in partnership with government to protect or maintain public 
lands. These include the work of the National Park Foundation, an 
organization created by the Congress in 1967 to receive private gifts 
and make disbursements to benefit the parks; cooperative agreements 
between the private sector and State and local parks to share resources 
and equipment and to provide valuable services, including maintenance 
services, to the parks; and agreements with willing private parties to 
acquire conservation easements. In an effort to ensure that the public-
private partnerships that can enhance park protection and maintenance 
are as effective as possible, I hereby direct the following action:
    1. The Secretary of the Interior is to provide to me, within 30 
days, a specific proposal for ways in which the National Park 
Foundation's role in fostering public-private partnerships on behalf of 
the parks can be invigorated through either administrative or 
legislative action.
    2. The Secretary of the Interior is to provide to me a legislative 
proposal that would make permanently available to the National Park 
System the authority to enter into cooperative agreements on behalf of 
the parks. This proposal should be consistent with the temporary 
authority that would be provided by enactment of my 1997 budget proposal 
as submitted to the Congress.
    3. The Secretary of the Interior is to provide a report to me within 
6 months on options for preserving historic structures within National 
Parks. This report should consider the possibilities for partnerships 
with businesses, associations, and individuals in the private sector.
    4. The Secretary of the Interior shall work with the Congress to 
pass legislation that would allow the implementation of the 1995 
National Park Service study to protect vistas surrounding Point Reyes 
National Seashore, California, while retaining existing private uses 
through actions including the purchase of conservation easements from 
willing private sellers. The Secretary of the Interior shall also give 
priority to funding such purchases from existing funds should 
authorization for such purchases be enacted. In addition, to the extent 
permitted by law and within existing budget authority, the Secretary 
shall exercise his existing authority to make a minor boundary 
adjustment as necessary to carry out the purposes of the National Park 
Service study to add property to Point Reyes National Seashore prior to 
enactment of such legislation, and to make available an amount of funds 
not to exceed $1 million to purchase such property from willing sellers.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of April 28, 1996
Exports of Alaskan North Slope (ANS) Crude Oil
Pursuant to section 28(s) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, 30 
U.S.C. 185, I hereby determine that exports of crude oil transported 
over right-of-

[[Page 283]]

way granted pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline 
Authorization Act are in the national interest. In making this 
determination, I have taken into account the conclusions of an 
interagency working group, which found that such oil exports:

    --will not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum 
available to the United States; and
    --are not likely to cause sustained material oil supply shortages or 
sustained oil price increases significantly above world market levels 
that would cause sustained material adverse employment effects in the 
United States or that would cause substantial harm to consumers, 
including those located in noncontiguous States and Pacific Territories.

I have also considered the interagency group's conclusions regarding 
potential environmental impacts of lifting the ban. Based on their 
findings and recommendations, I have concluded that exports of such 
crude oil will not pose significant risks to the environment if certain 
terms and conditions are met.
Therefore, pursuant to section 28(s) of the Mineral Leasing Act I direct 
the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate immediately a general license, 
or a license exception, authorizing exports of such crude oil, subject 
to appropriate documentation requirements, and consistent with the 
following conditions:

    --tankers exporting ANS exports must use the same route that they do 
for shipments to Hawaii until they reach a point 300 miles due south of 
Cape Hinchinbrook Light and then turn toward Asian destinations. After 
reaching that point, tankers in the ANS oil trade must remain outside of 
the 200 nautical-miles Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States as 
defined in the Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 
1811). This condition also applies to tankers returning from foreign 
ports to Valdez, Alaska. Exceptions can be made at the discretion of the 
vessel master only to ensure the safety of the vessel;
    --that export tankers be equipped with satellite-based 
communications systems that will enable the Coast Guard independently to 
determine their location. The Coast Guard will conduct appropriate 
monitoring of the tankers, a measure that will ensure compliance with 
the 200-mile condition, and help the Coast Guard respond quickly to any 
emergencies;
    --the owner or operator of an Alaskan North Slope crude oil export 
tankship shall maintain a Critical Area Inspection Plan for each 
tankship in the trade in accordance with the U.S. Coast Guard's 
Navigation and Inspection Circular No. 15-91 as amended, which shall 
include an annual internal survey of the vessel's cargo block tanks; and
    --the owner or operator of an Alaskan North Slope crude oil export 
tankship shall adopt a mandatory program of deep water ballast exchange 
(i.e., in 2,000 meters water depth). Exceptions can be made at the 
discretion of the captain only in order to ensure the safety of the 
vessel. Recordkeeping subject to Coast Guard audit will be required as 
part of this regime.

appropriate committees of the Congress of this determination and to

Notice of May 24, 1996
Continuation of Emergency With Respect to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Bosnian Serbs
On May 30, 1992, by Executive Order 12808, President Bush declared a 
national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and 
Montenegro, blocking all property and interests in property of those 
Governments. President Bush took additional measures to prohibit trade 
and other transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia 
and Montenegro) by Executive Orders 12810 and 12831, issued on June 5, 
1992, and January 15, 1993, respectively. On April 25, 1993, I issued 
Executive Order 12846, blocking the property and interests in property 
of all commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or 
entities organized or located in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro), and prohibiting trade-related transactions by 
United States persons involving those areas of the Republic of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina controlled by Bosnian Serb forces and the United Nations 
Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia. On October 25, 1994, because 
of the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serbs, I expanded the scope 
of the national emergency to block the property of the Bosnian Serb 
forces and the authorities in the territory that they control within the 
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well

[[Page 287]]

as the property of any entity organized or located in, or controlled by 
any person in, or resident in, those areas.
On December 27, 1995, I issued Presidential Determination No. 96-7, 
directing the Secretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the 
application of sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro) pursuant to the above-referenced Executive 
orders and to continue to block property previously blocked until 
provision is made to address claims or encumbrances, including the 
claims of the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia. This 
sanctions relief, in conformity with United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Resolution''), 
was an essential factor motivating Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of 
the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
initialled by the parties in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995, and 
signed in Paris on December 14, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Peace 
Agreement''). The sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) were accordingly suspended 
prospectively, effective January 16, 1996. Sanctions imposed on the 
Bosnian Serb forces and authorities and on the territory that they 
control within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were subsequently 
suspended prospectively, effective May 10, 1996, also in conformity with 
the Peace Agreement and Resolution.
In the last year, substantial progress has been achieved to bring about 
a settlement on the conflict in the former Yugoslavia acceptable to the 
parties. Before agreeing to the sanctions suspension, the United States 
insisted on a credible reimposition mechanism to ensure the full 
implementation of the Peace Agreement. Thus, Resolution 1022 provides a 
mechanism to reimpose the sanctions if the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia or the Bosnian Serb authorities fail significantly to meet 
their obligations under the Peace Agreement. It also provides that 
sanctions will not be terminated until after the first free and fair 
elections occur in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as provided 
for in the Peace Agreement, and provided that the Bosnian Serb forces 
have continued to respect the zones of separation as provided in the 
Peace Agreement. The Resolution also provides for the continued blocking 
of assets potentially subject to conflicting claims and encumbrances, 
including the claims of the other successor states of the former 
Yugoslavia, until provision is made to address them.
Because the resolution of the crisis and conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia that resulted from the actions and policies of the Government 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and of 
the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory that they 
control, will not be complete until such time as the Peace Agreement is 
implemented fully and the terms of Resolution 1022 have been met, the 
national emergency declared on May 30, 1992, as expanded in scope on 
October 25, 1994, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with 
that emergency must continue beyond May 30, 1996.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
and the Bosnian Serb forces and those areas of the Republic of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian Serb forces.

Presidential Determination No. 96-27 of May 28, 1996
U.S.-Israel Arrow Deployability Program
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law 103-160, I hereby 
certify that:
    --the United States and the Government of Israel have entered into 
an agreement governing the conduct and funding of the Arrow 
Deployability Program;
    --the Arrow Deployability Program will benefit the United States and 
has not been barred by other Congressional direction;
    --the Arrow missile successfully completed a flight test on June 12, 
1994, in which it intercepted a target missile under realistic test 
conditions; and
    --the Government of Israel is continuing, in accordance with its 
previous public commitments, to adhere to export controls pursuant to 
the Guidelines and Annex of the Missile Technology Control Regime.
You are authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this 
determination and to publish it in the Federal Register.

    Washington, May 28, 1996.
Presidential Determination No. 96-28 of May 29, 1996
Vietnamese Cooperation in Accounting for United States Prisoners of War 
and Missing in Action (POW/MIA)
Consistent with section 609 of the Fiscal Year 1996 Omnibus 
Appropriations Act, Public Law 104-134, I hereby determine, based on all 
information available to the United States Government that the 
Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, is cooperating in full 
faith with the United States in the following areas:
    (1) Resolving discrepancy cases, live sightings and field 
activities;
    (2) Recovering and repatriating American remains;

[[Page 289]]

    (3) Accelerating efforts to provide documents that will help lead to 
the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIA's; and
    (4) Providing further assistance in implementing trilateral 
investigations with Laos.
I have been advised by the Department of Justice and believe that 
section 609 is unconstitutional because it purports to condition the 
execution of responsibilities--the authority to recognize, and to 
maintain diplomatic relations with, a foreign government--that the 
Constitution commits exclusively to the President. I am, therefore, 
providing this determination as a matter of comity, while reserving my 
position that the condition enacted in section 609 is unconstitutional.
Finally, in making this determination, I wish to emphasize my continuing 
personal commitment to the entire POW/MIA community, especially to the 
immediate families, relatives, friends and supporters of these brave 
individuals, and to reconfirm that the central, guiding principle of my 
Vietnam policy is to achieve the fullest possible accounting for our 
prisoners of war and missing in action.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination to the 
appropriate committees of the Congress and to publish it in the Federal 
Register.

Amended--Continuation of Waiver Authority
Pursuant to the authority vested in me under the Trade Act of 1974, as

determine, pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 
2432(d)(1), that the further extension of the waiver authority granted 
by subsection 402(c) of the Act will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act. I further determine that 
continuation of the waiver applicable to the People's Republic of China 
will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act.
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the

Presidential Determination No. 96-33 of June 21, 1996
Reconfirmation of Findings With Respect to the Trade Agreement With the 
People's Republic of China
Since February 1, 1992, the United States of America and the People's 
Republic of China have had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade 
Relations, in relation to which, pursuant to my authority under 
subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I 
reconfirm that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and 
services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement and that 
actual or foreseeable reductions in U.S. tariffs and nontariff barriers 
to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are, and continuously 
have been, satisfactorily reciprocated by the People's Republic of 
China.

Presidential Determination No. 96-34 of June 26, 1996
Bosnian Compliance on Withdrawal of Foreign Forces and Terminating 
Intelligence Cooperation With Iran
Pursuant to Public Law 104-122, I hereby determine and certify that:
    <bullet> the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has complied with 
Article III of Annex 1-A of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina concerning the withdrawal of foreign forces; and 
that
    <bullet> intelligence cooperation on training, investigations and 
related activities between Iranian officials and Bosnian officials has 
been terminated.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination and 
certification to the appropriate committees of the Congress and to 
publish it in the Federal Register.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, June 26, 1996.
Memorandum of Justification
On June 26, 1996, pursuant to Public Law 104-122, the President 
determined and certified that:
    <bullet> the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has complied with 
Article III of Annex 1-A of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina concerning the withdrawal of foreign forces; and 
that
    <bullet> intelligence cooperation on training, investigations, and 
related activities between Iranian officials and Bosnian officials has 
been terminated.

The President reached this determination on the basis of all available 
information. We have also received explicit assurances from the Bosnian 
Government that foreign forces have been withdrawn and that the 
intelligence and military relationship with Iran has ended.
With respect to foreign forces, while some individuals have assimilated 
into Bosnian society and assumed civilian roles, there is no evidence of 
any remaining organized military units of Mujahedin or other foreign 
forces in Bosnia. With respect to the Iranians, the Bosnian government 
has assured that all IRGC personnel we identified to them have left 
Bosnia. We have no evidence that those IRGC remain. The Bosnian 
government has

[[Page 293]]

also assured us that none of the Iranians can be brought back to Bosnia 
without its knowledge and that, should any of them return, they would be 
expelled.
Although we have insisted that the Bosnian government end bilateral 
intelligence cooperation in such operational areas as training and 
investigations, and end all military ties, we have never demanded that 
all Iranian nationals depart Bosnia or that Bosnia terminate diplomatic 
or economic relations with Tehran. The Bosnian government has moved to 
end the operational military and intelligence relationship with Iran. It 
has removed from positions of authority key officials that were heavily 
engaged in intelligence cooperation with Iran, including the former head 
of the Bosnian intelligence agency.
We will continue to monitor compliance and will work with the Bosnian 
Government through a Joint Commission established in Sarajevo to resolve 
future allegations of non-compliance.

Notice of July 22, 1996
Continuation of Iraqi Emergency
On August 2, 1990, by Executive Order 12722, President Bush declared a 
national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iraq. By 
Executive Orders 12722 of August 2, 1990, and 12724 of August 9, 1990, 
the President imposed trade sanctions on Iraq and blocked Iraqi 
government assets. Because the Government of Iraq has continued its 
activities hostile to United States interests in the Middle East, the 
national emergency declared on August 2, 1990, and the measures adopted 
on August 2 and August 9, 1990, to deal with that emergency must 
continue in effect beyond August 2, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iraq.

This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Facilitation Act of 1995, title VI, Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1996, Public Law 
104-107 (``the Act''), I hereby:
    (1) Certify that it is in the national interest to suspend the 
application of the following provisions of law through February 12, 
1997:
      (A) Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended 
(22 U.S.C. 2227), as it applies with respect to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization or entities associated with it;
      (B) Section 114 of the Department of State Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (22 U.S.C. 287e note), as it applies with 
respect to the Palestine Liberation Organization or entities associated 
with it;
      (C) Section 1003 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5202); and
      (D) Section 37, Bretton Woods Agreement Act (22 U.S.C. 286w), as 
it applies to the granting to the Palestine Liberation Organization of 
observer status or other official status at any meeting sponsored by or 
associated with the International Monetary Fund.
    (2) certify that the Palestine Liberation Organization, the 
Palestinian Authority, and successor entities are complying with the 
commitments described in section 604(b)(4) of the Act.
    (3) certify that funds provided pursuant to the exercise of the

You are authorized and directed to transmit this determination to the

Notice of August 14, 1996
Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations
On August 19, 1994, consistent with the authority provided me under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), I 
issued Executive Order No. 12924. In that order, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States in 
light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as 
amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). Because the Export Administration 
Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national emergency 
declared on August 19, 1994, must continue in effect beyond August 19, 
1996. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12924.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

forth in the Act of supporting efforts to locate and repatriate members 
of the United States Armed Forces and civilians employed directly or 
indirectly by the United States Government who remain unaccounted for

Memorandum of August 30, 1996
Determinations Under Section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 
304 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 
Concerning Broom Corn Brooms
On August 1, 1996, the United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) submitted to me a report that included:
    (a) a determination pursuant to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 
(``the Trade Act'') that imports of broom corn brooms are being imported 
into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a 
substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry producing 
an article like or directly competitive with the imported article;
    (b) a finding pursuant to section 311(a) of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (``NAFTA Act'') that imports 
of broom corn brooms produced in Mexico account for a substantial share 
of total imports of such brooms and contribute importantly to the 
serious injury caused by imports; but that imports of broom corn brooms 
produced in Canada do not account for a substantial share of total 
imports and thus do not contribute importantly to the serious injury 
caused by imports;
    (c) a determination under section 302 of the NAFTA Act that, as a 
result of the reduction or elimination or a duty provided for under the 
NAFTA, broom corn brooms produced in Mexico are being imported into the 
United States in such increased quantities (in absolute terms) and under 
such conditions so that imports of the article, alone, constitute a 
substantial cause

[[Page 303]]

of serious injury to the domestic industry producing an article that is 
like, or directly competitive with, the imported article; and
    (d) recommendations for action by the President in response to these 
determinations.
Pursuant to section 203(a) of the Trade Act, I have determined to take 
appropriate and feasible action within my power that will facilitate 
efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to 
competition from imports of broom corn brooms. I have not implemented at 
this time any of the actions recommended by the USITC, because I believe 
it would be more appropriate first to seek a negotiated solution with 
appropriate foreign countries that would address the serious injury to 
our domestic broom corn broom industry, promote positive adjustment, and 
strike a balance among the various interests involved.
Therefore, after considering all relevant aspects of the investigation, 
including the factors set forth in section 203(a)(2) of the Trade Act, I 
hereby direct the Trade Representative to negotiate and conclude, within 
90 days, agreements of a type described in section 203(a)(3)(E) of the 
Trade Act, and to carry out any agreements reached. Not later than the 
end of this 90-day period, I would implement action of a type described 
in section 203(a)(3). I hereby direct the Secretaries of Agriculture, 
Commerce, and Labor to develop and present to me, within 90 days, a 
program of measures designed to enable our domestic industry producing 
broom corn brooms to adjust to import competition.
I agree with the USITC's finding under section 311(a) of the NAFTA Act, 
and therefore determine, pursuant to section 312(a) of the Act, that 
imports of broom corn brooms from Mexico account for a substantial share 
of total imports of such brooms and contribute importantly to the 
serious injury caused by imports; but that imports of broom corn brooms 
from Canada do not account for a substantial share of total imports and 
thus do not contribute importantly to the serious injury caused by 
imports. Therefore, pursuant to section 312(b) of the NAFTA Act, 
agreements reached, and action of a type described in section 203(a)(3) 
of the Trade Act, would apply to imports of broom corn brooms from 
Mexico, but would not apply to imports of broom corn brooms from Canada. 
Also, in light of the USITC's findings, any agreements and action would 
not apply to imports of broom corn brooms from Israel.
As a result of the action I have taken under section 203 of the Trade 
Act, I have fully preserved my ability to implement tariff increases of 
a magnitude equal to or greater than the increases recommended by USITC 
commissioners under section 303 of the NAFTA Act. Section 203 of the 
Trade Act also authorizes a wider array of types of action than the 
tariff increases permitted under the NAFTA Act. Thus, through section 
203 of the Trade Act, I maintain the full power to address the serious 
injury found by the USITC to have resulted from the reduction in tariffs 
under the NAFTA. For these reasons, I have determined that additional 
action under section 304 of the NAFTA Act is not necessary and would not 
provide greater benefits than costs.

POW/MIA Military Drawdown for Cambodia
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 535 of the 1996 
Foreign Operations Assistance Act (Public Law 104-107) (the ``Act''), I

set forth in the Act of supporting efforts to locate and repatriate 
members of the United States Armed Forces and civilians employed 
directly or indirectly by the United States Government who remain 
unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.
Therefore, I hereby authorize and direct the drawdown of up to $151,000 
of such defense articles from the stocks of the Department of Defense 
for Cambodia, for the purposes and under the authorities of section 535 
of the Act.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this

Presidential Determination No. 96-52 of September 12, 1996
Drawdown of Commodities and Services From the Departments of State, the 
Treasury, Defense and Justice for Presidential Security Support to the 
Government of Haiti
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the 
``Act''), I hereby determine that:
    (1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of 
funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the 
national interests of the United States; and
    (2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the 
inventory and resources of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Defense and Justice of an aggregate value not to exceed $3 million to 
provide augmentation and training for the Presidential security elements 
of the Government of Haiti.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the

Notice of September 16, 1996
Continuation of Emergency With Respect to UNITA
On September 26, 1993, by Executive Order 12865, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
(``UNITA''), prohibiting the sale or supply by United States persons or 
from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of 
arms and related material of

[[Page 306]]

all types, and petroleum and petroleum products to the territory of 
Angola, other than through designated points of entry. The order also 
prohibits the sale or supply of such commodities to UNITA. Because of 
our continuing international obligations and because of the prejudicial 
effect that discontinuation of the sanctions would have on the Angolan 
peace process, the national emergency declared on September 26, 1993, 
and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond September 26, 1996. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to 
UNITA.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 96-53 of September 26, 1996
Determination To Authorize the Furnishing of Emergency Military 
Assistance to Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda Under Section 506(a)(1) of

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(1) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1) (``the 
Act''), I hereby determine that:
    (1) an unforeseen emergency exists that requires immediate military 
assistance to Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda; and
    (2) the emergency requirement cannot be met under the authority of 
the Arms Export Control Act or under any other law except section 506 of 
the Act.
Therefore, I hereby authorize the furnishing of up to $10,000,000 in 
defense articles from the stocks of the Department of Defense, defense 
services of the Department of Defense and military education and 
training to assist the governments of Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 96-54 of September 28, 1996
Presidential Determination on Classified Information Concerning the Air 
Force's Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada
I find that it is in the paramount interest of the United States to 
exempt the United States Air Force's operating location near Groom Lake, 
Nevada (the subject of litigation in Kasza v. Browner (D. Nev. CV-S-94-
795-PMP) and Frost v. Perry (D. Nev. CV-S-94-714-PMP) from any 
applicable requirement for the disclosure to unauthorized persons of 
classified information concerning that operating location. Therefore, 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6961(a), I hereby exempt the Air Force's operating 
location near Groom Lake, Nevada, from any Federal, State, interstate or 
local provision respecting control and abatement of solid waste or 
hazardous waste disposal that would require the disclosure of classified 
information concerning that operating location to any unauthorized 
person. This exemption shall be effective for the full one-year 
statutory period.
Nothing herein is intended to: (a) imply that in the absence of such a 
Presidential exemption, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
(RCRA) or any other provision of law permits or requires disclosure of 
classified information to unauthorized persons; or (b) limit the 
applicability or enforcement of any requirement of law applicable to the 
Air Force's operating location near Groom Lake, Nevada, except those 
provisions, if any, that would require the disclosure of classified 
information.
The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized and directed to publish 
this determination in the Federal Register.

[[Page 308]]

    (1) an unforeseen emergency exists which requires immediate military

in the future participate in, ECOMOG; and
    (2) the emergency requirement cannot be met under the authority of 
the Arms Export Control Act or any other law except section 506 of the 
Act.

I therefore direct the drawdown from the inventory and resources of the 
Department of Defense of an aggregate value not to exceed $5 million in 
defense articles from the stocks of the Department of Defense, defense 
services of the Department of Defense and military education and 
training to provide assistance to the states currently participating 
(Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mali and Guinea), and for those states

Presidential Determination No. 96-57 of September 30, 1996
Drawdown of Articles, Services, and Military Education and Training From

and the Countries of the Eastern Caribbean
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(2) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(2) (``the

Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and the countries of the Eastern Caribbean 
Regional Security System (RSS), which are: Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, 
Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the

Therefore, I direct the drawdown in FY 1996 authority of up to $75 
million of articles, services, and military education and training from

Loan Guarantee to Israel Program
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 226(b) and section 
614(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (``the 
Act''), 22 U.S.C. 2186(b) and 22 U.S.C. 2364(a)(1), respectively, I 
hereby determine that:

[[Page 310]]

    (1) $307 million of loan guarantee authority pursuant to section 
226(a) and (b) of the Act for Fiscal Year 1997 is subject to the 
deduction requirements of section 226(d) of the Act; and
    (2) it is important to the security interests of the United States 
that the aforementioned amount shall be reduced by $247 million without 
regard to the deduction requirement of section 226(d) of the Act or any 
other provision of law within the scope of section 614 of the Act;

Therefore, I hereby authorize that such $247 million in loan guarantee 
authority shall remain available pursuant to section 226(a) and (b) of 
the Act and that $60 million in loan guarantee authority shall be 
deducted pursuant to section 226(d) of the Act.

Presidential Determination on FY 1997 Refugee Admissions Numbers and 
Authorizations of In-Country Refugee Status Pursuant to Sections 207 and 
101(a)(42), Respectively, of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and 
Determination Pursuant to Section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act, as Amended
In accordance with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(``the Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157), as amended, and after appropriate 
consultation with the Congress, I hereby make the following 
determinations and authorize the following actions:
  The admission of up to 78,000 refugees to the United States during FY 
1997 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the 
national interest; provided, however, that this number shall be 
understood as including persons admitted to the United States during FY 
1997 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian 
immigrant admissions program, as provided below.
The 78,000 funded admissions shall be allocated among refugees of 
special humanitarian concern to the United States as described in the 
documentation presented to the Congress during the consultations that 
preceded this determination and in accordance with the following 
regional allocations; provided, however, that the number allocated to 
the East Asia region shall include persons admitted to the United States 
during FY 1997 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance under 
section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related 
Programs Appropriations Act of 1988,

[[Page 311]]

as contained in section 101(e) of Public Law 100-202 (Amerasian 
immigrants and their family members); provided further that the number 
allocated to the former Soviet Union shall include persons admitted who 
were nationals of the former Soviet Union, or in the case of persons 
having no nationality, who were habitual residents of the former Soviet 
Union, prior to September 2, 1991:

                     Africa...........................      7,000       
                     East Asia........................     10,000       
                     Europe...........................     48,000       
                     Latin America/Caribbean..........      4,000       
                     Near East/South Asia.............      4,000       
                     Unallocated......................      5,000       
                                                                        

  The 5,000 unallocated federally funded numbers shall be allocated as 
needed. Unused admissions numbers allocated to a particular region 
within the 78,000 federally funded ceiling may be transferred to one or 
more other regions if there is an overriding need for greater numbers 
for the region or regions to which the numbers are being transferred. 
You are hereby authorized and directed to consult with the Judiciary 
Committees of the Congress prior to any such use of the unallocated 
numbers or reallocation of numbers from one region to another.

  Pursuant to section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance 
Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(b)(2), I hereby determine that 
assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the 
United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will 
contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States and 
designate such persons for this purpose.

  An additional 10,000 refugee admissions numbers shall be made 
available during FY 1997 for the adjustment to permanent resident status 
under section 209(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1159(b)) of aliens who have been granted asylum in the United States 
under section 208 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1158), as this is justified by 
humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.
In accordance with section 101(a)(42)(B) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(42)) and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I 
also specify that, for FY 1997, the following persons may, if otherwise 
qualified, be considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the 
United States within their countries of nationality or habitual 
residence:
    a. Persons in Vietnam
    b. Persons in Cuba

Notice of October 16, 1996
Continuation of Emergency With Respect to Significant Narcotics 
Traffickers Centered in Colombia
On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions of significant foreign narcotics traffickers 
centered in Colombia, and the unparalleled violence, corruption, and 
harm that they cause in the United States and abroad. The order blocks 
all property and interests in property of foreign persons listed in an 
Annex to the order, as well as foreign persons determined to play a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking centered in 
Colombia, to materially assist in, or provide financial or technological 
support for or goods or services in support of, the narcotics 
trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant to the 
order, or to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, 
persons designated in or pursuant to the order. The order also prohibits 
any transaction or dealing by United States persons or within the United 
States in such property or interests in property. Because the activities 
of significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to 
threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States and to cause unparalleled violence, corruption, and harm 
in the United States and abroad, the national emergency declared on 
October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 21, 1996. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency for 1 
year with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of October 29, 1996
Continuation of Iran Emergency
On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, for

[[Page 313]]

eign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the 
situation in Iran. Notices of the continuation of this national 
emergency have been transmitted annually by the President to the 
Congress and the Federal Register. The most recent notice appeared in 
the Federal Register on November 2, 1995. Because our relations with 
Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing 
the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is still underway, the 
national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. This notice 
shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the 
Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 97-1 of November 8, 1996
Assistance Program for the New Independent States of the Former Soviet 
Union
Pursuant to subsection (o) under the heading ``Assistance for the New 
Independent States of the Former Soviet Union'' in Title II of the 
Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations 
Act, for fiscal year 1996 (Public Law 104-107) and fiscal year 1997 
(Public Law 104-208), I hereby determine that it is important to the 
national security interest of the United States to make available funds 
appropriated under that heading without regard to the restriction in 
that subsection.
You are authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this 
determination and to arrange for its publication in the Federal 
Register.

Memorandum of Justification Regarding Determination Under Title II of 
the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act (Public Laws 104-107 and 104-208)
The Administration shares the deep concern of the Congress over Russian 
nuclear cooperation with Iran. Such cooperation, which could contribute 
over time to a nuclear-armed Iran, continues to be a threat not only to 
U.S. security interests, the Middle East Peace Process, and global 
stability, but also to Russian security interests as well. In dealing 
with this pressing issue, the Administration has repeatedly and 
strenuously objected to any form of nuclear cooperation with Iran. The 
President has raised the impor

[[Page 314]]

tant issue repeatedly and directly with President Yeltsin, including 
during their April 1996 meeting in Moscow. The Vice President discussed 
our concerns with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin most recently during their 
July Meeting in Moscow. The Administration has also established a multi-
level dialogue with the Russians and continues to give this issue the 
necessary high priority on the bilateral agenda. In addition, we have 
made clear to the Russians that we are not prepared to renew or expand 
the current U.S.-Russian Agreement on S&T Cooperation in the Field of 
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy because of Russia's ongoing nuclear 
cooperation with Iran. In addition, we informed the Russians in 1995 
that a Section 123 agreement would not be possible while Russian nuclear 
cooperation with Iran continues.
Subsection (o) under the heading, ``Assistance for the New Independent 
States of the Former Soviet Union,'' in Title II of the FY 1996 and FY 
1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Acts contain a restriction on 
assistance to Russia unless there is a Presidential determination that 
the Government of Russia has terminated implementation of arrangements 
to provide Iran with technical expertise, training, technology, or 
equipment necessary to develop a nuclear reactor or related nuclear 
research facilities or programs. Given present circumstances, the 
President is unable to make this determination. In order to further the 
national security interest of the United States, the President is 
exercising the authority provided by the Congress in subsection (o) to 
make funds available to Russia under these Acts without regard to this 
restriction.
The President takes this action because it remains important to the 
national security interest of the United States to continue support for 
the reform process in Russia. Assisting Russia and the other New 
Independent States in their transitions to democratic systems of 
government and market economies continues to be one of the 
Administration's highest foreign policy goals. As we noted in our 
previous determination, the outcome of this historic reform effort will 
have a critical impact on the future of regional and international peace 
and stability as well as the national security interests of the United 
States. Much has already been accomplished along the uncharted road to 
reform in Russia, including Russia's unprecedented 1996 Presidential 
elections. The transformation of Russia into a more democratic, market-
oriented society, however, is a long-term proposition, and the outcome 
is far from certain. The United States and the world community must 
remain steadfast in support of the people of Russia and the other New 
Independent States (NIS) during this important period of transition.
Our assistance and other cooperative programs continue to play a vital 
role promoting basic U.S. interests by furthering the reform process in 
Russia and bolstering fledgling democratic, market-oriented processes 
and institutions. With the Russian presidential elections complete, 
Russia must now accelerate major structural reforms, such as building 
the legal and institutional structures to support a market economy. To 
cut off assistance and thereby sharply cut back the influence Americans 
are having on Russian reform at this important juncture in Russia's 
history would be counterproductive. Most significantly, a withdrawal of 
assistance would undercut those in Russia who seek to build relations of 
a new kind with the United States, who support democratic and market 
economic principles, and who are helping to integrate Russia into global 
economic and security systems.

[[Page 315]]

We must continue to support two worthy foreign policy goals: supporting 
the reform process in Russia and ending Russian nuclear cooperation with 
Iran. Carefully designed and implemented assistance programs will help 
us to achieve the former, which in turn will help lessen the incentive 
for Russia to cooperate with Iran on nuclear programs. Active engagement 
with Russia at the highest levels will also help us accomplish this 
latter objective. We will continue to work with the Congress to achieve 
our mutual goals in this regard.
The President has made this determination because it is essential to 
enable us to continue to pursue with Russia our policy of pragmatic 
engagement, in which we seek to support U.S. national security and other 
interests by helping to integrate Russia into global economic and 
security systems as a cooperative, peaceful, and prosperous member of 
the world community.

Notice of November 12, 1996
Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction
On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons 
(``weapons of mass destruction'') and the means of delivering such 
weapons. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and 
the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 14, 1994, and extended on November 14, 1995, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 97-8 of November 27, 1996
Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act of 1962, as Amended
Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act 
of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is 
important to the national interest that up to $15 million be made 
available from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration 
Assistance Fund to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of refugees and 
migrants. These funds may be used to meet the urgent and unexpected 
needs of refugees, victims of conflict, and other persons at risk in and 
from northern Iraq. These funds may be used on a multilateral or 
bilateral basis as appropriate to provide contributions to international 
organizations, private voluntary organizations, governments, and other 
governmental and nongovernmental agencies. These funds may be used as 
reimbursement for expenses already incurred by the Department of State 
for these purposes and to pay related Department of State administrative 
expenses.

You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of 
the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under 
this authority and to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, November 27, 1996.
Justification for Presidential Determination Authorizing the Use of up 
to $15,000,000 From the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration 
Assistance Fund
Under section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 
1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c) (1), the President may authorize the 
furnishing of assistance from the United States Emergency Refugee and 
Migration Assistance Fund (the Fund) to meet ``unexpected urgent refugee 
and migration'' needs whenever he determines it is ``important to the 
national interest'' to do so. The President may furnish assistance and 
make contributions under this act notwithstanding any provisions of law 
which restrict assistance to foreign countries.
Between September 14 and September 18 the U.S. facilitated the 
evacuation of approximately 2,100 Kurdish employees of the U.S. 
Government and their dependents (Quick Transit I) who were considered to 
be at risk due to their close association with the U.S. Government. A 
second group has been evacuated. Due to the recent expansion of the 
Iraqi Government security presence in Northern Iraq, there are other 
persons who may need to be evacuated.
A drawdown from the Fund of up to $15,000,000 is required to respond to 
these unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs related to the 
crisis in Northern Iraq. These funds may be used as reimbursement for 
expenses already incurred by the Department of State for these purposes 
and to pay related Department of State administrative expenses. These 
funds also may be used to provide contributions to international 
organizations, private voluntary organizations, governments, and other 
governmental and non-governmental agencies. The need for these funds is 
urgent and was not foreseen in the appropriation and programming of the 
FY 1997 Migration and Refugee Assistance funds.
This drawdown furthers the U.S. national interest by providing 
humanitarian support where it is urgently needed.

Memorandum of November 28, 1996
Action Under Section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 Concerning Broom Corn 
Brooms
On August 1, 1996, the United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) submitted to me a report that contained: (1) a determination 
pursuant to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Trade Act'') 
that imports of broom corn brooms are being imported into the United 
States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of 
serious injury to the domestic industry; and (2) a finding pursuant to 
section 311(a) of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 
Implementation Act (``NAFTA Act'') and that imports of broom corn brooms 
produced in Mexico account for a substantial share of total imports of 
such brooms and contribute importantly to the serious injury caused by 
imports.
On August 30, 1996, I determined to take appropriate and feasible action 
that will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive 
adjustment to competition from imports of broom corn brooms. I did not 
implement at that time any of the actions recommended by the USITC, 
because I determined that it would be more appropriate first to seek a 
negotiated solution with appropriate foreign countries that would 
address the serious injury to our domestic broom corn broom industry, 
promote positive adjustment, and strike a balance among the various 
interests involved.
I therefore directed the Trade Representative to negotiate and conclude, 
within 90 days, agreements of a type described in section 203(a)(3)(E) 
of the Trade Act, and to carry out any agreements reached. I also 
directed the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor to develop 
and present, within 90 days, a program of measures designed to enable 
our domestic industry producing broom corn brooms to adjust to import 
competition.
The Trade Representative has informed me that her negotiations did not 
result in agreements meeting the goals that I had previously set. 
Therefore, after considering all relevant aspects of the investigation, 
including the factors set forth in section 203(a)(2) of the Trade Act, 
and the results of the activities undertaken over the previous 90 days, 
I have implemented actions of a type described in section 203(a)(3). I 
have determined that these actions will facilitate efforts by the 
domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition 
and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.
Specifically, I have proclaimed tariff relief for a period of three 
years that will provide time for the domestic industry to implement an 
adjustment plan that will facilitate its positive adjustment to import 
competition. This action meets the needs of the domestic industry, while 
striking a balance with the other interests of the United States by 
providing the minimum tariff relief necessary to promote such 
adjustment. No tariff relief is being provided on four of the six tariff 
subheadings subject to the injury determination. In addition, for the 
largest tariff subheading, duty-free treatment will be provided on a 
substantial annual quantity of broom corn broom imports from all import 
sources. In short, this action provides the domestic indus

[[Page 322]]

try with substantial temporary relief from increased import competition, 
while also assuring our trading partners significant continued duty-free 
access to the United States market.
I also note the substantial resources identified by the Departments of 
Agriculture and Commerce that can provide loans, grants, technical and 
in-kind assistance to the domestic industry as it implements its 
adjustment plan. Taken together, these programs have the potential to 
match the financial contribution that the domestic industry will make as 
it implements its adjustment plan. I urge the domestic industry to 
submit the necessary applications for consideration under the individual 
programs, and direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and Commerce to 
provide the appropriate assistance to the industry in completing the 
application process. I also direct the Departments of Agriculture and 
Commerce to give priority consideration to adjustment assistance 
requests, with the intent of providing the maximum appropriate 
assistance available.
The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program of the Department of Labor 
has already provided support for employees of broom corn broom 
manufacturers that have been laid off due to import competition. This 
assistance remains available, and I instruct the Secretary of Labor to 
give priority consideration to processing such TAA requests.
An additional issue considered during the course of the last 90 days was 
the possible circumvention of U.S. customs laws. As a result of 
information provided by the broom corn broom industry and other 
information collected by the U.S. Customs Service, an investigation is 
underway to determine whether any imports of broom corn brooms are 
entering the commerce of the United States in a manner inconsistent with 
U.S. law. I instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to pursue this matter 
with the intent of concluding this investigation within 90 days, and 
taking any other steps necessary to ensure broom corn broom imports do 
not circumvent U.S. law.
I also note that, pursuant to Section 204 of the Trade Act, the 
International Trade Commission will monitor developments with respect to 
the domestic industry, including progress and specific efforts made by 
workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment 
to import competition.
The United States Trade Representative is authorized and directed to 
publish this determination in the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 97-9 of December 2, 1996
Drawdown of Articles, Services, and Military Education and Training From 
DOD To Provide Anti-Narcotics Assistance to Mexico
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(2) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(2) (``the 
Act''), I hereby determine that it is in the national interest of the 
United States to draw down articles, services, and military education 
and training from the inventory and resources of the Department of 
Defense for the purpose of providing anti-narcotics assistance to 
Mexico.
Therefore, I direct the drawdown of up to $37 million of such articles, 
services, and military education and training from the Department of 
Defense for the Government of Mexico for the purposes and under the 
authorities of Chapter 8 of Part I of the Act.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress immediately and to arrange for its 
publication in the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 97-10 of December 3, 1996
Continued Vietnamese Cooperation in Accounting for United States 
Prisoners of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIA)
Consistent with section 609 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and 
State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1997, as 
contained in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, Public 
Law 104-208, I hereby determine, based on all relevant information 
available to the United States Government, that the Government of the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam continues to cooperate in full faith with 
the United States in four areas of accounting for American POW/MIA's:

    1. Resolving discrepancy cases, live sightings and field activities;
    2. Recovering and repatriating American remains;
    3. Accelerating efforts to provide documents that will help lead to 
the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIA's; and
    4. Providing further assistance in implementing trilateral 
investigations with Laos.

I have been advised by the Department of Justice and believe that 
section 609 is unconstitutional because it purports to condition the 
execution of

[[Page 324]]

responsibilities--the authority to recognize, and to maintain diplomatic 
relations with, a foreign government--that the Constitution commits 
exclusively to the President. I am, therefore, providing this 
determination as a matter of comity while preserving my position that 
the condition enacted in section 609 is unconstitutional.
In making this determination, I wish to reaffirm my continuing personal 
commitment to the entire POW/MIA community, especially to the immediate 
families, relatives, friends, and supporters of these brave individuals, 
and to reconfirm that the central, guiding principle of my Vietnam 
policy is to achieve the fullest possible accounting for our prisoners 
of war and missing in action.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination to the 
appropriate committees of the Congress and to publish it in the Federal 
Register

Determination Pursuant to Section 523 of the Foreign Operations, Export

Pursuant to section 523 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and 
Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (as enacted in Public Law 104-
208), I hereby certify that withholding from international financial 
institutions and other international organizations and programs funds

contrary to the national interest.
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the

Presidential Determination No. 97-12 of December 11, 1996
Drawdown of Commodities and Services From the Inventory and Resources of 
the Department of Defense To Support a Peace Monitoring Force in 
Northern Iraq
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by sections 552(c)(2) and 
614(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 
2348a(c)(2) and 2364(a)(1) (the ``Act''), I hereby determine that:
    (1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of 
funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the 
national interests of the United States;
    (2) an unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 Part II of the Act; and
    (3) it is important to the security interests of the United States 
to furnish up to $4 million of commodities and services from the 
inventory of the Department of Defense to support a Peace Monitoring 
Force in northern Iraq, without regard to any provision of law within 
the scope of section 614(a)(1) of the Act, including various 
restrictions on providing assistance to Iraq.
I therefore direct the drawdown of commodities and services from the 
inventory and resources of the Department of Defense of an aggregate 
value not to exceed $4 million to support a Peace Monitoring Force in 
northern Iraq.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress and arrange for its publication in the

Pursuant to sections 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act 
of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is 
important to the national interest that up to $38,000,000 be made 
available from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration 
Assistance Fund to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of refugees and 
migrants.
These funds may be used to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of 
refugees, victims of conflict, and other persons at risk in the Great 
Lakes region of Africa. These funds may be used on a multilateral or 
bilateral basis as appropriate to provide contributions to international 
organizations, private

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Standards


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The maintenance of the highest standards of honesty, integrity, 
impartiality, and conduct by regular employees and special Government 
employees is essential to assure the proper performance of Government 
business and the maintenance of confidence by citizens in their 
Government. The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest on the 
part of regular employees and special Government employees through 
informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these 
standards.
    (b) This part is intended to foster the foregoing concepts. It is 
issued in compliance with the requirements of Executive Order No. 11222 
of May 8, 1965, and is based upon the provisions of that order, the 
regulations of the Civil Service Commission issued thereunder (part 735 
of 5 CFR Ch. I), and the statutes cited elsewhere in this part.
    (c) This part, among other things reflects prohibitions and 
requirements imposed by the criminal and civil laws of the United 
States. However, the paraphrased restatements of criminal and civil 
statutes contained in this part are designed for informational purposes 
only and in no way constitute an interpretation or construction thereof 
that is binding upon the Federal Government. Moreover, this part does 
not purport to paraphrase or enumerate all restrictions or requirements 
imposed by statutes, Executive Orders, regulations or otherwise upon 
Federal employees and former Federal employees. The omission of a 
reference to any such restriction or requirement in no way alters the 
legal effect of that restriction or requirement and any such restriction 
or requirement, as the case may be, continues to be applicable to 
employees and former employees in accordance with its own terms. 
Furthermore, attorneys employed by an agency are subject to the canons 
of professional ethics of the American Bar Association.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-2  Definitions.

    In this subpart:
    (a) Agency means the following agencies in the Executive Office of

Office of Science and Technology, and the Special Representative for 
Trade Negotiations for the Office of the Special Representative for

<R05>
Sec. 100.735-3  Special Government employees.

    Except where specifically provided otherwise, or where limited in 
terms or by the context to regular employees, all provisions of this 
subpart relating to employees are applicable also to special Government 
employees.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-4  General standards of conduct.

    (a) All employees shall conduct themselves on the job in such a 
manner that the work of their agency is efficiently accomplished and 
courtesy, consideration, and promptness are observed in dealings with 
the Congress, the public, and other governmental agencies.
    (b) All employees shall conduct themselves off the job in such a 
manner as not to reflect adversely upon their agency or the Federal 
service.
    (c) In all circumstances employees shall conduct themselves so as to 
exemplify the highest standards of integrity. An employee shall avoid 
any action, whether or not specifically prohibited by this subpart, 
which might result in, or create the appearance of:
    (1) Using public office for private gain;
    (2) Giving preferential treatment to any person;
    (3) Impeding Government efficiency or economy;
    (4) Losing complete independence or impartiality;
    (5) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or
    (6) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-5  Responsibilities of employees.

    (a) The Executive Clerk for the White House Office and the Counselor 
for each other agency shall distribute copies of this subpart to each 
employee and special Government employee within 30 days after the 
effective date thereof. In the case of a new employee or special 
Government employee entering on duty after the date of such 
distribution, a copy shall be furnished at the time of his entrance on 
duty. All employees and special Government employees shall familiarize 
themselves with the contents of this subpart.
    (b) Copies of Executive Order 11222, regulations, and statutes 
referred to in Sec. 100.735-1, together with various explanatory 
materials are available for inspection in the Office of the Executive 
Clerk for the White House Office and the Counselor for each other agency 
at any time during regular business

[[Page 334]]

hours. Employees are encouraged to consult these basic materials in any 
case of doubt as to the proper application or interpretation of the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (c) Attention of all employees is directed to House Concurrent 
Resolution 175, 85th Congress, 2d session, 72 Stat. B12, the ``Code of 
Ethics for Government Service'', which is attached to this subpart as 
Appendix A.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-6  Interpretation and advisory service; counseling.

    (a) The agency head shall appoint a Counselor for the agency who 
shall serve also as the agency's designee to the Civil Service 
Commission on matters covered by this part. Communications between the 
Counselor and employee shall be confidential, except as otherwise 
determined by the agency head.
    (b) The Counselor for the agency shall notify all employees and 
special Government employees of the availability of counseling services, 
and of how and where such services are available. Such notification 
shall be made within 90 days after the effective date of this subpart 
and periodically thereafter. In the case of a new employee or special 
Government employee appointed after the date of such notification, 
notification shall be given at the time of his entrance on duty.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-7  Disciplinary action.

    (a) A violation of any provision of this subpart by an employee may 
be cause for appropriate disciplinary action which may be in addition to 
any penalties prescribed by law. (As to remedial action in cases where 
an employee's financial interests result in a conflict or apparent 
conflict of interest, see Sec. 100.735-26.)
    (b) Any disciplinary or remedial action taken pursuant to this 
subpart shall be effected in accordance with any applicable laws, 
Executive orders, and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-8  Conflicts of interest.

    (a) A conflict of interest may exist whenever an employee has a 
substantial personal or private interest in a matter which involves his 
duties and responsibilities as an employee. The maintenance of public 
confidence in Government clearly demands that an employee take no action 
which would constitute the use of his official position to advance his 
personal or private interest. It is equally important that each employee 
avoid becoming involved in situations which present the possibility, or 
even the appearance, that his official position might be used to his 
private advantage.
    (b) Neither the pertinent statutes nor the standards of conduct 
prescribed in this subpart are to be regarded as entirely comprehensive. 
Each employee must, in each instance involving a personal or private 
interest in a matter which also involves his duties and responsibilities 
as an employee, make certain that his actions do not have the effect or 
the appearance of the use of his official position for the furtherance 
of his own interests or those of his family or his business associates.
    (c) The principal statutory provisions relating to bribery, graft, 
and conflicts of interest are contained in Chapter 11 of the Criminal 
Code, 18 U.S.C. 201-224. Severe penalties are provided for violations, 
including variously fine, imprisonment, dismissal from office, and 
disqualification from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-9  Disqualification because of private financial interests.

    (a) Unless authorized to do so as provided hereafter in this 
section, no employee shall participate personally and substantially as a 
Government employee in a particular matter in which to his knowledge he 
has a financial interest (18 U.S.C. 208).
    (1) For the purposes of this section--
    (i) An employee participates personally and substantially in a 
particular matter through decision, approval, disapproval, 
recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise;
    (ii) A particular matter is a judicial or other proceeding, 
application, request for ruling or other determination, contract, claim, 
controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter; and
    (iii) A financial interest is the interest of the employee himself 
or his

[[Page 335]]

spouse, minor child, partner, organization in which he is serving as 
officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment.
    (b) An employee who has a financial interest (other than a financial 
interest exempted under paragraph (c) of this section) in a particular 
matter which is within the scope of his official duties shall make a 
full disclosure of that interest to the Counselor for the agency in 
writing. He shall not participate in such matter unless and until he 
receives a written determination by the agency head pursuant to section 
208 of Title 18, United States Code, that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect of him. If the agency head does 
not make such a determination he shall direct such remedial action as 
may be appropriate under the provisions of Sec. 100.735-26.
    (c) The financial interests described in this paragraph are hereby 
exempted pursuant to the provisions of section 208 of Title 18, United 
States Code, from the restrictions of paragraph (a) of this section and 
of section 208 of Title 18 as being too remote or inconsequential to 
affect the integrity of an employee's services in a matter.
    (1) Stocks, bonds, policies, properties, or interests in a mutual 
fund, investment company, trust, bank, or insurance company, as to which 
the employee has no managerial control or directorship. In the case of a 
mutual fund or investment company, this exemption applies only where the 
assets of the fund or company are diversified; it does not apply where 
the fund or company advertises that it specializes in a particular 
industry or commodity.
    (2) Interest in an investment club: Provided, That the fair value of 
the interest involved does not exceed $5,000, and that the interest does 
not exceed one-fourth of the total assets of the investment club.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-10  Additional prohibitions--regular employees.

    (a) In addition to the disqualification described in Sec. 100.735-9, 
a regular employee is subject to the following major prohibitions.
    (1) He may not, except in the discharge of his official duties, 
represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a matter in 
which the United States is a party or has an interest. This prohibition 
applies both to paid and unpaid representation of another (18 U.S.C. 203 
and 205).
    (2) He may not, after his Government employment has ended, represent 
anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which 
the United States is a party or has an interest and in which he 
participated personally and substantially for the Government (18 U.S.C. 
207(a)).
    (3) He may not, for 1 year after his Government employment has 
ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with 
a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and 
which was within the boundaries of his official responsibility during 
the last year of his Government service (18 U.S.C. 207(b)). (This 
temporary restraint is permanent if the matter is one in which he 
participated personally and substantially. See subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph.)
    (4) He may not receive any salary, or supplementation of his 
Government salary, from a private source as compensation for his 
services to the Government (18 U.S.C. 209). (See Sec. 100.735-13.)
    (b) Exemptions or exceptions from the prohibitions described in 
paragraph (a) of this section are permitted under certain circumstances. 
For the method of obtaining such exemptions or exceptions, see paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 100.735-12.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-11  Additional prohibitions--special Government employees.

    (a) In addition to the disqualification described in Sec. 100.735-9, 
a special Government employee is subject to the following major 
prohibitions.
    (1) He may not, except in the discharge of his official duties--
    (i) Represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a 
matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in 
which he has at any time participated personally and substantially for 
the Government (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205), or

[[Page 336]]

    (ii) Represent anyone else in a matter pending before his agency 
unless he served there no more than 60 days during the previous 365 (18 
U.S.C. 203 and 205). He is bound by this restraint despite the fact that 
the matter is not one in which he has ever participated personally and 
substantially.
    (2) He may not, after his Government employment has ended, represent 
anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which 
the United States is a party or has an interest and in which he 
participated personally and substantially for the Government (18 U.S.C. 
207(a)).
    (3) He may not, for 1 year after his Government employment has 
ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with 
a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and 
which was within the boundaries of his official responsibility during 
the last year of his Government service (18 U.S.C. 207(b)). (This 
temporary restraint is permanent if the matter is one in which he 
participated personally and substantially. See subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph.)
    (b) Exemptions or exceptions from the prohibitions described in 
paragraph (a) of this section are permitted under certain circumstances; 
for the method of obtaining such exemptions or exceptions, see paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 100.735-12.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-12  Exemptions and exceptions from prohibitions of conflict of interest statutes.

    (a) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee, 
if it is not otherwise inconsistent with the faithful performance of his 
duties, from acting without compensation as agent or attorney for any 
person in a disciplinary, loyalty, or other Federal personnel 
administration proceeding involving such person.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee 
from acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for his 
parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or for any estate for 
which, he is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee or 
other personal fiduciary, except in those matters in which he has 
participated personally and substantially as a Government employee, 
through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering 
of advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which are the subject of his 
official responsibility, as defined in section 202(b) of Title 18 of the 
United States Code, provided that the agency head approves.
    (c) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee 
from giving testimony under oath or from making statements required to 
be made under penalty for perjury or contempt.
    (d) In addition to the exemptions and exceptions described in this 
section and in Sec. 100.735-9, the conflict of interest statutes permit 
certain exemptions and exceptions in specific circumstances. The 
procedure for effecting such exemptions or exceptions is as follows:
    (1) Any regular employee or special Government employee who desires 
approval or certification of his activities as provided for by section 
205 of Title 18, United States Code, shall make application therefor in 
writing to the Counselor for the agency.
    (2) A former employee, including a former special Government 
employee, who desires certification with regard to his activities under 
section 207 of Title 18, United States Code, shall make application 
therefor in writing to the Counselor for the agency.
    (3) The Counselor for the agency shall report promptly to the agency 
head all matters reported to him under this subpart which require 
consideration of approvals, certifications, or determinations provided 
for in sections 205, 207, or 208 of Title 18, United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-13  Salary of employee payable only by United States.

    (a) No employee, other than a special Government employee or an 
employee serving without compensation, shall receive any salary, or any 
contribution to or supplementation of salary, as compensation for his 
services as an employee, from any source other than the Government of 
the United States, except as may be contributed out of the treasury of 
any State, county, or municipality (18 U.S.C. 209).
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee 
from

[[Page 337]]

continuing to participate in a bona fide pension, retirement, group 
life, health, or accident insurance, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or 
other employee welfare or benefit plan maintained by a former employer 
nor from accepting contributions, awards, or other expenses under 
Chapter 41 of Title 5, United States Code (the former Government 
Employees Training Act).


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-14  Gifts, entertainment, and favors.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee 
shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, 
favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value from a 
person who:
    (1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or 
financial relations with his agency;
    (2) Conducts operations or activities which are regulated by his 
agency; or
    (3) Has interests which may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of his official duty.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an employee may:
    (1) Accept a gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or other 
thing of monetary value from a friend, parent, spouse, child, or other 
close relative when the circumstances make it clear that the family or 
personal relationships involved are the motivating factors;
    (2) Accept food or refreshments of nominal value on infrequent 
occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or 
other meeting or on an inspection tour whom an employee may properly be 
in attendance;
    (3) Accept loans from banks or other financial institutions on 
customary terms to finance proper or usual activities of employees, such 
as home mortgage loans; and
    (4) Accept unsolicited advertising or promotional materials such as 
pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, or other items of nominal intrinsic 
value.
    (c) An employee shall not solicit contributions from another 
employee for a gift to an employee in a superior official position. An 
employee in a superior official position shall not accept a gift 
presented as a contribution from employees receiving less salary than 
himself. An employee shall not make a donation as a gift to an employee 
in a superior official position (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph 
does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a 
nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness or 
retirement.
    (d) The Constitution (Art. 1, sec. 9, par. 8) prohibits acceptance 
from foreign governments, except with the consent of Congress, of any 
emolument, office, or title. The Congress has provided for the receipt 
and disposition of foreign gifts and decorations in 5 U.S.C. 7342. See 
also Executive Order 11320, 31 FR 15789, and the regulations pursuant 
thereto in 22 CFR part 3 (as added, 32 FR 6569). Any such gift or thing 
which cannot appropriately be refused shall be submitted to the 
Counselor for transmittal to the State Department.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-15  Outside employment and other activity.

    (a) An employee shall not engage in outside employment or other 
outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge of 
the duties and responsibilities of his Government employment. 
Incompatible activities include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or 
any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance 
may result in, or create the appearance of, a conflict of interest; or
    (2) Outside employment which tends to impair the employee's mental 
or physical capacity to perform his Government duties and 
responsibilities in an acceptable manner.
    (b) Within the limitations imposed by this section, employees are 
encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and writing. However, an 
employee shall not, either for or without compensation, engage in 
teaching, lecturing, or writing that is dependent on information 
obtained as a result of his Government employment, except when that 
information has been made available to the general public or will be 
made available on request, or when the agency head gives written 
authorization for the use of non-public information on the basis that

public interest. In addition, an employee who is a Presidential 
appointee covered by section 401(a) of Executive Order No. 11222 of May 
8, 1965, shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value 
for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the

from:
    (1) Receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, 
for actual expenses for travel and such other necessary subsistence as 
is compatible with this subpart and for which no Government payment or 
reimbursement is made. However, an employee may not be reimbursed, and 
payment may not be made on his behalf, for excessive personal living 
expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it 
allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official 
business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by 
Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.
    (2) Participation in the activities of national or State political 
parties not proscribed by law. (See paragraph (o) of Sec. 100.735-22 
regarding proscribed political activities.)
    (3) Participation in the affairs of, or acceptance of an award for a 
meritorious public contribution or achievement given by, a charitable, 
religious, professional, social, fraternal, nonprofit educational or 
recreational, public service, or civic organization.

obtain the approval, through his official superior, of his agency head. 
A record of each approval under this paragraph shall be filed in the

    (f) This section does not apply to special Government employees, who 
are subject to the provisions of Sec. 100.735-23.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-16  Financial interests.

    (a) An employee may not have financial interests which--
    (1) Establish a substantial personal or private interest in a matter 
which involves his duties and responsibilities as an employee (an 
employee may not have financial interests, except as permitted by 
Sec. 100.735-9(c) or authorized pursuant to Sec. 100.735-12(d); or

the making of bona fide investments) which is conducted on such a scale 
as to interfere with the proper performance of his duties.
    (b) Aside from the restrictions prescribed or cited in this subpart, 
employees are free to engage in lawful financial transactions to the 
same extent as private citizens. Employees should be aware that the 
financial interests of their wives of minor children and blood relatives 
who are full-time residents of their households may be regarded, for the 
purposes of this section, as financial interests of the employees 
themselves.
    (c) This section does not apply to special Government employees, who 
are subject to the provisions of Sec. 100.735-23.


<R05>

Government, for other than officially approved activities. An employee

including equipment, supplies, and other property entrusted or issued to 
him.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-18  Misuse of information.

    For the purpose of furthering a private interest, an employee shall

indirectly use, or allow the use of, official information obtained 
through or in connection with

[[Page 339]]

his Government employment which has not been made available to the 
general public.

Sec. 100.735-19  Indebtedness.

    An employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and 
timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or 
local taxes. For the purpose of this section, a just financial 
obligation means one acknowledged by the employee, or reduced to 
judgment by a court, and in a proper and timely manner means in a manner 
which his agency determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect 
adversely on the Government as his employer. In the event of dispute 
between an employee and an alleged creditor, this section does not 
require an agency to determine the validity or amount of the disputed 
debt.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-20  Gambling, betting, and lotteries.

    An employee shall not participate, while on Government-owned or

    (a) A special Government employee shall not use his Government

    (b) A special Government employee shall not use inside information 
obtained as a result of his Government employment for private gain for 
himself or another person whether by direct action on his part or by 
counsel, recommendation, or suggestion to another person, particularly 
one with whom he has family, business, or financial ties. For the 
purposes of this section, inside information means information obtained 
under Government authority which has not become part of the body of 
public information.
    (c) A special Government employee who engages in teaching, 
lecturing, or writing, whether for or without compensation, shall not 
for such purposes make use of information obtained as a result of his 
Government employment, except when that information has been made 
available to the general public or will be made available on request, or 
when the agency head gives written authorization for the use of 
nonpublic information on the basis that such use is in the public 
interest.
    (d) A special Government employee shall not use his Government 
employment to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, a person to 
provide financial benefit to himself or another person, particularly one 
with whom he has family, business, or financial ties.

Government employee shall be allowed the same latitude as is authorized 
for regular Government employees by paragraph (b) of Sec. 100.735-14.
    (g) Attention of special Government employees is directed to the 
provisions of Sec. 100.735-3, making the provisions of this subpart

    (a) Not later than 90 days after the effective date of this subpart, 
an employee designated in paragraph (d) of this section shall submit to 
his agency head a statement, on a form made available in the office of 
the Executive Clerk for the White House Office and the Counselor for 
each other agency, setting forth the following information:
    (1) A list of the names of all corporations, companies, firms, or 
other business enterprises, partnerships, nonprofit organizations, and 
educational or other institutions with or in which he, his spouse, minor 
child or other member of his immediate household has--
    (i) Any connection as an employee, officer, owner, director, member, 
trustee, partner, adviser or consultant; or
    (ii) Any continuing financial interest, through a pension or 
retirement plan, shared income, or other arrangement as a result of any 
current or prior employment or business or professional association; or
    (iii) Any financial interest through the ownership of stock, stock 
options, bonds, securities, or other arrangements including trusts.
    However, an employee need not report any financial interest exempted 
under Sec. 100.735-9(c) as too remote or inconsequential to affect the 
integrity of an employee's services in a matter.
    (2) A list of the names of his creditors and the creditors of his 
spouse, minor child or other member of his immediate household, other 
than those creditors to whom they may be indebted by reason of a 
mortgage on property which he occupies as a personal residence or to 
whom they may be indebted for current and ordinary household and living 
expenses such as

[[Page 341]]

those incurred for household furnishings, an automobile, education, 
vacations, or the like.
    (3) A list of his interests and those of his spouse, minor child or 
other member of his immediate household in real property or rights in 
lands, other than property which he occupies as a personal residence.
    (b) For the purpose of this section member of his immediate 
household means a full-time resident of the employee's household who is 
related to him by blood.
    (c) Each employee designated in paragraph (d) of this section who 
enters on duty after the effective date of this subpart shall submit 
such statement not later than 30 days after the date of his entrance on 
duty, but not earlier than 90 days after the effective date of this 
subpart.
    (d) Statements of employment and financial interests are required of 
the following:
    (1) Employees paid at a level of the Executive Schedule in 
subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, except a 
Presidential appointee required to file a statement of financial 
interests under section 401 of Executive Order No. 11222 of May 8, 1965.
    (2) Employees in classified positions of grade GS-13 or above, or 
the equivalent thereof.
    (e) Changes in, or additions to, the information contained in an 
employee's statement of employment and financial interests shall be 
reported in a supplementary statement as of June 30 each year. If no 
changes or additions occur, a negative report is required. 
Notwithstanding the filing of the annual report required by this 
paragraph, each employee shall at all times avoid acquiring a financial 
interest that could result, or taking an action that would result, in a 
violation of the conflicts-of-interest provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 or 
this subpart.
    (f) If any information required to be included on a statement of 
employment and financial interests or supplementary statement, including 
holdings placed in trust, is not known to the employee but is known to 
another person, the employee shall request that other person to submit 
the information in his behalf.
    (g) Paragraph (a) of this section does not require an employee to 
submit any information relating to his connection with, or interest in, 
a professional society or a charitable, religious, social, fraternal, 
recreational, public service, civic, or political organization or a 
similar organization not conducted as a business enterprise. For the 
purpose of this section, educational and other institutions doing 
research and development or related work involving grants of money from 
or contracts with the Government are deemed ``business enterprises'' and 
are required to be included in an employee's statement of employment and 
financial interests.
    (h) Each agency shall hold each statement of employment and 
financial interests in confidence. Each person designated to review a 
statement of employment and financial interests under section 100.735-26 
is responsible for maintaining the statement in confidence and shall not 
allow access to, or allow information to be disclosed from, a statement 
except to carry out the purpose of this subpart. An agency may not 
disclose information from a statement except as the Civil Service 
Commission or the agency head may determine for good cause shown.
    (i) The statements of employment and financial interests and 
supplementary statements required of employees are in addition to, and 
not in substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement 
imposed by law, order, or regulation. The submission of a statement by 
an employee does not permit him or any other person to participate in a 
matter in which his or the other person's participation is prohibited by 
law, order, or regulation.
    (j) An employee who believes that his position has been improperly 
included as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment 
and financial interests is entitled to obtain a review of his complaint 
under his agency's grievance procedure.
    (k) This section does not apply to special Government employees, who 
are subject to the provisions of Sec. 100.735-25.

interests of the employee or special Government employee concerned and 
the performance of his service for the Government. If the designee 
determines that such a conflict or appearance of conflict exists, he 
shall provide the employee with an opportunity to explain the conflict 
or appearance of conflict. If he concludes that remedial action should 
be taken, he shall refer the statement to the agency head through the 
Counselor for the agency designated pursuant to Sec. 100.735-6, with his 
recommendation for such action. The agency head, after consideration of 
the employee's explanation and such investigation as he deems

or instructions not inconsistent with this subpart as necessary to carry

agency. Such regulations or instructions may include but are not limited 
to, delegations of any authority allowed by law pertaining to the 
functions placed upon the agency head by this subpart. Such regulations 
or instructions must be made available to employees and special 
Government employees in the same manner as this subpart (see

interests, he shall request each Member thereof to submit such a

29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102.141--102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant

[[Page 348]]

historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with 
handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property 
is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;

[[Page 349]]

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec. 102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If

from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
