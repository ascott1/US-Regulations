              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2010 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2010 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 8470 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2010 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2011, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
  statements, can be found in the Compilation of Presidential Documents 
   and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. A selection of these 
Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
 Division under the supervision of Stacey A. Mulligan. The Chief Editor 
   for the 2010 Compilation was Michael J. Forcina, assisted by Lois M. 
                                                                  Davis.

Proclamation 8470 of January 4, 2010

National Mentoring Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, mentors in communities across our Nation provide crucial 
support and guidance to young people. Whether a day is spent helping 
with homework, playing catch, or just listening, these moments can have 
an enormous, lasting effect on a child's life. During National Mentoring 
Month, we recognize those who give generously of themselves by mentoring 
young Americans.
As tutors, coaches, teachers, volunteers, and friends, mentors commit 
their time and energy to kids who may otherwise lack a positive, mature 
influence in their lives. Their impact fulfills critical local needs 
that often elude public services. Our government can build better 
schools with more qualified teachers, but a strong role model can 
motivate students to do their homework. Lawmakers can put more police 
officers on our streets and ensure our children have access to high-
quality health care, but the advice and example of a trusted adult can 
keep kids out of harm's way. Mentors are building a brighter future for 
our Nation by helping our children grow into productive, engaged, and 
responsible adults.
Many of us are fortunate to recall a role model from our own adolescent 
years who pushed us to succeed or pulled us back from making a poor 
decision. We carry their wisdom with us throughout our lives, knowing 
the unique and timeless gift of mentorship. During this month, I 
encourage Americans to give back by mentoring young people in their 
communities who may lack role models, and pass that precious gift on to 
the next generation.

[[Page 2]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2010 as 
National Mentoring Month. I call upon public officials, business and 
community leaders, educators, and Americans across the country to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8471 of January 4, 2010

National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States was founded on the principle that all people are born 
with an unalienable right to freedom--an ideal that has driven the 
engine of American progress throughout our history. As a Nation, we have 
known moments of great darkness and greater light; and dim years of 
chattel slavery illuminated and brought to an end by President Lincoln's 
actions and a painful Civil War. Yet even today, the darkness and 
inhumanity of enslavement exists. Millions of people worldwide are held 
in compelled service, as well as thousands within the United States. 
During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we 
acknowledge that forms of slavery still exist in the modern era, and we 
recommit ourselves to stopping the human traffickers who ply this 
horrific trade.
As we continue our fight to deliver on the promise of freedom, we 
commemorate the Emancipation Proclamation, which became effective on 
January 1, 1863, and the 13th Amendment, which was sent to the States 
for ratification on February 1, 1865. Throughout the month of January, 
we highlight the many fronts in the ongoing battle for civil rights--
including the efforts of our Federal agencies; State, local, and tribal 
law enforcement partners; international partners; nonprofit social 
service providers; private industry and nongovernmental organizations 
around the world who are working to end human trafficking.
The victims of modern slavery have many faces. They are men and women, 
adults and children. Yet, all are denied basic human dignity and 
freedom. Victims can be abused in their own countries, or find 
themselves far from home and vulnerable. Whether they are trapped in 
forced sexual or labor exploitation, human trafficking victims cannot 
walk away, but are held in service through force, threats, and fear. All 
too often suffering from horrible physical and sexual abuse, it is hard 
for them to imagine that there might be a place of refuge.

[[Page 3]]

We must join together as a Nation and global community to provide that 
safe haven by protecting victims and prosecuting traffickers. With 
improved victim identification, medical and social services, training 
for first responders, and increased public awareness, the men, women, 
and children who have suffered this scourge can overcome the bonds of 
modern slavery, receive protection and justice, and successfully reclaim 
their rightful independence.
Fighting modern slavery and human trafficking is a shared 
responsibility. This month, I urge all Americans to educate themselves 
about all forms of modern slavery and the signs and consequences of 
human trafficking. Together, we can and must end this most serious, 
ongoing criminal civil rights violation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2010 as 
National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in 
the annual celebration of National Freedom Day on February 1. I call 
upon the people of the United States to recognize the vital role we can 
play in ending modern slavery, and to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8472 of January 8, 2010

National Influenza Vaccination Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since the first United States cases were identified in April of last 
year, our Nation has witnessed the worldwide spread of the H1N1 
influenza virus. To date, tens of millions of Americans have contracted 
this virus. While the vast majority of those affected have recovered 
without incident, an unusually high proportion of children and younger 
adults have developed serious complications, resulting in 
hospitalization or even death. We know that influenza vaccination is the 
best way to protect ourselves against the flu, and my Administration 
moved swiftly to respond to this threat by assisting in the development 
of a vaccine, which is now widely available and has shown to be both 
safe and effective.
Every American has a role to play in fighting the H1N1 flu. Expectant 
mothers, children, young adults, and all those under the age of 65 with 
chronic health conditions are at high risk for H1N1 flu-related 
complications and should get the vaccine as soon as possible. Those not 
at high risk can protect themselves and prevent the virus from spreading 
to more vulnerable members of their families and communities by getting 
vaccinated as well.

[[Page 4]]

This week presents a window of opportunity for us to prevent a possible 
third wave of H1N1 flu in the United States. I strongly encourage those 
who have not yet received the H1N1 flu vaccine to do so. Visit flu.gov 
to find vaccination sites in communities across our country and to stay 
informed. Together, we can all fight the H1N1 flu and help protect our 
families, friends, and neighbors.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of January 
10-16, 2010, as National Influenza Vaccination Week. I encourage all 
Americans to observe this week by getting the H1N1 flu vaccine if they 
have not yet done so, and by asking their families, friends, and co-
workers to do the same.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8473 of January 15, 2010

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., challenged our Nation to 
recognize that our individual liberty relies upon our common equality. 
In communities marred by division and injustice, the movement he built 
from the ground up forced open doors to negotiation. The strength of his 
leadership was matched only by the power of his words, which still call 
on us to perfect those sacred ideals enshrined in our founding 
documents.
``We have an opportunity to make America a better Nation,'' Dr. King 
said on the eve of his death. ``I may not get there with you. But I want 
you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised 
land.'' Though we have made great strides since the turbulent era of Dr. 
King's movement, his work and our journey remain unfinished. Only when 
our children are free to pursue their full measure of success--
unhindered by the color of their skin, their gender, the faith in their 
heart, the people they love, or the fortune of their birth--will we have 
reached our destination.
Today, we are closer to fulfilling America's promise of economic and 
social justice because we stand on the shoulders of giants like Dr. 
King, yet our future progress will depend on how we prepare our next 
generation of leaders. We must fortify their ladders of opportunity by 
correcting social injustice, breaking the cycle of poverty in struggling 
communities, and reinvesting in our schools. Education can unlock a 
child's potential and remains our strongest weapon against injustice and 
inequality.
Recognizing that our Nation has yet to reach Dr. King's promised land is 
not an admission of defeat, but a call to action. In these challenging 
times, too many Americans face limited opportunities, but our capacity 
to support

[[Page 5]]

each other remains limitless. Today, let us ask ourselves what Dr. King 
believed to be life's most urgent and persistent question: ``What are 
you doing for others?'' Visit www.MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, 
Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.
Dr. King devoted his life to serving others, and his message transcends 
national borders. The devastating earthquake in Haiti, and the urgent 
need for humanitarian support, reminds us that our service and 
generosity of spirit must also extend beyond our immediate communities. 
As our Government continues to bring our resources to bear on the 
international emergency in Haiti, I ask all Americans who want to 
contribute to this effort to visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/HaitiEarthquake. 
By lifting up our brothers and sisters through dedication and service--
both at home and around the world--we honor Dr. King's memory and 
reaffirm our common humanity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 18, 2010, as 
the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans 
to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service 
programs in honor of Dr. King's life and lasting legacy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8474 of January 15, 2010

Religious Freedom Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Long before our Nation's independence, weary settlers sought refuge on 
our shores to escape religious persecution on other continents. 
Recognizing their strife and toil, it was the genius of America's 
forefathers to protect our freedom of religion, including the freedom to 
practice none at all. Many faiths are now practiced in our Nation's 
houses of worship, and that diversity is built upon a rich tradition of 
religious tolerance. On this day, we commemorate an early realization of 
our Nation's founding ideals: Virginia's 1786 Statute for Religious 
Freedom.
The Virginia Statute was more than a law. It was a statement of 
principle, declaring freedom of religion as the natural right of all 
humanity--not a privilege for any government to give or take away. 
Penned by Thomas Jefferson and championed in the Virginia legislature by 
James Madison, it barred compulsory support of any church and ensured 
the freedom of all people to profess their faith openly, without fear of 
persecution. Five years later, the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights 
followed the Virginia Statute's model, stating, ``Congress shall make no 
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof . . .''.

[[Page 6]]

Our Nation's enduring commitment to the universal human right of 
religious freedom extends beyond our borders as we advocate for all who 
are denied the ability to choose and live their faith. My Administration 
will continue to oppose growing trends in many parts of the world to 
restrict religious expression.
Faith can bring us closer to one another, and our freedom to practice 
our faith and follow our conscience is central to our ability to live in 
harmony. On Religious Freedom Day, let us pledge our constant support to 
all who struggle against religious oppression and rededicate ourselves 
to fostering peace with those whose beliefs differ from our own. In 
doing so, we reaffirm our common humanity and respect for all people 
with whom we share a brief moment on this Earth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2010, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day 
with events and activities that teach us about this critical foundation 
of our Nation's liberty, and show us how we can protect it for future 
generations here and around the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8475 of January 20, 2010

National Angel Island Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One hundred years ago, the Angel Island Immigration Station in San 
Francisco Bay opened for the first time, and an important chapter of the 
American narrative began. It would be written by those who walked 
through the station's doors over the next three decades. From the 
cities, villages, and farms of their birth, they journeyed across the 
Pacific, seeking better lives for themselves and their children. Many 
arrived at Angel Island, weary but hopeful, only to be unjustly confined 
for months or, in some cases, years. As we remember their struggle, we 
honor all who have been drawn to America by dreams of limitless 
opportunity.
Unlike immigrants who marveled at the Statue of Liberty upon arrival at 
Ellis Island, those who came to Angel Island were greeted by an intake 
facility that was sometimes called the ``Guardian of the Western Gate.'' 
Racially prejudiced immigration laws of the time subjected many to 
rigorous exams and interrogations, as well as detention in crowded, 
unsanitary barracks. Some expressed themselves by carving poetry and 
inscriptions into the walls in their native language--from Chinese, 
Japanese, and Korean to Russian, German, and Urdu. These etchings remain 
on Angel Island today

[[Page 7]]

as poignant reminders of the immigrant experience and an unjust time in 
our history.
If there is any vindication for the Angel Island immigrants who endured 
so many hardships, it is the success achieved by those who were allowed 
entry, and the many who, at long last, gained citizenship. They have 
contributed immeasurably to our Nation as leaders in every sector of 
American life. The children of Angel Island have seized the 
opportunities their ancestors saw from across an ocean. By demonstrating 
that all things are possible in America, this vibrant community has 
created a beacon of hope for future generations of immigrants.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 21, 2010, as 
National Angel Island Day. I call upon the people of the United States 
to learn more about the history of Angel Island and to observe this 
anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8476 of February 1, 2010

National African American History Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the centuries since African Americans first arrived on our shores, 
they have known the bitterness of slavery and oppression, the hope of 
progress, and the triumph of the American Dream. African American 
history is an essential thread of the American narrative that traces our 
Nation's enduring struggle to perfect itself. Each February, we 
recognize African American History Month as a moment to reflect upon how 
far we have come as a Nation, and what challenges remain. This year's 
theme, ``The History of Black Economic Empowerment,'' calls upon us to 
honor the African Americans who overcame injustice and inequality to 
achieve financial independence and the security of self empowerment that 
comes with it.
Nearly 100 years after the Civil War, African Americans still faced 
daunting challenges and indignities. Widespread racial prejudice 
inhibited their opportunities, and institutional discrimination such as 
black codes and Jim Crow laws denied them full citizenship rights. 
Despite these seemingly impossible barriers, pioneering African 
Americans blazed trails for themselves and their children. They became 
skilled workers and professionals. They purchased land, and a new 
generation of black entrepreneurs founded banks, educational 
institutions, newspapers, hospitals, and businesses of all kinds.
This month, we recognize the courage and tenacity of so many hard-
working Americans whose legacies are woven into the fabric of our 
Nation. We

[[Page 8]]

are heirs to their extraordinary progress. Racial prejudice is no longer 
the steepest barrier to opportunity for most African Americans, yet 
substantial obstacles remain in the remnants of past discrimination. 
Structural inequalities--from disparities in education and health care 
to the vicious cycle of poverty--still pose enormous hurdles for black 
communities across America.
Overcoming today's challenges will require the same dedication and sense 
of urgency that enabled past generations of African Americans to rise 
above the injustices of their time. That is why my Administration is 
laying a new foundation for long-term economic growth that helps more 
than just a privileged few. We are working hard to give small businesses 
much-needed credit, to slash tax breaks for companies that ship jobs 
overseas, and to give those same breaks to companies that create jobs 
here at home. We are also reinvesting in our schools and making college 
more affordable, because a world class education is our country's best 
roadmap to prosperity.
These initiatives will expand opportunities for African Americans, and 
for all Americans, but parents and community leaders must also be 
partners in this effort. We must push our children to reach for the full 
measure of their potential, just as the innovators who succeeded in 
previous generations pushed their children to achieve something greater. 
In the volumes of black history, much remains unwritten. Let us add our 
own chapter, full of progress and ambition, so that our children's 
children will know that we, too, did our part to erase an unjust past 
and build a brighter future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2010 as 
National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8477 of February 1, 2010

American Heart Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Its 
victims are women and men, and people of all backgrounds and 
ethnicities, in all regions of our country. Although heart disease is 
one of our Nation's most costly and widespread health problems, it is 
among the most preventable. During American Heart Month, we rededicate 
ourselves to fighting this disease by improving our own heart-healthy 
habits, and by raising awareness in our homes and our communities.

[[Page 9]]

Protecting our families from heart disease requires each of us to take 
responsibility for our health and that of our children--including 
exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding tobacco, and 
raising our children to spend more time playing outside. Because obesity 
is a leading risk factor for heart disease, good nutrition and physical 
activity are crucial for all our families.
This month, we honor the health-care professionals, researchers, and 
heart health ambassadors who save lives and spare suffering. Every day, 
these dedicated individuals put themselves on the front lines of our 
fight against heart disease. To better equip them, my Administration is 
investing in cutting-edge research, such as a large DNA sequencing study 
funded by the National Institutes of Health which could unlock earlier 
treatment options for high-risk individuals.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is sponsoring The Heart 
Truth campaign, which reminds women of their risk for heart disease and 
empowers them to reduce it. On Friday, February 5, Michelle and I 
encourage all Americans to recognize the campaign's National Wear Red 
Day by wearing red or the campaign's Red Dress Pin to support women's 
heart disease awareness and remind all women about their risk for heart 
disease.
In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has 
requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating 
February as ``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2010 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 
5, 2010. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and 
reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8478 of February 24, 2010

American Red Cross Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 From rebuilding former adversaries after World War II, to combating 
HIV/AIDS in Africa, to saving lives after the tragic earthquake in 
Haiti, the American people have an unmatched tradition of responding to 
challenges at home and abroad with compassion and generosity. This 
tradition reflects our Nation's noblest ideals and has led people around 
the world to see the United States as a beacon of hope. During American 
Red Cross Month, we

[[Page 10]]

honor the organizations across our country that contribute to our 
Nation's ongoing efforts to relieve human suffering.
 Founded by Clara Barton in 1881, the American Red Cross has provided 
assistance and comfort to communities stricken by disasters large and 
small. Amidst the final months of World War I in 1918, President Woodrow 
Wilson first proclaimed ``Red Cross Week'' as a time for our citizens 
``to give generously to the continuation of the important work of 
relieving distress.'' The American Red Cross continues to help ensure 
our communities are more ready and resilient in the face of future 
disasters. I urge all Americans to embrace our shared duty to better 
prepare ourselves, our families, and our neighbors against a wide range 
of emergencies; and to visit www.Ready.gov and www.CitizenCorps.gov.
 Despite facing economic hardship at home, ordinary Americans are still 
contributing to humanitarian efforts worldwide. This year's catastrophic 
earthquake in Haiti caused untold suffering, and the American people 
have responded with speed and kindness. Donations have poured into the 
American Red Cross and other relief organizations. On the ground in 
Haiti, American search-and-rescue teams have pulled survivors from the 
rubble, and volunteer medical professionals continue to treat victims 
and save lives.
 Our Nation's leadership relies upon our citizens who are motivated to 
act by our common humanity. This month, let us come together to 
celebrate the American spirit of generosity, and the dedicated 
individuals and organizations who keep that spirit alive.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States, do hereby proclaim March 2010 as American Red Cross 
Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities, and by supporting the work of our 
Nation's service and relief organizations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8479 of March 1, 2010

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From long before American independence to today, countless individuals 
have reached our shores, bringing vibrant cultures and diverse roots, 
and immeasurably enriching our Nation. This month, we honor the 
contributions made by the tens of millions of Americans who trace their 
heritage to the Emerald Isle.

[[Page 11]]

Irish Americans fought for our independence, and their signatures adorn 
our founding documents. When famine ravaged Ireland in the 1840s and 
1850s, many Irish men and women sought a new beginning in the United 
States. Though they faced poverty and discrimination, these immigrants 
transformed our cities, served in our Armed Forces, and settled the 
frontiers of our young Nation. Their children, and succeeding 
generations of Irish Americans, have preserved their culture's values 
while becoming leaders in every facet of American life.
During this year's Irish-American Heritage Month, we also celebrate an 
extraordinary Irishman: Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Throughout his career 
in public service, Senator Kennedy worked tirelessly to create 
opportunity for all Americans. His legacy lives on in the legislation he 
championed, which will bolster and protect the health, education, and 
civil rights of Americans for generations to come.
Across the Atlantic, the people of Ireland continue to confront their 
own challenges with resolve and determination. In the face of violence 
perpetuated by some--testing a hard-earned peace--the people of Northern 
Ireland have responded heroically. Undaunted, they and their leaders 
persist on the road to peace and prosperity enshrined over a decade ago 
in the Good Friday Agreement. The United States remains committed to 
supporting the political process and the work of those who have shown 
leadership in pursuit of a lasting peace.
Today, the sons and daughters of Erin can look back with pride on their 
many contributions to the civic and cultural life of America. Like so 
many of our Nation's ethnic communities, Irish Americans are a people 
whose hard work and resilience have brought them great opportunity and 
success, and whose service to our Nation has left it a better place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution 
and the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim March 2010 as 
Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month by celebrating the contributions of Irish American to our Nation 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8480 of March 1, 2010

Read Across America Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As the foundation that makes all other learning possible, literacy is 
the key to unlocking every child's full potential. From riding a bus to 
opening a bank account, our everyday tasks and decisions require 
comprehension of

[[Page 12]]

the written word. On Read Across America Day, we reaffirm our commitment 
to investing in our children and giving them an essential tool for 
success in school and in life: the ability to read.
Today marks the birthday of the late Theodor Seuss Geisel, known to 
millions as Dr. Seuss. His imaginative tales have helped generations of 
children learn to read, and they hold a cherished place on bookshelves 
in homes across America. Authors like Dr. Seuss, whose stories introduce 
fantastical worlds and characters, fold joy into reading and help spark 
the curiosity that is central to learning.
While government must ensure that all our children receive a world-class 
education, parents and caregivers play a crucial role in preparing 
them--especially during early childhood. We can promote a positive 
relationship with books and language through everyday activities to make 
reading fun and interactive. When reading to young children, I urge all 
parents and caregivers to talk about what is happening in a story, point 
out details that relate to real life, and encourage them to ask about 
words they do not understand. Making regular trips to the library, 
playing word games, and simply keeping books around the home can foster 
a love of reading that will last a lifetime. We can also set a good 
example by turning off the television and picking up a book to read with 
or alongside our children.
On Read Across America Day, my Administration is partnering with the 
National Education Association to encourage families across our Nation 
to make reading a priority. Together, we can give our sons and daughters 
the knowledge and skills they need to compete in the global economy, and 
in doing so, secure a brighter future for America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2010, as Read 
Across America Day. I call upon children, families, educators, 
librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the

Proclamation 8481 of March 2, 2010

Women's History Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Countless women have steered the course of our history, and their 
stories are ones of steadfast determination. From reaching for the 
ballot box to breaking barriers on athletic fields and battlefields, 
American women have stood resolute in the face of adversity and overcome 
obstacles to realize their full measure of success. Women's History 
Month is an opportunity for

[[Page 13]]

us to recognize the contributions women have made to our Nation, and to 
honor those who blazed trails for women's empowerment and equality.
Women from all walks of life have improved their communities and our 
Nation. Sylvia Mendez and her family stood up for her right to an 
education and catalyzed the desegregation of our schools. Starting as a 
caseworker in city government, Dr. Dorothy Height has dedicated her life 
to building a more just society. One of our young heroes, Caroline 
Moore, contributed to advances in astronomy by discovering a supernova 
at age 14.
When women like these reach their potential, our country as a whole 
prospers. That is the duty of our Government--not to guarantee success, 
but to ensure all Americans can achieve it. My Administration is working 
to fulfill this promise with initiatives like the White House Council on 
Women and Girls, which promotes the importance of taking women and girls 
into account in Federal policies and programs. This council is committed 
to ensuring our Government does all it can to give our daughters the 
chance to achieve their dreams.
As we move forward, we must correct persisting inequalities. Women 
comprise over 50 percent of our population but hold fewer than 17 
percent of our congressional seats. More than half our college students 
are female, yet when they graduate, their male classmates still receive 
higher pay on average for the same work. Women also hold 
disproportionately fewer science and engineering jobs. That is why my 
Administration launched our Educate to Innovate campaign, which will 
inspire young people from all backgrounds to drive America to the 
forefront of science, technology, engineering, and math. By increasing 
women's participation in these fields, we will foster a new generation 
of innovators to follow in the footsteps of the three American women 
selected as 2009 Nobel Laureates.
Our Nation's commitment to women's rights must not end at our own 
borders, and my Administration is making global women's empowerment a 
core pillar of our foreign policy. My Administration created the first 
Office for Global Women's Issues and appointed an Ambassador at Large to 
head it. We are working with the United Nations and other international 
institutions to support women's equality and to curtail violence against 
women and girls, especially in situations of war and conflict. We are 
partnering internationally to improve women's welfare through targeted 
investments in agriculture, nutrition, and health, as well as programs 
that empower women to contribute to economic and social progress in 
their communities. And we are following through on the commitments I 
made in Cairo to promote access to education, improve literacy, and 
expand employment opportunities for women and girls.
This month, let us carry forth the legacy of our mothers and 
grandmothers. As we honor the women who have shaped our Nation, we must 
remember that we are tasked with writing the next chapter of women's 
history. Only if we teach our daughters that no obstacle is too great 
for them, that no ceiling can block their ascent, will we inspire them 
to reach for their highest aspirations and achieve true equality.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2010 as Women's

[[Page 14]]

History Month. I call upon all our citizens to observe this month with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the history, 
accomplishments, and contributions of American women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Every day, American consumers decide how and where to spend their money. 
Their decisions have far-reaching effects for both their financial well-
being and our Nation's economic stability. National Consumer Protection 
Week (NCPW) gives all Americans an opportunity to become better-informed 
consumers.
This year, NCPW focuses on the importance of being a careful consumer at 
every stage of life, from grade school to retirement. To help our 
children grow into financially responsible adults and avoid frauds and 
scams, we must help them understand the marketplace. Parents and 
educators can play a role by teaching them about advertising and 
marketing, smart financial practices, and keeping personal information 
safe and secure.
My Administration is committed to protecting American consumers. Last 
month, major reforms went into effect with the Credit Card 
Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009. This 
landmark legislation reins in deceptive tactics that unfairly penalize 
responsible consumers with unreasonable costs. However, consumers must 
also learn to avoid predatory practices and manage their financial 
resources more effectively. That is why I established the President's 
Advisory Council on Financial Capability, which is looking for new ways 
to help individuals make informed financial decisions.
Still, our Government must do more to stand up for consumers. From 
excessive bank account overdraft fees to abusive mortgage lending 
practices, our broken financial system produces profits at the expense 
of American families. I support the creation of an independent Consumer 
Financial Protection Agency to safeguard ordinary Americans as they 
navigate the financial marketplace.
Giving Americans of all ages the resources they need to make wise buying 
decisions is the responsibility of Federal, State, and local consumer 
protection agencies, private sector organizations, and consumer advocacy 
groups. This week, I encourage all Americans to visit Consumer.gov/NCPW 
for informative and interactive resources to help them take full 
advantage of their consumer rights.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 7 through March 
13, 2010, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government 
officials, industry leaders, and consumer advocates across our Nation to 
share information about consumer protection; and I encourage all 
Americans to learn more about marketing and business, whether they are 
shopping at their local store or in the global online marketplace.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8483 of March 5, 2010

Save Your Vision Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

While many Americans are fortunate to have healthy eyes, millions are 
affected by low vision or blindness. Maintaining good vision requires 
early diagnosis and timely treatment of eye conditions. Save Your Vision 
Week is a time for all Americans to take action to protect their sight.
Vision loss affects everyone, from infants with genetic conditions, to 
teens and adults with refractive errors, to older individuals with 
cataracts and other age-related eye diseases. Through recent studies, 
scientists and clinicians have identified risk factors, early detection 
methods, and new treatments for many eye conditions, but individuals can 
also take steps to protect their own vision.
By getting regular eye examinations, Americans can take advantage of 
medical breakthroughs that allow early detection and treatment of vision 
loss. Doctors also recommend maintaining a healthy diet, not smoking, 
and wearing sunglasses or suitable eye protection when playing sports or 
performing household chores and yard work. This week, I encourage all 
Americans to visit the National Eye Institute website at www.NEI.NIH.gov 
to find eye care professionals in communities across our country and to 
access the latest eye health information.
To remind Americans about the importance of safeguarding their eyesight, 
the United States Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 
1963, as amended (77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and 
requested the President to proclaim the first week in March of each year 
as ``Save Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 7 through March 13, 2010, as Save Your 
Vision Week. During this time, I invite eye care professionals, 
teachers, members of the media, and all organizations dedicated to 
preserving eyesight to join in activities that will raise awareness of 
eye and vision health.

Proclamation 8484 of March 15, 2010

National Poison Prevention Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since 1962, during National Poison Prevention Week we alert American 
families about the dangers of accidental poisonings and provide 
information on safety measures that can prevent senseless injuries and 
deaths. With nearly two million poison exposures reported each year, we 
must take every precaution to guard against these preventable tragedies.
Sadly, more than half of all reported poisonings involve children under 
the age of six, and the vast majority take place in the home. Parents 
should keep household chemicals and medicines in child-proof containers, 
beyond the reach of their children. Thanks to safety regulations and 
awareness campaigns like National Poison Prevention Week, childhood 
death rates from unintentional poisonings have fallen considerably. 
However, adult death rates have steadily risen in recent years.
We must each remember to read labels thoroughly before taking 
medications, to keep medicines in their original packaging, and to 
dispose of them properly. Consulting a physician before combining 
prescription drugs or using them with alcohol also reduces our risks.
In the event of an accidental poisoning, crucial information and 
immediate action can save lives. Individuals can call the toll-free 
national poison control hotline at 1-800-222-1222 to be connected to one 
of dozens of local poison control centers, which are open 24 hours every 
day. These centers provide emergency assistance, offer guidance on 
poison prevention, and answer questions concerning potential exposure.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the third week of March of each year as 
National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this week by taking actions to protect their families from hazardous 
household materials and from the misuse of prescription medications.

Proclamation 8485 of March 24, 2010

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, as we commemorate the 189th anniversary of Greece's independence, 
we reaffirm the ties that link our nations together as allies and warm 
friends. We also honor the accomplishments of Greek Americans and their 
immeasurable contributions to the United States.
It was the genius of America's forebears to enshrine the pre-eminent 
idea of democracy in our Nation's founding documents. Inspired by the 
governing values of ancient Greece, they launched the great American 
experiment. Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of our Declaration of 
Independence, later expressed his admiration for the Greeks and their 
heritage as they fought their War of Independence. Writing in 1823, he 
acknowledged Greece as ``the first of civilized nations, [which] 
presented examples of what man should be.''
The Hellenic influence on America's scholarly traditions reflects our 
Nation's high regard for Greece's lasting heritage. Our physicians 
uphold the timeless ethics of Hippocrates, and our students learn the 
mathematics of Euclid and Pythagoras. Our law schools use the Socratic 
Method, and the structures of ancient Greece have inspired many of our 
most cherished buildings and monuments. Greek Americans have also shaped 
our Nation as leaders in every sector of American life, and their 
community has strengthened the fabric of our country with its vibrant 
culture and unique traditions.
Above all, we were blessed to inherit the Hellenic ideal of democracy, 
which lives on today in Greece and America, and reinforces the enduring 
bonds between our two nations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2010, as 
``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy.'' I call upon all the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8486 of March 25, 2010

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

To secure a bright future for America, we must instill in our children a 
love of learning as well as a spirit of compassion. These are two of our 
Nation's most cherished and enduring values. Today, let us rededicate 
ourselves to preparing our next generation of leaders for the world they 
will inherit.
For America to thrive in the 21st century, we need a workforce with the 
knowledge and skills to compete in the global economy. More than ever 
before, the success of every American will depend on their level of 
academic achievement. A world class education can unlock every child's 
full potential, and that remains our best roadmap to prosperity.
However, our leadership in the world relies upon citizens who are not 
only well-educated, but also driven by their humanity and civic virtue. 
In the wake of this year's devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, 
Americans stepped forward to help, carrying on the unmatched tradition 
of generosity that defines our national character. By passing on this 
spirit of compassion to our children, we help ensure America remains a 
beacon of hope to people around the world.
The importance of education and kindness was promoted in the work of 
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, inspiring 
countless individuals to uphold these values in their own lives and 
communities. Each year, Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., reminds us of 
his legacy and the principles to which he dedicated himself. As we 
strengthen our Nation's ladders of opportunity, let us teach our 
children to lift up generations yet to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 26, 2010, as 
``Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A.'' I call upon all Americans to 
observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8487 of March 31, 2010

Cesar Chavez Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The rights and benefits working Americans enjoy today were not easily 
gained; they had to be won. It took generations of courageous men and 
women, fighting to secure decent working conditions, organizing to 
demand fair pay, and sometimes risking their lives. Some, like Cesar 
Estrada Chavez, made it the cause of their lives. Today, on what would 
have been his 83rd birthday, we celebrate Cesar's legacy and the 
progress achieved by all who stood alongside him.
Raised by a family of migrant farm workers, Cesar Chavez spent his youth 
moving across the American Southwest, working in fields and vineyards, 
and experiencing firsthand the hardships he would later crusade to 
abolish. At the time, farm workers were deeply impoverished and 
frequently exploited, exposed to very hazardous working conditions, and 
often denied clean drinking water, toilets, and other basic necessities. 
The union Cesar later founded with Dolores Huerta, the United Farm 
Workers of America (UFW), still addresses these issues today.
After serving in the United States Navy, Cesar Chavez became a community 
organizer and began his lifelong campaign for civil rights and social 
justice. Applying the principles of nonviolence, he empowered countless 
laborers, building a movement that grew into the UFW. He led workers in 
marches, strikes, and boycotts, focusing our Nation's attention on their 
plight and using the power of picket lines to win union contracts.
``The love for justice that is in us is not only the best part of our 
being, but it is also the most true to our nature,'' Cesar Chavez once 
said. Since our Nation's earliest days of independence, we have 
struggled to perfect the ideals of equal justice and opportunity 
enshrined in our founding documents. As Cesar suggests, justice may be 
true to our nature, but as history teaches us, it will not prevail 
unless we defend its cause.
Few Americans have led this charge so tirelessly, and for so many, as 
Cesar Chavez. To this day, his rallying cry--``S[iacute], se puede,'' or 
``Yes, we can,''--inspires hope and a spirit of possibility in people 
around the world. His movement strengthened our country, and his vision 
lives on in the organizers and social entrepreneurs who still empower 
their neighbors to improve their communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2010, as 
Cesar Chavez Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate service, community, and education programs to honor Cesar 
Chavez's enduring legacy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8488 of March 31, 2010

Census Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's earliest days, the census has played an important 
role in identifying where resources are most needed. This procedure, 
enshrined in our Constitution, informs our Government's responses to the 
evolving needs of American communities. By completing this year's 
survey, we can ensure they receive adequate funding for schools, 
hospitals, senior centers, and other public works projects. The 2010 
Census will also aid employers in selecting locations for new factories 
and businesses as our economy recovers. On Census Day, I urge all 
Americans to fulfill their civic duty by participating in the 2010 
Census.
While the first United States census surveyed a young country with fewer 
than 4 million people, this year's census will assess a Nation of over 
300 million. America's diversity defines our national character, yet, in 
the past, the census has too often undercounted minorities, young 
people, and low-income residents. As our Nation grows, getting the count 
right will help ensure that our families and neighbors receive the 
services they need, and accurate and proportional representation in the 
United States House of Representatives.
The 2010 Census is safe and easy to complete, and the Census Bureau 
aggressively protects all census participants' private information, 
which is never used against them or shared with other government or 
private entities. By mailing the Census form back, we help save taxpayer 
dollars and ensure that all Americans get the support they deserve and a 
voice in our democracy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 1, 2010, as Census 
Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day by completing their 
census form and mailing it back.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8489 of April 1, 2010

National Cancer Control Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Cancer is among the leading causes of death in our country, taking over 
half a million American lives in the past year alone. This illness has 
stricken countless individuals and families in communities across our 
Nation, but the future holds untold promise. We continue to make 
monumental strides in managing and understanding cancer, and rates of 
new cases and deaths have declined for men and women overall in recent 
years. During National Cancer Control Month, let us renew our commitment 
to combat this disease by raising awareness and supporting the 
development of life-saving treatments.
With simple, everyday activities, we all can take steps to protect 
ourselves and our loved ones from cancer. Americans should discuss 
preventive care with a health professional. Getting regular check-ups 
and screenings can help reduce the risk of developing certain cancers 
and help detect cancer early, when it is most treatable. Changing 
unhealthy habits can often help prevent cancer before it forms. By 
limiting sun exposure and alcohol consumption, avoiding tobacco, 
exercising regularly, and maintaining a nutritious diet, we can each 
reduce our risk of developing cancer. I encourage all who are struggling 
to quit smoking to visit SmokeFree.gov for resources and information.
My Administration is committed to supporting every American who is 
fighting cancer, and we have invested in innovative research through the 
National Institutes of Health to develop more effective treatments. 
While cancer affects people of every background and economic status, 
disparities exist between races, ethnicities, and incomes regarding the 
likelihood of survival. Community cancer centers will play an important 
role in closing these gaps and bringing hope to underserved citizens.
Like too many Americans, I know the pain of losing a loved one to 
cancer, and I carry the memory of my mother's courage with me each day. 
Inspired by the stories and tenacity of patients and survivors, and 
guided by our love for those we have lost, we will one day triumph over 
this devastating illness.
The Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved March 
28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103), as amended, has requested the 
President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer 
Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 2010 as National Cancer Control Month. 
I call upon citizens, government agencies, organizations, health care 
providers, and research institutions to raise cancer awareness and 
continue helping Americans live longer, healthier lives.

Proclamation 8490 of April 1, 2010

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our children are our most valuable resource, and they need our support 
to thrive and grow into healthy, productive adults. During National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our unwavering commitment to 
protecting children and responding to child abuse, promoting healthy 
families, and building a brighter future for all Americans.
Every child deserves a nurturing family and a safe environment, free 
from fear, abuse, and neglect. Tragically, sexual, emotional, and 
physical abuse threaten too many children every day in communities 
across our Nation. Parents, guardians, relatives, and neighbors all 
share a responsibility to prevent these devastating crimes, and our 
government plays a critical role as well.
My Administration is committed to helping future generations succeed. We 
are focused on engaging parents in their children's early learning and 
development, ensuring the safety and well-being of all families, and 
creating opportunities for all Americans. We are also partnering with 
Federal, State, and local agencies to better coordinate early childhood 
services and improve the lives of young children and their families.
Together, we can ensure that every child grows up in a safe, stable, and 
nurturing environment, free from abuse and neglect. I encourage all 
Americans to visit: www.ChildWelfare.gov/Preventing to learn what they 
can do to stop child abuse in their communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2010 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month with programs and activities that help prevent child abuse and 
provide for children's physical, emotional, and developmental needs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the

National Donate Life Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, we can demonstrate our commitment to one another in the 
most difficult of circumstances through organ, tissue, stem cell, and 
blood donation. During National Donate Life Month, we honor donors who 
provide others with a second chance for a healthy life and encourage 
more Americans to share this precious gift.
Today, over 100,000 Americans await donation on the Organ Procurement 
and Transplantation Network waiting list. Many will receive a lifesaving 
transplant, but, for some, help will not come fast enough. Whether they 
are coping with kidney failure or recovering from severe injuries, these 
individuals' lives depend on the compassion of a loved one or a complete 
stranger. Across our country, we face a shortage of donors and an urgent 
need for help. We must respond with the spirit of generosity that has 
always defined our national character.
Each organ or tissue donor can save many lives, and becoming one is 
simple: join your State's donor registry, indicate your decision on your 
driver's license, and inform loved ones of your decision. There is no 
age limit for donors, and because some conditions and blood types are 
more common in certain ethnic and racial populations, the Department of 
Health and Human Services especially encourages minorities to consider 
donation.
Visit OrganDonor.gov to learn more about the urgent need for donors and 
to find resources on how to donate. Together, we can save lives and give 
hope to countless American families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2010 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
private organizations to join forces to boost the number of organ, 
tissue, blood, and stem cell donors throughout our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8492 of April 1, 2010

National Sexual Assault Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, women, men, and children across America suffer the pain and 
trauma of sexual assault. From verbal harassment and intimidation to 
molestation and rape, this crime occurs far too frequently, goes 
unreported far too often, and leaves long-lasting physical and emotional 
scars. During National Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we recommit 
ourselves not only to lifting the veil of secrecy and shame surrounding 
sexual violence, but also to raising awareness, expanding support for 
victims, and strengthening our response.
Sexual violence is an affront to our national conscience, one which we 
cannot ignore. It disproportionately affects women--an estimated one in 
six American women will experience an attempted or completed rape at 
some point in her life. Too many men and boys are also affected.
These facts are deeply troubling, and yet, sexual violence affects 
Americans of all ages, backgrounds, and circumstances. Alarming rates of 
sexual violence occur among young women attending college, and 
frequently, alcohol or drugs are used to incapacitate the victim. Among 
people with disabilities, isolation may lead to repeated assaults and an 
inability to seek and locate help. Native American women are more than 
twice as likely to be sexually assaulted compared with the general 
population. As a Nation, we share the responsibility for protecting each 
other from sexual assault, supporting victims when it does occur, and 
bringing perpetrators to justice.
We can lead this charge by confronting and changing insensitive 
attitudes wherever they persist. Survivors too often suffer in silence 
because they fear further injury, are unwilling to experience further 
humiliation, or lack faith in the criminal justice system. This feeling 
of isolation, often compounded with suicidal feelings, depression, and 
post-traumatic stress disorder, only exacerbate victims' sense of 
hopelessness. No one should face this trauma alone, and as families, 
friends, and mentors, we can empower victims to seek the assistance they 
need.
At the Federal, State, local, and tribal level, we must work to provide 
necessary resources to victims of every circumstance, including medical 
attention, mental health services, relocation and housing assistance, 
and advocacy during legal proceedings. Under Vice President Biden's 
leadership, the 2005 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act 
included the Sexual Assault Services Program, the first-ever funding 
stream dedicated solely to providing direct services to victims of 
sexual assault. To further combat sexual violence, my 2011 Budget 
doubles funding for this program. Through the Justice Department and the 
Centers for Disease Control, we are funding prevention and awareness 
campaigns as well as grants for campus services to address sexual 
assault on college campuses. The Justice Department has also increased 
funding and resources to combat violence against Native American women.
As we continue to confront this crime, let us reaffirm this month our 
dedication to take action in our communities and stop abuse before it 
starts.

[[Page 25]]

Together, we can increase awareness about sexual violence, decrease its 
frequency, punish offenders, help victims, and heal lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2010 as National 
Sexual Assault Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to reach out to 
victims, learn more about this crime, and speak out against it.

in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8493 of April 2, 2010

National Financial Literacy Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In recent years, our Nation's financial system has grown increasingly 
complex. This has left too many Americans behind, unable to build a 
secure financial future for themselves and their families. For many, 
financial literacy can mean economic prosperity and protection against 
fraud and predatory banking practices. During National Financial 
Literacy Month, we recommit to teaching ourselves and our children about 
the basics of financial education.
Our recent economic crisis was the result of both irresponsible actions 
on Wall Street, and everyday choices on Main Street. Large banks 
speculated recklessly without regard for the consequences, and other 
firms invented and sold complex financial products to conceal risks and 
escape scrutiny. At the same time, many Americans took out loans they 
could not afford or signed contracts without fully understanding the 
terms. Ensuring this crisis never happens again will require new rules 
to protect consumers and better information to empower them.
The new Consumer Financial Protection Agency I have proposed will ensure 
ordinary Americans get clear and concise financial information. We must 
put an end to confusing loan contracts, hidden fees attached to 
mortgages, and unfair penalties that appear without warning on bank 
statements. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure 
Act of 2009 began reining in some of these deceptive tactics when it 
recently took effect. The President's Advisory Council on Financial 
Capability is also looking for new ways to help individuals make 
informed decisions and to educate our children on core financial 
competencies.
While our Government has a critical role to play in protecting consumers 
and promoting financial literacy, we are each responsible for 
understanding basic concepts: how to balance a checkbook, save for a 
child's education, steer clear of deceptive financial products and 
practices, plan for retirement, and avoid accumulating excessive debts. 
To learn more, visit:

resources.
Our Nation's future prosperity depends on the financial security of all 
Americans. This month, let us each take time to improve our own 
financial knowledge and share that knowledge with our children. 
Together, we can prevent another crisis and rebuild our economy on a 
stronger, more balanced foundation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2010 as National 
Financial Literacy Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month with programs and activities to improve their understanding of 
financial principles and practices.

Proclamation 8494 of April 8, 2010

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, young Americans face pressures to engage in violent 
activities, drug use, and other harmful behavior. Today, we reaffirm our 
commitment to empowering our children to resist violence and substance 
abuse.
Drug dependence affects individuals from all backgrounds, and its 
debilitating effects often go unaddressed. Too many of our families are 
afflicted by addiction, and too many lives are ruined by its harmful 
impact. Drug abuse is not an isolated crime, and communities experience 
the tragic results when drug-related violence and gang activity reach 
our neighborhoods. It takes parents, guardians, educators, clergy, law 
enforcement officers, and other mentors to demonstrate that a healthy 
and drug-free lifestyle can build a strong foundation for future 
success.
Families must be vigilant in recognizing and addressing the warning 
signs of drug and alcohol abuse. From prescriptions and over-the-counter 
medications to chemical inhalants, many substances can be harmful if 
abused, and preventing our children from doing so is vital. I urge 
friends and loved ones to be role-models and to discuss the consequences 
of drug use with the young people in their lives.
Community-based prevention and treatment programs can provide young 
Americans with mentors and reinforce positive behavior. Through the Drug 
Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program, law enforcement personnel 
contribute their expertise to help teach America's youth to resist peer 
pressure, and to abstain from drugs, gangs, and violence. We all have a 
responsibility to join these professionals in enabling youth to choose 
alternatives

Americans toward a brighter future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 8, 2010, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day 
with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8495 of April 9, 2010

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 200 years of history and significant current events have 
reinforced the strong bonds of friendship and common purpose among the 
nations and people of the Americas. The year 2010 marks the 80th 
anniversary of the first Pan American Day Proclamation; the centennial 
anniversary of the dedication of the Organization of American States' 
headquarters, the Pan American Union Building; and the bicentennials of 
four of our fellow republics: Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Chile.
These milestones remind us of our shared histories of independence and 
interdependence, and of our long and arduous journeys toward the just, 
free, inclusive, and prosperous nations our founders envisioned. My 
Administration is committed to building strong partnerships in the 
Americas. We are focused on supporting social and economic opportunity, 
ensuring the safety of our citizens, strengthening democratic 
institutions and accountability, and building a secure and clean energy 
future. This is the message members of the Administration are carrying 
with them throughout the Americas, and the United States will focus on 
these principles as we partner with friends and neighbors across the 
Americas.
Our combined response to this year's devastating earthquakes in Haiti 
and Chile demonstrates the enduring strength of Pan American solidarity. 
As we mourn these tragic losses of life, hope prevails in our 
hemisphere's extraordinary assistance to the Haitian and Chilean 
peoples. The United States will continue to support these reconstruction 
efforts.
As we commemorate this year's special anniversaries and take note of our 
combined rescue and relief efforts, let us reaffirm the vision President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt expressed at the 1936 Inter-American 
Conference for the Maintenance of Peace: ``We took from our ancestors a 
great dream. We here offer it back as a great unified reality.'' Once 
again, we stand ready to usher in a new era of cooperation to advance 
the security, prosperity, and liberty of all our peoples.

[[Page 28]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2010, as Pan 
American Day and April 11 through 17 as Pan American Week. I urge the 
Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the United 
States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8496 of April 9, 2010

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's former prisoners of war faced tremendous challenges and 
dangers to protect us all. Many gave their last full measure of devotion 
to defend our freedom, and we are forever in their debt. Each year, on 
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, the American people pay 
tribute to these heroes.
Through multiple wars, thousands of American service members have faced 
unimaginable cruelty and unspeakable treatment at the hands of foreign 
captors. Many sacrificed their own well-being to protect their fellow 
prisoners, the war effort, and our country. The families suffered as 
well, unsure of their loved ones' fates, just as the captured warriors 
were unsure of what the next day would bring. Not all of these 
courageous men and women, who persevered bravely and sometimes alone, 
are prominently noted in our history books. Yet, their stories are 
etched in our national conscience, and their courage is enshrined in the 
tradition of honor and bravery that is the mark of our Armed Forces.
America's former prisoners of war gave their freedom so that we can 
enjoy our own. We may never know the full extent of injuries received 
nor burdens borne by these heroes and their families, but neither shall 
we forget their selfless sacrifice and unshakeable resolve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2010, as 
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this day of remembrance by honoring our service 
members, veterans, and all American prisoners of war. I also call upon 
Federal, State, and local government officials and organizations to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Honoring the Victims of the Montcoal, West Virginia, Mine Disaster

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the memory of those who perished in the mine 
explosion in Montcoal, West Virginia, I hereby order, by the authority 
vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff 
at all public buildings and grounds and at all military facilities and 
naval stations of the Federal Government in the State of West Virginia 
until sunset on April 18, 2010.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of

Proclamation 8498 of April 16, 2010

National Park Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we have a responsibility to protect America's natural 
resources and noteworthy landmarks. During National Park Week, we 
celebrate the diversity, beauty, and history found in our National Park 
System.
For nearly 100 years, the American people have entrusted the National 
Park Service (NPS) to care for the places that fuel our spirit and 
define our character. By safeguarding our Nation's historical parks, 
sites, and monuments, NPS in turn preserves our rich culture and 
heritage. From the first glimpses of hope at the Statue of Liberty to 
the harrowing Battle of Gettysburg and the quest for freedom on the 
Underground Railroad, countless American stories are enshrined in these 
sites. By visiting them, we can reflect on our shared history and vision 
for the future.
Our National Park System also includes millions of acres that support 
educational and recreational opportunities for all Americans. Every day, 
NPS employees and volunteers dedicate their time and energy to upholding 
the

[[Page 30]]

beauty and integrity of these lands for future generations. Only by 
conserving our natural treasures--from the verdant forests of the Great 
Smoky Mountains to the geysers of Yellowstone and the granite walls of 
Yosemite--can we share their wonder with our children and grandchildren.
Our national parks provide safe and affordable opportunities for 
families and communities to reconnect with nature and have fun together. 
Our Nation's historical parks, sites, and monuments also enhance quality 
of life and bolster community vitality in many of America's urban areas. 
In the spirit of Let's Move, the First Lady's nationwide campaign to 
tackle childhood obesity, I encourage all Americans to visit our 
national parks and take part in outdoor activities.
While most national parks are free throughout the year, none will charge 
admission during National Park Week, ensuring these treasures are open 
and accessible to all. As we acknowledge the wealth of our National Park 
System, let us also recommit to responsible stewardship that will 
sustain our parks for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 17 through April 
25, 2010, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to visit 
their national parks and be reminded of these unique blessings that we 
share as a Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8499 of April 16, 2010

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Millions of Americans fall prey to criminal behavior every year, and 
still more suffer the physical, emotional, and psychological pain of 
past offenses. This week, we renew our commitment to supporting crime 
victims and preventing crimes that threaten our families and our 
communities.
Our Nation's prosperity depends on the safety and security of all 
Americans. Though crime rates have declined in recent years, crime and 
its devastating effects still require our constant vigilance and 
attention. To help protect our citizens and make our neighborhoods 
safer, last year's landmark American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
included funding for crime prevention programs, criminal justice 
initiatives, and services for victims. Dedicated individuals, 
organizations, and agencies across our Nation are also aiding this 
effort, caring for the survivors of crime by providing shelter, 
counseling, and other types of assistance.

[[Page 31]]

While any person or community may experience crime, some groups are 
disproportionately affected. Nearly half of all murder victims are 
African Americans, and Native American women suffer one of the highest 
rates of sexual assault of any ethnic group. These disparities are an 
affront to all Americans, and we must address them with innovative 
policing strategies and greater community involvement.
Beyond violent crime and property crime, we must also fight white-collar 
crime and protect its victims, including those recovering from financial 
fraud. Through my Administration's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task 
Force and other initiatives, we are cracking down on mortgage fraud and 
predatory lending practices. Programs for victims of these crimes can 
help restore economic security after a family loses its life savings or 
home due to cruel deception.
During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we reaffirm our support for 
victims and survivors of crime, and we recommit to strengthening the 
Federal, State, and local partnerships that are reducing criminal 
activity. Together, we will build a safer, more secure America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 
24, 2010, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this week with events and activities that raise 
awareness of victims' rights, and by volunteering to serve their fellow 
citizens.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8500 of April 16, 2010

National Volunteer Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since the founding of our Nation, we have met our greatest challenges 
through the dedication of countless Americans who have given generously 
of themselves, asking for nothing in return. The American story is a 
story of volunteers--of patriots who fought for our founding ideals, of 
people who marched for justice, of firefighters who rushed into burning 
towers, and of ordinary citizens who lifted up struggling communities. 
All were volunteers, and their work changed our country. This week, we 
recognize their enduring contributions and encourage more Americans, 
especially our youth, to join their ranks.
Today's vast challenges require a renewed commitment to service, and 
Americans are answering that call. From mentoring a student and feeding 
the homeless, to rebuilding after a natural disaster, volunteers are 
touching lives every day. Social entrepreneurs are pioneering innovative 
approaches to community service, and technology is providing us with new 
ways to

[[Page 32]]

connect with one another. Public-private partnerships are also expanding 
the scope and effectiveness of volunteerism.
My Administration is committed to ushering in a new era of service and 
responsibility. We launched United We Serve, a nationwide initiative to 
encourage all Americans to make service a part of their daily lives. The 
Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which I signed last year, has 
expanded and updated programs at the Corporation for National and 
Community Service, harnessing the energy of millions to meet our most 
pressing national challenges. We are also investing in social innovation 
and volunteer management to give community groups the capacity to tackle 
local concerns.
During National Volunteer Week, we honor the ordinary people who give of 
themselves to accomplish extraordinary things, and we encourage more 
Americans to strengthen our country by volunteering. Visit Serve.gov to 
find volunteer opportunities across America and resources to start your 
own project. This website highlights volunteer opportunities for 
Americans of all ages, and I especially hope our young people will be 
inspired to chart a course of service.
Whether through the workplace or a house of worship, in our own 
neighborhoods or in another state or country, service binds us together 
as Americans in a way nothing else can. It defines us as a people, and 
it is essential to achieving our national priorities. Together, let us 
answer the call, take hold of our shared future, and meet the challenges 
of our new century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 
24, 2010, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country 
and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8501 of April 16, 2010

National Day of Service and Remembrance for Victims and Survivors of 
Terrorism, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

There is no greater evil than willful violence against innocents. On 
this National Day of Service and Remembrance for Victims and Survivors 
of Terrorism, we pause to remember victims of terrorism at home and 
abroad, we honor the heroes who have supported them, and we redouble our 
efforts to build the kind of world that is worthy of their legacy.

[[Page 33]]

Fifteen years ago, terrorists bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City, killing over 160 men, women, and children, 
and injuring hundreds more. Even before the dust settled, heroes had 
emerged. First responders, medical professionals, clergy, relief 
organizations, local leaders, and everyday citizens stepped forward to 
help victims and their families. Again, when terrorists struck on 
September 11, 2001, and thousands of Americans--and scores of foreign 
nationals--perished in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Americans made a historic effort to assist 
all those affected. The dignity of those who were attacked--and the 
courage of those who came to their aid--reaffirmed the strength of our 
Nation, and the human spirit.
Terrorists prey on the innocent and vulnerable, and have nothing to 
offer except hatred and destruction. No cause justifies their actions, 
yet they have claimed many victims around the world. Wherever they 
kidnap or kill, they reveal only their own bankrupt vision, and disrupt 
or destroy lives. Their actions impact not only their victims, but the 
families, friends, and fellow citizens of those who are targeted.
Survivors of terrorism and their families, though bound at first by 
anguish and loss, are united by extraordinary acts of courage, love, 
faith, and commitment. They have risen against terrorism in the 
aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and 
other incidents of violence around the world. They are giving a voice to 
victims, speaking out against violent and extremist ideologies, easing 
the suffering of survivors, and helping them heal and hope once more.
Today, let us honor the good works of this inspiring movement that shows 
us that hope is more powerful than fear, and recognize the sacrifice of 
extraordinary citizens worldwide who have shown fortitude in the face of 
unspeakable tragedy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19, 2010, as 
National Day of Service and Remembrance for Victims and Survivors of 
Terrorism. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities 
of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-
staff on this day in honor of the individuals who lost their lives as a 
result of terrorism. I invite the Governors of the United States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and interested organizations and individuals 
to join in this observance. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
solemn day of remembrance with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
acts of community service in memory of the victims and survivors of 
terrorism worldwide.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8502 of April 20, 2010

National Equal Pay Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, extraordinary women have broken 
barriers to achieve their dreams and blazed trails so their daughters 
would not face similar obstacles. Despite decades of progress, pay 
inequity still hinders women and their families across our country. 
National Equal Pay Day symbolizes the day when an average American 
woman's earnings finally match what an average American man earned in 
the past year. Today, we renew our commitment to end wage discrimination 
and celebrate the strength and vibrancy women add to our economy.
Our Nation's workforce includes more women than ever before. In 
households across the country, many women are the sole breadwinner, or 
share this role equally with their partner. However, wage discrimination 
still exists. Nearly half of all working Americans are women, yet they 
earn only about 80 cents for every dollar men earn. This gap increases 
among minority women and those with disabilities.
Pay inequity is not just an issue for women; American families, 
communities, and our entire economy suffer as a result of this 
disparity. We are still recovering from our economic crisis, and many 
hardworking Americans are still feeling its effects. Too many families 
are struggling to pay their bills or put food on the table, and this 
challenge should not be exacerbated by discrimination. I was proud that 
the first bill I signed into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Restoration Act, helps women achieve wage fairness. This law brings us 
closer to ending pay disparities based on gender, age, race, ethnicity, 
religion, or disability by allowing more individuals to challenge 
inequality.
To further highlight the challenges women face and to provide a 
coordinated Federal response, I established the White House Council on 
Women and Girls. My Administration also created a National Equal Pay 
Enforcement Task Force to bolster enforcement of pay discrimination 
laws, making sure women get equal pay for an equal day's work. And, 
because the importance of empowering women extends beyond our borders, 
my Administration created the first Office for Global Women's Issues at 
the Department of State.
We are all responsible for ensuring every American is treated equally. 
From reshaping attitudes to developing more comprehensive community-wide 
efforts, we are taking steps to eliminate the barriers women face in the 
workforce. Today, let us reaffirm our pledge to erase this injustice, 
bring our Nation closer to the liberty promised by our founding 
documents, and give our daughters and granddaughters the gift of true 
equality.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 20, 2010, as 
National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to acknowledge the 
injustice of wage discrimination and join my Administration's efforts to 
achieve equal pay for equal work.

Proclamation 8503 of April 21, 2010

Earth Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the fall of 1969, Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson announced plans 
for a national ``environmental teach-in''--one day, each year, of action 
and advocacy for the environment. His words rallied our Nation, and the 
first Earth Day, as it became known, saw millions come together to meet 
one of the greatest challenges of our times: caring for our planet. What 
Senator Nelson and the other organizers believed then, and what we still 
believe today, is that our environment is a blessing we share. Our 
future is inextricably bound to our planet's future, and we must be good 
stewards of our home as well as one another.
On the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, we come together to reaffirm those 
beliefs. We have come far in these past four decades. One year before 
the first Earth Day, our Nation watched in horror as the polluted and 
debris-choked Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, caught fire. In 
response, a generation of Americans stepped forward to demand progress. 
What Americans achieved in the decades that followed has made our 
children healthier, our water and air cleaner, and our planet more 
livable.
We passed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, established the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and safeguarded treasured American 
landscapes. Americans across our country have witnessed the impact of 
these measures, including the people of Cleveland, where the Cuyahoga 
River is cleaner than it has been in a century.
We continue to build on this progress today. My Administration has 
invested in clean energy and clean water infrastructure across the 
country. We are also committed to passing comprehensive energy and 
climate legislation that will create jobs, reduce our dependence on 
foreign oil, and cut carbon pollution.
We have more work to do, however, and change will not come from 
Washington alone. The achievements of the past were possible because 
ordinary Americans demanded them, and meeting today's environmental 
challenges will require a new generation to carry on Earth Day's cause. 
From weatherizing our homes to planting trees in our communities, there 
are countless ways for every American, young and old, to get involved. I 
encourage all Americans to visit WhiteHouse.gov/EarthDay for information 
and resources to get started.
The 40th anniversary of Earth Day is an opportunity for us to reflect on 
the legacy we have inherited from previous generations, and the legacy 
that

[[Page 36]]

we will bestow upon generations to come. Their future depends on the 
action we take now, and we must not fail them. Forty years from today, 
when our children and grandchildren look back on what we did at this 
moment, let them say that we, too, met the challenges of our time and 
passed on a cleaner, healthier planet.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2010, as 
Earth Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in programs and 
activities that will protect our environment and contribute to a 
healthy, sustainable future.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States of America, that, on the day of her interment, the flag of

upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval 
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the 
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions until sunset on such day. I further direct 
that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all 
United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other 
facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels 
and stations.

Proclamation 8505 of April 28, 2010

National Foster Care Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Nearly a half-million children and youth are in foster care in America, 
all entering the system through no fault of their own. During National 
Foster Care Month, we recognize the promise of children and youth in 
foster care, as well as former foster youth. We also celebrate the 
professionals and foster parents who demonstrate the depth and kindness 
of the human heart.
Children and youth in foster care deserve the happiness and joy every 
child should experience through family life and a safe, loving home. 
Families provide children with unconditional love, stability, trust, and 
the support to grow into healthy, productive adults. Unfortunately, too 
many foster youth reach the age at which they must leave foster care and 
enter adulthood without the support of a permanent family.
Much work remains to reach the goal of permanence for every child, and 
my Administration has supported States that increased the number of 
children adopted out of foster care, providing over $35 million in 2009 
through the Adoption Incentives program. We are also committed to 
meeting the developmental, educational, and health-related needs of 
children and youth in foster care. The American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act provided a significant increase in funding for the 
Title IV-E adoption and foster care assistance program. States can use 
these funds to ensure those placed in foster care will enter a safe and 
stable environment.
In addition, we are implementing the Fostering Connections to Success 
and Increasing Adoptions Act. This law promotes permanency and improved 
outcomes for foster youth through support for kinship care and adoption, 
support for older youth, direct access to Federal resources for Indian 
tribes, coordinated health benefits, improved educational stability and 
opportunities, and adoption incentives and assistance. Former foster 
youth will also benefit from the Affordable Care Act, which, beginning 
in 2014, will ensure Medicaid coverage for them in every State.
This month, caring foster parents and professionals across our Nation 
will celebrate the triumphs of children and youth in foster care as they 
work to remove barriers to reaching a permanent family. Federal, State, 
and local government agencies, communities, and individuals all have a 
role to play as well. Together, we can ensure that young people in 
foster care have the opportunities and encouragement they need to 
realize their full potential.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2010 as National 
Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor and support young people in 
foster care, and to recognize the committed adults who work on their 
behalf each day.

Proclamation 8506 of April 28, 2010

Older Americans Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Older Americans have lived through momentous and trying times in our 
history, and they have strengthened our national character. Their 
experience and wisdom connect us to the past and help us meet the 
challenges of the present. During Older Americans Month, we show our 
support and appreciation for these treasured individuals who have 
contributed so much to our Nation.
This year's theme for Older Americans Month, ``Age Strong, Live Long,'' 
recognizes the efforts of people of all ages to promote the well-being, 
community involvement, and independence of senior citizens. As Americans 
live longer, healthier, and more productive lives, many are starting 
second careers and continuing to be involved in their communities. 
Dedicated older Americans are also answering the call to serve through 
the Corporation for National and Community Service's Senior Corps.
My Administration is committed to ensuring older Americans can age 
strong and live long. By strengthening Medicare and Medicaid, while 
protecting Social Security, we help ensure all Americans can age with 
dignity. The recently enacted Affordable Care Act strengthens Medicare 
by providing free preventive care starting next year, enhancing care 
coordination, and gradually closing the ``donut hole'' gap in 
prescription drug coverage. In addition, this law includes provisions to 
help prevent and eliminate elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Along 
with the Middle Class Task Force's Caregiver Initiative, we are 
investing in wellness and prevention programs to help seniors remain 
healthy and close to their loved ones. The Administration on Aging's 
network of State and local organizations provides services to older 
Americans that help prevent unnecessary hospitalization or 
institutionalization. We must also protect seniors by expanding efforts 
to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid through 
national and State efforts, as well as community-based programs that 
empower retirees to detect and defend against health care fraud.
Many of our Nation's older men and women have worked tirelessly and 
sacrificed so their children could achieve something greater. Their 
passion and experience inspire us all and we are privileged to honor and 
care for the generations whose legacy continues to enrich our Nation and 
shape our future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2010 as Older 
Americans Month. I call upon citizens of all ages to honor older 
Americans this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8507 of April 28, 2010

Workers Memorial Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year marks the 40th anniversary of both the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act and the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, which 
promise American workers the right to a safe workplace and require 
employers to provide safe conditions. Yet, today, we remain too far from 
fulfilling that promise. On Workers Memorial Day, we remember all those 
who have died, been injured, or become sick on the job, and we renew our 
commitment to ensure the safety of American workers.
The families of the 29 coal miners who lost their lives on April 5 in an 
explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia are in our 
thoughts and prayers. We also mourn the loss of 7 workers who died in a 
refinery explosion in Washington State just days earlier, the 4 workers 
who died at a power plant in Connecticut earlier this year, and the 11 
workers lost in the oil platform explosion off the coast of Louisiana 
just last week.
Although these large-scale tragedies are appalling, most workplace 
deaths result from tragedies that claim one life at a time through 
preventable incidents or disabling disease. Every day, 14 workers are 
killed in on-the-job incidents, while thousands die each year of work-
related disease, and millions are injured or contract an illness. Most 
die far from the spotlight, unrecognized and unnoticed by all but their 
families, friends, and co-workers--but they are not forgotten.
The legal right to a safe workplace was won only after countless lives 
had been lost over decades in workplaces across America, and after a 
long and bitter fight waged by workers, unions, and public health 
advocates. Much remains to be done, and my Administration is dedicated 
to renewing our Nation's commitment to achieve safe working conditions 
for all American workers.
Providing safer work environments will take the concerted action of 
government, businesses, employer associations, unions, community 
organizations, the scientific and public health communities, and 
individuals. Today, as we mourn those lost mere weeks ago in the Upper 
Big Branch Mine and other recent disasters, so do we honor all the men 
and women

[[Page 40]]

who have died on the job. In their memory, we rededicate ourselves to 
preventing such tragedies, and to securing a safer workplace for every 
American.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2010, as 
Workers Memorial Day. I call upon all Americans to participate in 
ceremonies and activities in memory of those who have been killed due to 
unsafe working conditions.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8508 of April 29, 2010

Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For centuries, America's story has been tied to the Pacific. Generations 
of brave men and women have crossed this vast ocean, seeking better 
lives and opportunities, and weaving their rich heritage into our 
cultural tapestry. During Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage 
Month, we celebrate the immeasurable contributions these diverse peoples 
have made to our Nation.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have shared common struggles 
throughout their histories in America--including efforts to overcome 
racial, social, and religious discrimination. This year marks the 100th 
anniversary of the Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco 
Bay, a milestone that reminds us of an unjust time in our history. For 
three decades, immigrants from across the Pacific arrived at Angel 
Island, where they were subject to harsh interrogations and exams, and 
confined in crowded, unsanitary barracks. Many who were not turned back 
by racially prejudiced immigration laws endured hardship, injustice, and 
deplorable conditions as miners, railroad builders, and farm workers.
Despite these obstacles, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have 
persevered and flourished, achieving success in every sector of American 
life. They stood shoulder to shoulder with their fellow citizens during 
the civil rights movement; they have served proudly in our Armed Forces; 
and they have prospered as leaders in business, academia, and public 
service.
This month, as we honor all Americans who trace their ancestry to Asia 
and the Pacific Islands, we must acknowledge the challenges they still 
face. Today, many Asian American and Pacific Islander families 
experience unemployment and poverty, as well as significant education 
and health disparities. They are at high risk for diabetes and 
hepatitis, and the number of diagnoses for HIV/AIDS has increased in 
recent years.

[[Page 41]]

We must recognize and properly address these critical concerns so all 
Americans can reach their full potential. That is why my Administration 
reestablished both the White House Initiative and the President's 
Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). 
These partnerships include leaders from across our Government and the 
AAPI community, dedicated to improving the quality of life and 
opportunities for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are a vast and diverse community, 
some native to the United States, hailing from Hawaii and our Pacific 
Island territories. Others trace their heritage to dozens of countries. 
All are treasured citizens who enrich our Nation in countless ways, and 
help fulfill the promise of the American dream which has drawn so many 
to our shores.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2010, as Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans 
to learn more about the history of Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders, and to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8509 of April 29, 2010

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The 2010 Winter Olympics inspired people around the globe as they 
watched elite athletes push their bodies to the limit. Olympic 
competition showcases the vibrancy that physical activity can add to a 
person's life. Exercise strengthens both body and mind, and maintaining 
good health can help prevent injury and disease. Americans of every age, 
background, and ability can weave activity into their daily habits to 
improve their mental and physical wellbeing. This month, we celebrate 
fitness, sports, and outdoor recreation as both healthy activities and 
cherished national traditions.
Exercise can help prevent complications from conditions like heart 
disease, diabetes, and obesity, which are among our most costly and 
widespread health problems. That is why my Administration is investing 
in the long-term health of our Nation by encouraging Americans to stay 
fit. Through interactive toolkits and programs, the President's Council 
on Physical Fitness and Sports helps motivate citizens of all ages to 
incorporate physical activity into their lives. Visit Fitness.gov for 
more information and resources to get started.

[[Page 42]]

Involvement in sports and recreational activities offer opportunities 
for young people to learn about teamwork, fair play, focus, and 
dedication. As they develop into athletes, they acquire time management, 
goal setting, and leadership skills. At any age, exercising with others 
also builds lasting friendships and helps keep individuals motivated and 
involved.
Our future depends on how we raise and prepare the next generation, and 
America's epidemic of childhood obesity requires our immediate 
attention. The Department of Health and Human Services, the President's 
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, and other members of the White 
House Task Force on Childhood Obesity are partnering with First Lady 
Michelle Obama's ``Let's Move'' initiative to solve this epidemic within 
a generation. ``Let's Move'' cultivates the appreciation of nutritious 
food and inspires kids to engage in physical activity. It empowers 
parents and caregivers by emphasizing their role in making healthy 
choices for their children and stresses the importance of access to 
nutritious foods in our schools and communities. Visit LetsMove.gov to 
learn more about this exciting campaign.
During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, let us recommit to 
making healthy choices that will reduce our risk of chronic diseases and 
help our families lead longer, happier lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2010 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon all Americans to take 
control of their health and wellness by making physical activity, 
fitness, and sports participation an important part of their daily 
lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8510 of April 29, 2010

National Charter Schools Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's future depends on the education we provide to our sons and 
daughters, and charter schools across America serve as laboratories for 
education. Ideas developed and tested by charter schools have unlocked 
potential in students of every background and are driving reform 
throughout many school districts. During National Charter Schools Week, 
we recommit to supporting innovation in teaching and learning at high 
quality charter schools and ensuring all our students have a chance to 
realize the American Dream.
Principals, teachers, parents, school boards, and communities are 
working together to transform our public schools, and countless children 
stand to

[[Page 43]]

benefit from the replication of effective education models. In the 21st 
century, a world class education is our best avenue to prosperity. The 
skills and knowledge students gain in school--reinforced by the love of 
learning educators and mentors can foster--can empower young Americans 
to achieve their dreams and lead our country in the global marketplace.
The size and scope of the challenges before us require us to align our 
deepest values and commitments to the demands of a new age. My 
Administration is committed to helping schools prepare the next 
generation of leaders by reaching beyond standardized methods and 
promoting creative teaching strategies and learning techniques. By 
giving all our children access to a complete and competitive education, 
we will pass on the American spirit of limitless possibility to the next 
generation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2 through May 8, 
2010, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's charter 
schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and 
communities to support charter schools and the students they serve.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8511 of April 29, 2010

Law Day, U.S.A., 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For over two centuries, our Nation has adhered to the rule of law as the 
foundation for a safe, free, and just society. President Eisenhower, 
seeking to formally recognize this tradition, established Law Day in 
1958 as ``a day of national dedication to the principles of government 
under law.'' Each Law Day, we celebrate our commitment to the rule of 
law and to upholding the fundamental principles enshrined in our 
founding documents.
Today, we can travel, communicate, and conduct business around the world 
faster than ever before. The theme of this year's Law Day, ``Law in the 
21st Century: Enduring Traditions and Emerging Challenges,'' reminds us 
to draw upon and adapt our time-honored legal traditions to meet the 
demands of a global era. The prosperity we enjoy as a Nation of laws 
increasingly depends on preserving the rights and liberties not just in 
our own country but also in other nations.
In an increasingly interconnected world, legal issues of human rights, 
criminal justice, intellectual property, business transactions, dispute 
resolution, human migration, and environmental regulation affect us all. 
The enduring legal principles of due process and equal protection of the 
law, judicial independence, access to justice, and a firm commitment to 
the rule of

[[Page 44]]

law will continue to allow us to address today's concerns while 
anticipating tomorrow's challenges.
On this Law Day, I encourage all Americans to reflect upon and renew our 
commitment to our legal traditions. By fostering an open dialogue about 
law's role in the 21st century, we help ensure that all people 
understand, remain dedicated to, and are protected by the principles of 
government under law.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2010, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to 
acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag of 
the United States in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8512 of April 29, 2010

Loyalty Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On July 4, 1776, after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, 
the Continental Congress of the newly formed United States of America 
appointed a committee to design a national seal. Our Founders set out to 
create a visible symbol of our sovereign country to inspire all our 
citizens and to represent us abroad.
An initial sketch depicted a banner bearing the Latin motto, ``E 
Pluribus Unum,'' or, ``Out of many, one.'' After years of deliberation 
and multiple drafts of the emblem's design, the final seal displayed an 
eagle with outstretched wings, clenching a banner in its beak with those 
powerful words emblazoned across it. It became a cherished creed, 
representing the foundation of our national values. As a union of States 
and a Nation of immigrants from every part of the world, we are bound as 
one people by our adherence to common ideals: individual equality, 
constitutional liberty, and the rule of law.
Over two centuries since our Founders established our Republic and our 
freedom, the firm resolve that ran in their veins still courses through 
our own. Since then, countless loyal Americans have risen to preserve 
our Union and the blessings bestowed upon us. Today, whether singing the 
national anthem, watching our flag billow in the breeze, or seeing the 
hope in a young child's eyes, each of us can still feel the patriotism 
and respect for one another that defines us as a people. It is the same 
love of country that drives our Armed Forces to shoulder the 
responsibility of defending our citizens and our values. We will forever 
stand united against any force

[[Page 45]]

that seeks to divide us, finding strength in our diversity and 
inspiration in the sacrifices of our forebears.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529 as amended, has designated May 1 of 
each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' On this day, we honor the legacy of these 
United States, and we remember all those who have fought to defend our 
freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2010, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty 
Day, I call upon the people of the United States to join in this 
national observance, to display the flag of the United States, and to 
pledge true and steadfast allegiance to the Republic for which it 
stands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8513 of April 30, 2010

Jewish American Heritage Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1883, the Jewish American poet Emma Lazarus composed a sonnet, 
entitled ``The New Colossus,'' to help raise funds for erecting the 
Statue of Liberty. Twenty years later, a plaque was affixed to the 
completed statue, inscribed with her words: ``Give me your tired, your 
poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free....'' These poignant 
words still speak to us today, reminding us of our Nation's promise as a 
beacon to all who are denied freedom and opportunity in their native 
lands.
Our Nation has always been both a haven and a home for Jewish Americans. 
Countless Jewish immigrants have come to our shores seeking better lives 
and opportunities, from those who arrived in New Amsterdam long before 
America's birth, to those of the past century who sought refuge from the 
horrors of pogroms and the Holocaust. As they have immeasurably enriched 
our national culture, Jewish Americans have also maintained their own 
unique identity. During Jewish American Heritage Month we celebrate this 
proud history and honor the invaluable contributions Jewish Americans 
have made to our Nation.
The Jewish American story is an essential chapter of the American 
narrative. It is one of refuge from persecution; of commitment to 
service, faith, democracy, and peace; and of tireless work to achieve 
success. As leaders in every facet of American life--from athletics, 
entertainment, and the arts to academia, business, government, and our 
Armed Forces--Jewish Americans have shaped our Nation and helped steer 
the course of our history. We are a stronger and more hopeful country 
because so many Jews from around the world have made America their home.

[[Page 46]]

Today, Jewish Americans carry on their culture's tradition of ``tikkun 
olam''--or ``to repair the world''--through good deeds and service. As 
they honor and maintain their ancient heritage, they set a positive 
example for all Americans and continue to strengthen our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2010 as Jewish 
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies to celebrate the 
heritage and contributions of Jewish Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8514 of April 30, 2010

National Day of Prayer, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, whether in times of great joy and thanksgiving, 
or in times of great challenge and uncertainty, Americans have turned to 
prayer. In prayer, we have expressed gratitude and humility, sought 
guidance and forgiveness, and received inspiration and assistance, both 
in good times and in bad.
On this day, let us give thanks for the many blessings God has bestowed 
upon our Nation. Let us rejoice for the blessing of freedom both to 
believe and to live our beliefs, and for the many other freedoms and 
opportunities that bring us together as one Nation. Let us ask for 
wisdom, compassion, and discernment of justice as we address the great 
challenges of our time.
We are blessed to live in a Nation that counts freedom of conscience and 
free exercise of religion among its most fundamental principles, thereby 
ensuring that all people of goodwill may hold and practice their beliefs 
according to the dictates of their consciences. Prayer has been a 
sustaining way for many Americans of diverse faiths to express their 
most cherished beliefs, and thus we have long deemed it fitting and 
proper to publicly recognize the importance of prayer on this day across 
the Nation.
Let us remember in our thoughts and prayers those suffering from natural 
disasters in Haiti, Chile, and elsewhere, and the people from those 
countries and from around the world who have worked tirelessly and 
selflessly to render aid. Let us pray for the families of the West 
Virginia miners, and the people of Poland who so recently and 
unexpectedly lost many of their beloved leaders. Let us pray for the 
safety and success of those who have left home to serve in our Armed 
Forces, putting their lives at risk in order to make the world a safer 
place. As we remember them, let us not forget their families and the 
substantial sacrifices that they make every day. Let us remember the 
unsung heroes who struggle to build their communities,

[[Page 47]]

raise their families, and help their neighbors, for they are the 
wellspring of our greatness. Finally, let us remember in our thoughts 
and prayers those people everywhere who join us in the aspiration for a 
world that is just, peaceful, free, and respectful of the dignity of 
every human being.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2010, as 
a National Day of Prayer. I call upon the citizens of our Nation to 
pray, or otherwise give thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and 
consciences, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I invite all 
people of faith to join me in asking for God's continued guidance, 
grace, and protection as we meet the challenges before us.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8515 of May 6, 2010

Military Spouse Appreciation Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When Americans answer the call to serve in our Armed Forces, a sacred 
trust is forged. Our men and women in uniform take on the duty of 
protecting us all, and their spouses and families also help shoulder 
this important responsibility. As we mark Military Spouse Appreciation 
Day, we reaffirm our steadfast commitment to supporting and honoring the 
husbands, wives, and loved ones of our Nation's servicemembers.
At the heart of our Armed Forces, servicemembers' spouses keep our 
military families on track. They balance family life, military life, and 
their careers--all while supporting other military families and giving 
back to their communities. Many have served in uniform themselves and, 
understanding the obligations involved, can provide unparalleled 
support. They are pillars of strength in their families, often 
celebrating their children's life milestones while the other parent is 
away.
Military spouses also care for our wounded warriors and honor the memory 
of our Nation's fallen heroes, including their own loved ones. They 
impact countless lives on military bases and in schools, places of 
worship, and neighborhoods across our Nation. Their contributions help 
protect our freedom by strengthening our communities and our 
servicemembers.
My Administration is committed to improving opportunities and quality of 
life for these brave spouses and families who know the separation and 
stress of war. We are increasing servicemembers' compensation as well as 
funding for better housing, job training, counseling, outreach, and 
support for spouses and their families. We are also expanding our ground 
forces to reduce the strain of repeated deployments, and to give 
servicemembers more time with their loved ones.

[[Page 48]]

There are many ways for each of us to show our appreciation for military 
spouses. Working through community-based organizations, workplaces, 
schools, and places of worship, we can help them support their families, 
establish or build a career, and address the unique challenges they 
face.
I am inspired every day by our men and women in uniform and their 
families. They are America's greatest military asset, and my 
Administration is committed to fulfilling our obligations to them. 
Today, let us honor the spouses and families who support our 
servicemembers and, in doing so, help defend our Nation and preserve our 
liberty.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7, 2010, as 
Military Spouse Appreciation Day. I call upon the people of the United 
States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8516 of May 7, 2010

National Women's Health Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In recent decades, our Nation has made extraordinary progress in 
promoting women's health issues. However, far too many women remain 
underserved and we must continue working to ensure all women can access 
medical services, receive fair treatment, and make healthy choices. 
During National Women's Health Week, we recommit to breaking existing 
barriers and improving the health of American women for generations to 
come.
Many American women face significant obstacles in caring for themselves 
and their families. That is why my Administration fought tirelessly to 
pass the Affordable Care Act, which I recently signed into law. This 
landmark legislation gives Americans greater control over their health 
care decisions and access to affordable and equitable insurance. It 
lowers costs for women and prohibits insurance companies from 
overcharging because of gender or denying coverage due to a pre-existing 
condition. The Affordable Care Act also requires that new health care 
plans cover preventive care, routine screenings, and regular checkups, 
as well as basic pediatric services for children. These services are 
vital to maintaining individual well-being, and empower women when 
making choices for themselves and their families. Visit HealthReform.gov 
to learn more about how the Affordable Care Act benefits Americans 
across the country.
We have taken steps to provide access to high-quality, affordable health 
care, but individuals must also lead healthy lives and set a good 
example for their children. From scheduling regular medical examinations 
to applying sunscreen, simple, everyday activities can make a positive 
impact on

[[Page 49]]

the lives of women. Regular exercise, coupled with a nutritious diet, 
helps prevent heart disease, obesity, and other chronic conditions. 
Visit WomensHealth.gov and GirlsHealth.gov for more information and 
resources on women's health issues. I also encourage Americans to visit 
www.WhiteHouse.gov/Administration/EOP/CWG to learn about the White House 
Council on Women and Girls--a body I created to bring women's issues to 
the forefront, and to emphasize women's roles as full partners in 
shaping and implementing our Nation's policies.
The health of American women and girls is not just a women's issue; all 
Americans have a vested interest. Women are the foundation of many 
families, and by encouraging their wellness, we also promote the 
vitality of our children and our communities. By standing firm in our 
commitment to improve women's health, we can give our daughters and 
granddaughters--and all Americans--a brighter future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 9-15, 2010, as 
National Women's Health Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate the 
progress we have made in protecting women's health and promote 
prevention, awareness, and educational activities that improve the 
health of all women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8517 of May 7, 2010

Mother's Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Generations of mothers have labored tirelessly and selflessly to support 
and guide their children and families. Their loving, devoted efforts 
have broadened horizons for their children and opened doors of 
opportunity for our Nation's daughters and granddaughters. On Mother's 
Day, we pay tribute to these women who have given so much of themselves 
to lift up our children and shape America's character.
Julia Ward Howe, who wrote the words for the song The Battle Hymn of the 
Republic, led early efforts to establish a day honoring the influence of 
mothers on our lives and communities. In the ensuing decades, many 
Americans rallied to support this cause, including Anna Jarvis. After 
the loss of her own mother, Anna helped spur the nationwide institution 
of Mother's Day we celebrate each year.
From our first moments in this world and throughout our lives, our 
mothers protect us from harm, nurture our spirits, and encourage us to 
reach for our highest aspirations. Through their unwavering commitment, 
they have driven and inspired countless acts of leadership, compassion, 
and

[[Page 50]]

service across our country. Many mothers have struggled to raise 
children while pursuing their careers, or as single parents working to 
provide for their families. They have carried the torch of trailblazers 
past, leading by powerful example and overcoming obstacles so their sons 
and daughters could reach their fullest potential.
Whether adoptive, biological, or foster, mothers share an unbreakable 
bond with their children, and Americans of all ages and backgrounds owe 
them an immeasurable debt. Nurturing families come in many forms, and 
children may be raised by two parents, a single mother, two mothers, a 
step-mom, a grandmother, or a guardian. Mother's Day gives us an 
opportunity to celebrate these extraordinary caretakers, mentors, and 
providers who have made us who we are. As we honor today's mothers, we 
also reflect upon the memory of those who have passed, and we renew our 
commitment to living the values they cultivated in us.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), 
has designated the second Sunday in May each year as ``Mother's Day'' 
and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 9, 2010, as Mother's Day. Let us express 
our deepest love and thanks to our mothers and remember those who, 
though no longer with us, inspire us still.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we rely on law enforcement officers to keep our 
neighborhoods safe, enforce our laws, and respond in times of crisis. 
These men and women sustain peace and order across America, and we look 
to them as models of courage and integrity. This week, we honor their 
extraordinary service and sacrifice, and we remember the fallen heroes 
whose selfless acts have left behind safer streets and stronger 
communities.
Every day, peace officers face the threat of violence and danger. They 
routinely put their lives on the line to defend ours, and the price of 
that bravery may result in injury, disability, or death. The steadfast 
dedication of our country's law enforcement officers warrants more than 
praise. That is why my Administration has provided billions of dollars 
in grants to support State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. 
These funds are giving peace officers the tools and resources they need 
to help ensure our safety.

[[Page 51]]

Thanks to law enforcement officers, our Nation is more secure. They work 
with vigilance and dedication to identify and arrest those who seek to 
do us harm. They have also been instrumental in foiling many potential 
attacks, including the recent plot in New York City's Times Square. From 
combating terror and staking out criminals to patrolling our highways, 
peace officers--with the strong support of their families--maintain 
stability in our communities as we go about our daily lives. This week, 
we recognize their invaluable contributions to upholding justice, 
enforcing the rule of law, and protecting the innocent.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 
676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the 
President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each 
year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the week in which it falls 
as ``Police Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2010, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 9 through May 15, 2010, as Police Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. Let each of us reflect on the ways in which our lives have 
been touched by the peace officers who stand guard over our 
neighborhoods.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8519 of May 13, 2010

Emergency Medical Services Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day of the year, at all hours of the day and night, we rely on 
emergency medical services (EMS) professionals and volunteers for 
critical care in our homes, on our roads, in our hospitals, and wherever 
needs exist. EMS teams serve all Americans, standing ready to respond at 
a moment's notice, and tirelessly enhancing our country's preparedness 
and resilience. During Emergency Medical Services Week, we recommit to 
supporting all EMS providers, and we celebrate their selflessness and 
courageous contributions to our Nation.
Our EMS system includes a wide array of dedicated specialists, including 
emergency medical technicians, 9-1-1 dispatchers, paramedics, 
firefighters, law enforcement officials, educators, nurses, and 
physicians. From rural regions of our Nation to our busiest urban 
centers, EMS teams provide access to quality care when unforeseen 
illness, injury, or disaster strikes. The aid they administer cuts 
across various disciplines and often requires split-second decisions, 
essential to preventing disability or death among their fellow citizens.

[[Page 52]]

My Administration is committed to supporting EMS providers and their 
important mission. The Affordable Care Act, which I signed into law this 
year, authorizes innovative new emergency care and trauma systems, and 
improves and expands EMS for children. It also prohibits insurance 
companies from imposing prior authorization requirements or increased 
cost-sharing for emergency services.
EMS providers spend long hours to further their medical education, train 
themselves on the latest life-saving techniques, and maintain vital 
emergency equipment, often choosing to do so on their own time and at 
their own expense. Many communities rely heavily, or even exclusively, 
on committed volunteers to provide out-of-hospital EMS. The role of EMS 
providers extends beyond performing services themselves, however. They 
also act as instructors to train ordinary Americans, because bystanders 
are often the first to arrive at the scene of a crisis. These heroic 
professionals, volunteers, and citizens form a network that has long 
supported our health care system, and their example is an inspiration to 
us all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 
2010, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Americans to 
observe this occasion with programs and activities to support their 
local EMS workers and to improve their own safety and preparedness 
skills.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8520 of May 14, 2010

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The transportation networks of early America connected our rapidly 
growing Nation with natural waterways and dirt roads, making travel 
difficult and time-consuming. In the time since, undeveloped paths have 
given way to iron and concrete thoroughfares, and our modern 
transportation system has profoundly shaped our landscape, communities, 
commerce, and culture. During National Defense Transportation Day and 
National Transportation Week, we reaffirm the importance of an advanced 
transportation infrastructure to our Nation's economy and security, and 
we thank the dedicated men and women who build and maintain it.
In times of peace and national crisis, efficient roads, rails, ports, 
and airports play a vital role in keeping us safe by enabling the rapid 
movement of people and resources. The devoted professionals who design 
and manage this infrastructure help ensure America has a world-class 
logistics and

[[Page 53]]

transportation system to support our military readiness and emergency 
response capabilities.
Our Nation's transportation arteries make our economy more efficient, 
promoting economic growth, the lifeblood of commerce. The Department of 
Transportation is working closely with State, local, and tribal 
governments to ensure billions in transportation funds from the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 are used to improve infrastructure 
across America. Through Recovery Act projects, we are repairing 
crumbling infrastructure, expanding transit capacity, and modernizing 
our transportation system to meet national security standards and the 
needs of a 21st-century economy.
The ability to travel effectively also strengthens us as a people. 
President Eisenhower's creation of our interstate highway system over 50 
years ago revolutionized channels of economic and social mobility, drew 
together distant areas of our Nation, and helped us maneuver through 
dense metropolitan areas. Today, smart, sustainable development, coupled 
with quality public transportation, has created more livable and 
environmentally sustainable communities for all to enjoy. By reducing 
isolation and bringing neighborhoods together, we can continue to 
increase access to good jobs, affordable housing, safe streets and 
parks, and a healthy food supply.
Working together to upgrade our Nation's transportation infrastructure, 
we will lay a new foundation for long-term growth, security, and 
prosperity in America and give future generations a transportation 
system that is second to none.
To recognize the importance of transportation and the Americans who work 
to meet our transportation needs, the Congress has requested, by joint 
resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the 
President designate the third Friday in May of each year as ``National 
Defense Transportation Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 
1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), that the week during which that Friday 
falls be designated as ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 21, 2010, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and the week of May 16 through May 22, 2010, as 
National Transportation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the 
importance of our Nation's transportation system and to acknowledge the 
contributions of the men and women who support this critical sector.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8521 of May 14, 2010

World Trade Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For our Nation to compete and win in the 21st century, we must rebuild 
our economy on a stronger, more balanced foundation. Part of that effort 
will require us to boost our exports, which are critical for our long-
term prosperity and which support millions of American jobs. World Trade 
Week is an opportunity for us to reaffirm the importance of trade to our 
Nation's continued economic recovery and growth.
Our Nation is still emerging from an unprecedented economic crisis. 
Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and millions more remain 
underemployed, limited to part-time work or odd jobs. To help them, we 
must do all we can to spur job creation and restore economic security. 
Producing and exporting more goods and services is essential to 
strengthening our ability to compete for customers outside our borders.
My Administration is proud to launch the National Export Initiative, a 
comprehensive strategy to promote American exports. This initiative 
brings senior Government officials together with leaders from the 
private sector to increase trade opportunities for businesses of all 
sizes, including individual entrepreneurs. To ensure American companies 
have free and fair access to global markets, we are enforcing existing 
trade agreements, addressing issues in pending agreements, and forging 
new ones that protect our businesses, workers, consumers, and 
environment. We are also opening new markets and encouraging development 
with trade preference programs. These steps will bring us closer to 
accomplishing the ambitious goal I set in this year's State of the Union 
address to double our Nation's exports over the next five years.
As we pursue measures to safeguard our future prosperity, we must 
remember that we still have the most innovative and productive workers 
in the world. We have the most dynamic and competitive economy, and we 
remain the top exporter of goods and services. As other nations and 
markets grow, our leadership will not be guaranteed. Yet, our success 
has never been guaranteed. It has been forged through decades of hard 
work, ingenuity, optimism, and common purpose.
This week, let us renew the enduring principles that have driven our 
Nation to the forefront of human progress. With our ships, trucks, 
trains, planes, and fiber optic lines, we will send our goods and 
services to every corner of the globe. Together, we will make this new 
century an American century yet again, and secure a bright future for 
generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 
2010, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
the benefits of trade to our Nation, American workers, and the global 
economy.

Proclamation 8522 of May 14, 2010

Armed Forces Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's Armed Forces represent the very best of our national 
character. They have answered the call to defend our Nation, and their 
service and sacrifice humble us all. On Armed Forces Day, we pay tribute 
to these patriots who risk their lives, sometimes giving their last full 
measure of devotion, to preserve the vision of our forebears and the 
freedoms we enjoy.
Our service members carry on the proud traditions of duty and valor that 
have sustained us from our earliest days of independence. Today, we have 
the greatest military force in the history of the world because we have 
the finest personnel in the world. Wherever they are needed, from Iraq 
and Afghanistan to right here at home, they are serving and protecting 
our Nation.
We owe our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen more 
than our gratitude; we owe them our support. That is why my 
Administration is committed to ensuring they have the strategy, clear 
mission, and equipment they need to get the job done, and the resources 
they deserve when they come home. We are also increasing support for 
military spouses and families who must deal with the stress and 
separation of war.
Today, let us raise our flags high to honor the service members who keep 
us safe, as we reaffirm our commitment to fulfill our duty to them.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby 
proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.
I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air 
Force, Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of 
the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the 
Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and 
cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.
I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to 
provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction 
each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public 
understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.
I also invite veterans, civic, and other organizations to join in the 
observance of Armed Forces Day each year.

[[Page 56]]

Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United 
States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn 
more about military service by attending and participating in the local 
observances of the day. I also encourage Americans to volunteer at 
organizations that provide support to our troops.
Proclamation 8380 of May 14, 2009, is hereby superseded.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8523 of May 20, 2010

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year during hurricane season, Americans living in our coastal and 
inland communities face the danger of these powerful storms. From high 
winds and storm surges to tornadoes and flooding, the hazards of 
hurricanes can destroy communities and devastate lives, and we must 
aggressively prepare our shores and protect our families.
During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, I urge individuals, 
families, communities, and businesses to take time to plan for the storm 
season before it begins. While hurricane forecasting has improved, 
storms may still develop with little warning. For Americans in 
hurricane-threatened areas, knowledge and preparation are pivotal to 
ensure emergency readiness and responsiveness. The National Hurricane 
Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well 
as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, recommend taking several 
important steps to ensure safety. These precautions include: developing 
a family disaster plan; maintaining an emergency supply kit; securing 
homes, businesses, and belongings; and learning evacuation routes.
I urge those in hurricane-threatened areas to visit www.Hurricanes.gov/
Prepare to learn more about what they can do to protect themselves and 
their property from hurricanes. Emergency preparation resources for 
hurricanes and other natural disasters are also available at: 
www.Ready.gov.
To help Americans meet the challenges of severe weather, my 
Administration is focusing on preparedness and response--before, during, 
and after hurricanes. We are improving accountability and coordination 
between all levels of government, modernizing our emergency 
communications, and empowering more families to prepare themselves. 
Thanks to advancements in hurricane forecasting and tracking, the 
National Hurricane Center is working to give citizens more notice before 
impending storms. With the right planning and preparation, we can 
safeguard lives, protect property, and enhance America's resilience to 
national weather emergencies.

[[Page 57]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 23 through May 29, 
2010, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon all 
Americans, especially those in hurricane-prone areas, to learn more 
about protecting themselves against hurricanes and to work together to 
respond to them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8524 of May 20, 2010

National Safe Boating Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's waterways provide endless opportunities for family 
recreation, exercise, or moments of quiet solitude and reflection. As 
the weather warms and people prepare to spend time on the water, let us 
recommit during National Safe Boating Week to practicing safe techniques 
so boaters of all ages can enjoy this pastime.
Responsible and informed behavior on board can keep boaters and 
passengers free from harm. Wearing a Coast Guard-approved life jacket, 
taking a boating safety course, being aware of weather conditions, and 
ensuring all boats have the necessary safety equipment are all important 
steps Americans can take to minimize risk on the water. Those who 
operate boats must also take extra precautions to keep their passengers 
safe and never boat under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
To help save lives and prevent accidents, the United States Coast Guard 
partners with boating organizations to raise awareness and teach safe 
boating practices. Boaters can take advantage of these opportunities to 
learn, make informed decisions, and teach family and friends to use 
caution while on board. By practicing safe boating habits and 
encouraging others to do the same, Americans can protect themselves and 
others throughout the boating season.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by Joint Resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22 through May 28, 2010, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating 
activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating 
practices and to take advantage of boating education.

Proclamation 8525 of May 20, 2010

Small Business Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Small business owners embody the spirit of entrepreneurship and strong 
work ethic that lie at the heart of the American dream. They are the 
backbone of our Nation's economy, they employ tens of millions of 
workers, and, in the past 15 years, they have created the majority of 
new private sector jobs. During Small Business Week, we reaffirm our 
support for America's small businesses and celebrate the proud tradition 
of private enterprise they represent.
Our Nation is still emerging from one of the worst recessions in our 
history, and small businesses were among the hardest hit. From mom-and-
pop stores to high tech start-ups, countless small businesses have been 
forced to lay off employees or shut their doors entirely. In these 
difficult times, we must do all we can to help these firms recover from 
the recession and put Americans back to work. Our Government cannot 
guarantee a company's success, but it can help create market conditions 
that allow small businesses to thrive.
My Administration is committed to helping small businesses drive our 
economy toward recovery and long-term growth. The American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act has supported billions of dollars in loans and Federal 
contracts for small businesses across the country. The Affordable Care 
Act makes it easier for small business owners to provide health 
insurance to their employees, and gives entrepreneurs the security they 
need to innovate and take risks. We have also enacted new tax cuts and 
tax credits for small firms. Still, we must do more to empower these 
companies.
In this year's State of the Union address, I proposed creating a $30 
billion lending fund to help increase the flow of credit to small 
businesses, and I call on the Congress to pass this legislation quickly. 
My Administration is also working to extend and enhance Small Business 
Administration programs that have helped small business owners acquire 
loans and hire workers.
This week, we celebrate the role of entrepreneurs and small businesses 
in our national life. They are the engine of our prosperity and a proud 
reflection of our character. A healthy small business sector will give 
us vibrant communities, cutting-edge technology, and an American economy 
that can compete and win in the 21st century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 23 through May 29,

[[Page 59]]

2010, as Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the 
tremendous contributions of small businesses to our Nation with 
appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 8526 of May 20, 2010

National Maritime Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Even before our Nation declared independence, our forebears recognized 
the importance of merchant ships and seafarers to our economic and 
national security. Since 1775, America's maritime fleet has risen to the 
challenges before them and worked to meet our country's needs in times 
of peace and war alike. On National Maritime Day, we recognize the men 
and women of the United States Merchant Marine for their contributions 
to America's leadership in the global marketplace, and to our security.
Civilian mariners and their ships have played an important role in 
equipping our military forces at sea in national conflicts. During World 
War II, they executed the largest sealift the world had ever known, and 
thousands gave their lives to help convoys with desperately needed 
supplies reach our troops. Their service to our Nation continues today. 
Merchant mariners support military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
as well as humanitarian missions, including the delivery of supplies to 
Haiti following this year's devastating earthquake.
The United States Merchant Marine also shepherds the safe passage of 
American goods. They carry our exports to customers around the world and 
support the flow of domestic commerce on our maritime highways. They 
help strengthen our Nation's economy; bolster job-creating businesses; 
and, along with the transportation industry, employ Americans on ships 
and tugs, and in ports and shipyards. Today, we pay tribute to the 
United States Merchant Marine, and we honor all those whose tireless 
work is laying a foundation for growth, prosperity, and leadership in 
the 21st century.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2010, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance with 
appropriate activities, and I encourage all ships sailing under the 
American flag to dress ship on that day.

African-American Music Appreciation Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Music can tell a story, assuage our sorrows, provide blessing and 
redemption, and express a soul's sublime and powerful beauty. It 
inspires us daily, giving voice to the human spirit. For many, including 
the African-American community, music unites individuals through a 
shared heritage. During African-American Music Appreciation Month, we 
celebrate the extraordinary legacy of African-American singers, 
composers, and musicians, as well as their indelible contributions to 
our Nation and our world.
Throughout our history, African-American music has conveyed the hopes 
and hardships of a people who have struggled, persevered and overcome. 
Through centuries of injustice, music comforted slaves, fueled a 
cultural renaissance, and sustained a movement for equality. Today, from 
the shores of Africa and the islands of the Caribbean to the jazz clubs 
of New Orleans and the music halls of Detroit, African-American music 
reflects the rich sounds of many experiences, cultures, and locales.
African-American musicians have created and expanded a variety of 
musical genres, synthesizing diverse artistic traditions into a 
distinctive soundscape. The soulful strains of gospel, the harmonic and 
improvisational innovations of jazz, the simple truth of the blues, the 
rhythms of rock and roll, and the urban themes of hip-hop all blend into 
a refrain of song and narrative that traces our Nation's history.
These quintessentially American styles of music have helped provide a 
common soundtrack for people of diverse cultures and backgrounds, and 
have joined Americans together not just on the dance floor, but also in 
our churches, in our public spaces, and in our homes. This month, we 
honor the talent and genius of African-American artists who have 
defined, shaped, and enriched our country through music, and we recommit 
to sharing their splendid gifts with our children and grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2010 as African-
American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, and the people of the United States to observe this month 
with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and foster 
appreciation of African-American music.

Great Outdoors Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's vast and varied outdoor spaces are a source of great national 
pride, and we have long strived to protect them for future generations. 
Our lands and waters provide countless opportunities for exploration, 
recreation, and reflection, whether in solitude or with family and 
friends. During Great Outdoors Month, we renew our enduring commitment 
to protect our natural landscapes, to enjoy them, and to promote active 
lifestyles for ourselves and our children.
Our outdoor spaces include the farms, ranches, rivers, forests, and 
working lands that are integral to our culture and economy, as well as 
our National Parks, local parks, fishing holes, beaches, and other 
favorite spots that provide space for us to stay active and healthy. 
These places are especially important today, as an increasing number of 
Americans, especially children, fall into unhealthy sedentary 
lifestyles.
This year, I launched the America's Great Outdoors Initiative to foster 
innovative, community-driven strategies to protect our natural spaces, 
and to reconnect Americans with our great outdoors. We are addressing 
the conservation challenges and opportunities of the 21st century 
through partnerships with ranchers, farmers, sportsmen, and 
conservationists; State, local, private, and tribal leaders; educational 
and service programs like AmeriCorps; and business representatives and 
other stakeholders. To learn how you can join this effort, visit: 
www.DOI.gov/AmericasGreatOutdoors.
The America's Great Outdoors Initiative also builds upon Let's Move, 
First Lady Michelle Obama's effort to help our children eat more 
nutritious foods, lead healthier lives, and increase their physical 
activity. Exploring beyond the walls of their homes and schools will 
help inspire our children to move, run, play, and thrive. I encourage 
all Americans to visit www.LetsMove.gov to learn more.
In these difficult economic times, renewing our commitment to our 
natural places will foster jobs in the tourism and recreation industries 
while conserving our great outdoors. Moreover, as Americans, we are 
responsible for protecting our heritage, including the raw beauty of our 
lands and waters. Together, let us rise to meet that responsibility and 
safeguard our cherished outdoor spaces for our children and 
grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 62]]

the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2010 as Great 
Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors and 
to continue our Nation's tradition of conserving our lands for future 
generations.

Proclamation 8529 of May 28, 2010

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, it is our birthright that all people are created equal and 
deserve the same rights, privileges, and opportunities. Since our 
earliest days of independence, our Nation has striven to fulfill that 
promise. An important chapter in our great, unfinished story is the 
movement for fairness and equality on behalf of the lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. This month, as we recognize 
the immeasurable contributions of LGBT Americans, we renew our 
commitment to the struggle for equal rights for LGBT Americans and to 
ending prejudice and injustice wherever it exists.
LGBT Americans have enriched and strengthened the fabric of our national 
life. From business leaders and professors to athletes and first 
responders, LGBT individuals have achieved success and prominence in 
every discipline. They are our mothers and fathers, our sons and 
daughters, and our friends and neighbors. Across my Administration, 
openly LGBT employees are serving at every level. Thanks to those who 
came before us--the brave men and women who marched, stood up to 
injustice, and brought change through acts of compassion or defiance--we 
have made enormous progress and continue to strive for a more perfect 
union.
My Administration has advanced our journey by signing into law the 
Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which 
strengthens Federal protections against crimes based on gender identity 
or sexual orientation. We renewed the Ryan White CARE Act, which 
provides life-saving medical services and support to Americans living 
with HIV/AIDS, and finally eliminated the HIV entry ban. I also signed a 
Presidential Memorandum directing hospitals receiving Medicare and 
Medicaid funds to give LGBT patients the compassion and security they 
deserve in their time of need, including the ability to choose someone 
other than an immediate family member to visit them and make medical 
decisions.
In other areas, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
announced a series of proposals to ensure core housing programs are open 
to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. HUD 
also announced the first-ever national study of discrimination against 
members of the LGBT community in the rental and sale of housing. 
Additionally, the

[[Page 63]]

Department of Health and Human Services has created a National Resource 
Center for LGBT Elders.
Much work remains to fulfill our Nation's promise of equal justice under 
law for LGBT Americans. That is why we must give committed gay couples 
the same rights and responsibilities afforded to any married couple, and 
repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. We must protect the rights of LGBT 
families by securing their adoption rights, ending employment 
discrimination against LGBT Americans, and ensuring Federal employees 
receive equal benefits. We must create safer schools so all our children 
may learn in a supportive environment. I am also committed to ending 
``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' so patriotic LGBT Americans can serve openly 
in our military, and I am working with the Congress and our military 
leadership to accomplish that goal.
As we honor the LGBT Americans who have given so much to our Nation, let 
us remember that if one of us is unable to realize full equality, we all 
fall short of our founding principles. Our Nation draws its strength 
from our diversity, with each of us contributing to the greater whole. 
By affirming these rights and values, each American benefits from the 
further advancement of liberty and justice for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2010 as Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this month by fighting prejudice and discrimination in their own 
lives and everywhere it exists.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8530 of May 28, 2010

National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation is linked to the Caribbean by our geography as well as our 
shared past and common aspirations. During National Caribbean-American 
Heritage Month, we pay tribute to the diverse cultures and immeasurable 
contributions of all Americans who trace their heritage to the 
Caribbean.
Throughout our history, immigrants from Caribbean countries have come to 
our shores seeking better lives and opportunities. Others were brought 
against their will in the bonds of slavery. All have strived to ensure 
their children could achieve something greater and have preserved the 
promise of America for future generations.

[[Page 64]]

During the month of June, we also honor the bonds of friendship between 
the United States and Caribbean countries. This year's devastating 
earthquake in Haiti has brought untold grief to the Haitian-American 
community, many who continue to mourn the loss of loved ones as they 
help rebuild their homeland. These families and individuals remain in 
our thoughts and prayers. The United States has proudly played a leading 
role in the international response to this crisis, which included vital 
contributions from countries throughout the Caribbean. As Haiti 
recovers, we will remain a steady and reliable partner.
This month, we celebrate the triumph of Caribbean Americans, a diverse 
community that encompasses many nationalities and languages. They have 
become leaders in every sector of American life while maintaining the 
varied traditions of their countries of origin. Caribbean Americans 
enrich our national character and strengthen the fabric of our culture, 
and we are proud they are part of the American family.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2010 as National 
Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to 
celebrate the history and culture of Caribbean Americans with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8531 of May 28, 2010

National Oceans Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year during National Oceans Month, we rededicate ourselves to 
protect the Earth's dominant feature and precious resource. In 2010, 
this annual observance falls at a time of environmental crisis, as we 
continue our relentless efforts to stop and contain the oil spill 
threatening the Gulf Coast region. The oil spill has already caused 
substantial damage to our coastline and its natural habitats, and 
negatively impacted the livelihoods of Gulf Coast small businesses and 
communities. The environmental and economic devastation to the Gulf 
Coast region requires our continuing efforts to reverse the damage to 
our coastlines and revitalize affected areas.
As we respond to this disaster, we must not forget that our oceans, 
coasts, and Great Lakes demand our constant attention. They have long 
been under considerable strain from pollution, overfishing, climate 
change, and other human activity. Last year, I established the 
Interagency Ocean Policy Task

[[Page 65]]

Force and charged it with developing a clear direction for meeting our 
environmental stewardship responsibilities. Our oceans face complex 
challenges, and we must take a comprehensive approach to ensure their 
sustained protection, maintenance, and restoration.
The vitality and bounty of America's natural resources immeasurably 
impact our lives. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As we commemorate this special 
milestone, we are reminded by the ongoing Gulf Coast crisis that we 
still have much to do in order to safeguard our vast oceanic resources 
for generations to come. Forty years from now, when our children look 
back on this moment, let them say that we did not waiver, but rather 
seized this opportunity to fulfill our duty to protect the waters that 
sustain us.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2010 as National 
Oceans Month. I call upon Americans to learn more about what they can do 
to protect, conserve, sustain, and enjoy our oceans, coasts, and Great 
Lakes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8532 of May 28, 2010

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's founding, America's sons and daughters have given 
their lives in service to our country. From Concord and Gettysburg to 
Marne and Normandy, from Inchon and Khe Sanh to Baghdad and Kandahar, 
they departed our world as heroes and gave their lives for a cause 
greater than themselves.
On Memorial Day, we pay tribute to those who have paid the ultimate 
price to defend the United States and the principles upon which America 
was founded. In honor of our country's fallen, I encourage all Americans 
to unite at 3:00 p.m. local time to observe a National Moment of 
Remembrance.
Today, Americans from all backgrounds and corners of our country serve 
with valor, courage, and distinction in the United States Armed Forces. 
They stand shoulder to shoulder with the giants of our Nation's history, 
writing their own chapter in the American story. Many of today's 
warriors know what it means to lose a friend too soon, and all our 
service members and their families understand the true meaning of 
sacrifice.
This Memorial Day, we express our deepest appreciation to the men and 
women in uniform who gave their last full measure of devotion so we

[[Page 66]]

might live in freedom. We cherish their memory and pray for the peace 
for which they laid down their lives. We mourn with the families and 
friends of those we have lost, and hope they find comfort in knowing 
their loved ones died with honor. We ask for God's grace to protect 
those fighting in distant lands, and we renew our promise to support our 
troops, their families, and our veterans. Their unwavering devotion 
inspires us all--they are the best of America.
It is our sacred duty to preserve the legacy of these brave Americans, 
and it remains our charge to work for peace, freedom, and security. Let 
us always strive to uphold the founding principles they died defending; 
let their legacy continue to inspire our Nation; and let this solemn 
lesson of service and sacrifice be taught to future generations of 
Americans.
In honor of their dedication and service to America, the Congress, by a 
Joint Resolution, approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time 
for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of 
Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 31, 2010, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.
I request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, 
to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this 
Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the 
United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I 
also request the people of the United States to display the flag at 
half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8533 of June 10, 2010

90th Anniversary of the Department of Labor Women's Bureau, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, American women have played a vital role in the 
growth and vitality of our Nation's economy. They have tirelessly 
balanced

[[Page 67]]

responsibilities to work, family, and community, strengthening our 
economic leadership and enriching our national life. Today, there are 
more women in America's workforce than ever before, yet they still face 
significant obstacles to equal economic opportunity and advancement.
Recognizing the challenges women confronted in the workforce, the 
Congress established the Women's Bureau in the Department of Labor on 
June 5, 1920, 2 months before women gained the right to vote. For the 
past 90 years, the Women's Bureau has been a champion for working women 
nationwide through its commitment to advancing employment opportunities, 
improving their working conditions, and helping them achieve economic 
security.
As women surged into the labor force, the Women's Bureau tackled the 
barriers to their economic advancement. Early in its history, the 
Women's Bureau advocated for the successful inclusion of women under the 
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, establishing minimum wages and maximum 
working hours. The Bureau also played an instrumental role in the 
passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. And the first law that I signed as 
President--the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act--builds upon 
these vital protections to ensure people subjected to discrimination 
have better access to a remedy.
Equal economic opportunity and wage parity are not simply women's 
issues--they are American issues. As a Nation, we must recommit to the 
enduring vision of the Women's Bureau and work to support all wage-
earning women. With the hard-fought progress of the past as a 
foundation, we can build a better and brighter tomorrow, one in which 
our daughters have an equal right and opportunity to pursue the American 
Dream.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 11, 2010, as the 
90th Anniversary of the Department of Labor Women's Bureau. I call upon 
all Americans to observe this anniversary with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities that honor the Bureau's history, 
accomplishments, and contributions to working women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8534 of June 10, 2010

King Kamehameha Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Two hundred years ago, King Kamehameha the Great brought the Hawaiian 
Islands together under a unified government. His courage and leadership

[[Page 68]]

earned him a legacy as the ``Napoleon of the Pacific,'' and today his 
humanity is preserved in Ke Kanawai Mamalahoe, or ``the Law of the 
Splintered Paddle.'' This law protects civilians in times of war and 
remains enshrined in Hawaii's constitution as ``a unique and living 
symbol of the State's concern for public safety.''
On this bicentennial King Kamehameha Day, we celebrate the history and 
heritage of the Aloha State, which has immeasurably enriched our 
national life and culture. The Hawaiian narrative is one of both 
profound triumph and, sadly, deep injustice. It is the story of Native 
Hawaiians oppressed by crippling disease, aborted treaties, and the 
eventual conquest of their sovereign kingdom. These grim milestones 
remind us of an unjust time in our history, as well as the many pitfalls 
in our Nation's long and difficult journey to perfect itself. Yet, 
through the peaks and valleys of our American story, Hawaii's steadfast 
sense of community and mutual support shows the progress that results 
when we are united in a spirit of limitless possibility.
In the decades since their persecution, Native Hawaiians have remained 
resilient. They are part of the diverse people of Hawaii who, as 
children of pioneers and immigrants from around the world, carry on the 
unique cultures and traditions of their forebears. As Americans, we can 
all admire these traits, as well as the raw natural beauty of the 
islands themselves. Truly, the Aloha Spirit of Hawaii echoes the 
American Spirit, representing the opportunities we all have to grow and 
learn from one another as we carry our Nation toward a brighter day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 11, 2010, as King 
Kamehameha Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the rich heritage 
of Hawaii with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8535 of June 11, 2010

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When the Second Continental Congress adopted the American flag on June 
14, 1777, the thirteen stripes alternating red and white, and thirteen 
white stars in a blue field, represented ``a new constellation.'' On 
Flag Day, and throughout National Flag Week, we celebrate its lasting 
luminosity, and the enduring American story that it represents.
Although the configuration of stars and stripes has changed over the 
years it has been flown, its significance and symbolism have not 
wavered. The

[[Page 69]]

flag that once helped unite a new Nation to confront tyranny and 
oppression still flies today as an unequivocal emblem of freedom and 
liberty. The same flag that has been raised on beaches and battlefields 
still adorns the uniforms of our heroic sons and daughters serving in 
America's Armed Forces, including our troops serving in harm's way in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.
This past year, that same flag has continued to soar. When our American 
Olympic and Paralympics athletes were positioned triumphantly on the 
podiums of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, our 
majestic flag flew high above them. From homes to classrooms, civic 
gatherings to private memorials, we gathered to salute our flag, and in 
doing so, renewed the eternal promise of this glorious Nation.
More than 220 years after Old Glory was first embraced by our Founders, 
the Stars and Stripes remain the symbol of our Nation's pride. On Flag 
Day and during National Flag Week we recognize the American flag as a 
symbol of hope and inspiration to people at home and around the world--
as a constellation which grows brighter with every achievement earned 
and sacrifice borne by one of our citizens.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and call upon citizens of the United 
States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2010, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 13, 2010, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also call upon the people of the 
United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from 
Flag Day through Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 
Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in 
public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.
BARACK OBAMA

7. I have determined that technical corrections to general note 25 to 
the HTS are necessary to provide the tariff and certain other treatment 
accorded under the USSFTA to originating goods.

[[Page 71]]

9. I have determined that technical corrections to general note 26 are 
necessary to provide the tariff and certain other treatment accorded 
under the USCFTA to originating goods.
10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts 
affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence

Proclamation 8537 of June 18, 2010

Father's Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the first moments of life, the bond forged between a father and a 
child is sacred. Whether patching scraped knees or helping with 
homework, dads bring joy, instill values, and introduce wonders into the 
lives of their children. Father's Day is a special time to honor the men 
who raised us, and to thank them for their selfless dedication and love.
Fathers are our first teachers and coaches, mentors and role models. 
They push us to succeed, encourage us when we are struggling, and offer 
unconditional care and support. Children and adults alike look up to 
them and learn from their example and perspective. The journey of 
fatherhood is both exhilarating and humbling--it is an opportunity to 
model who we want our sons and daughters to become, and to build the 
foundation upon which they can achieve their dreams.
Fatherhood also carries enormous responsibilities. An active, committed 
father makes a lasting difference in the life of a child. When fathers 
are not present, their children and families cope with an absence 
government cannot fill. Across America, foster and adoptive fathers 
respond to this need, providing safe and loving homes for children 
facing hardships. Men are also making compassionate commitments outside 
the home by serving as mentors, tutors, or big brothers to young people 
in their community. Together, we can support the guiding presence of 
male role models in the lives of countless young people who stand to 
gain from it.
Nurturing families come in many forms, and children may be raised by a 
father and mother, a single father, two fathers, a step-father, a 
grandfather, or caring guardian. We owe a special debt of gratitude for 
those parents serving in the United States Armed Forces and their 
families, whose sacrifices protect the lives and liberties of all 
American children. For the character they build, the doors they open, 
and the love they provide over our lifetimes, all our fathers deserve 
our unending appreciation and admiration.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 20, 
2010, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the 
Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government 
buildings on this day, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. Let us honor our 
fathers, living and deceased, with all the love and gratitude they 
deserve.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.
BARACK OBAMA

Proclamation 8538 of June 18, 2010

World Refugee Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On World Refugee Day, we honor the contributions and resilience of those 
forced to flee from their homelands due to violence, persecution, or 
natural disasters. The hard-earned wisdom, diverse experiences, and 
unceasing courage of refugees enrich our Nation and strengthen our 
unique narrative--that America stands as a beacon of hope and opens our 
doors to those in need. Today, we celebrate the triumph of the human 
spirit exemplified by these displaced individuals, and acknowledge the 
compassion of those who welcome them into their homes and communities.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Refugee Act of 1980. This 
historic legislation championed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy created the 
current Federal Refugee Resettlement Program and codified into law the 
right to asylum for refugees. Through the Refugee Act and continued 
humanitarian aid, America's leadership in international relief efforts 
and in defense of human rights has helped expand protections for 
countless refugees, internally displaced persons, and other victims 
around the world.
Some refugees face bleak prospects of returning to their native soil, 
and they must find security in peaceful areas. Many uprooted people have 
found safe haven in America, bringing with them determination and 
optimism to contribute to our cultural, economic, and intellectual 
fabric. Welcoming more refugee men, women, and children than any other 
country, the United States has provided a home to some of the world's 
most vulnerable individuals, enriching our own country and advancing our 
leadership in the world.
Refugees face daunting challenges in an unfamiliar society with new 
rules, new resources, and often a new language. Yet, in spite of all 
they have faced--harrowing acts of violence or devastation, flight 
across borders in search of aid and shelter, uncertain and often 
prolonged stays in camps, and travel to a strange country--refugees are 
survivors. Living in the United States presents an opportunity to move 
forward, one that countless refugees from all over the globe have 
embraced. Their remarkable determination to rebuild a brighter future 
after great adversity embodies our Nation's promise and spirit of 
boundless possibility.
On June 20, we recognize the past 30 years of refugee resettlement and 
protection in the United States as a demonstration of our overall 
efforts in support of people in need around the world. Recognizing the 
continuing challenges and barriers faced by refugees, my Administration 
has undertaken a comprehensive review of the United States Refugee 
Admissions Program, with the goal of strengthening support for refugees 
and those who assist them. This will build on the vital work of 
international organizations like the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees, which provide emergency food, shelter, 
medical care, and other types of assistance to those uprooted by crisis. 
As we commemorate World Refugee Day, we recommit to ensuring that the 
blessings of liberty and opportunity are available to all who seek it.

America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 20, 2010, as 
World Refugee Day. I call upon all the people of the United States to

Proclamation 8539 of June 29, 2010

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, 
as amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the 
President may designate articles as eligible for preferential tariff 
treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
2. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing countries, except those 
designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 
503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to

U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from 
any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of 
the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
4. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(5)),

articles when imported from any beneficiary developing country.
6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined

As a mark of respect for the memory and longstanding service of Senator 
Robert C. Byrd, President pro tempore of the Senate, I hereby order, by 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of

Proclamation 8541 of July 16, 2010

Captive Nations Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1959, President Eisenhower issued the first Captive Nations 
Proclamation in solidarity with those living without personal or 
political autonomy behind the Iron Curtain. Since that time, once-
captive nations have broken free to establish civil liberties, open 
markets, and allow their people access to information. However, even as 
more nations have embraced self-governance and basic human rights, there 
remain regimes that use violence, threats, and isolation to suppress the 
aspirations of their people.
The Cold War is over, but its history holds lessons for us today. In the 
face of cynicism and stifled opportunity, the world saw daring 
individuals who

[[Page 83]]

held fast to the idea that the world can change and walls could come 
down. Their courageous struggles and ultimate success--and the enduring 
conviction of all who keep the light of freedom alive--remind us that 
human destiny will be what we make of it.
The journey towards worldwide freedom and democracy sought in 1959 
remains unfinished. Today, we still observe the profound differences 
between governments that reflect the will of their people, and those 
that sustain power by force; between nations striving for equal justice 
and rule of law, and those that deny their citizens freedom of religion, 
expression, and peaceful assembly; and between states that are open and 
accountable, and those that restrict the flow of ideas and information. 
The United States has a special responsibility to bear witness to those 
whose voices are silenced, and to stand alongside those who yearn to 
exercise their universal human rights.
In partnership with like-minded governments, we must reinforce 
multilateral institutions and international partnerships that safeguard 
human rights and democratic values. We must empower embattled civil 
societies and help their people connect with one another and the global 
community through new technologies. And, with faith in the future, we 
must always stand with the courageous advocates, organizations, and 
ordinary citizens around the world who fearlessly fight for limitless 
opportunity and unfettered freedom.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution, approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 
212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 18 through July 24, 2010, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm 
our deep commitment to all those working for human rights and dignity 
around the globe.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8542 of July 26, 2010

Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law in 
1990, a founding truth of our Nation was realized for persons living 
with disabilities--that all our citizens are entitled to the same 
privileges, pursuits, and civil rights. As we mark the 20th anniversary 
of this historic legislation, we renew our commitment to ensuring that 
everyone with disabilities can live free from the weight of 
discrimination and pursue the American dream.

[[Page 84]]

Across our country, Americans with disabilities have enriched and 
strengthened our Nation. Each day, individuals living with disabilities 
contribute immeasurably to every aspect of our country's national life 
and economy, from art to law, science to business, education to 
technology. Through steadfast determination, they have worked to make 
our communities more accessible, while empowering others to exercise 
independence and self-determination in all aspects of their lives. They 
have also brightened futures for countless young people. Today, children 
and youth with disabilities have a place in our classrooms alongside 
their peers, and are graduating with the knowledge and skills needed for 
postsecondary education and beyond.
Yet, despite the progress made in removing barriers and eliminating 
discrimination based on disability, on this 20th anniversary of the ADA, 
we must renew our commitment to achieving equal opportunity for, and the 
full inclusion of, all people with disabilities. My Administration has 
taken important steps towards achieving this goal. We have expanded 
funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act so that all 
of America's children have access to the tools to succeed. Under the 
health care reforms enacted in the Affordable Care Act, unfair practices 
like discrimination based on health status or pre-existing conditions 
will be eliminated. This landmark legislation also creates the Community 
Living Assistance Services and Supports Program to assist Americans with 
disabilities to live independently. Additionally, the Affordable Care 
Act provides States with more tools and financial incentives, such as 
the Community First Choice Option, which will support individuals with 
disabilities living in the communities of their choosing. These and 
other initiatives build on the ``Year of Community Living,'' which I 
launched in 2009 to support independent living.
The Federal Government is committed to leading by example in hiring 
people with disabilities, with focused efforts to recruit, retain, and 
support these public servants. In partnership with the many Federal 
agencies and departments with ADA responsibilities, my Administration 
will uphold strong and meaningful enforcement of the ADA to eliminate 
discrimination in employment, housing, public services, and community 
accommodations. I urge all Americans to visit Disability.gov for 
comprehensive disability-related information and resources.
I am also proud that the United States has in the past year joined the 
international community in signing the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In so doing, we affirm that these 
rights are not simply principles to safeguard at home, but also 
universal rights to be respected and advanced around the world.
In honor of and in solidarity with all Americans with disabilities and 
their loved ones, we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ADA, and 
recommit to build a more just world, free of unnecessary barriers and 
full of deeper understanding.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim Monday, July 26, 2010, 
the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I encourage 
Americans across our Nation to celebrate the 20th anniversary of this 
civil rights law and the many contributions of individuals with 
disabilities.

of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8543 of July 26, 2010

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today we celebrate the signing of the Military Armistice Agreement at 
Panmunjom and we honor our servicemembers who fought and died for 
freedom and democracy in the Korean War. This year marks the 60th 
anniversary of the start of the Korean War and the birth of an enduring 
friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea that is 
stronger today than ever before. Our alliance is rooted in shared 
sacrifice, common values, mutual interest, and respect, and this 
partnership is vital to peace and stability in Asia and the world.
Since our Nation's founding, the United States has relied on our Armed 
Forces to ensure our safety and security at home, and to protect lives 
and liberties around the globe. When Communist armies poured across the 
38th parallel, threatening the very survival of South Korea, American 
troops braved unforgiving conditions and rallied to the young republic's 
defense. Tens of thousands of our Nation's servicemembers lost their 
lives, and many more were wounded, declared missing in action, or taken 
as prisoners of war. The courageous service and ultimate sacrifices of 
these patriots and our allied combatants safeguarded a free government 
and vibrant economy in South Korea, forging a bond between our people 
that stands strong today.
As we commemorate the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War 
and the eventual conclusion of hostilities at Panmunjom, let us raise 
our flags high to honor the service and valor of our veterans, to 
reflect on the principles for which they fought, and to reaffirm the 
unshakeable bond between South Korea and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2010, as 
National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor 
our distinguished Korean War veterans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8544 of July 30, 2010

45th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law 
on July 30, 1965, millions of Americans and about half our Nation's 
seniors lacked health care coverage, unable to afford basic health care 
services or weather a medical emergency. The signing of Medicare forged 
a promise with older Americans--that those who have contributed a 
lifetime to our national life and economy can enjoy their golden years 
with peace of mind and the security of reliable medical insurance. 
Medicaid created an essential partnership between the Federal Government 
and the States to provide a basic health care safety net for some of the 
most vulnerable Americans: low-income children, parents, seniors, and 
people with disabilities. Forty-five years later, we must ensure this 
inviolable trust between America and its citizens remains stronger than 
ever.
Medicare and Medicaid support longer, healthier lives and economic 
security for some of the neediest among us. Since their expansion in 
1972, Medicare and Medicaid have covered millions of people with 
disabilities, protecting individuals who otherwise might not have access 
to affordable health coverage. Today, Medicare provides over 47 million 
Americans with dependable medical insurance, and is the largest health 
care provider in our Nation. State Medicaid programs provide health and 
long-term care coverage to more than 56 million low-income Americans. 
With too many communities stricken by the economic crisis, Medicaid 
provides a critical support for those struggling to raise healthy 
families or cope with illness or injury. No American should be one 
illness away from financial ruin, and we must continue to keep Medicare 
and Medicaid strong for the millions of beneficiaries who rely on these 
vital safety nets.
Medicare is not simply an entitlement program that starts at age 65--it 
is earned over a lifetime. The health care reforms in the landmark 
Affordable Care Act (ACA) renew and strengthen our pledge to America's 
seniors and families, ensuring Medicare and Medicaid will be there when 
they need it. Guaranteed Medicare benefits will not change, and 
participants will see greater savings, improved quality, and increased 
accountability in their health care coverage.
My Administration is taking steps to extend the life of the Medicare 
trust fund and to slow the growth of Medicare costs. The ACA helps 
accomplish this by addressing overpayments to insurance companies that 
operate Medicare Advantage plans; aggressively fighting waste, fraud, 
and abuse; and better coordinating the care of individuals with chronic 
conditions. The ACA also helps seniors and people with disabilities in 
Medicare who fall in the Part D coverage gap for prescription drug 
costs, or the ``donut hole,'' and Medicare beneficiaries who reach the 
donut hole this year are receiving a $250 rebate. Additionally, 
beneficiaries will see 50 percent discounts on brand name drugs in the 
coverage gap starting next year, and an end of the coverage gap 
altogether by 2020. To encourage health maintenance, the ACA enables 
Medicare to provide a free annual physical examination and other 
effective preventative care services, like certain colorectal

[[Page 87]]

cancer screenings and mammograms, with no co-pays or deductibles. 
Through focus on preventative care, increased efficiencies, and better 
management, the ACA is modernizing the health care system to make it 
work better for older Americans.
As President, I will protect the promise of Medicare and Medicaid, and 
make sure they continue to be strong and solvent for our children and 
grandchildren. As we celebrate the 45th anniversary of these critical 
programs, we reflect on a moment when our Nation made an enduring 
commitment to care for those who have given the most to our society, and 
those living in poverty. Let us continue protecting Medicare and 
Medicaid so older Americans can age with dignity, and so all Americans 
can live longer, healthier, and happier lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 30, 2010, as the 
45th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that 
recognize the vital safety net that Medicare and Medicaid provide for 
millions of Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8545 of August 5, 2010

National Health Center Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's community health centers are a vital component of our health 
care system, providing underserved communities access to coordinated 
primary and preventive care. During National Health Center Week, we 
recognize the important work of community health centers for their role 
in providing quality, accessible, and affordable patient care as we 
strive to build a health care system equipped for the 21st century.
Today, community health centers serve nearly 19 million patients across 
our Nation, and they are essential for underserved communities and 
vulnerable populations. They provide care to those who need it most, 
including millions of Americans with no medical insurance and whose 
illnesses might otherwise result in an unmet medical need or emergency 
room visit. As comprehensive wellness hubs, community health centers 
diagnose and treat illness and injury, and emphasize preventive care and 
wellness practices. Rooted in community-based and patient-centered care, 
they also respond to the unique needs of their local communities by 
conducting outreach and education, ensuring patients can communicate 
with their providers, and linking patients with social services.

[[Page 88]]

My Administration has made significant investments in community health 
centers. Serving as an economic anchor in many low-income and 
economically struggling communities, community health centers are an 
integral source of local employment and economic growth. The American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act has already provided unprecedented 
investments in the construction and renovation of community health 
centers so they can expand their staff and facilities, adopt health 
information technology systems, and meet their critical care needs.
The reforms in the landmark new health care law, the Affordable Care 
Act, also strengthen and build upon our existing system of health care 
centers. This law invests $11 billion in funding over the next 5 years, 
enabling community health centers to serve nearly double the number of 
patients currently receiving care, regardless of their insurance status 
or ability to pay. It also finances the construction of hundreds of new 
community health centers, bringing high quality health care, jobs, and 
economic benefits to countless individuals and communities.
Community health centers are at the heart of a modern, reformed health 
care system in America. We must continue to invest in these centers and 
ensure that comprehensive, culturally competent, and quality primary 
health care services are accessible in every community across our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of August 8 
through August 14, 2010, as National Health Center Week. I encourage all 
Americans to celebrate this week by visiting their local community 
health center, meeting local health center providers, and exploring the 
programs they offer to keep their families healthy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8546 of August 13, 2010

75th Anniversary of the Social Security Act

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On August 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the 
Social Security Act to protect ordinary Americans ``against the loss of 
a job and against poverty-ridden old age.'' Our Nation was entrenched in 
the Great Depression. Unemployment neared 20 percent, and millions of 
Americans struggled to provide for themselves and their families. In the 
midst of all this, the Social Security Act brought hope to some of our 
most vulnerable citizens, giving elderly Americans income security and 
bringing us closer to President Roosevelt's vision of a Nation free from 
want or fear.
As our country recovers from one of the greatest economic challenges 
since that time, we are grateful for President Roosevelt's perseverance, 
and for

[[Page 89]]

the countless public servants whose efforts produced the Social Security 
program we know today. Seventy-five years later, Social Security remains 
a safety net for seniors and a source of resilience for all Americans. 
Since 1935, it has been expanded to include dependent and survivor 
benefits, disability insurance, and guaranteed medical insurance for 
seniors through Medicare. It is a lasting promise that we can retire 
with dignity and peace of mind, that workers who become disabled can 
support themselves, and that families who suffer the loss of a loved one 
will not live in poverty.
My Administration is committed to strengthening our retirement system 
and protecting Social Security as a reliable income source for seniors, 
workers who develop disabilities, and dependents. After a lifetime of 
contributions to our Nation and its economy, Americans have earned this 
support. The new health care law, the Affordable Care Act, helps sustain 
this commitment and improves the long-term outlook of the Social 
Security program. My Administration is dedicated to safeguarding Social 
Security's promise of retirement with dignity and security.
On the 75th anniversary of the Social Security Act, let us ensure we 
continue to preserve this program's original purpose in the 21st 
century. Together, we can give our children and our grandchildren the 
same protections we have cherished for decades, and in doing so, lead 
our Nation to a brighter day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 14, 2010, as 
the 75th Anniversary of the Social Security Act. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
that recognize the historic legacy of the Social Security Act, as well 
as the vital safety net it provides to millions of Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8547 of August 20, 2010

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's founding, the United States has been a beacon of 
economic opportunity and limitless possibility. America's strength and 
resiliency have relied on the vision of our entrepreneurs and small 
business owners, whose tireless work ethic has defined the character of 
our country. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we celebrate 
the millions of minority business owners whose firms generate jobs, 
strengthen our economy, and embody the entrepreneurial spirit of 
America.
Even in the toughest of times, America has been characterized by the 
belief that anyone with a good idea and enough hard work can succeed and 
share

[[Page 90]]

those achievements with their employees and communities. Today, as we 
emerge from a historic recession, many families and businesses face 
difficult economic challenges, and we must continue to prioritize job 
creation as part of a sustained recovery that works for all Americans. 
Minority-owned and operated enterprises are essential to stabilizing our 
economy now, and laying a foundation for future economic growth and 
prosperity.
Looking forward, we must continue to remove barriers so these businesses 
can create new employment opportunities, increase their capacity, and 
advance our long-term prosperity. To achieve this goal, my 
Administration is committed to taking concrete steps to increase 
Government procurement opportunities for small and minority businesses. 
By unleashing the energy and ingenuity of American entrepreneurs in the 
domestic and international marketplaces, we can generate millions of 
jobs here at home, open and expand new markets, reduce barriers to 
trade, and ensure strong and balanced economic growth. As America 
competes in the global economy, it is vital we capitalize on the 
dedication, creativity, and acumen shown by our minority business owners 
and their employees. Through the National Export Initiative, my 
Administration is teaming with American businesses to double our exports 
over the next 5 years. The skills and leadership of minority business 
owners and employees will be critical as our public servants and 
business leaders develop the linguistic capabilities, cultural 
competencies, and international partnerships needed in a 21st century 
economy.
Minority Enterprise Development Week is anchored by the American legacy 
of entrepreneurial ambition and innovation. As we honor minority 
enterprises, their industrious owners, and their hard-working employees, 
let us also recognize the diversity, determination, insight, and 
innovation of American businesses, and the immeasurable support they 
lend to our leadership in the global marketplace.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 22 through 
August 28, 2010, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of our 
Nation's minority enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8548 of August 26, 2010

Women's Equality Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ninety years ago, on August 26, 1920, the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment to our Constitution was completed, guaranteeing women the 
right to

[[Page 91]]

vote, renewing our commitment to equality and justice, and marking a 
turning point in our Nation's history. As we celebrate this important 
milestone and the achievements and shattered ceilings of the past, we 
also recognize the inequalities that remain and our charge to overcome 
them.
In a letter to John Adams, who was then serving as a delegate to the 
First Continental Congress, Abigail Adams once implored her husband to 
``remember the ladies'' in the ``new code of laws'' of our fledgling 
country. It has taken the collective efforts of daring and tenacious 
women over many generations to realize the principles and freedoms 
enshrined in our Constitution. Standing on the shoulders of these 
trailblazers, we pay tribute to the brave women who dot the pages of our 
history books, and to those who have quietly broken barriers in our 
workplaces, communities, and society.
We can see the remarkable fruits of past struggles and victories today. 
For nearly two centuries, America could only imagine a female justice 
sitting on the Supreme Court of the United States. Today, for the first 
time in our Nation's history, three women sit on the bench of the 
highest court of the land, and I am proud to be the first President to 
nominate two women to the Court. Women lead in boardrooms and in our 
Armed Forces, in classrooms and conference rooms, and in every sector of 
society. Their boundless determination has enabled today's young women 
to dream bigger as they see themselves reflected at the highest levels 
of business, communications, and public service--including in my 
Administration and Cabinet. If we continue to fight for our hopes and 
aspirations, there will be no limit to the possibilities for our 
daughters and granddaughters.
As we celebrate 90 years of progress on Women's Equality Day, we also 
recognize the realities of the present. Women comprise less than one-
fifth of our Congress and account for a mere fraction of the chief 
executives at the helm of our biggest companies. Women hold only 27 
percent of jobs in science and engineering, which are critical to our 
economic growth in a 21st-century economy. And, almost 50 years after 
the Equal Pay Act was enacted, American women still only earn 77 cents 
for every dollar men earn. This gap increases among minority women and 
those living with disabilities.
These disparities remind us that our work remains unfinished. My 
Administration remains committed to advancing women's equality in all 
areas of our society and around the world. I was proud to create the 
White House Council on Women and Girls to help ensure that American 
women and girls are treated fairly in all matters of public policy. I 
also appointed the first White House Advisor on Violence Against Women, 
whose leadership will guide my Administration in confronting violence 
and sexual assault against women. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the 
first bill I signed as President, restored basic protections against pay 
discrimination for women, and to build upon that law, I support passage 
of the Paycheck Fairness Act. I have also established the National Equal 
Pay Enforcement Task Force to ensure equal pay laws are vigorously 
enforced throughout the country. Workplace flexibility is also important 
to women and families, and we will continue coordinating with Federal 
agencies to make quality child care more affordable, promote work 
policies that improve work-family balance, and advance the economic 
development and security of all women.
Fifteen years after the world gathered in Beijing for the Fourth World 
Conference on Women, far too many women around the world still lack 
access

[[Page 92]]

to basic education and economic opportunity, face gender-based violence, 
and cannot participate fully and equally in their societies. To help 
address this, I appointed the first-ever Ambassador at Large for Global 
Women's Issues to elevate the importance of women's empowerment in all 
aspects of our foreign policy. From Afghanistan to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, the United States will continue its commitment to 
the rights of women around the world.
Women's rights are ultimately human rights, and the march for equality 
will not end until full parity and equal opportunity are attained in 
every State and workplace across our Nation. It remains our 
responsibility to ensure that the principles of justice and equality 
apply to all Americans, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, disability, or socioeconomic status. If we stay true to our 
founding ideals and the example of those who insisted upon nothing less 
than full equality, we can and will perpetuate the line of progress that 
runs throughout our Nation's history for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2010, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
celebrate the achievements of women and recommit themselves to the goal 
of true gender equality in this country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8549 of August 27, 2010

National Preparedness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Preparedness Month, we stress the importance of 
strengthening the security and resiliency of our Nation through 
systematic preparation for the full range of hazards threatening the 
United States in the 21st century, including natural disasters, cyber 
attacks, pandemic disease, and acts of terrorism. This year marks the 
fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, one of the most tragic and 
destructive disasters in American history. In remembrance of this 
national tragedy, we must reaffirm our commitment to readiness and the 
necessity of preparedness.
By empowering Americans with information about the risks we face, we can 
all take concrete actions to protect ourselves, our families, our 
communities, and our country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
(FEMA) Ready Campaign provides simple and practical steps every American 
can take to be better prepared. At the community level, Citizen Corps 
enables volunteers to contribute to homeland security efforts by 
educating, training, and coordinating local activities that help make us 
safer, better

[[Page 93]]

prepared, and more responsive during emergencies. I encourage all 
Americans to visit Ready.gov and CitizenCorps.gov for more information 
and resources on emergency preparedness, including how to prepare a 
family emergency plan, create an emergency supply kit, and get involved 
in community preparedness efforts.
My Administration has made emergency and disaster preparedness a top 
priority, and is dedicated to a comprehensive approach that relies upon 
the responsiveness and cooperation of government at all levels, the 
private and nonprofit sectors, and individual citizens. I also encourage 
Americans to get involved with the thousands of organizations in the 
National Preparedness Month Coalition, which will share preparedness 
information and hold preparedness events and activities across the 
United States. By strengthening citizen preparedness now, we can be 
ready when disaster strikes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as 
National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the 
importance of preparedness and observe this month by working together to 
enhance our national security, resilience, and readiness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8550 of August 31, 2010

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each day brings new opportunities for personal growth, renewal, and 
transformation to millions of Americans who have chosen to forge a path 
toward recovery from addiction to drugs or alcohol. While addiction can 
destroy self-confidence, family ties, and friendships, recovery can 
restore the promise of a brighter tomorrow. During National Alcohol and 
Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we express support for those living 
healthy and productive lives in long-term recovery, we applaud those 
working to help struggling Americans break the cycle of abuse, and we 
encourage those in need to seek help.
This year's theme, ``Join the Voices for Recovery: Now More Than 
Ever!,'' calls us to an urgent mission--to save lives from the hazards 
of addiction. As we make quality and affordable health care more 
accessible to all Americans, we also resolve to build a healthier Nation 
by increasing access to treatment and recovery programs in our health 
care system. To help achieve this goal, the Affordable Care Act supports 
services available to address addiction. Together, we can reduce the 
harmful consequences of untreated addiction, such as violence, failure 
in school, job loss, child abuse,

[[Page 94]]

crimes, and death. I encourage all Americans to visit RecoveryMonth.gov 
for more resources and information.
The journey to recovery requires great fortitude and a supportive 
network. As we celebrate National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery 
Month, we also express our appreciation for the family members, mutual 
aid groups, peer support programs, health professionals, and community 
leaders that provide compassion, care, and hope. Across America, we must 
spread the word that substance abuse is preventable, that addiction is 
treatable, and that recovery is possible.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as 
National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and activities, and to celebrate the lives freed from addiction to 
illicit drugs, alcohol, or prescription medications.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8551 of August 31, 2010

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

While we have made great strides in the battle against ovarian cancer, 
this disease continues to claim more lives than any other gynecologic 
cancer. During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we honor all 
those lost to and living with ovarian cancer, and we renew our 
commitment to developing effective screening methods, improving 
treatments, and ultimately defeating this disease.
Each year, thousands of women are diagnosed with, and go on to battle 
valiantly against, this disease. Yet, ovarian cancer remains difficult 
to detect, and women are often not diagnosed until the disease has 
reached an advanced stage. I encourage all women--especially those with 
a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, and those over age 
55--to protect their health by understanding risk factors and discussing 
possible symptoms, including abdominal pain, with their health care 
provider. Women and their loved ones may also visit Cancer.gov for more 
information about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian and 
other cancers.
Across the Federal Government, we are working to promote awareness of 
ovarian cancer and advance its diagnosis and treatment. The National 
Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 
the Department of Defense all play vital roles in reducing the burden of 
this illness through critical investments in research. Earlier this 
year, I was proud to sign into law the landmark Affordable Care Act 
(ACA), which includes

[[Page 95]]

provisions to help women living with ovarian cancer. The ACA eliminates 
annual and lifetime limits on benefits, creates a program for those who 
have been denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, 
and prohibits insurance companies from canceling coverage after 
individuals get sick. The ACA also requires that women enrolling in new 
insurance plans and those covered by Medicare or Medicaid receive free 
preventive care--including women's health services and counseling 
related to certain genetic screenings that identify increased risks for 
ovarian cancer. In addition, the ACA prohibits new health plans from 
dropping coverage if an individual chooses to participate in a 
potentially life-saving clinical trial, or from denying coverage for 
routine care simply because an individual is enrolled in such a trial.
During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and throughout the year, 
I commend all the brave women fighting this disease, their families and 
friends, and the health care providers, researchers, and advocates 
working to reduce this disease's impact on our Nation. Together, we can 
improve the lives of all those affected and create a healthier future 
for all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as 
National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon citizens, 
government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research 
institutions to raise ovarian cancer awareness and continue helping 
Americans live longer, healthier lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8552 of August 31, 2010

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Although its mortality rate has steadily fallen in the last decade, 
prostate cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer deaths among 
men in the United States. This year alone, nearly 218,000 men will be 
diagnosed with prostate cancer, and more than 32,000 men will die from 
this disease. National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month gives us the 
opportunity to renew our commitment to fight this disease by finding 
better ways to prevent, detect, and treat it.
The exact causes of prostate cancer are not known, but awareness can 
help men make more informed choices about their health. Researchers have 
identified several factors that may increase a man's risk of developing 
prostate cancer, including age, race, and family history. According to 
the National Cancer Institute, avoiding smoking, losing weight, 
maintaining a

[[Page 96]]

healthy diet, and exercising may all help prevent certain cancers. We 
must ensure that more men are informed about all aspects of this 
disease, including early detection and possible treatment. I encourage 
men to talk with their doctors about risk factors, prevention, and 
preventative screenings. And I invite all Americans to visit Cancer.gov 
for more information and resources about the symptoms, diagnosis, and 
treatment of prostate and other cancers.
Until we find a cure for this disease, my Administration will continue 
promoting awareness of this illness and supporting prostate cancer 
research and treatment, including research to help determine why 
prostate cancer affects some racial and ethnic groups more than others. 
The National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and the Department of Defense all play vital roles in 
reducing the burden of prostate cancer through critical investments in 
research. The health care reforms included in the landmark Affordable 
Care Act also address specific needs of individuals fighting cancer, 
including removing annual and lifetime caps on insurance coverage, 
prohibiting insurance companies from dropping coverage after an 
individual gets sick, and guaranteeing insurance coverage for 
individuals participating in clinical trials, the cornerstone of cancer 
research.
As we observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we stand by the 
fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons battling prostate cancer, as well 
as their families and the health care providers, researchers, and 
advocates who are working to combat this disease and save lives. By 
joining together to raise awareness of prostate cancer and supporting 
research, we can continue to make progress against this devastating 
disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, Government 
agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other groups 
to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of 
prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8553 of August 31, 2010

National Wilderness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For centuries, the American spirit of exploration and discovery has led 
us to experience the majesty of our Nation's wilderness. From raging 
rivers to serene prairies, from mountain peaks slicing the skyline to 
forests teeming with life, our Nation's landscapes have provided wonder, 
inspiration, and strength to all Americans. Many sites continue to hold 
historical, cultural,

[[Page 97]]

and religious significance for Indian tribes, the original stewards of 
this continent. We must continue to preserve and protect these scenic 
places and the life that inhabits them so they may be rediscovered and 
appreciated by generations to come.
As we celebrate America's abundance of diverse lands, remarkable 
wildlife, and untamed beauty during National Wilderness Month, we also 
look back on our rich history of conservation. It was over 100 years ago 
that President Theodore Roosevelt marveled at the stark grandeur of the 
Grand Canyon and declared, ``the ages have been at work on it, and man 
can only mar it.'' Since that time, administrations have worked across 
party lines to defend America's breathtaking natural sites. President 
Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act in 1964, and many Presidents 
have since added new places to this great network of protected lands so 
that millions of acres of forests, monuments, and parks will be 
preserved for our children and grandchildren.
Following in the footsteps of my predecessors, I signed the Omnibus 
Public Land Management Act last year to restore and protect more of our 
cherished wild spaces. In April of this year, I established the 
America's Great Outdoors Initiative to develop a community-based 21st 
century conservation agenda that can also spur job creation in the 
tourism and recreation industries. My Administration will continue to 
work closely with our State, local, and tribal partners to connect 
Americans with the great outdoors.
This month, we renew our pledge to build upon the legacy of our 
forebears. Together, we must ensure that future generations can 
experience the tranquility and grandeur of America's natural places. As 
we resolve to meet this responsibility, let us also reflect on the ways 
in which our lives have been enriched by the gift of the American 
wilderness.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as 
National Wilderness Month. I invite all Americans to visit and enjoy our 
wilderness areas, to learn about their vast history, and to aid in the 
protection of our precious national treasures.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8554 of September 1, 2010

National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One of the greatest responsibilities we have as a Nation is to safeguard 
the health and well-being of our children. We now face a national 
childhood obesity crisis, with nearly one in every three of America's 
children being overweight or obese. There are concrete steps we can take 
right away as

[[Page 98]]

concerned parents, caregivers, educators, loved ones, and a Nation to 
ensure that our children are able to live full and active lives. During 
National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, I urge all Americans to take 
action to meet our national goal of solving the problem of childhood 
obesity within a generation.
Childhood obesity has been a growing problem for decades. While it has 
afflicted children across our country, certain Americans have been 
disproportionately affected. Particular racial and ethnic groups are 
more severely impacted, as are certain regions of the country. In 
addition, obesity can be influenced by a number of environmental and 
behavioral factors, including unhealthy eating patterns and too little 
physical activity at home and at school.
We must do more to halt and reverse this epidemic, as obesity can lead 
to severe and chronic health problems during childhood, adolescence and 
adulthood, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and asthma. Not 
only does excess weight adversely affect our children's well-being, but 
its associated health risks also impose great costs on families, our 
health care system, and our economy. Each year, nearly $150 billion are 
spent to treat obesity-related medical conditions. This is not the 
future to which we want to consign our children, and it is a burden our 
health care system cannot bear.
Earlier this year, the First Lady announced ``Let's Move!''--an 
initiative to combat childhood obesity at every stage of a child's life. 
As President, I created a Task Force on Childhood Obesity to marshal the 
combined resources of the Federal Government to develop interagency 
solutions and make recommendations on how to respond to this crisis. The 
Task Force produced a report containing a comprehensive set of 
recommendations that will put our country on track for solving this 
pressing health issue and preventing it from threatening future 
generations.
The report outlines broad strategies to address childhood obesity, 
including providing healthier food in schools, ensuring access to 
healthy affordable food, increasing opportunities for physical activity, 
empowering parents and caregivers with better information about making 
healthy choices, and giving children a healthy start in life. I invite 
all Americans to visit LetsMove.gov to learn more about these 
recommendations and find additional information and resources on how to 
help children eat healthy and stay active.
The new landmark health care law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), 
includes a number of important tools for fighting and reversing the rise 
of childhood obesity. All new health insurance plans will be required to 
cover both screenings for childhood obesity and counseling on nutrition 
and sustained weight loss, without charging any out of pocket costs. The 
ACA also requires large restaurant and vending machine operators to 
provide visible nutritional information about the products they sell, 
enabling all Americans to make more informed choices about the foods 
they eat. As part of my Administration's comprehensive approach to 
combating this epidemic, the ACA includes millions in new funds to 
implement prevention activities nationwide that support recommendations 
of the Task Force on Childhood Obesity.
Our history shows that when we are united in our convictions, we can 
safeguard the health and safety of America's children for generations to

[[Page 99]]

come. When waves of American children were stricken with polio and 
disabled for life, we developed a nationwide immunization program that 
eradicated this crippling disease from our shores within a matter of 
decades. When we discovered that children were going to school hungry 
because their families could not afford nutritious meals, we created the 
National School Lunch Program. Today, this program feeds more than 30 
million American children, often at little or no charge. When we work 
together, we can overcome any obstacle and protect our Nation's most 
precious resource--our children. As we take steps to turn around the 
epidemic of childhood obesity, I am confident that we will solve this 
problem together, and that we will solve it in a generation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as 
National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month. I encourage all Americans to 
take action by learning about and engaging in activities that promote 
healthy eating and greater physical activity by all of our Nation's 
children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8555 of September 3, 2010

Labor Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Working Americans are the foundation of our Nation's continued economic 
success and prosperity. From constructing the first transcontinental 
railroad to shaping our city skylines, they have built our country and 
propelled it forward. Through great innovation and perseverance, our 
labor force has forged America as a land of limitless possibility and a 
leader in the global marketplace. On Labor Day, we honor the enduring 
values and immeasurable contributions of working men and women today and 
throughout our history.
As we recognize the contributions of the American workers who have built 
our country, we must continue to protect their vital role and that of 
organized labor in our national life. Workers have not always possessed 
the same rights and benefits many enjoy today. Over time, they have 
fought for and gained fairer pay, better benefits, and safer work 
environments. From the factory floors during the Industrial Revolution 
to the shopping aisles of today's superstores, organized labor has 
provided millions of hard-working men and women with a voice in the 
workplace and an unprecedented path into our strong middle class. By 
advocating on behalf of our families, labor unions have helped advance 
the safe and equitable working conditions that every worker deserves.

[[Page 100]]

Today, as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression, 
far too many American workers remain without a job. With every work hour 
lost and every plant closure and layoff, families and communities 
struggle to make ends meet and face difficult decisions about how to 
stay afloat. Yet, in the face of this tremendous challenge, our workers 
have renewed their commitment to achieving the American dream by 
training and educating themselves for careers crucial to our long-term 
competitiveness. To rebuild our economy, my Administration is focusing 
on job training and investing in industries that cannot be outsourced. 
By focusing on recovery at home, we are saving or creating millions of 
jobs in America and supporting the working men and women who will drive 
our 21st-century economy. More remains to be done, but we have taken 
important steps forward toward recovery.
American workers have always been ready to roll up their sleeves, clock 
in, and earn an honest living. That steady determination is why I have 
confidence in the American economy and confidence that we can overcome 
the challenges we face. There is no greater example of our country's 
resolve and resilience than that of our workers. As we celebrate Labor 
Day, we honor those who have advanced our Nation's strength and 
prosperity--American workers.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 6, 2010, as 
Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United 
States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that acknowledge the tremendous contributions of working 
Americans and their families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8556 of September 10, 2010

National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, thousands of children face the battle against cancer with 
inspiring hope and incredible bravery. When a child is diagnosed with 
cancer, an entire family and community are affected. The devotion of 
parents, grandparents, loved ones, and friends creates a treasured 
network of support for these courageous children. During National 
Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the young lives taken too 
soon and the survivors who face chronic health challenges, we celebrate 
the progress made in treatment and recovery, and we rededicate ourselves 
to fighting this disease so all children may have the chance to live a 
full and healthy life.

[[Page 101]]

While survival rates for many childhood cancers have risen sharply over 
the past few decades, cancer is still the leading cause of death by 
disease for young Americans between infancy and age 15. Too many 
families have been touched by cancer and its consequences, and we must 
work together to control, and ultimately defeat, this destructive 
disease. I invite all Americans to visit Cancer.gov for more information 
and resources about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of childhood 
cancers.
Tragically, the causes of cancer in children are largely unknown. Until 
these illnesses can be cured, my Administration will continue to support 
investments in research and treatment. The National Cancer Institute, 
the Federal Government's principal agency for cancer research, is 
supporting national and international studies examining the risk factors 
and possible causes of childhood cancers.
The health reforms included in the landmark Affordable Care Act advance 
critical protections for individuals facing cancer. Provisions in the 
law prohibit insurance companies from limiting or denying coverage to 
individuals participating in clinical trials, the cornerstone of cancer 
research. After recovering from cancer, children can no longer be denied 
insurance coverage due to a pre-existing condition. It also requires all 
new plans to provide preventive services without charging copayments, 
deductibles, or coinsurance, increasing access to regular checkups that 
can help detect and treat childhood cancers earlier. The Affordable Care 
Act eliminates annual and lifetime caps on insurance coverage and 
prohibits companies from dropping coverage if someone gets sick, giving 
patients and families the peace of mind that their insurance will cover 
the procedures their doctors recommend.
This month, we pay tribute to the health-care professionals, 
researchers, private philanthropies, social support organizations, and 
parent advocacy groups who work together to provide hope and help to 
families and find cures for childhood cancers. Together, we will carry 
on their work toward a future in which cancer no longer threatens the 
lives of our Nation's children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2010 as 
National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I also encourage all 
Americans to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to 
fighting childhood cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8557 of September 10, 2010

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Early in our Nation's history, higher education was not possible for 
most African Americans, and simple lessons in reading and writing were 
often conducted in secret. With a unique mission to meet the educational 
needs of African Americans, Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
(HBCUs) have been valued resources for our country since their inception 
before the Civil War. Historically Black Colleges and Universities have 
opened doors and cultivated dreams, and the contributions of their 
founders, faculty, students, and graduates have shaped our growth and 
progress as a Nation. During National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week, we honor these pillars of higher education in 
America, and we pay tribute to those who have worked to realize their 
promise.
Bastions of heritage and scholarship, HBCUs have produced African 
American medical professionals, lawyers, educators, and public officials 
throughout their history. Countless individuals have worked tirelessly 
to cultivate HBCUs, and their legacy is seen in graduates whose 
achievements adorn the pages of American history. From Booker T. 
Washington to Mary McLeod Bethune, Dr. W.E.B. DuBois to the Reverend Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., HBCU visionaries and graduates have set 
powerful examples of leadership, built our middle class, strengthened 
our economy, served in our Armed Forces, and secured their place in the 
American story.
HBCUs are important engines of economic growth and community service and 
will continue to play a vital role in helping America achieve our goal 
of having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 
2020. This year, I was proud to sign an Executive Order to strengthen 
the White House Initiative on HBCUs, which will collaborate with 
government agencies, educational associations, philanthropic 
organizations, the private sector, and other partners to increase the 
capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education to a greater 
number of students. Together, we will ensure HBCUs continue fostering 
determination in their students, instilling pride in their alumni, and 
adding rungs to our Nation's ladder of opportunity for future 
generations.
During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we 
celebrate the immeasurable contributions these crucibles of learning 
have made to our Nation. As we continue strengthening the capacity of 
HBCUs, let us also recommit to preserving and enriching their long 
tradition of hope and success, and to sustaining our collective effort 
to meet and exceed America's goals for educational excellence.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12 through

[[Page 103]]

September 18, 2010, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon all public officials, educators, 
librarians, and Americans to observe this week with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the tremendous 
achievements HBCUs and their graduates have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8558 of September 10, 2010

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In commemoration of the tragedies of September 11, 2001, we come 
together as Americans each September to honor the memory of the women, 
men, and children lost in New York City, in rural Pennsylvania, and at 
the Pentagon. We renew our commitment to those who lost the comfort and 
companionship of loved ones and friends in those moments, and we mourn 
with them.
This year's National Days of Prayer and Remembrance are a time to 
express our everlasting gratitude for the countless acts of valor on 
September 11, 2001, and in the dark days that followed. Innocent men and 
women were beginning a routine day at work on a beautiful September 
morning when they tragically lost their lives in a horrific moment of 
violence. We are forever indebted to the firefighters, police officers, 
and other first responders who put their lives on the line to help 
evacuate and rescue individuals trapped in offices and elevators. 
Rushing into chaos and burning buildings, many gave their lives so 
others might live. We continue to draw inspiration from the unflagging 
service rendered by volunteers who contributed to the recovery effort, 
including civilians and servicemembers.
At this somber time, we also pause to remember the sacrifices of the men 
and women in uniform who have lost their lives serving in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and elsewhere, while promoting freedom and security. When 
their country faced crisis and uncertainty, a new generation of 
Americans stepped forward and volunteered to serve. Their selfless 
contributions are immeasurable and must never be forgotten. We honor the 
members of America's Armed Forces who have left the comfort of home to 
protect our Nation. We pray for their protection from every danger as 
they carry out their vital missions.
 At a time of national tragedy, we relied upon the strength and 
resilience that has marked the pages of American history. Many Americans 
turned to God, and lifted up their fellow Americans in prayer. On these 
solemn days, let us remember that from the destruction of that morning, 
we came together as a people and a country, united in our grief and 
joined in common

[[Page 104]]

purpose to save, serve, and rebuild. The legacy of the lives lost nine 
Septembers ago and in defense of our Nation--of husbands and fathers, 
wives and mothers, cherished children, and dear friends and loved ones--
reinforces our resolve to unite with one another, for the country we all 
love and the values for which we stand.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 10, 
through Sunday, September 12, 2010, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States honor and 
remember the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones through 
prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the 
ringing of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I invite people around the world 
to participate in this commemoration.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8559 of September 10, 2010

Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Nine years ago, the United States of America suffered an unprecedented 
national tragedy. On September 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 individuals from 
across our Nation and from more than 90 others, lost their lives in acts 
of terrorism aimed at the heart of our country. The Americans we lost 
came from every color, faith, and station. They were cherished family 
members, friends, and fellow citizens, and we will never forget them. 
Yet, against the horrific backdrop of these events, the American people 
revealed the innate resilience and compassion that marks our Nation. 
When the call came for volunteers to assist our heroic first responders, 
countless men and women answered with a massive rescue and recovery 
effort, offering hope and inspiration amidst tremendous heartbreak. 
Today we remember those we lost on that dark September day, and we honor 
the courage and selflessness of our first responders, servicemembers, 
and fellow citizens who served our Nation and its people in our hour of 
greatest need.
Throughout America, patriotism was renewed through common purpose and 
dedicated service in the days and weeks following September 11. Many 
joined our Armed Forces to protect our country at home and abroad; 
others chose to serve in their own neighborhoods and communities, 
lending their skills and time to those in need. Fences and boundaries 
gave way to fellowship and unity.

[[Page 105]]

 In the wake of loss and uncertainty, Americans from every corner of our 
country joined together to demonstrate the unparalleled human capacity 
for good. To rekindle this spirit, I signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve 
America Act last year, which recognizes September 11 as a National Day 
of Service and Remembrance. I called upon every American to make an 
enduring commitment to serve their community and our Nation. The 
response to that appeal has been inspirational, and last year more than 
63 million Americans volunteered in their communities. I encourage all 
Americans to visit Serve.gov, or Servir.gov for Spanish speakers, for 
more information and resources on opportunities for service across 
America.
 By any measure, these myriad acts of service have strengthened our 
country and fostered a new wave of active and engaged citizens of all 
ages and walks of life. Americans should be particularly proud of the 
example set by our Nation's young people, who came of age following the 
horrors of September 11, yet still believe a truly patriotic idea: that 
people who love their country can change it. Through selfless acts for 
country and for one another, patriots in every corner of our Nation 
continue to honor the memory of those lost on September 11, and they 
reaffirm our charge to reach for a more perfect Union.
 By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as Patriot Day, 
and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has 
requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized 
National Day of Service and Remembrance.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2010, as Patriot Day and 
National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, 
agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag 
of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of 
Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives 
on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and interested organizations and 
individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the 
United States to participate in community service in honor of those our 
Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of 
silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the 
innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8560 of September 10, 2010

National Grandparents Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, American families have been guided and 
strengthened by the support of devoted grandparents. These mentors have 
a special place in our homes and communities, ensuring the stories and 
traditions of our heritage are passed down through generations. On 
National Grandparents Day, we honor those who have helped shape the 
character of our Nation, and we thank these role models for their 
immeasurable acts of love, care, and understanding.
Grandparents witness great milestones in the lives of their children and 
grandchildren. Whether with us when we learn to read or ride a bicycle, 
they celebrate early triumphs, console us when we are distressed, and 
cultivate our dreams. Through decades of hard work and sacrifice, our 
forebears have also enabled many of the rights and opportunities now 
accessible to all Americans. As a country and a people, our grandparents 
have made us who we are today.
National Grandparents Day presents a chance to show our profound 
appreciation and respect for the central roles that family elders play 
in our lives. The legacy of these selfless caregivers is not only 
reflected in the principles and sense of purpose they inspire in their 
loved ones, but also in their unique ability to reach across ages and 
enrich the lives of generations of Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12, 2010, as 
National Grandparents Day. I call upon all Americans to take the time to 
honor their own grandparents and those in their community.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8561 of September 15, 2010

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the early settlers of the New World to those reaching for the 
American dream today, Hispanics have shaped and strengthened our 
country. During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we pause to celebrate 
the immeasurable contributions these individuals have made to our 
Nation--from its inception to its latest chapters.

[[Page 107]]

Reflecting the remarkable diversity of the American people, Hispanics 
represent a wide range of nationalities and backgrounds. Like so many 
Americans, Hispanics have overcome great obstacles to persevere and 
flourish in every sector of our society. With enduring values of faith 
and family, hard work and sacrifice, Hispanics have preserved the rich 
heritage of generations past while contributing mightily to the promise 
of our Nation for their children and grandchildren.
Hispanics are leaders in all aspects of our national life, from the 
Supreme Court and halls of Congress to boardrooms and Main Streets. 
Across America, Hispanics protect neighborhoods as police officers and 
first responders, guide young people as teachers and mentors, and boost 
economic growth as business owners and operators. As members of the 
Armed Forces, heroic Hispanic men and women have also fought and died to 
defend the liberties and security of the United States in every war 
since the American Revolution, many serving before becoming American 
citizens.
This month, we honor Hispanics for enriching the fabric of America, even 
as we recognize and rededicate ourselves to addressing the challenges to 
equality and opportunity that many Hispanics still face. In reflecting 
on our Nation's rich Hispanic heritage, let us take pride in our unique 
and vibrant history, and recommit to a shared future of freedom, 
prosperity, and opportunity for all.
To mark the achievements of Hispanics in the United States, the 
Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and 
requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating 
September 15 through October 15 as ``National Hispanic Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2010, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8562 of September 16, 2010

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The summer of 1787 was a watershed moment in our Nation's history. In 
the span of four short months, delegates to the Constitutional 
Convention in Philadelphia established a Constitution for the United 
States of America, signing the finished charter on September 17, 1787. 
With their signatures,

[[Page 108]]

and subsequent ratification of the Constitution by the States, the 
Framers advanced our national journey.
On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and during Constitution Week, 
we commemorate the legacy passed down to us from our Nation's Founders. 
Our Constitution, with the Bill of Rights and amendments, has stood the 
test of time, steering our country through times of prosperity and 
peace, and guiding us through the depths of internal conflict and war. 
Because of the wisdom of those who have shaped our Nation's founding 
documents, and the sacrifices of those who have defended America for 
over two centuries, we enjoy unprecedented freedoms and opportunities. 
As beneficiaries, we have a solemn duty to participate in our vibrant 
democracy so that it remains strong and responsive to the needs of our 
people.
Each year, thousands of candidates for citizenship commemorate 
Constitution Day and Citizenship Day by becoming new American citizens. 
These individuals breathe life into our Constitution by learning about 
its significance and the rights it enshrines, and then by taking a 
solemn oath to ``support and defend the Constitution and laws of the 
United States of America.'' In so doing, they voluntarily accept that 
citizenship is not merely a collection of rights, but also a set of 
responsibilities. Just as our Founders sought to secure the ``Blessings 
of Liberty'' for themselves and their posterity, these new Americans 
have come to our shores to embrace and impart the fundamental beliefs 
that define us as a Nation.
In the United States, our Constitution is not simply words written on 
aging parchment, but a foundation of government, a protector of 
liberties, and a guarantee that we are all free to shape our own 
destiny. As we celebrate this document's profound impact on our everyday 
lives, may all Americans strive to uphold its vision of freedom and 
justice for all.
In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 
108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 
17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2010, as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2010, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that recognize our Constitution and 
reaffirm our rights and obligations as citizens of this great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8563 of September 16, 2010

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

``Until every story ends'' is a solemn promise to those who wear the 
uniform of the United States that they will never be left behind or 
forgotten. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we pay tribute to the 
American men and women who never returned home from combat, to those who 
faced unthinkable suffering as prisoners of war in distant lands, and to 
all servicemembers who have defended American lives and liberties with 
unwavering devotion. As a grateful Nation, we can never repay the 
profound debt to our heroes, and we will not rest until we have 
accounted for the missing members of our Armed Forces.
We demonstrate our deep gratitude and admiration for our brave patriots 
not in words alone, but in our actions to bring them home. Each year, 
specialists in our Department of Defense scour foreign battlefields and 
burial sites, interview witnesses, and search national and international 
archives for information about those missing from the Vietnam War, 
Korean War, Cold War, World War II, and other conflicts. Their work will 
not be complete, nor our commitment fulfilled, until the families of 
those taken or missing in action can rest knowing the fate of their 
loved ones.
On September 17, 2010, the stark black and white flag honoring America's 
prisoners of war and those missing in action will be flown over the 
White House; the United States Capitol; the Departments of State, 
Defense, and Veterans Affairs; the Selective Service System 
Headquarters; the World War II Memorial; the Korean War Veterans 
Memorial; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; United States post offices; 
national cemeteries; and other locations across our country. It is a 
powerful reminder that our Nation will never cease in our task to 
recover, remember, and honor the courageous men and women who have 
served and sacrificed so much for each of us.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws 
of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2010, as National 
POW/MIA Recognition Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day of 
honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8564 of September 17, 2010

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's founding over 200 years ago, patriotic Americans have 
answered the call of duty when our country has needed it most. As family 
members, employees, and leaders in their communities, members of the 
National Guard and Reserve give of themselves at home and abroad to 
preserve the American way of life. These dedicated citizens leave the 
comfort of their civilian lives to wear the uniform of the United 
States, protect our freedoms around the world, and serve within our 
borders during times of peace as well as turmoil. As we celebrate 
National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we honor those 
who serve in the National Guard and Reserve, and we give thanks to their 
employers, whose support and encouragement is critical to the strength 
of our Armed Forces.
Making up nearly half of our military force, the men and women in the 
National Guard and Reserve play a vital role in our national defense. 
Throughout the year, they train and prepare for new challenges faced in 
missions at home and across the globe. Whether providing assistance in 
response to natural disasters and emergencies, helping secure our 
borders to protect our homeland, or fighting on the front lines to 
defend our freedom, these gallant service members are willing to pay the 
ultimate sacrifice in the service of others. Their dedication commands 
the admiration of us all as they balance the demands of civilian and 
military life.
During this week, we pay special tribute to the employers of our 
Guardsmen and Reservists, whose support and flexibility bolster the 
contributions of these brave men and women. Through accommodating 
personnel policies that encourage National Guard and Reserve 
participation, and by bearing financial and organizational 
responsibilities, these employers ensure that our troops are mission-
ready when they are activated, and that their families will have the 
support they need before and after their loved ones' mobilization.
Our Nation has always relied upon the service of citizen-soldiers to 
protect our lives and liberties. During National Employer Support of the 
Guard and Reserve Week, we recognize both the exceptional spirit of 
service that characterizes these individuals, and their employers' 
commitment to maintaining the safety and security of the United States 
by caring for those who defend it.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 
September 25, 2010, as National Employer Support of the Guard and 
Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our 
heartfelt thanks to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and 
their civilian employers. I also call on State and local officials, 
private organizations, and all military commanders, to observe this week 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 8565 of September 17, 2010

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, the lives of Americans are touched by the hard work and 
dedication of our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers. The food 
they produce through their tireless efforts fuels our Nation, nourishes 
our bodies, and sustains millions at home and around the globe. As we 
celebrate National Farm Safety and Health Week, we recognize the 
tremendous contributions of these individuals and rededicate ourselves 
to ensuring their safety and health at all times.
Our farmers, ranchers, farmworkers, horticultural workers, and their 
families and communities are among the most productive in the world. Our 
agriculture industry employs only a tiny percentage of the United States 
workforce, yet its yield is worth billions of dollars a year and 
supports the growth and development of the American economy. 
Agricultural producers are stewards of our natural resources and 
precious open spaces, and they are playing a key role in developing 
renewable energy and moving America towards energy independence.
To safely continue this important work, those in the agriculture sector 
must take special precautions in their daily tasks. Despite the great 
advancements in modern agriculture, farming remains a labor-intensive 
and sometimes dangerous occupation. America's agricultural producers 
work in harsh weather conditions, handle dangerous chemicals and 
materials, and operate large machinery and equipment. I encourage these 
individuals and their families to conduct regular training on 
respiratory protection; proper handling and usage of pesticides and 
other hazardous materials; the inspection, maintenance, and safe 
operation of machinery and other equipment; and emergency response and 
rescue procedures. Additionally, farms and ranches with children or 
novice farmers should receive proactive health and safety instruction to 
prevent injury or illness.
By working together to ensure the highest standards of health and safety 
for our agricultural producers, we will build upon this vital industry 
and its contributions to make our Nation stronger, more secure, and more 
prosperous in the years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 
September 25, 2010, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services that 
serve

[[Page 112]]

America's agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to 
promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge Americans to 
honor our agricultural heritage and express appreciation to our farmers, 
ranchers, and farmworkers for their remarkable contributions to our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8566 of September 17, 2010

National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Education is critical to our children's future and to the continued 
growth and prosperity of our Nation. To maintain our leadership in the 
global economy, we have an obligation to provide a high-quality 
education to our children and ensure they can obtain higher education 
and job training. Currently, Hispanics are the largest and fastest 
growing minority group in our Nation, and they have been a vital force 
of innovation and development. As we look to deliver a world-class 
education that will determine America's success in the 21st century, we 
must ensure Hispanics have access to the resources and tools needed to 
compete and thrive.
Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) are key members of our higher 
education system and vital sources of strength for our Nation's 
students. They play an important role in attracting underrepresented 
Americans to science, technology, engineering, and math--fields that 
will be pivotal in the 21st-century economy. HSIs are committed to 
improving the lives of their students as well as helping revitalize the 
communities where they serve. Graduates of these institutions are 
helping expand our economy and enriching all aspects of our national 
life.
To prepare the next generation of great American leaders, my 
Administration has set a goal to have the highest proportion of college 
graduates in the world by 2020. Enhancing educational opportunities for 
Hispanics will be vital to achieving this objective, and we will need 
the continued leadership of our HSIs to increase the enrollment, 
retention, and graduation rates of our Hispanic students. Working 
together, we will open doors of opportunity for all our children and 
help them succeed on a global stage.
This week, we celebrate the contributions of the more than 200 Hispanic-
Serving Institutions in communities across our country, and we recognize 
the students, alumni, parents, teachers, and school leaders whose vision 
and dedication has brightened countless futures. We will need their 
dreams and hard work, ideas and talents, perseverance and daring in the 
days ahead to build a stronger, more prosperous tomorrow for our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through

[[Page 113]]

September 25, 2010, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. I 
call upon all public officials, educators, and people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that acknowledge the contributions these institutions and 
their graduates have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8567 of September 24, 2010

National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, the bond we have with our land is traceable to our 
earliest ancestors and etched into the character of our Nation. From the 
rocky shoals of New England to the rugged mountains of the West, the 
natural beauty and great diversity of our open spaces draw millions to 
the outdoors every year for sport, play, and relaxation. On National 
Hunting and Fishing Day, we recognize the Americans who engage in these 
timeless pursuits, and we reaffirm our commitment to conserving our 
native lands, waters, and wildlife for generations to come.
Like President Theodore Roosevelt--an enthusiastic hunter and a great 
conservationist--hunters and anglers value stewardship, often leading 
efforts to ensure the protection of our Nation's wildlife, habitats, and 
waterways. President Roosevelt understood that conservation was 
essential to preserving our hunting and fishing heritage, and during his 
Presidency established the first units of the National Wildlife Refuge 
System to sustain the outdoor traditions many Americans enjoy today. We 
recognize, as President Roosevelt did over a century ago, that we must 
champion the conservation of our lands, and those who know them well--
the individuals who hunt and fish--must endeavor to be their consummate 
guardians.
Conservation takes on even greater importance today as our lands, 
waters, and wildlife face threats from global climate change, loss of 
habitats, and environmental disasters. The abundance of our wilderness 
is not limitless and needs protection and restoration. To ensure 
America's wild spaces remain healthy and accessible for all to enjoy, 
outdoorsmen and women can continue to participate in innovative programs 
such as the Federal Duck Stamp Program to protect and restore our 
natural legacy. This includes rebuilding and safeguarding our fragile 
Gulf ecosystem, where the unique and beautiful bounty of waterfowl, 
fish, and other game confront exceptional hardships.
Following in the footsteps of President Roosevelt and other 
conservationists, my Administration is dedicated to fostering a national 
conversation about 21st-century conservation that embraces a broad 
coalition of Americans, including hunters and anglers. Through my 
America's Great Outdoors

[[Page 114]]

Initiative, we have heard from sportsmen and women across our country 
about the value of hunting and fishing, the challenges to wildlife 
conservation, and how the Federal Government can be a better partner for 
conservation. My Administration established the Wildlife and Hunting 
Heritage Conservation Council to enlist the efforts of the sporting 
community, wildlife conservation organizations, States, and Native 
American tribes to uphold our Nation's wildlife heritage and to meet the 
conservation challenges of our time. We added over 4 million acres to 
the Conservation Reserve Program this year to provide important wildlife 
habitats, and we have taken specific steps to benefit gamebirds in this 
program. In addition, we are providing millions of dollars to the 
Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, a new effort to 
encourage hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities on 
privately owned land.
Our ability to enjoy our land and wildlife today is a tribute to the 
character of conservationists who have come before us. On National 
Hunting and Fishing Day, we celebrate the time-honored traditions of 
hunting and fishing, as well as the preservation of America's vast 
natural resources, as we seek to protect them for centuries to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2010, as 
National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8568 of September 24, 2010

National Public Lands Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From majestic mountain ranges to beloved neighborhood parks, Americans 
enjoy the natural places our ancestors have celebrated and protected for 
centuries. Our public lands represent the American spirit and reflect 
our shared experience--our history, our culture, and our deep love for 
wild and beautiful places. Every September, thousands of Americans 
volunteer their time and talents to protect our parks, national forests, 
wildlife refuges, and other public lands. National Public Lands Day is 
an occasion to join together in honor of our Nation's unique natural 
treasures.
Every year, Americans take this opportunity to conserve and restore our 
public places. Last year, an estimated 150,000 dedicated volunteers 
removed litter and invasive plants; cleaned water resources; built and 
maintained trails; and planted trees, shrubs, and other native plants. 
This year,

[[Page 115]]

I encourage even more Americans to volunteer in local projects to have a 
greater impact on parks and public lands across our Nation.
Taking care of our public lands is and must continue to be a proud 
American tradition. In April, I hosted the White House Conference on 
America's Great Outdoors to address challenges and opportunities 
surrounding conservation today, and to identify new ways to work 
together to preserve our natural bounty. I also inaugurated the 
America's Great Outdoors Initiative to build a conservation agenda for 
the 21st century, and to reconnect Americans to our great outdoors. To 
do this, I instructed my Administration to participate in listening 
sessions around the country to hear Americans' concerns, and to learn 
about what citizens and communities are doing to safeguard our land, 
water, and wildlife, as well as places of historic and cultural 
significance. As a Nation, we must engage in a new conversation about 
the conservation of the cherished places that have helped define us.
On this day of service and celebration, I encourage all Americans to 
give their time and energy to care for--and to go out and enjoy--our 
public lands. Together, we can build upon our history of stewardship so 
our unique landscapes are preserved for countless generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2010, as 
National Public Lands Day. I invite all Americans to join me in a day of 
service for our public lands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8569 of September 24, 2010

Gold Star Mother's and Families' Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In a long line of heroes stretching from the greens of Lexington and 
Concord to the mountains of Afghanistan, selfless patriots have defended 
our lives and liberties with valor and honor. They have been ordinary 
Americans who loved their country so profoundly that they were willing 
to give their lives to keep it safe and free. As we pay tribute to the 
valiant men and women in uniform lost in battle, we also recognize the 
deep loss and great strength of those who share in that ultimate 
sacrifice: America's Gold Star Mothers and Families.
For those in our Armed Forces who gave their last full measure of 
devotion, their loved ones know the high cost of our hard-won freedoms 
and security. An empty seat at the table and missed milestones leave a 
void that can never be filled, yet the legacy of our fallen heroes lives 
on in the people they loved. Their exceptional spirit of service dwells 
in the pride

[[Page 116]]

of Gold Star parents, who instilled the values that led these brave men 
and women to service. It grows in the hearts of their children, who know 
that, despite their absence, they gave their lives so others might be 
free. And, it echoes in the enduring love of their spouses--the backbone 
of our military families--who supported the person they cherished most 
in the world in serving our Nation. Though our Gold Star families have 
sacrificed more than most can ever imagine, they still find the courage 
and strength to comfort other families, support veterans, and give back 
to their communities.
It is from these examples of unwavering patriotism that we witness the 
values and ideals for which our country was founded, and for which 
America's sons and daughters have laid down their lives. As members of a 
grateful Nation, we owe a debt we can never repay, but hold this sacred 
obligation forever in our hearts, minds, and actions.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 26, 
2010, as Gold Star Mother's and Families' Day. I call upon all 
Government officials to display the flag of the United States over 
Government buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American 
people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public 
expression of our Nation's sympathy, support, and respect for our Gold 
Star Mothers and Families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8570 of September 27, 2010

Family Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Committed families shape and guide our children, preparing them for 
every obstacle they may encounter and encouraging them to overcome 
life's most demanding challenges. Today, our young people are exposed to 
negative influences that can lead to dangerous decisions, such as 
abusing drugs and alcohol. When parents, loved ones, and mentors take 
the time to educate youth about the risks they face, they can change 
attitudes and reduce the likelihood their loved ones will use alcohol 
and illicit drugs. On Family Day, we honor the devotion of parents and 
family members, and recognize their critical role in teaching our young 
people positive and healthy behaviors.
Parents across America balance demanding responsibilities at work with 
family needs, including valuable time spent with their children. 
America's

[[Page 117]]

youth encounter difficult choices in their daily lives, and we must be 
there for them as they strive to succeed in school and resist pressures 
to use dangerous substances that can affect their health and limit their 
potential. Concerned and active parents and guardians play a critical 
role in keeping our children drug-free, and they can demonstrate by 
example how to lead a healthy and drug-free life. I encourage all 
Americans to visit www.TheAntiDrug.com for information and resources to 
talk with children and warn them against the perils of drug use.
Simple daily activities such as sharing a meal, a conversation, or a 
book can have an enormous impact on the life of a child. Strong and 
engaged families help build a strong America, and it is our 
responsibility as concerned family members to discuss the dangers of 
substance abuse. On this Family Day, let us recommit to creating a solid 
foundation for the future health and happiness of all our Nation's 
children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 27, 2010, as 
Family Day. I call upon the people of the United States to join together 
in observing this day by spending time with your families, and by 
engaging in appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor and 
strengthen our Nation's families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8571 of October 1, 2010

National Arts and Humanities Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout history, the arts and humanities have helped men and women 
around the globe grapple with the most challenging questions and come to 
know the most basic truths. In our increasingly interconnected world, 
the arts play an important role in both shaping the character that 
defines us and reminding us of our shared humanity. This month, we 
celebrate our Nation's arts and humanities, and we recommit to ensuring 
all Americans can access and experience them.
Our strength as a Nation has always come from our ability to recognize 
ourselves in each other, and American artists, historians, and 
philosophers have helped enable us to find our common humanity. Through 
powerful scenes on pages, canvases, and stages, the arts have spurred 
our imaginations, lifted our hearts, and united us all without regard to 
belief or background.
The arts and humanities have also helped fuel our economy as well as our 
souls. Across our country, men and women in the non-profit and for-
profit

[[Page 118]]

arts industries bring arts and cultural activities to our communities, 
contributing tens of billions of dollars to our economy each year. 
Today, arts workers are revitalizing neighborhoods, attracting new 
visitors, and fostering growth in places that have gone too long without 
it.
As we work to bring the power of the arts and humanities to all 
Americans, my Administration remains committed to providing our children 
with an education that inspires as it informs. Exposing our students to 
disciplines in music, dance, drama, design, writing, and fine art is an 
important part of that mission. To promote arts education and pay 
tribute to America's vibrant culture, First Lady Michelle Obama and I 
have been proud to host a White House Music Series, Dance Series, and 
Poetry Jam. We have been honored to bring students, workshops, and 
performers to ``the People's House;'' to highlight jazz, country, Latin, 
and classical music; and to invite Americans to listen to the music of 
the civil rights movement, hip-hop, and Broadway.
By supporting the fields that feed our imagination, strengthen our 
children's education, and contribute to our economy, our country will 
remain a center of creativity and innovation, and our society will stand 
as one where dreams can be realized. As we reflect on the contributions 
of America's artists, we look forward to hearing their tales still 
untold, their perspectives still unexplored, and their songs still 
unwritten. May they continue to shed light on trials and triumphs of the 
human spirit, and may their work help ensure that our children's 
horizons are ever brighter.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2010 as 
National Arts and Humanities Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to join together in observing this month with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs to celebrate the arts and the 
humanities in America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8572 of October 1, 2010

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

While considerable progress has been made in the fight against breast 
cancer, it remains the most frequently diagnosed type of non-skin cancer 
and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women in our 
country. This year alone, over 200,000 Americans will be diagnosed and 
nearly 40,000 lives will be claimed. During National Breast Cancer 
Awareness Month, we reaffirm our commitment to supporting breast cancer 
research, and to educating all Americans about its risk factors, 
detection, and treatment. As we display pink ribbons on our lapels, 
offices, and storefronts,

[[Page 119]]

we also support those courageously fighting breast cancer and honor the 
lives lost to this devastating disease.
Thanks to earlier detection and better treatments, mortality rates for 
breast cancer have steadily decreased in the last decade. To advance the 
life-saving research that has breathed promise into countless lives, the 
National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and the Department of Defense are investing hundreds of 
millions of dollars annually in breast cancer research and related 
programs. Through funding from the Recovery Act, the National Cancer 
Institute is also conducting and supporting research and training 
projects, as well as distributing health information, to help Americans 
with breast cancer and health care providers face this disease.
Knowing what may contribute to breast cancer is an important part of its 
prevention. Risk factors for breast cancer include family and personal 
history, radiation therapy to the chest for previous cancers, obesity, 
and certain genetic changes. Being cognizant of these possible risk 
factors, as well as maintaining a healthy body weight and balanced diet, 
exercising regularly, and getting regular screenings, may help lower the 
chances of developing breast cancer. I encourage all women and men to 
talk with their health care provider about their risks and what they can 
do to mitigate them, and to visit Cancer.gov to learn about the 
symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of breast and other cancers.
Screenings and early detection are also essential components in the 
fight against breast cancer. For women ages 40 and over, regular 
mammograms and clinical breast exams by health care providers every one 
to two years are the most effective ways to find breast cancer early, 
when it may be easier to treat. Women at higher risk of breast cancer 
should discuss with their health care providers whether they need 
mammograms before age 40, as well as how often to have them. Regular 
mammograms, followed by timely treatment when breast cancer is 
diagnosed, can help improve the chances of surviving this disease.
In order to detect breast cancer early, we must ensure all women can 
access these important screenings. The Affordable Care Act, which I was 
proud to sign into law earlier this year, requires all new health 
insurance policies to cover recommended preventive services without any 
additional cost, including annual mammography screenings for women over 
age 40. The Affordable Care Act will also ensure that people who have 
been diagnosed with breast cancer cannot be excluded from coverage for a 
pre-existing condition or charged higher premiums.
During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we stand with our 
mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends, and we recognize all who have 
joined their loved ones in fighting their battle, as well as the 
advocates, researchers, and health care providers whose care and hard 
work gives hope to those living with breast cancer. By educating 
ourselves and supporting innovative research, we will improve the 
quality of life for all Americans affected by breast cancer and, one 
day, defeat this terrible disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2010 as 
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, Government 
agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and all other 
interested

[[Page 120]]

groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what 
Americans can do to prevent and control breast cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8573 of October 1, 2010

National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's digital infrastructure is critical to laying the foundation 
for our economic prosperity, government efficiency, and national 
security. We stand at a transformational moment in history, when our 
technologically interconnected world presents both immense promise and 
potential risks. The same technology that provides new opportunities for 
economic growth and the free exchange of information around the world 
also makes possible new threats. During National Cybersecurity Awareness 
Month, we recognize the risk of cyber attacks and the important steps we 
can take to strengthen our digital literacy and cybersecurity.
America relies on our digital infrastructure daily, and protecting this 
strategic asset is a national security priority. My Administration is 
committed to advancing both the security of our informational 
infrastructure and the cutting-edge research and development necessary 
to meet the digital challenges of our time. Earlier this year, we marked 
the one-year anniversary of my Administration's thorough review of 
Federal efforts to defend our Nation's information technology and 
communications infrastructure. We must continue to work closely with a 
broad array of partners--from Federal, State, local, and tribal 
governments to foreign governments, academia, law enforcement, and the 
private sector--to reduce risk and build resilience in our shared 
critical information and communications infrastructure.
All Americans must recognize our shared responsibility and play an 
active role in securing the cyber networks we use every day. National 
Cybersecurity Awareness Month provides an opportunity to learn more 
about the importance of cybersecurity. To that end, the Department of 
Homeland Security and the Federal Trade Commission have highlighted 
basic cybersecurity tips every computer user should adopt, including 
using security software tools, backing up important files, and 
protecting children online. I urge all Americans to visit DHS.gov/Cyber 
and OnGuardOnline.gov for more information about practices that can 
enhance the security of our shared cyber networks.
Effective cyber networks connect us and allow us to conduct business 
around the globe faster than ever before. We must advance innovative 
public- and private-sector initiatives to protect the confidentiality of 
sensitive information, the integrity of e-commerce, and the resilience 
of our

[[Page 121]]

cyber infrastructure. Together with businesses, community-based 
organizations, and public- and private-sector partners, we are launching 
a National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign: ``Stop. Think. Connect.'' 
Through this initiative, Americans can learn about and become more aware 
of risks in cyberspace, and be empowered to make choices that contribute 
to our overall security.
 The growth and spread of technology has already transformed 
international security and the global marketplace. So long as the United 
States--the Nation that created the Internet and launched an information 
revolution--continues to be a pioneer in both technological innovation 
and cybersecurity, we will maintain our strength, resilience, and 
leadership in the 21st century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2010 as 
National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to 
observe this month with activities, events, and trainings that will 
enhance our national security and resilience.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8574 of October 1, 2010

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 As Americans, we understand employment and economic security are 
critical to fulfilling our hopes and aspirations. We also know we are 
stronger when our country and economy can benefit from the skills and 
talents of all our citizens. No individual in our Nation should face 
unnecessary barriers to success, and no American with a disability 
should be limited in his or her desire to work. During National 
Disability Employment Awareness Month, we renew our focus on improving 
employment opportunities and career pathways that lead to good jobs and 
sound economic futures for people with disabilities.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA), the landmark civil rights legislation that established a 
foundation of justice and equal opportunity for individuals with 
disabilities. In the two decades since its passage, much progress has 
been made. However, Americans with disabilities continue to be employed 
at a rate far below Americans without disabilities, and they are 
underrepresented in our Federal workforce.
My Administration is committed to ensuring people living with 
disabilities have fair access to jobs so they can contribute to our 
economy and realize

[[Page 122]]

their dreams. To help achieve this goal, I signed an Executive Order in 
July to increase Federal employment of individuals with disabilities. 
This directive requires Federal agencies to design model recruitment and 
hiring strategies for people with disabilities, and to implement 
programs to retain these public servants. To ensure transparency and 
accountability, agencies will report on their progress on hiring people 
with disabilities, and the Office of Personnel Management will post the 
results of agencies' efforts online for public evaluation. As the 
Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government can become a model 
employer by increasing employment across America of individuals with 
disabilities.
The 21st-century economy demands a highly educated workforce equipped 
with the technology and skills to maintain America's leadership in the 
global marketplace. Technology has changed the way we work, and the 
Federal Government is leveraging emerging, assistive, and other 
workplace technologies to improve the options available for everyone, 
including workers with disabilities. We must improve the accessibility 
of our workplaces and enable the collaboration and contributions of 
every employee, and that is why I look forward to signing into law the 
Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010. 
This legislation will greatly increase access to technology, with 
advances in areas such as closed captioning, delivery of emergency 
information, video description, and other advanced communications--all 
essential tools for learning and working in today's technological 
society.
Individuals with disabilities are a vital and dynamic part of our 
Nation, and their contributions have impacted countless lives. People 
with disabilities bring immeasurable value to our workplaces, and we 
will continue to address the challenges to employment that must be 
overcome. This month, let us rededicate ourselves to fostering equal 
access and fair opportunity in our labor force, and to capitalizing on 
the talent, skills, and rich diversity of all our workers.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2010 as 
National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to 
embrace the unique value that individuals with disabilities bring to our 
workplaces and communities and to promote everyone's right to 
employment.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8575 of October 1, 2010

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the 16 years since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act 
(VAWA), we have broken the silence surrounding domestic violence to 
reach thousands of survivors, prevent countless incidences of abuse, and 
save untold numbers of lives. While these are critical achievements, 
domestic violence remains a devastating public health crisis when one in 
four women will be physically or sexually assaulted by a partner at some 
point in her lifetime. During Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we 
recognize the tremendous progress made in reducing domestic violence, 
and we recommit to making everyone's home a safe place for them.
My Administration is committed to reducing the prevalence of domestic 
violence. Last year, I appointed the first-ever White House Advisor on 
Violence Against Women to collaborate with the many Federal agencies 
working together to end domestic violence in this country. Together with 
community efforts, these Federal programs are making important strides 
towards eliminating abuse.
The landmark Affordable Care Act also serves as a lifeline for domestic 
violence victims. Before I signed this legislation in March, insurance 
companies in eight States and the District of Columbia were able to 
classify domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, leaving victims 
at risk of not receiving vital treatment when they are most vulnerable. 
Now, victims need not fear the additional burden of increased medical 
bills as they attempt to protect themselves and rebuild their lives.
Individuals of every race, gender, and background face domestic 
violence, but some communities are disproportionately affected. In order 
to combat the prevalence of domestic violence and sexual assault in 
tribal areas, I signed the Tribal Law and Order Act to strengthen tribal 
law enforcement and its ability to prosecute and fight crime more 
effectively. This important legislation will also help survivors of 
domestic violence get the medical attention, services, support, and 
justice they need.
Children exposed to domestic violence, whether victims or witnesses, 
also need our help. Without intervention, they are at higher risk for 
failure in school, emotional disorders, substance abuse, and 
perpetrating violent behavior later in life. That is why my 
Administration has launched the ``Defending Childhood'' initiative at 
the Department of Justice to revitalize prevention, intervention, and 
response systems for children exposed to violence. The Department of 
Health and Human Services is also expanding services and enhancing 
community responses for children exposed to violence.
Ending domestic violence requires a collaborative effort involving every 
part of our society. Our law enforcement and justice system must work to 
hold offenders accountable and to protect victims and their children. 
Business, faith, and community leaders, as well as educators, health 
care providers, and human service professionals, also have a role to 
play in communicating that domestic violence is always unacceptable. As 
a Nation, we

[[Page 124]]

must endeavor to protect survivors, bring offenders to justice, and 
change attitudes that support such violence. I encourage victims, their 
loved ones, and concerned citizens to call the National Domestic 
Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE or visit: www.TheHotline.org.
This month--and throughout the year--let each of us resolve to be 
vigilant in recognizing and combating domestic violence in our 
communities, and let us build a culture of safety and support for all 
those affected.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2010 as 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to 
speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist 
victims of these crimes in finding the help and healing they need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8576 of October 1, 2010

National Energy Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's energy resources are inextricably linked to our continued 
prosperity, security, and environmental health. When it comes to our 
Nation's energy future, we face fundamental choices between action and 
inaction, between embracing the possibilities of a new clean energy 
economy and settling for the status quo, and between leading the world 
in clean energy and lagging behind. We must choose wisely and invest in 
clean energy technologies to position our country for a sustainable 
future, create new jobs, improve the health of our environment, and lay 
the foundation for our long-term economic security and prosperity.
The time to act is now. Every year our overdependence on fossil fuels 
sends billions of dollars overseas to buy foreign oil instead of 
supporting American workers and farmers, rewarding innovation, and 
developing clean energy industries here at home. Fossil fuel pollution 
has already begun to change our climate, posing a grave and growing 
danger to our economy, our national security, and our environment.
Over the last year and a half, we have taken unprecedented action to 
build a clean energy economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
made a $90 billion down-payment on a clean energy future for our 
country. This critical investment is expanding manufacturing capacity 
for clean energy technologies; advancing vehicle and fuel technologies; 
spurring the development of renewable fuels; and catalyzing progress 
towards a bigger, better, smarter electric grid; all while creating new 
jobs that cannot be shipped overseas. My Administration also set tough 
new fuel-economy standards and the first greenhouse gas emissions 
standards for cars and

[[Page 125]]

light trucks. Additionally, I signed an Executive Order that empowers 
the Federal Government to lead by example by cutting its energy use. As 
our Nation's single largest energy consumer, the Federal Government has 
an obligation to improve its energy efficiency, increase its use of 
renewable energy, cut greenhouse gas pollution, and leverage its 
purchasing power to advance a clean energy economy.
Across the country, citizens themselves are helping to lead the way. In 
small towns and city neighborhoods, on college campuses and in houses of 
worship, in office buildings and on the shop floor, Americans are 
standing up and building a clean energy economy together through 
community information, education, and action.
This progress must mark the start, not the end, of our efforts. Today, 
countries around the world are competing to create the clean energy 
economy and jobs of tomorrow, and the country that harnesses the power 
of clean energy will lead the global economy. As a Nation of scientists 
and engineers, farmers and entrepreneurs, we must continue to invest in 
clean, domestic sources of energy, harness the innovation of our 
brightest minds, promote our world-leading industries, and find lasting 
solutions to our energy challenges.
If we seize this moment, we stand to strengthen our economy, enhance our 
national security, and preserve our environment. During National Energy 
Awareness Month, let us commit to embarking on a new course to achieve 
our clean energy future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2010 as 
National Energy Awareness Month. I call upon the citizens of the United 
States to recognize this month by making clean energy choices that will 
help build a stronger Nation, a more robust economy, and a healthier 
environment for our children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8577 of October 1, 2010

Fire Prevention Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Fire Prevention Week, we reaffirm the importance of fire safety 
and awareness, and we pay tribute to our firefighters, volunteers, and 
first responders who put themselves in harm's way to protect our lives, 
homes, and communities every day.
Each of us can take precautions in our homes to safeguard our loved ones 
from the hazards of fire. Smoke alarms are vital detection devices, and

[[Page 126]]

properly installing and maintaining them in the home can help keep our 
families safe. Residential sprinkler systems can give individuals extra 
time to evacuate a home safely in case of an emergency as well. This 
year's theme, ``Smoke Alarms: A sound you can live with,'' encourages 
all Americans to test alarms at least once a month, and to check their 
batteries and locations.
Parents and caregivers should also take the time to discuss and practice 
emergency plans with children in the event of a fire. Additionally, 
around the home, it is important to ensure electronic appliances, 
machines, and heating units are plugged in and operated properly. With 
responsible use of fire indoors and outdoors--from safely disposing of 
matches and cigarettes to increased attention when cooking on grills or 
building a campfire--we can avoid untold numbers of emergencies, 
injuries, and lives lost to fire and its consequences.
Fire Prevention Week also calls our attention to the lifesaving work our 
firefighters perform in communities across America. These courageous 
professionals are the first ones on the scene during an emergency, 
fearlessly charging up smoke-filled staircases as people rush down them. 
Some have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Our Nation is 
profoundly grateful for the dedication and tireless efforts of our 
firefighters and first responders in their selfless service to our 
communities.
I encourage all Americans to take preventative measures during Fire 
Prevention Week to protect themselves, their families, and their 
communities from the hazards of fire and to express gratitude to our 
firefighters and first responders. Together, we can ensure the 
resilience and safety of our neighborhoods, and aid the brave men and 
women who risk their lives every day to protect us.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 3 through 
October 9, 2010, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 3, 2010, in 
accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be 
flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans 
to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and 
activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their 
tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8578 of October 4, 2010

Child Health Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The health and well-being of a child is one of our most challenging, yet 
important, responsibilities, and we have an obligation to ensure that 
all our children can live, learn, and play in safe and healthy 
environments. On Child Health Day, we reaffirm the critical importance 
of the quality health care, nutritious foods, clean air and water, and 
safe communities our kids need to grow into strong and active adults.
Parents and other caregivers set an example of healthy living and lay 
the foundation for our children's success. Whether providing nourishing 
meals, attending regular check-ups, or encouraging outside activity, 
they teach the habits and values for mental and physical well-being that 
last a lifetime. However, the charge to protect the health of our young 
people extends beyond the home to our classrooms, playgrounds, and 
hospitals around the country.
Today, our children face a new public health crisis we must address as a 
Nation, and we all have a role to play. In the last three decades, 
childhood obesity rates have tripled, and this epidemic threatens many 
young Americans, leaving them at risk for severe and chronic health 
problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. My 
Administration is committed to solving the childhood obesity epidemic 
within a generation, and earlier this year I created a Task Force on 
Childhood Obesity to examine interagency solutions and develop clear, 
concrete steps on how to address this national health crisis. Along with 
the Task Force, First Lady Michelle Obama's ``Let's Move!'' initiative 
empowers parents and caregivers to help their kids maintain a healthy 
weight and make healthy choices for their families. ``Let's Move!'' also 
encourages young people to choose wholesome foods, increase their 
physical activity, and develop life-long healthy habits. Child care 
providers and schools also have an important part in strengthening 
health and physical education programs and providing nutritious foods in 
cafeterias and vending areas.
In America, no parent should have to agonize over finding or affording 
health care for their child. To address this, the Affordable Care Act 
guarantees that children are eligible for health coverage regardless of 
any pre-existing condition. This landmark law extends the Children's 
Health Insurance Program, and requires basic dental and vision coverage 
for children under all health plans offered in the new health insurance 
exchanges beginning in 2014. It also expands our health care workforce, 
including increasing the number of primary care providers who treat 
children; forbids insurance companies from dropping coverage if a child 
or family member gets sick; and helps ensure access to free preventive 
services. As we mark these successes and the beginning of a new chapter 
in American health care this year, we also celebrate the 75th 
anniversary of the Social Security Act--including title V of this 
milestone legislation, which supports maternal and child health programs 
and services across the country.

[[Page 128]]

Parents also should not have to worry about whether the conditions in 
which their children grow and play are unsafe or unclean. Prenatal and 
early-life exposures to allergens and environmental contaminants may 
have detrimental lifelong effects. We must take action for our 
children's and grandchildren's sake, and we must work together to reduce 
risks from environmental exposure at home, school, and play areas. 
Through coordinated efforts like that of the President's Task Force on 
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, my 
Administration will continue to empower Federal interagency 
collaboration to help ensure healthy homes and communities exist for our 
children.
Children are our most precious resource. They are our joy in the 
present, and our hope for the future. As loved ones and educators, 
mentors and friends, we must do everything in our power to protect the 
health and well-being of our Nation's children and the promise of their 
futures.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 4, 
2010, as Child Health Day. I call upon families, child health 
professionals, faith-based and community organizations, and all levels 
of government to help ensure that America's children stay safe and 
healthy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8579 of October 6, 2010

National Physician Assistants Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In communities across our Nation, physician assistants serve tirelessly 
everyday to care for Americans and fulfill a critical function in our 
health care system. They provide important medical attention and 
treatment to patients and their loved ones, and can be the principal 
care provider in rural or inner-city clinics, and other settings with 
provider shortages. During National Physician Assistants Week, we honor 
these dedicated medical professionals and their essential role in 
providing diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive health care services 
to millions of American men, women, and children.
With compassion matched by professionalism, physician assistants work as 
part of a team to provide vital support to both patients in need and the 
doctors who balance the care of many individuals. Recognizing their 
essential function in our medical system, we allocated more than $30 
million from the Prevention and Public Health Fund under the Affordable 
Care Act to expand the Physician Assistant Training Program, and to 
increase the number of physician assistants in primary care over the 
next 5 years. Primary care is the foundation of preventive health care, 
and we must support

[[Page 129]]

the training of hundreds of new physician assistants who can join the 
medical field and increase access to providers and services in 
underserved areas. Our Nation needs a strong primary care workforce and 
the continued dedication of physician assistants in our hospitals, 
clinics, and medical offices to address the crucial health issues of our 
time.
Countless American families have relied on the skill, concern, and 
commitment of physician assistants, in both joyous times and heart-
wrenching circumstances. As we recognize their countless contributions 
this week, we also pay tribute to the kind and meticulous care provided 
by all of America's medical professionals. Our Nation is stronger 
because of these invaluable workers, and their efforts safeguard a 
healthy future for all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6 through 
October 12, 2010, as National Physician Assistants Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, 
and programs that honor and foster appreciation for our physician 
assistants and all medical professionals.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8580 of October 6, 2010

German-American Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American story has been written by those who have come to our shores 
in search of freedom, opportunity, and the chance at a better life. The 
German men and women who braved numerous perils to cross the Atlantic 
long ago left a legacy of millions of Americans of German ancestry who 
have been an integral part of our national life. On German-American Day, 
we pay tribute to the role this community has played in shaping America 
and contributing to our progress and prosperity.
On October 6, 1683, 13 courageous German families arrived in 
Pennsylvania to start a new life. They began a chapter in the American 
narrative that has influenced our country in all walks of life, and 
their resolve lives on in the men, women, and families of German descent 
who enhance civic engagement, steer our industries, and fortify our 
Nation's character. With their dedication and determination, the United 
States has been a leader in ingenuity and entrepreneurship, and has 
delivered a message of hope and opportunity that resonates around the 
world. Today, German Americans innovate and excel as leaders in all 
sectors of our society.
On this occasion, we honor not only the countless achievements and rich 
heritage of German Americans, but also the strong ties between Germany 
and the United States. Our two nations share unbreakable bonds as allies

[[Page 130]]

with solemn obligations to one another's security; values that inspired 
those brave settlers four centuries ago; and a vision for a safer, 
freer, more peaceful, more prosperous world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2010, as 
German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the 
history of German Americans and reflect on the many contributions they 
have made to our Nation.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8581 of October 8, 2010

Leif Erikson Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Over 1,000 years ago, the lure of discovery led Leif Erikson--a son of 
Iceland and grandson of Norway--and his crew on an ambitious exploration 
of present-day Greenland and Canada. Centuries later, after a months-
long ocean voyage, a group of Norwegians landed in New York City on 
October 9, 1825, the first large group of immigrants to arrive in the 
United States from Norway. To commemorate that event and pay tribute to 
our rich Nordic-American heritage, we celebrate Leif Erikson Day in 
honor of the first European known to set foot on North American soil 
more than a millennium ago.
Countless immigrants who crossed the Atlantic on voyages to the New 
World looked to Leif Erikson as a symbol of fortitude and a hero who did 
not turn back in the face of danger and uncertainty. Leif Erikson's bold 
courage echoes in the daring and intrepid spirit of the pioneers who 
built and shaped our young country, and in the determination, self-
reliance, and innovation of the Nordic settlers who made enduring 
contributions to the American character. Today, Nordic Americans 
immeasurably enrich our national life as neighbors and leaders in 
communities across America.
Guided by the strength and resolve of Leif Erikson and the countless 
Nordic immigrants who came in his wake, let us steadfastly reach for the 
promise of tomorrow. It is their spirit of exploration and progress that 
helped forge our great country, and that will continue to guide us as we 
strive for a better and brighter future.
To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the 
Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 
2, 1964, has authorized the President to proclaim October 9 of each year 
as ``Leif Erikson Day.''

[[Page 131]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2010, as Leif Erikson Day. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8582 of October 8, 2010

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From before our Nation's founding until today, daring individuals have 
fought to defend America with unwavering devotion. Casimir Pulaski was a 
Polish patriot, yet he laid down his life in defense of American 
independence during the Revolutionary War. Each year, on October 11, 
Americans pause to remember this champion of liberty who fought 
valiantly for the freedom of Poland and the United States, and we 
proudly reflect upon our rich Polish-American heritage.
As a young man, Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski witnessed the 
occupation of Poland by foreign troops and fought for his homeland's 
freedom, determined to resist subjugation. During his subsequent exile 
to France, he learned of our nascent struggle for independence, and 
volunteered his service to our cause. Pulaski arrived in America in 1777 
and served in the American Cavalry under the command of General George 
Washington. Valued for his vast military experience, General Pulaski led 
colonists on horseback with admirable skill, earning a reputation as the 
``father of American Cavalry.'' Pulaski was mortally wounded during the 
siege of Savannah, and he died from his wounds on October 11, 1779.
General Pulaski's legacy survives in a long line of proud Polish 
Americans, who have arrived on our shores seeking freedom and 
opportunity and have served in our Armed Forces to defend our Nation. 
Polish Americans have carried with them values and traditions that have 
shaped our society, and their immeasurable contributions have 
strengthened our country. This proud community has been integral to our 
success as a Nation, and will play a prominent leadership role in the 
years ahead.
General Pulaski wrote to our first President, ``I came here, where 
freedom is being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.'' We 
have never forgotten his sacrifice for our independence or his 
patriotism in defending freedom across two continents. Today, the people 
of the United States and Poland are bound by our solemn obligations to 
each other's security and our shared values, including a deep and 
abiding commitment to liberty, democracy, and human rights. On General 
Pulaski Memorial Day, we celebrate the early beginnings of our strong 
friendship, our lasting ties to the

[[Page 132]]

people of Poland, and our enduring commitment to a safer, freer, and 
more prosperous world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 11, 
2010, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to 
commemorate this occasion with appropriate programs and activities 
paying tribute to Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who defend the 
freedom of our great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8583 of October 8, 2010

National School Lunch Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

No child should have to learn on an empty stomach. Nearly 65 years ago, 
America made protecting the health of our children a national priority 
by developing the National School Lunch Program. This groundbreaking 
program has prevented hunger and promoted education by enabling our 
young people to have access to safe, balanced, and affordable meals at 
school. It has also supported their development, encouraged their 
learning capacity, and instilled life-long healthy habits. This year, 
during National School Lunch Week, we recognize the vital importance of 
this historic program, and we recommit to serving meals that will 
contribute to the health and well-being of a new generation.
With more than 31 million children participating in the National School 
Lunch Program and more than 11 million in the School Breakfast Program, 
good nutrition at school is more vital than ever. When one in three 
children in this country is overweight or obese, we all have a 
responsibility to make sure our kids receive good nutrition at school 
and learn to make healthy choices early in life. This is an essential 
part of First Lady Michelle Obama's ``Let's Move!'' initiative, which is 
a nationwide campaign dedicated to ending the epidemic of childhood 
obesity within a generation so that children can reach adulthood at a 
healthy weight.
To foster school environments that encourage physical activity and 
nourishing diets, ``Let's Move!'' is partnering with the United States 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to increase the number of schools that 
participate in the HealthierUS School Challenge. The Challenge 
establishes rigorous standards for nutritional quality in school food, 
participation in meal programs, physical activity, and nutrition 
education--all key components that make for healthy, active children.
Chefs across America are also helping create nutritious and appealing 
school meals. Over 1,900 have volunteered to offer their unique talents 
and

[[Page 133]]

knowledge of food and nutrition to ``Chefs Move to Schools,'' an 
initiative that pairs chefs with interested schools in their 
communities. Together, chefs and school administrators are creating 
wholesome meals while teaching young people about nutrition and making 
balanced, healthy choices. I invite all Americans to visit LetsMove.gov 
to learn more about this initiative and other strategies to raise a 
healthier generation of kids.
To provide more fruits, vegetables, and other fresh and nutritious foods 
for school meals, the USDA is also working to develop farm-to-school 
partnerships with local farmers, States, localities, tribal authorities, 
school districts, and community organizations. The USDA Farm to School 
Team is helping to provide quality foods in school menus, to increase 
markets for local farms, and to teach young people of all ages about the 
source of the food they enjoy. To enable school cafeterias across our 
Nation to prepare these healthy foods, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act funded the purchase of new food service equipment such 
as salad bars, and the replacement of aging or outdated appliances such 
as deep fryers.
This week provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the critical 
role the National School Lunch Program plays in promoting the health and 
well-being of tomorrow's leaders. We also recognize the talent and 
dedication of all the food service professionals, educators, program 
administrators, and parents whose time and energy help ensure America's 
students have the healthy food necessary to grow and succeed.
The Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-
780), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday 
in October each year as ``National School Lunch Week,'' and has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 10 through October 16, 
2010, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join 
the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being 
of our Nation's children.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8584 of October 8, 2010

Columbus Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Over five centuries ago, Christopher Columbus set sail across the 
Atlantic Ocean in search of a new trade route to India. The findings of 
this explorer from Genoa, Italy, would change the map of the world and 
forever alter the course of human history.

[[Page 134]]

When Columbus's crewmembers came ashore in the Americas, they arrived in 
a world previously unknown to his contemporaries in Europe. Columbus 
returned to the Caribbean three more times after his maiden voyage in 
1492, convinced of the vast potential of what he had seen. His 
expeditions foreshadowed the journey across the seas for millions of 
courageous immigrants who followed. As they settled, they joined 
indigenous communities with thriving cultures. Today, we reflect on the 
myriad contributions tribal communities have made to our Nation and the 
world, and we remember the tremendous suffering they endured as this 
land changed.
For more than 500 years, women and men from every corner of the globe 
have embarked on journeys to our shores as did Columbus. Some have 
sought refuge from religious or political oppression, and others have 
departed nations ravaged by war, famine, or economic despair. Columbus 
charted a course for generations of Italians who followed his crossing 
to America. As Italy marks the 150th anniversary of its unification this 
year, we celebrate the incalculable contributions of Italian Americans, 
whose determination, hard work, and leadership have done so much to 
build the strength of our Nation.
What Columbus encountered over half a millennia ago was more than earth 
or continent. His epic quest into the unknown may not have revealed the 
new trade route he sought, but it exposed the boundless potential of a 
new frontier. It is this intrepid character and spirit of possibility 
that has come to define America, and is the reason countless families 
still journey to our shores.
In commemoration of Christopher Columbus' historic voyage 518 years ago, 
the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 
1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim 
the second Monday of October of each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2010, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the Flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8585 of October 14, 2010

Italian American Heritage and Culture Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the five centuries since Christopher Columbus, a son of Genoa, Italy, 
first set sail across the Atlantic Ocean, countless individuals have 
followed

[[Page 135]]

the course he charted to seek a new life in America. Since that time, 
generations of Italian Americans have helped shape our society and steer 
the course of our history. During Italian American Heritage and Culture 
Month, we recognize the rich heritage of Americans of Italian descent 
and celebrate their immeasurable contributions to our Nation.
Bound by enduring values of faith and family, Italian Americans have 
flourished in all areas of our public and economic life while preserving 
their proud Italian traditions. Upon arrival in the United States, the 
Italian American community faced racial, social, and religious 
discrimination. Yet, Italian Americans have persevered with hope and 
hard work to reach for the American dream and helped build our great 
country. As proud service members, they have also defended the liberty 
and integrity of the United States since the Revolutionary War.
Today, the legacy of these intrepid immigrants is found in the millions 
of American men, women, and children of Italian descent who strengthen 
and enrich our country. Italian Americans operate thriving businesses, 
teach our children, serve at all levels of government, and succeed in 
myriad occupations. Drawing on the courage and principles of their 
forebears, they lead in every facet of American life, dedicating their 
knowledge and skills to the growth of our country.
The Great Seal of the United States declares ``out of many, one.'' As we 
forge new futures as a unified people, we must celebrate the unique and 
vibrant cultures that have written the American story. Many determined 
individuals have sought our shores as a beacon of hope and opportunity, 
and their spirit of limitless possibility and example of resolve 
continues to inspire and guide our Nation. As we honor the long history 
and vast contributions of Italian Americans, let us recommit to 
extending the promise of America that they embraced to future 
generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2010 as 
Italian American Heritage and Culture Month. I call upon all Americans 
to learn more about the history of Italian Americans, and to observe 
this month with appropriate programs and activities.

National Character Counts Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's strength, even in the most challenging of times, is found in 
the spirit and character of our people. During National Character Counts 
Week, we reflect upon the values of equality, fairness, and compassion 
that lie at

[[Page 136]]

the heart of our country. These qualities resonate in the countless 
humanitarian acts and deep social consciousness of our citizens. From 
lending a hand to those in need to caring for the sick, selfless service 
is a fundamental American ideal, and one we must instill in our children 
and grandchildren.
The strength and character of our country have always come from our 
ability to recognize ourselves in one another. Concern for the well-
being of our fellow Americans has shaped our Nation's development and 
will continue to cast our future. As parents and educators, community 
leaders and mentors, we share the responsibility for instilling in our 
children this fundamental principle. By demonstrating shared values such 
as respect, curiosity, integrity, courage, honesty, and patriotism, we 
help our youth develop the strength of character that is the mark of our 
great Nation. In turn, our young people will serve as models of mutual 
regard and civility, and share in the responsibility to maintain our 
schools and neighborhoods as safe, supportive, and inclusive 
environments.
Across America, countless individuals reflect our highest ideals by 
offering their time and energy to help make our communities safer, more 
nurturing places to live. Their service results from a decision to 
become engaged, and it often becomes a lifelong commitment. During 
National Character Counts Week, let us take this opportunity to 
celebrate the generosity of America's character, and to fortify and 
inspire it in our next generation of leaders.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 17 through 
October 23, 2010, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon all 
public officials, educators, parents, students, and Americans to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the

National Forest Products Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since the first communities and settlements in our Nation, forests and 
their products have played a vital role in our growth and economic 
development. Forests have also enhanced the splendor of our 
surroundings, served as wildlife habitats, provided places for 
recreational activities, and offered serene settings for contemplation. 
As we mark the 50th anniversary of National Forest Products Week, we 
recognize the enduring value of forests as sustainable, renewable, and 
bountiful resources, and we recommit to our stewardship and efforts to 
further their conservation.

[[Page 137]]

Our Nation's forests provide us with clean water and air, wood, 
wildlife, recreation, and beauty. Forest products can be seen in myriad 
places in our daily lives, from the houses we live in to the paper we 
write on. National Forest Products Week draws attention to these 
invaluable resources, and to the importance of ensuring our forests 
remain flourishing ecosystems that will provide indispensable benefits 
for current and future generations. Every forested acre represents an 
opportunity to reduce the effects of climate change; to protect habitats 
and communities; to explore nature; to provide clean air and water; and 
to produce raw materials like timber, fiber, and biomass.
Earlier this year, I launched the America's Great Outdoors Initiative to 
develop a 21st-century conservation agenda that will reconnect Americans 
with the outdoors and protect our Nation's vast and varied natural 
heritage. Senior officials from my Administration have been traveling 
across America to learn about innovative ways that private landowners; 
State, local, and tribal governments; conservationists; and other 
concerned citizens are coming together to preserve our natural 
resources. They have also heard about the many benefits our forests and 
their products provide the Nation.
In this time of economic recovery, we must not forget the jobs created 
and supported by forest management and restoration, as well as the 
significant contributions made by the Americans who work in these 
sectors. They not only help bring forest products to market, but also 
spur innovative ways to move our country forward. Forests provide 
renewable and recyclable commodities, and scientific exploration can 
find new frontiers of growth in their application. Through new 
technologies, we have made progress in nanotechnology, enhanced biofuels 
and biochemicals; expanded our knowledge of medicinal plants; and 
examined more sustainable green building practices. Through careful 
conservation of our forests, we can ensure future generations will be 
able to both enjoy these national treasures and expand upon the many 
uses we have for their products today.
To recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, 
by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the 
week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as National 
Forest Products Week, and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 17 through October 23, 2010, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call on all Americans to celebrate the 
varied uses and products of our forested lands, as well as the people 
who carry on the tradition of careful stewardship of these precious 
natural resources for generations to come.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8588 of October 15, 2010

White Cane Safety Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The white cane, in addition to being a practical mobility tool, serves 
as a symbol of dignity, freedom, and independence for individuals who 
are blind or visually impaired. On White Cane Safety Day, our Nation 
celebrates the immeasurable contributions the Americans who use canes 
have made as valued members of our diverse country. We also examine our 
progress and recommit to full integration, equality, education, and 
opportunity for Americans with visual impairments.
Today, students with disabilities are reaching achievements considered 
unattainable just a few decades ago. Many gains have been realized 
throughout our educational system, but we must accomplish more so that 
America's technological advances and assistive tools are available for 
the benefit of all students. My Administration is committed to ensuring 
that electronic readers and other electronic equipment used by schools, 
including postsecondary institutions, are accessible to individuals who 
are blind or visually impaired. We are also providing guidance and 
technical assistance to help colleges and universities fully comply with 
the legal requirements to use emerging technology that is accessible to 
all students in the classroom. Blindness and visual impairments are not 
impediments to obtaining knowledge, and we must highlight the 
availability of existing tools to facilitate communication and work to 
improve access to them. Additionally, the Braille code opens doors of 
literacy and learning to countless individuals with visual impairments 
across our country and around the world, and we must work with advocates 
and leaders throughout our society to promote and improve Braille 
literacy among our students.
Americans with disabilities are Americans first and foremost, entitled 
to both full participation in our society and full opportunity in our 
economy. My Administration is working to increase information access so 
Americans who are blind or visually impaired can fully participate in 
our increasingly interconnected world. To expand career options for 
people with disabilities in the Federal Government, I signed an 
Executive Order directing executive departments and agencies to design 
strategies to increase recruitment and hiring of these valued public 
servants. I was also pleased to sign the Twenty-First Century 
Communications and Video Accessibility Act into law earlier this month 
to ensure that the jobs of the future are accessible to all. This 
legislation will make it easier for people who are deaf, blind, or live 
with a visual impairment to use the technology our 21st-century economy 
depends on, from navigating digital menus on a television to sending 
emails on a smart phone.
As we observe the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act this year, my Administration reaffirms our national commitment to 
creating access to employment, education, and social, political, and 
economic opportunities for Americans with disabilities. Together with 
individuals who are blind or visually impaired, service providers, 
educators, and employers, we will uphold our country as an inclusive, 
welcoming place for blind or visually impaired people to work, learn, 
play, and live.

[[Page 139]]

By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as 
amended), the Congress designated October 15 of each year as White Cane 
Safety Day to recognize the contributions of Americans who are blind or 
have low vision.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2010, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon all public officials, business and community leaders, 
educators, librarians, and Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8589 of October 22, 2010

United Nations Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty-five years ago, 51 nations came together in the aftermath of one 
of history's most devastating wars to rededicate themselves to peace, 
justice, and progress. The founders of the United Nations vowed to work 
together to ensure that the horrors seen in World War II would never be 
repeated. On United Nations Day, we join our friends around the world in 
reflecting on our shared interests and renewing our commitment to 
international law, common security, accountability, and prosperity for 
all peoples.
The United Nations has made great advances since it first developed out 
of ruin and genocide, and, today, this partnership includes 192 member 
states. Throughout its journey to live up to its founding values, it has 
remained an indispensable vehicle for coordinated action to tackle 
global problems. In a time when we face challenges such as nuclear 
proliferation, climate change, transnational terrorism, food security 
risks, and pandemic disease, we must work as one to build the kind of 
world we want to see in the 21st century.
This vital international body provides a forum and framework for leaders 
to come together to advance our shared ideals. Through its broad range 
of peace operations, it helps limit and resolve conflicts that could 
otherwise threaten the security of individuals and the stability of 
nations. The United Nations' humanitarian assistance lifts up countless 
lives, supporting nations in meeting the most immediate human needs and 
in building their own capabilities. Its history of rushing assistance to 
disaster victims was reflected this year in its response to the 
devastating earthquake in Haiti, which also claimed the lives of many 
United Nations officers. And, through its health, education, and 
development programs, the United Nations is helping empower the next 
generation of world leaders. Although difficulties remain, the dialogue 
fostered and actions taken by the United Nations will continue to 
strengthen the foundations of freedom across the globe.

[[Page 140]]

Though the future we envision for all the world's children may not come 
easily, the founding of the United Nations itself is a testament to 
human progress. Let us continue to be guided by its founders' soaring 
example, and move through the conflicts and divisions of our time to a 
day when people from every part of this world can live together in 
peace.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2010, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, and the 
officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to 
observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8590 of October 29, 2010

Military Family Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We owe each day of security and freedom that we enjoy to the members of 
our Armed Forces and their families. Behind our brave service men and 
women, there are family members and loved ones who share in their 
sacrifice and provide unending support. During Military Family Month, we 
celebrate the exceptional contributions of our military families, and we 
reaffirm our commitments to these selfless individuals who exemplify the 
highest principles of our Nation.
Across America, military families inspire us all with their courage, 
strength, and deep devotion to our country. They endure the challenges 
of multiple deployments and moves; spend holidays and life milestones 
apart; juggle everyday tasks while a spouse, parent, son, or daughter is 
in harm's way; and honor the service of their loved ones and the memory 
of those lost.
Just as we hold a sacred trust to the extraordinary Americans willing to 
lay down their lives to protect us all, we also have a national 
commitment to support and engage our military families. They are proud 
to serve our country; yet, they face unique challenges because of that 
service. My Administration has taken important steps to help them 
shoulder their sacrifice, and we are working to ensure they have the 
resources to care for themselves and the tools to reach their dreams. We 
are working to improve family resilience, enhance the educational 
experience of military children, and ensure military spouses have 
employment and advancement opportunities, despite the relocations and 
deployment cycles of military life. Our historic investment to build a 
21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs is helping to provide our 
veterans with the benefits and care they have earned. We are also 
standing with our service members and their families

[[Page 141]]

as they transition back into civilian life, providing counseling as well 
as job training and placement. And, through the Post-9/11 GI Bill, our 
veterans and their families can pursue the dream of higher education.
However, Government can only do so much. While only a fraction of 
Americans are in military families, all of us share in the 
responsibility of caring for our military families and veterans, and all 
sectors of our society are better off when we reach out and work 
together to support these patriots. By offering job opportunities and 
workplace flexibility, businesses and companies can benefit from the 
unparalleled dedication and skills of a service member or military 
spouse. Through coordination with local community groups, individuals 
and organizations can ensure our military families have the help they 
need and deserve when a loved one is deployed. Even the smallest actions 
by neighbors and friends send a large message of profound gratitude to 
the families who risk everything to see us safe and free.
As America asks ever more of military families, they have a right to 
expect more of us--it is our national challenge and moral obligation to 
uphold that promise. If we hold ourselves to the same high standard of 
excellence our military families live by every day, we will realize the 
vision of an America that supports and engages these heroes now and for 
decades to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2010 as 
Military Family Month. I call on all Americans to honor military 
families through private actions and public service for the tremendous 
contributions they make in support of our service members and our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8591 of October 29, 2010

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Alzheimer's disease tragically robs individuals of their memories and 
leads to progressive mental and physical impairments. This eventually 
fatal disease represents a serious and growing threat to the health of 
our Nation, impacting millions of Americans and their families. During 
National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we recommit to improving 
its detection and treatment, finding a cure, and standing with all whose 
lives are affected by this terrible disease.

[[Page 142]]

As we continue our fight against Alzheimer's disease, we must seek new 
ways to prevent, delay, and treat this disease. Through the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we are boosting funding for promising 
research on risk factors, on improving diagnostic tools and therapies, 
and in identifying new preventive measures.
This year's landmark Affordable Care Act also makes important progress 
for those living with Alzheimer's disease, as well as their loved ones 
and caretakers. This legislation establishes the Cures Acceleration 
Network, which will advance cutting-edge research, aid in the 
development of highly needed cures, and reduce barriers between 
laboratory discoveries and clinical trials for debilitating and life-
threatening conditions like Alzheimer's disease. The Affordable Care Act 
seeks to improve care by training nursing home workers who care for 
residents with dementia and establishes the Community Living Assistance 
Services and Supports (CLASS) Program, a new national long-term care 
insurance option. This legislation also provides Medicare beneficiaries 
with free annual wellness visits to increase the likelihood of early 
cognitive impairment detection, allowing patients and families to better 
plan for care needs. And by 2014, Americans living with Alzheimer's 
disease and other pre-existing conditions will not have to worry about 
having their insurance coverage discontinued or denied.
The human cost of Alzheimer's disease is staggering. We can--and must--
come together to address this growing health challenge. Caring for a 
person with Alzheimer's disease is a full-time, non-stop job, and this 
month, we also honor the compassionate caregivers and medical 
professionals who provide endless comfort and attention to those facing 
Alzheimer's disease. Until we find more effective treatments and a cure, 
we must continue to support both Alzheimer's disease research and the 
caregivers and victims of this devastating disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2010 as 
National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to learn more about Alzheimer's disease and what they 
can do to support their families, friends, and neighbors who care for 
those with the disease.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8592 of October 29, 2010

National Diabetes Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Today, nearly 24 million Americans have diabetes, and thousands more 
are diagnosed each day. During National Diabetes Month, we recommit to 
educating Americans about the risk factors and warning signs of 
diabetes, and we honor all those living with or lost to this disease.
Diabetes can lead to severe health problems and complications such as 
heart disease, stroke, vision loss, kidney disease, nerve damage, and 
amputation. Type 1 diabetes, which can occur at any age but is most 
often diagnosed in young people, is managed by a lifetime of regular 
medication or insulin treatment. Type 2 diabetes is far more common, and 
the number of people developing or at elevated risk for the disease is 
growing at an alarming rate, including among our Nation's children. Risk 
is highest among individuals over the age of 45, particularly those who 
are overweight, inactive, or have a family history of the disease, as 
well as among certain racial and minority groups. While less prevalent, 
gestational diabetes in expectant mothers may lead to a more complicated 
or dangerous delivery, and can contribute to their child's obesity later 
in life. With more Americans becoming affected by diabetes and its 
consequences every day, our Nation must work together to better prevent, 
manage, and treat this disease in all its variations.
 Obesity is one of the most significant risk factors for Type 2 
diabetes. National Diabetes Month gives Americans an opportunity to 
redouble their efforts to reduce their chances of developing Type 2 
diabetes by engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy 
weight, and making nutritious food choices. For people already living 
with diabetes, these lifestyle changes can help with the management of 
this disease, and delay or prevent complications.
We must also do more to reverse the climbing rates of childhood obesity 
so all America's children can grow into healthy, happy, and active 
adults. Through her ``Let's Move!'' initiative, First Lady Michelle 
Obama is helping to lead an Administration-wide effort to solve the 
epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. ``Let's Move!'' 
promotes nutritious foods and physical activities that lead to life-long 
healthy habits. I encourage all parents, educators, and concerned 
Americans to visit www.LetsMove.gov for more information and resources 
on making healthy choices for our children.
The new health insurance reform law, the Affordable Care Act, adds a 
number of tools for reversing the increase in diabetes and caring for 
those facing this disease. Insurance companies are no longer able to 
deny health coverage or exclude benefits for children due to a pre-
existing condition, including diabetes. This vital protection will apply 
to all Americans by 2014. Also, all new health plans and Medicare must 
now provide diabetes screenings free of charge to patients, and Medicare 
covers the full cost of medical nutritional therapy to help seniors 
manage diabetes. This landmark

[[Page 144]]

new law also requires most chain restaurants to clearly post nutritional 
information on their menus, ensuring that Americans have consistent 
facts about food choices and can make more informed, healthier 
selections.
In recognition of National Diabetes Month, I commend those bravely 
fighting this disease; the families and friends who support them; and 
the health care providers, researchers, and advocates working to reduce 
this disease's impact on our Nation. Together, we can take the small 
steps that lead to big rewards--a healthier future for our citizens and 
our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2010 as 
National Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans, school systems, 
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, and 
research institutions to join in activities that raise diabetes 
awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the disease.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8593 of October 29, 2010

National Family Caregivers Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, family members, friends, neighbors, and concerned individuals 
across America provide essential attention and assistance to their loved 
ones. Many individuals in need of care--including children, elders, and 
persons with disabilities--would have difficulty remaining safely in 
their homes and community without the support of their relatives and 
caregivers.
Caregivers often look after multiple generations of family members. 
Their efforts are vital to the quality of life of countless American 
seniors, bringing comfort and friendship to these treasured citizens. 
However, this labor of love can result in physical, psychological, and 
financial hardship for caregivers, and research suggests they often put 
their own health and well-being at risk while assisting loved ones. 
Through the National Family Caregiver Support Program, individuals can 
help their loved ones remain comfortably in the home and receive 
assistance with their caregiving responsibilities. This program provides 
information, assistance, counseling, training, support groups, and 
respite care for caregivers across our country.
My Administration's Middle Class Task Force, led by Vice President Joe 
Biden, has made supporting family caregivers a priority, and we are 
working to assist caregivers as they juggle work, filial, and financial 
responsibilities. We made important progress with this year's Affordable 
Care Act, and because of this landmark legislation, Americans will be 
able to take advantage of the Community Living Assistance Services and 
Supports (CLASS)

[[Page 145]]

Program. This voluntary insurance program will help individuals with 
long-term care needs to maintain independent living, as well as 
compensate family caregivers for their devoted work.
Our businesses and companies can also contribute to families' ability to 
care for their loved ones in need. By offering flexible work 
arrangements and paid leave when caregiving duties require employees to 
miss work, employers can enable workers with caregiver responsibilities 
to balance work and family obligations more easily. Such efforts impact 
countless lives across our Nation, easing concerns and contributing to 
the well-being of individuals and families as they go about their daily 
lives.
During National Family Caregivers Month, we honor the millions of 
Americans who give endlessly of themselves to provide for the health and 
well-being of a beloved family member. Through their countless hours of 
service to their families and communities, they are a shining example of 
our Nation's great capacity to care for each other.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2010 as 
National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to pay 
tribute to those who provide care for their family members, friends, and 
neighbors in need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8594 of October 29, 2010

National Hospice Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Hospice Month, we recognize the dignity hospice care can 
provide to patients who need it most, and the professionals, volunteers, 
and family members who bring peace to individuals in their final days.
Hospice care gives medical services, emotional support, and spiritual 
resources to people facing life-limiting illnesses. It can also help 
families and caregivers manage the details and emotional challenges of 
caring for a dying loved one. The decision to place someone into a 
hospice program can be difficult, but Americans can have peace of mind 
knowing the doctors and professionals involved with these services are 
trained to administer high-quality and comprehensive care for terminally 
ill individuals. As many of our Nation's veterans age and cope with 
illness, hospice and palliative care can also provide tailored support 
to meet the needs of these heroes.
The Affordable Care Act signed into law this year protects and expands 
hospice services covered under Federal health care programs. Prior to 
its

[[Page 146]]

enactment, the prohibition on concurrent care for Federal health care 
programs meant patients could not receive hospice care before first 
discontinuing treatments to cure their disease. The Affordable Care Act 
permanently eliminates this prohibition for children enrolled in 
Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and creates 
demonstration projects to test how the elimination of the concurrent 
care prohibition would impact Medicare. As a result, fewer children, 
seniors, and families will have to make the heart-rending choice between 
coverage that fights an illness and coverage that provides needed 
comfort.
All Americans should take comfort in the important work of hospice care, 
which enables individuals to carry on their lives, in spite of a 
terminal illness. During this month, let us recognize those who allow 
the terminally ill to receive comfortable and dignified care.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2010 as 
National Hospice Month. I encourage citizens, medical institutions, 
government and social service agencies, businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
promote awareness of the important role of hospice care.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8595 of October 29, 2010

National Native American Heritage Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For millennia before Europeans settled in North America, the indigenous 
peoples of this continent flourished with vibrant cultures and were the 
original stewards of the land. From generation to generation, they 
handed down invaluable cultural knowledge and rich traditions, which 
continue to thrive in Native American communities across our country 
today. During National Native American Heritage Month, we honor and 
celebrate their importance to our great Nation and our world.
America's journey has been marked both by bright times of progress and 
dark moments of injustice for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Since 
the birth of America, they have contributed immeasurably to our country 
and our heritage, distinguishing themselves as scholars, artists, 
entrepreneurs, and leaders in all aspects of our society. Native 
Americans have also served in the United States Armed Forces with honor 
and distinction,

[[Page 147]]

defending the security of our Nation with their lives. Yet, our tribal 
communities face stark realities, including disproportionately high 
rates of poverty, unemployment, crime, and disease. These disparities 
are unacceptable, and we must acknowledge both our history and our 
current challenges if we are to ensure that all of our children have an 
equal opportunity to pursue the American dream. From upholding the 
tribal sovereignty recognized and reaffirmed in our Constitution and 
laws to strengthening our unique nation-to-nation relationship, my 
Administration stands firm in fulfilling our Nation's commitments.
Over the past 2 years, we have made important steps towards working as 
partners with Native Americans to build sustainable and healthy native 
communities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act continues to 
impact the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives, including 
through important projects to improve, rebuild, and renovate schools so 
our children can get the education and skills they will need to compete 
in the global economy. At last year's White House Tribal Nations 
Conference, I also announced a new consultation process to improve 
communication and coordination between the Federal Government and tribal 
governments.
This year, I was proud to sign the landmark Affordable Care Act, which 
permanently reauthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, a 
cornerstone of health care for American Indians and Alaska Natives. This 
vital legislation will help modernize the Indian health care system and 
improve health care for 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
To combat the high rates of crime and sexual violence in Native 
communities, I signed the Tribal Law and Order Act in July to bolster 
tribal law enforcement and enhance their abilities to prosecute and 
fight crime more effectively. And, recently, my Administration reached a 
settlement in a lawsuit brought by Native American farmers against the 
United States Department of Agriculture that underscores our commitment 
to treat all our citizens fairly.
As we celebrate the contributions and heritage of Native Americans 
during this month, we also recommit to supporting tribal self-
determination, security, and prosperity for all Native Americans. While 
we cannot erase the scourges or broken promises of our past, we will 
move ahead together in writing a new, brighter chapter in our joint 
history.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2010 as 
National Native American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to 
commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities, and to 
celebrate November 26, 2010, as Native American Heritage Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8596 of November 1, 2010

To Adjust the Rules of Origin Under the United States-Bahrain Free Trade 
Agreement, Implement Modifications to the Caribbean Basin Economic 
Recovery Act, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. In Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, pursuant to 
the authority provided in section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) (the ``1988 Act''), the 
President modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTS) to reflect amendments to the International Convention on the 
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the ``Convention'').
2. Presidential Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006, implemented the 
United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA) with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to section 101(a) of the United States-
Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USBFTA 
Implementation Act'') (Public Law 109-169, 119 Stat. 3581) (19 U.S.C. 
3805 note), incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and 
rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USBFTA.
3. In order to ensure the continuation of the staged reductions in rates 
of duty for originating goods from Bahrain in categories that were 
modified to conform to the Convention, the President proclaimed in 
Presidential Proclamation 8097 modifications to the HTS that he 
determined were necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty 
reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8039.
4. Bahrain is a party to the Convention. Because the substance of 
changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing form in 
the national tariff schedules of the parties to the USBFTA, the rules of 
origin set out in Annexes 3-A and 4-A of that Agreement must be changed 
to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the 
USBFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the 
tariff categories that were modified in Proclamation 8097. The USBFTA 
parties have agreed to make these changes in a protocol to the USBFTA, 
which will go into effect on November 1, 2010.
5. Section 202 of the USBFTA Implementation Act provides certain rules 
for determining whether a good is an originating good for purposes of 
implementing tariff treatment under the USBFTA. Section 202(j)(1)(A) of 
the USBFTA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim the 
rules of origin set out in the USBFTA and any subordinate categories 
necessary to carry out the USBFTA, subject to certain exceptions set out 
in section 202(j)(2)(A).
6. I have determined that modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant 
to section 202 of the USBFTA Implementation Act and section 1206(a) of

[[Page 149]]

the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of 
tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under 
tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and to carry out the 
duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8039.
7. Section 213A of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 
2703a) (CBERA), as amended by the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act of 
2010 (Public Law 111-171, 124 Stat. 1194) (19 U.S.C. 2701 note) (the 
``HELP Act''), provides that preferential tariff treatment may be 
provided for apparel and other articles originating in Haiti that are 
imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic into the customs 
territory of the United States.
8. In order to implement the tariff treatment provided for under the 
CBERA, as amended, it is necessary to modify the HTS.
9. Proclamation 7987 of February 28, 2006, implemented the Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). 
There was a technical error in the form of an inadvertent omission from 
Annex I of Publication 3829 of the United States International Trade 
Commission (USITC) entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States to Implement the Dominican Republic-
Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement With Respect to El 
Salvador,'' which was incorporated by reference into Proclamation 7987.
10. I have determined that a technical correction to general note 29 to 
the HTS is necessary to provide the tariff and certain other treatment 
accorded under the CAFTA-DR to originating goods.
11. In Proclamation 8097 two technical errors were made in U.S. note 2 
to subchapter XVII of chapter 98 of the HTS as set forth in Annex I of 
Publication 3898 of the USITC entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States Under Section 1206 of the Omnibus 
Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988,'' which was incorporated by 
reference into Proclamation 8097.
12. I have determined that technical corrections to U.S. note 2 to 
subchapter XVII of chapter 98 of the HTS are necessary to provide the 
intended tariff treatment.
13. Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified certain rules of 
origin of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Technical 
errors, including an inadvertent omission, were made in the 
modifications to general note 12 to the HTS as provided in Annex I of 
Publication 4095 of the USITC entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States to Adjust Rules of Origin Under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement,'' which was incorporated by 
reference into Proclamation 8405.
14. I have determined that technical corrections to general note 12 to 
the HTS are necessary to provide the tariff and certain other treatment 
accorded under the NAFTA to originating goods.
15. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, affecting 
import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, 
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction. Section

[[Page 150]]

1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that 
any modifications proclaimed by the President under section 1206(a) of 
that Act may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on 
which the text of the proclamation is published in the Federal Register.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, section 202 of the USBFTA 
Implementation Act, section 213A of CBERA, as amended, and section 604 
of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that: (1) In order to reflect in the HTS 
the modifications to the rules of origin under the USBFTA once those 
modifications go into effect, general note 30 to the HTS is modified as 
provided in Annex I to this proclamation.
(2) In order to implement the tariff treatment provided for in section 
213A of CBERA, as amended, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II 
to this proclamation.
(3) In order to make the technical corrections to general note 29 to the 
HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in paragraph 1 of Annex III to 
this proclamation.
(4) In order to make the technical corrections to U.S. note 2 to 
subchapter XVII of chapter 98 of the HTS, the HTS is modified as set 
forth in paragraph 2 of Annex III to this proclamation.
(5) In order to make technical corrections to general note 12 to the 
HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in paragraph 3 of Annex III to 
this proclamation.
(6) The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS set forth 
in Annex I to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the 
later of (i) November 1, 2010, or (ii) the thirtieth day after the date 
of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.
(7) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annexes II and III to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates provided 
in those Annexes.
(8) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of

Proclamation 8597 of November 1, 2010

National Adoption Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Giving a child a strong foundation--a home, a family to love, and a safe 
place to grow--is one of life's greatest and most generous gifts. 
Through adoption, both domestic and international, Americans from across 
our country have provided secure environments for children who need 
them, and these families have benefited from the joy an adopted child 
can bring. Thanks to their nurturing and care, more young people have 
been able to realize their potential and lead full, happy lives. This 
year, we celebrate National Adoption Month to recognize adoption as a 
positive and powerful force in countless American lives, and to 
encourage the adoption of children from foster care.
Currently, thousands of children await adoption or are in foster care, 
looking forward to permanent homes. These children can thrive, reach 
their full potential, and spread their wings when given the loving and 
firm foundation of family. Adoptive families come in many forms, and 
choose to adopt for different reasons: a desire to grow their family 
when conceiving a child is not possible, an expression of compassion for 
a child who would otherwise not have a permanent family, or simply 
because adoption has personally touched their lives. For many Americans, 
adoption has brought boundless purpose and joy to their lives. We must 
do all we can to break down barriers to ensure that all qualified 
caregivers have the ability to serve as adoptive families.
This year, on November 20, families, adoption advocates, policymakers, 
judges, and volunteers will celebrate the 11th annual National Adoption 
Day in communities large and small. National Adoption Day is a day of 
hope and happiness when courthouses finalize the adoptions of children 
out of foster care. Last year, Health and Human Services Secretary 
Kathleen Sebelius was honored to preside over a ceremony celebrating two 
foster care adoptions as part of my Administration's support for this 
important day.
Adoptive families are shining examples of the care and concern that 
define our great Nation. To support adoption in our communities, my 
Administration is working with States to support families eager to 
provide for children in need of a place to call home. The landmark 
Affordable Care Act increases and improves the Adoption Tax Credit, 
enabling adoption to be more affordable and accessible. As part of the 
Adoption Incentives program, States can also receive awards for 
increasing adoptions and the number of children adopted from foster 
care. AdoptUsKids, a project of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, offers technical support to States, territories, and tribes to 
recruit and retain foster and adoptive families; provides information 
and assistance to families considering adoption; and supports parents 
already on that journey. I encourage all Americans to visit 
AdoptUsKids.org or ChildWelfare.gov/Adoption for information and 
resources on adoption, including adoption from foster care.

[[Page 155]]

As we observe National Adoption Month, we honor the loving embrace of 
adoptive families and the affirming role of adoption in the lives of 
American families and our country. Let us all commit to supporting our 
children in any way that we are able--whether opening our hearts and 
homes through adoption, becoming foster parents to provide quality 
temporary care to children in crisis, supporting foster and adoptive 
families in our communities and places of worship, mentoring young 
people in need of guidance, or donating time to helping children in 
need. Working together, we can shape a future of hope and promise for 
all of our Nation's children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2010 as 
National Adoption Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by answering the call to find homes for every child in America in need 
of a permanent and caring family, as well as to support the families who 
care for them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8598 of November 5, 2010

Veterans Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Veterans Day, we come together to pay tribute to the men and women 
who have worn the uniform of the United States Armed Forces. Americans 
across this land commemorate the patriots who have risked their lives to 
preserve the liberty of our Nation, the families who support them, and 
the heroes no longer with us. It is not our weapons or our technology 
that make us the most advanced military in the world; it is the 
unparalleled spirit, skill, and devotion of our troops. As we honor our 
veterans with ceremonies on this day, let our actions strengthen the 
bond between a Nation and her warriors.
In an unbroken line of valor stretching across more than two centuries, 
our veterans have charged into harm's way, sometimes making the ultimate 
sacrifice, to protect the freedoms that have blessed America. Whether 
Active Duty, Reserve, or National Guard, they are our Nation's finest 
citizens, and they have shown the heights to which Americans can rise 
when asked and inspired to do so. Our courageous troops in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and around the globe have earned their place alongside 
previous generations of great Americans, serving selflessly, tour after 
tour, in conflicts spanning nearly a decade.
Long after leaving the uniform behind, many veterans continue to serve 
our country as public servants and mentors, parents and community 
leaders. They have added proud chapters to the story of America, not 
only on the

[[Page 156]]

battlefield, but also in communities from coast to coast. They have 
built and shaped our Nation, and it is our solemn promise to support our 
Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen as they return 
to their homes and families.
America's sons and daughters have not watched over her shores or her 
citizens for public recognition, fanfare, or parades. They have 
preserved our way of life with unwavering patriotism and quiet courage, 
and ours is a debt of honor to care for them and their families. These 
obligations do not end after their time of service, and we must fulfill 
our sacred trust to care for our veterans after they retire their 
uniforms.
As a grateful Nation, we are humbled by the sacrifices rendered by our 
service members and their families out of the deepest sense of service 
and love of country. On Veterans Day, let us remember our solemn 
obligations to our veterans, and recommit to upholding the enduring 
principles that our country lives for, and that our fellow citizens have 
fought and died for.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service men 
and women have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's 
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2010, as Veterans Day. I 
encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our 
veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their 
communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal 
organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support 
this day with commemorative expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8599 of November 8, 2010

World Freedom Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Berlin Wall once stood as a painful barrier between family and 
friends, a dark symbol of oppression and stifled liberties. On November 
9, 1989, in a powerful affirmation of freedom, Germans from both sides 
of the wall joined to tear down the hated blockade. World Freedom Day 
commemorates the end of this icon of division; celebrates the courageous 
resolve of individuals who insisted upon a better future for themselves 
and their country; and marks the reunification of a city, a nation, and 
a people. This

[[Page 157]]

cherished day also calls upon us to reflect on our world anew and 
recognize that the work of freedom is never finished.
Our world has become increasingly interconnected, and more prosperous, 
cooperative, and free. We stand at a transformational moment in history, 
where there is tremendous potential not only to tear down walls, but 
also to build bridges between people separated by geography, cultures, 
and beliefs. Across the world, we have seen the power of the ballot box 
and the desire of people to break through artificial barriers and work 
to implement solutions to common challenges. Civil society and 
governments are coming together as never before to promote liberty, 
share knowledge, and protect human dignity.
With enduring bonds forged across decades, the democracies that emerged 
one by one from behind the Iron Curtain are now America's allies and 
partners, and today we jointly confront global challenges. Examples of 
the strength of conviction, these sovereign nations inspire all who 
still yearn to exercise their universal human rights. The 21st 
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall is an occasion to renew our 
common commitment to advance the cause of world freedom in the 21st 
century.
The arc of history has shown that human destiny is what we make of it. 
Freedom has expanded across the globe because principled men and women 
have marched, spoken out, and demanded the rights and dignity that 
should be enjoyed by all humanity. Those nations that have already 
secured these liberties share a responsibility to uphold the light of 
freedom in other countries as well as in their own. On World Freedom 
Day, we rededicate ourselves to supporting democracy and the rule of 
law, to strengthening civil society, and to promoting the free exchange 
of information around the world. United in common purpose, we will 
continue to work towards the promise of a brighter future and a time 
when all peoples and nations enjoy the hope and peace of freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2010, as 
World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming 
our dedication to freedom and democracy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8600 of November 15, 2010

National Entrepreneurship Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Entrepreneurs embody the promise that lies at the heart of America--that 
if you have a good idea and work hard enough, the American dream is

[[Page 158]]

within your reach. During National Entrepreneurship Week, we renew our 
commitment to supporting the entrepreneurs who power the engine of our 
Nation's economy. These intrepid individuals translate their vision into 
products and services that keep America strong and competitive on a 
global scale, and build opportunity and prosperity across our country.
As we emerge from a historic economic recession, my Administration has 
taken decisive action to accelerate growth and remove barriers for 
entrepreneurs and small business owners to grow, hire, and prosper. At a 
time when small business lending standards had tightened considerably, 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act helped the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) work with lenders to provide critical SBA loans. 
These loans assisted thousands of entrepreneurs in starting new 
businesses, employing workers, and jumpstarting our economy. I was also 
proud to sign the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the most important 
investment in small businesses in more than a decade. This legislation 
will make it easier for them to expand and hire, creating tax breaks and 
accelerating more than $55 billion in tax relief for entrepreneurs and 
small business owners by the end of 2011.
To harness the ingenuity of the American people, my Administration has 
developed a national innovation strategy, which emphasizes 
entrepreneurship as a catalyst for new industries, new businesses, and 
new jobs. This strategy focuses on key investments to foster American 
innovation, improving education, building a 21st-century infrastructure, 
and bolstering our ability to conduct cutting-edge research. It also 
seeks to promote and facilitate competitive markets for entrepreneurs, 
and to support breakthroughs in areas of national priority--including 
alternative energy, health care technology, and advanced vehicle 
technologies. In addition, the new National Advisory Council on 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship is collecting input from across the 
United States to recommend policies that will bolster our economic 
growth and lead to sustainable, well-paying American jobs. I encourage 
aspiring entrepreneurs and other Americans interested in promoting 
innovation to visit www.SBA.gov for resources and information.
All Americans can play a role in increasing the prevalence and success 
of new start-ups. Business leaders can mentor a budding entrepreneur who 
has an original idea and the will to execute, but could benefit from the 
guidance of an experienced owner or operator. Philanthropists can expand 
entrepreneurship education for ambitious students at underserved schools 
and community colleges. Universities can accelerate the transition of 
scientific breakthroughs from the lab to the marketplace. Together, we 
can help millions of entrepreneurs create the industries and jobs of the 
21st century and solve some of the toughest challenges we face as a 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 14 through 
November 20, 2010, as National Entrepreneurship Week. I call upon all 
Americans to commemorate this week with appropriate programs and 
activities, and to celebrate November 19, 2010, as National 
Entrepreneurs' Day.

Proclamation 8601 of November 15, 2010

America Recycles Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each small act of conservation, when combined with other innumerable 
deeds across the country, can have an enormous impact on the health of 
our environment. On America Recycles Day, we celebrate the individuals, 
communities, local governments, and businesses that work together to 
recycle waste and develop innovative ways to manage our resources more 
sustainably.
Americans already take many steps to protect our planet, participating 
in curbside recycling and community composting programs, and expanding 
their use of recyclable and recycled materials. Recycling not only 
preserves our environment by conserving precious resources and reducing 
our carbon footprint, but it also contributes to job creation and 
economic development. This billion-dollar industry employs thousands of 
workers nationwide, and evolving our recycling practices can help create 
green jobs, support a vibrant American recycling and refurbishing 
industry, and advance our clean energy economy.
While we can celebrate the breadth of our successes on America Recycles 
Day, we must also recommit to building upon this progress and to drawing 
attention to further developments, including the recycling of electronic 
products. The increased use of electronics and technology in our homes 
and society brings the challenge of protecting human health and the 
environment from potentially harmful effects of the improper handling 
and disposal of these products. Currently, most discarded consumer 
electronics end up in our landfills or are exported abroad, creating 
potential health and environmental hazards and representing a lost 
opportunity to recover valuable resources such as rare earth minerals.
To address the problems caused by electronic waste, American businesses, 
government, and individuals must work together to manage these 
electronics throughout the product lifecycle--from design and 
manufacturing through their use and eventual recycling, recovery, and 
disposal. To ensure the Federal Government leads as a responsible 
consumer, my Administration has established an interagency task force to 
prepare a national strategy for responsible electronics stewardship, 
including improvements to Federal procedures for managing electronic 
products. This strategy must also include steps to ensure electronics 
containing hazardous materials collected for recycling and disposal are 
not exported to developing nations that lack the capacity to manage the 
recovery and disposal of these products in ways that safeguard human 
health and the environment.

[[Page 160]]

On America Recycles Day, let us respond to our collective responsibility 
as a people and a Nation to be better stewards of our global 
environment, and to pass down a planet to future generations that is 
better than we found it.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2010, as 
America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I 
encourage all Americans to continue their recycling efforts throughout 
the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8602 of November 16, 2010

American Education Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Education is essential to our success as both a people and a Nation. 
During American Education Week, we rededicate ourselves to providing a 
complete and competitive education for every student, from cradle 
through career.
In an increasingly interconnected world, our leadership and prosperity 
depend on the standard and quality of education that we establish for 
our students. In order to maintain our Nation's role as the world's 
engine of discovery and innovation, my Administration is committed to 
ensuring that America has the best-educated citizenry in the world.
To foster the next generation of great American leaders, we must 
continue to invest in education at all levels, work with States and 
districts to improve our educational system, and encourage reforms that 
ensure the development of our students and teachers. We have also set a 
goal of once again having the highest proportion of college graduates of 
any country across the globe by the year 2020.
 Educators and school employees must also strive to provide our students 
with the tools needed to access a fulfilling and prosperous future. 
Students are able to reach for their dreams when teachers, parents, and 
communities support their efforts and insist upon excellence.
 Education has always been central to ensuring opportunity, and to 
instilling in all our citizens the defining American values of freedom, 
equality, and respect for one another. Our Nation's schools can give 
students the tools, skills, and knowledge to participate fully in our 
democracy, and to succeed in college, career, and life. This week, let 
us reaffirm the importance of education and recognize that we all share 
in the responsibility to educate our students.

[[Page 161]]

 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 14 through 
November 20, 2010, as American Education Week. I call upon all Americans 
to observe this week by supporting their local schools through 
appropriate activities, events, and programs designed to help create 
opportunities for every school and student in America.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8603 of November 18, 2010

National Family Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Like generations before them, today's American families rely on their 
love and care for each other to face challenges. During National Family 
Week, we celebrate the resilient spirit of America's families and their 
role in building vibrant communities and a strong Nation.
My Administration remains committed to finding solutions to the issues 
affecting American families. In my first year in office, I established 
the White House Task Force on the Middle Class, chaired by Vice 
President Joe Biden, which aims to protect working families' economic 
security and raise their standard of living. And the continued success 
of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has created more jobs, as 
well as housing, educational, and child care support for families 
throughout the country.
This year, I was proud to sign the Affordable Care Act, which 
strengthens health security for families through important health 
insurance reforms. This landmark law allows young adults to stay on 
their parents' health insurance plan until they turn 26 or have coverage 
through their job, requires new plans to cover recommended preventive 
care with no out-of-pocket costs, prohibits insurance companies from 
denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and eliminates 
lifetime and annual caps on dollar amounts insurance companies will 
spend on care. I also signed the Health Care and Education 
Reconciliation Act, which provides increased funding for Pell grants to 
help families cover the rising costs of higher education.
The strength of our families will determine our success as a Nation. 
Families of all kinds can provide a supportive and stable foundation to 
unlock the promise in each of us. These units are the building blocks of 
our neighborhoods and communities, shaping the development of our 
society, instilling values in us, and impacting our lives with their 
care and compassion. During this holiday season, we especially 
acknowledge the sacrifices of our brave service members and their 
families who keep our loved ones safe here at home and abroad.

[[Page 162]]

This National Family Week, we recognize the importance of the family 
unit in helping all Americans reach their dreams. As we confront our 
challenges as a Nation, let us support our families in creating safe, 
nurturing environments for our loved ones and communities. Together, we 
will build a foundation for the future success of all of America's sons 
and daughters.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21 through 
November 27, 2010, as National Family Week. I invite all States, local 
communities, and individuals to join in observing this week with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8604 of November 19, 2010

National Child's Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On National Child's Day, we celebrate America's children and rededicate 
ourselves to helping them reach for their dreams and realize their full 
potential. To build a strong foundation for our children's future, we 
must support their health and development and ensure that they receive a 
high-quality education that will prepare them to lead in the 21st 
century.
My Administration is committed to caring for our Nation's most precious 
resource: our children. I was proud to sign the Affordable Care Act into 
law, which expands families' health insurance options and requires new 
plans to cover recommended preventive services--including well-baby and 
well-child visits and essential immunizations and vaccinations--with no 
out-of-pocket costs. It also prohibits insurance companies from using a 
pre-existing condition as a reason to deny health care coverage to 
children as of this year, and to all Americans in 2014. Additionally, 
through the ``Let's Move!'' Initiative, First Lady Michelle Obama is 
helping lead our effort to end the epidemic of childhood obesity within 
a generation by encouraging healthy eating and physical activity.
We must also invest in our Nation's future by investing in our 
children's education, for it is both a key to success and a prerequisite 
to opportunity. Early childhood education programs can greatly influence 
learning capabilities later in life, and my Administration is working to 
expand these programs and improve their quality. Teachers are the most 
important resource to a child's learning, and countless children benefit 
from the experience and enthusiasm that teachers bring to the classroom. 
These individuals instill in our youth the knowledge that will enable 
them to grow into active and engaged adults. Through such care and 
guidance--and a greater effort

[[Page 163]]

by all to provide safe, supportive spaces for our children, free of 
bullying and harassment--we will unlock the promise within each child.
Our children will soon stand at the helm of America and steer its 
course. This Child's Day, let us recommit to instilling the values, 
vision, and knowledge that will allow our children to realize a future 
of opportunity and prosperity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2010, as 
National Child's Day. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with 
appropriate activities, programs, and ceremonies, and to rededicate 
ourselves to creating the bright future we want for our Nation's 
children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8605 of November 19, 2010

National Farm-City Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's farms have long been vital to our Nation. They contribute to 
our public health, safeguard our environmental resources, and stand at 
the forefront of our country's path toward energy independence. We must 
continue supporting the vital relationship between American farms and 
families, and work to ensure that farming remains an economically, 
socially, and environmentally sustainable way of life for future 
generations. During National Farm-City Week, we recognize the myriad 
contributions our Nation's farmers and ranchers make toward furthering 
the health and well-being of our country.
The connection between rural industries and urban markets is stronger 
than ever, and Americans across the country are finding ways to 
participate in and celebrate the importance of agriculture and related 
industries. Rising interest in local and regional food highlights 
farmers' contributions in connecting urban, suburban, and rural areas. 
American children are learning about the origins of our food and healthy 
food options by visiting farms, learning from hard-working farmers and 
ranchers, and trying their hand at agriculture through networks of 
school gardens and farm-to-school programs. Thanks to their constant 
enterprise and innovation, rural communities are building new domestic 
and international markets for their high-quality food, fuel, and fiber 
products. As our agricultural industries continue to feed individuals at 
home and around the globe, we must help ensure robust and vibrant rural 
communities to support them.
For agriculture to thrive, we must remain committed to protecting our 
valuable natural resources and diverse ecosystems. In April, I launched 
the America's Great Outdoors Initiative to develop a 21st-century 
conservation

[[Page 164]]

agenda that will reconnect Americans with the outdoors and protect our 
Nation's vast and varied natural heritage. Senior officials throughout 
my Administration have travelled across the country to farms, State 
fairs, and community meetings to learn about innovative ways farmers, 
ranchers, tribes, conservationists, and concerned citizens are working 
together to preserve our rich agricultural legacy.
While we gather with family and friends during this time of 
Thanksgiving, let us celebrate farms of every size that produce the 
abundance that graces our tables. During National Farm-City Week, as the 
bounty of agriculture moves from America's farms to our tables, we honor 
all who foster our healthier future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 19 through 
November 25, 2010, as National Farm-City Week. I call on all Americans 
to reflect on the accomplishments of those who dedicate their lives to 
promoting our Nation's agricultural abundance and environmental 
stewardship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8606 of November 23, 2010

Thanksgiving Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A beloved American tradition, Thanksgiving Day offers us the opportunity 
to focus our thoughts on the grace that has been extended to our people 
and our country. This spirit brought together the newly arrived Pilgrims 
and the Wampanoag tribe--who had been living and thriving around 
Plymouth, Massachusetts for thousands of years--in an autumn harvest 
feast centuries ago. This Thanksgiving Day, we reflect on the compassion 
and contributions of Native Americans, whose skill in agriculture helped 
the early colonists survive, and whose rich culture continues to add to 
our Nation's heritage. We also pause our normal pursuits on this day and 
join in a spirit of fellowship and gratitude for the year's bounties and 
blessings.
Thanksgiving Day is a time each year, dating back to our founding, when 
we lay aside the troubles and disagreements of the day and bow our heads 
in humble recognition of the providence bestowed upon our Nation. Amidst 
the uncertainty of a fledgling experiment in democracy, President George 
Washington declared the first Thanksgiving in America, recounting the 
blessings of tranquility, union, and plenty that shined upon our young 
country. In the dark days of the Civil War when the fate of our Union 
was in doubt, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a Thanksgiving Day, 
calling for ``the Almighty hand'' to heal and restore our Nation.

[[Page 165]]

In confronting the challenges of our day, we must draw strength from the 
resolve of previous generations who faced their own struggles and take 
comfort in knowing a brighter day has always dawned on our great land. 
As we stand at the close of one year and look to the promise of the 
next, we lift up our hearts in gratitude to God for our many blessings, 
for one another, and for our Nation. This Thanksgiving Day, we remember 
that the freedoms and security we enjoy as Americans are protected by 
the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces. These 
patriots are willing to lay down their lives in our defense, and they 
and their families deserve our profound gratitude for their service and 
sacrifice.
This harvest season, we are also reminded of those experiencing the 
pangs of hunger or the hardship of economic insecurity. Let us return 
the kindness and generosity we have seen throughout the year by helping 
our fellow citizens weather the storms of our day.
As Americans gather for the time-honored Thanksgiving Day meal, let us 
rejoice in the abundance that graces our tables, in the simple gifts 
that mark our days, in the loved ones who enrich our lives, and in the 
gifts of a gracious God. Let us recall that our forebears met their 
challenges with hope and an unfailing spirit, and let us resolve to do 
the same.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 25, 
2010, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of 
the United States to come together--whether in our homes, places of 
worship, community centers, or any place of fellowship for friends and 
neighbors--to give thanks for all we have received in the past year, to 
express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own, and to share 
our bounty with others.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8607 of November 30, 2010

Critical Infrastructure Protection Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Critical Infrastructure Protection Month, we highlight the vast 
network of systems and structures that sustain the vigor and vitality of 
our Nation. Critical infrastructure includes the assets, networks, and 
functions--both physical and virtual--essential to the security, 
economic welfare, public health, and safety of the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security leads an unprecedented national 
partnership dedicated to the security and resilience of our critical 
infrastructure. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan integrates a 
multitude

[[Page 166]]

of diverse stakeholders--Federal, State, local, territorial, and tribal 
governments; private sector critical infrastructure owners and 
operators; first responders; and the public--to identify and protect our 
infrastructure from hazards or attack. These critical infrastructure 
partnerships continue to build their information-sharing capacity and 
develop actions that strengthen our Nation's preparedness, response 
capabilities, and recovery resources.
My Administration is committed to delivering the necessary information, 
tools, and resources to areas where critical infrastructure exists in 
order to maintain and enhance its security and resilience. I have 
proposed a bold plan for renewing and expanding our Nation's 
infrastructure, including its critical infrastructure, in the coming 
years. Additionally, we must work to empower communities, an integral 
part of critical infrastructure security, to work with local 
infrastructure owners and operators, which will make our physical and 
cyber infrastructure more resilient. Working together, we can raise 
awareness of the important role our critical infrastructure plays in 
sustaining the American way of life and develop actions to protect these 
vital resources.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2010 as 
Critical Infrastructure Protection Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's 
resources and to observe this month with appropriate events and training 
to enhance our national security and resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8608 of November 30, 2010

Helsinki Human Rights Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year marks the 35th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, a 
seminal document tying lasting security among states with respect for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms within states. With the signing of 
the Act on August 1, 1975, the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, 
and the countries of a divided Europe solemnly pledged to work together 
to realize comprehensive security across the European continent. This 
occasion also spurred courageous human rights activists in Eastern 
Europe to form citizens' groups to press for the implementation of 
commitments their governments had made, launching the Helsinki movement.
The guiding principles set forth 35 years ago in the Helsinki Final Act, 
now institutionalized in the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (OSCE), still serve as a beacon to all who strive for freedom 
and peace

[[Page 167]]

across the Euro-Atlantic region. On this day, we reaffirm our sincere 
belief that security is indivisible, and must be rooted in confidence, 
cooperation, transparency, and respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. We also recommit to calling on fellow participating states to 
reexamine their compliance with their OSCE commitments.
The Helsinki Final Act, with its affirmation of fundamental human 
rights, inspired many who struggled against repressive regimes and for 
human dignity. Today, a new generation of brave women and men work 
tirelessly--often risking their lives--to realize those same rights. We 
stand with them and with all who advocate for the rights of their fellow 
citizens and for the betterment of their societies.
Together, we will ensure the United States continues to serve as an 
example in both word and deed to the Helsinki principles. As President 
Gerald Ford said to his fellow signatories at the signing of the 
Helsinki Final Act, history will judge us ``not by the promises we make, 
but by the promises we keep.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2010, as 
Helsinki Human Rights Day. I call upon all the people of the United 
States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8609 of November 30, 2010

World AIDS Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On this World AIDS Day, as we approach the thirtieth year of the HIV/
AIDS pandemic, we reflect on the many Americans and others around the 
globe lost to this devastating disease, and pledge our support to the 33 
million people worldwide who live with HIV/AIDS. We also recommit to 
building on the great strides made in fighting HIV, to preventing the 
spread of the disease, to continuing our efforts to combat stigma and 
discrimination, and to finding a cure.
Today, we are experiencing a domestic HIV epidemic that demands our 
attention and leadership. My Administration has invigorated our response 
to HIV by releasing the first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy 
for the United States. Its vision is an America in which new HIV 
infections are rare, and when they do occur, all persons--regardless of 
age, gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
socio-economic circumstance--will have unfettered access to high-
quality, life-extending care.

[[Page 168]]

Signifying a renewed level of commitment and urgency, the National HIV/
AIDS Strategy for the United States focuses on comprehensive, evidence-
based approaches to preventing HIV in high-risk communities. It 
strengthens efforts to link and retain people living with HIV into care, 
and lays out new steps to ensure that the United States has the 
workforce necessary to serve Americans living with HIV. The Strategy 
also provides a path for reducing HIV-related health disparities by 
adopting community-level approaches to preventing and treating this 
disease, including addressing HIV-related discrimination.
Along with this landmark Strategy, we have also made significant 
progress with the health reform law I signed this year, the Affordable 
Care Act. For far too long, Americans living with HIV and AIDS have 
endured great difficulties in obtaining adequate health insurance 
coverage and quality care. The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance 
companies from using HIV status and other pre-existing conditions as a 
reason to deny health care coverage to children as of this year, and to 
all Americans beginning in 2014. To ensure that individuals living with 
HIV/AIDS can access the care they need, the Affordable Care Act ends 
lifetime limits and phases out annual limits on coverage. Starting in 
2014, it forbids insurance companies from charging higher premiums 
because of HIV status, and introduces tax credits that will make 
coverage more affordable for all Americans. This landmark law also 
provides access to insurance coverage through the Pre-Existing Condition 
Insurance Plan for the uninsured with chronic conditions.
Our Government has a role to play in reducing stigma, which is why my 
Administration eliminated the entry ban that previously barred 
individuals living with HIV/AIDS from entering the United States. As a 
result, the 2012 International AIDS Conference will be held in 
Washington, D.C., the first time this important meeting will be hosted 
by the United States in over two decades. For more information about our 
commitment to fighting this epidemic and the stigma surrounding it, I 
encourage all Americans to visit: www.AIDS.gov.
Tackling this disease requires a shared response that builds on the 
successes achieved to date. Globally, tens of millions of people have 
benefited from HIV prevention, treatment, and care programs supported by 
the American people. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
(PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
support anti-retroviral treatments for millions around the world. My 
Administration has also made significant investments and increases in 
our efforts to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS at home and abroad by 
implementing a comprehensive package of proven prevention programs and 
improving the health of those in developing countries. Additionally, the 
Global Health Initiative integrates treatment and care with other 
interventions to provide a holistic approach to improving the health of 
people living with HIV/AIDS. Along with our global partners, we will 
continue to focus on saving lives through effective prevention 
activities, as well as other smart investments to maximize the impact of 
each dollar spent.
World AIDS Day serves as an important reminder that HIV/AIDS has not 
gone away. More than one million Americans currently live with HIV/AIDS 
in the United States, and more than 56,000 become infected each year. 
For too long, this epidemic has loomed over our Nation and our world, 
taking a devastating toll on some of the most vulnerable among us. On 
World

[[Page 169]]

AIDS Day, we mourn those we have lost and look to the promise of a 
brighter future and a world without HIV/AIDS.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim December 1, 2010, as 
World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join in 
appropriate activities to remember the men, women, and children who have 
lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support and comfort to those 
living with this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8610 of December 1, 2010

National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, millions of Americans travel on our Nation's roadways. 
Thousands of these drivers and passengers tragically lose their lives 
each year because of drunk, drugged, or distracted driving. During 
National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we recommit to preventing 
the loss of life by practicing safe driving practices and reminding 
others to be sober, drug-free, and safe on the road.
Impaired driving and its consequences can seriously alter or even 
destroy lives and property in a moment. This reckless behavior not only 
includes drunk driving, but also the growing problem of drugged driving. 
Drugs, including those prescribed by a physician, can impair judgment 
and motor skills. It is critical that we encourage our young people and 
fellow citizens to make responsible decisions when driving or riding as 
a passenger, especially if drug use is apparent.
This National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we must also draw 
attention to the dangers of distracted driving, including using 
electronic equipment or texting while behind the wheel of a vehicle. 
When people take their attention away from the road to answer a call, 
respond to a message, or use a device, they put themselves and others at 
risk. Distracted driving is a serious, life-threatening practice, and I 
encourage everyone to visit Distraction.gov to learn how to prevent 
distracted driving.
My Administration is dedicated to strengthening efforts against drunk, 
drugged, and distracted driving. To lead by example, we have implemented 
a nationwide ban prohibiting Federal employees from texting while 
driving on Government business or when using a Government device. This 
holiday season, the United States Department of Transportation's 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also sponsoring the 
campaign, ``Drunk

[[Page 170]]

Driving: Over the Limit. Under Arrest.'' Thousands of police departments 
and law enforcement agencies across the Nation will redouble their 
efforts to ensure impaired drivers are detected and appropriate action 
is taken. Additionally, the Office of National Drug Control Policy is 
working with Federal agencies to raise public awareness about the high 
prevalence of drugged driving in our country, and to provide resources 
for parents of new drivers about how to talk to their children about 
drugs.
As responsible citizens, we must not wait until tragedy strikes, and we 
must take an active role in preventing debilitated driving. Individuals, 
families, businesses, community organizations, drug-free coalitions, and 
faith-based groups can promote substance abuse prevention and encourage 
alternative sources of transportation. By working together, we can help 
save countless lives and make America's roadways safer for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2010 as 
National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make 
responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired 
driving.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8611 of December 2, 2010

40th Anniversary of the Environmental Protection Agency

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the air we breathe to the water we drink, the quality of our 
environment has a profound effect on our public health, the well-being 
of future generations, and the vitality of our economy. Just four 
decades ago, smog choked communities across America, pollution clotted 
numerous waterways, and our Nation watched in shock as Cleveland's 
Cuyahoga River ignited from a tragic accumulation of industrial waste 
and sewage. Americans realized that we must work together to preserve 
the beauty and utility of our planet, and we have come to expect clean 
air and drinking water.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created in 
1970 to protect Americans' health and our natural resources from 
pollution. Since its formation, EPA has responded to our Nation's most 
urgent environmental challenges, including industrial waste polluting 
our waters, acid rain poisoning our forests and lakes, the thinning of 
the ozone layer that shields the Earth, and safe handling of electronic 
waste. Throughout its history, EPA has been a champion for healthy 
families by reducing the environmental risks that affect children, 
fostering cleaner communities, and building a stronger America.

[[Page 171]]

Looking to the future, we must safeguard the rich resources that have 
supported centuries of American growth and economic expansion, while 
also protecting the clean air and water that has helped keep our 
families healthy. To carry out these obligations, EPA will continue to 
make clean air, safe water, and unpolluted land a priority, and 
encourage America to be a leader in environmental protection through 
pollution prevention and the development of clean-energy alternatives to 
fossil fuels. The advances we make today will build a sustainable future 
for our country, creating new clean-energy jobs and laying the 
foundation for our long-term economic security.
Four decades after its creation, EPA is building on its legacy of 
responsible stewardship and advancing environmental quality in the face 
of new challenges. As we strive to protect the integrity of our planet 
in the 21st century, EPA continues to lead on critical global issues 
like reducing mercury pollution, fighting for environmental justice in 
overburdened communities, and confronting global climate change. The 
work of EPA benefits every American by making our environment safer and 
healthier while securing the path to a better future for our children 
and grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2, 2010, as 
the 40th Anniversary of the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency. I call upon all Americans to observe this anniversary with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor EPA's 
history, accomplishments, and contributions to our environment.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8612 of December 3, 2010

International Day of Persons With Disabilities, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America stands in solidarity with the growing number of nations around 
the world that have committed themselves to ending unequal treatment of 
persons with disabilities. On International Day of Persons with 
Disabilities, we acknowledge the contributions of women and men with 
disabilities around the world, and we recognize our charge to ensure 
that all individuals can enjoy full inclusion and participation in our 
societies.
My Administration is continuing to protect and promote human rights, 
fair opportunity, and equal access for people with disabilities. Last 
year, the United States became a proud signatory of the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the first new 
human rights treaty of the 21st century. Like our laws in the United 
States, this treaty urges

[[Page 172]]

equal protection and equal benefit of the law for all persons with 
disabilities, and it reaffirms the inherent dignity, worth, and 
independence of the 650 million individuals with disabilities worldwide. 
To advance our international work in this area, my Administration has 
named a Special Advisor for International Disability Rights at the 
Department of State. My Administration also continues to support the 
efforts of the World Intellectual Property Organization to facilitate 
and increase access to literary, artistic, and scientific materials for 
persons with disabilities. With our partners around the globe, we can 
affirm the rights of individuals with disabilities to live independently 
if they choose, free from the fear of discrimination, stigma, or 
economic insecurity.
In acknowledging the progress of the past year, we also reflect upon 
important milestones in America's civil rights struggle for people with 
disabilities. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act and the 35th anniversary of the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act. These historic, bipartisan civil rights laws 
were clarion calls for equal access for and an end to discrimination 
against persons with disabilities, and they have paved the way for 
countless Americans with disabilities to share their talents and 
strengthen our communities.
We have made progress, but still have a great distance to journey before 
every person living with a disability can benefit from the same access 
and protections, in the United States and abroad. As we celebrate 
International Day of Persons with Disabilities, let us reinvigorate our 
commitment to eradicate barriers and ensure equal opportunity for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2010, as 
International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans 
to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8613 of December 6, 2010

50th Anniversary of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our public lands represent the American spirit and reflect our history, 
culture, and deep respect for wild and beautiful places. As we celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge, we remember that this breathtaking terrain holds great 
significance to our Nation. Stretching from the plains of the Arctic Sea 
to the soaring mountains of the Brooks Range and lush boreal forests of 
the Alaskan lowlands, the rugged splendor of the Arctic Refuge is among 
the most profoundly beautiful places in America.

[[Page 173]]

Following the efforts of visionary conservationists, the Arctic National 
Wildlife Range was created in 1960 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
``for the purpose of preserving unique wildlife, wilderness, and 
recreational values.'' In 1980, under President Jimmy Carter, the area 
was renamed the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and expanded to further 
recognize and protect the stunning variety of wildlife in the area. For 
50 years, the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the 
Interior has managed the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, carefully 
balancing the needs of wildlife and their vital habitats.
In the decades since its establishment, the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge has continued to be one of our Nation's most pristine and 
cherished areas. In the decades to come, it should remain a place where 
wildlife populations, from roaming herds of caribou to grizzly bears and 
wolf packs, continue to thrive. The 19.6 million acres that comprise the 
Arctic Refuge are also home to Native American tribes, including the 
Inupiat and Gwich'in, and the resources of the Refuge sustain these 
populations and protect their indigenous traditions and way of life.
Today, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge remains distinct in the 
American landscape, and we must remain committed to making responsible 
choices and ensuring the continued conservation of these wild lands.
Our Nation's great outdoors, whether our stunning national parks and 
refuges or cherished green spaces in our local communities, are truly a 
hallmark of our American identity. In commemorating five decades of 
protection and conservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, I 
encourage all Americans to recognize the beauty and diversity of all of 
America's open spaces. We are all stewards and trustees of this land, 
and we must ensure that our treasured wilderness and other natural areas 
will be part of our national heritage for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 6, 2010, as 
the 50th Anniversary of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I call upon 
all Americans to observe this anniversary with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8614 of December 7, 2010

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Nearly 70 years ago, on December 7, 1941, our service members and 
civilians awoke on a quiet Sunday to a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor 
by Japanese forces. Employing whatever weapons were at hand, those who 
defended Hawaii that fateful morning stand as examples of the selfless 
heroism that has always characterized the Armed Forces of the United 
States. More than 3,500 Americans were killed or wounded, and the images 
of burning battleships and the grief for lives lost were forever seared 
into our national memory.
The deadly attack on Pearl Harbor did not accomplish its mission of 
breaking the American spirit. Instead, it reinforced our resolve. 
Americans responded with unity and courage to a tragedy that President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt called ``a date which will live in infamy.'' In 
the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, thousands of resolute individuals 
immediately volunteered their service to a grieving Nation. Sixteen 
million of America's sons and daughters served during World War II, and 
more than 400,000 paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of life and 
liberty. Countless other patriots served on the home front, aiding the 
war effort by working in manufacturing plants, participating in 
rationing programs, or planting Victory gardens. In the face of great 
loss, America once again showed the resilience and strength that have 
always characterized our great country.
The Allied Forces battled the scourge of tyranny and ultimately spread 
the transformative march of freedom. As we recognize the 65th 
anniversary of the end of World War II this year, we honor not only 
those who gave their lives that December day, but also all those in 
uniform who travelled to distant theaters of war to halt the progression 
of totalitarianism and hate. In honor of all who have borne the cost of 
battle throughout America's history, let us pledge to meet our debt of 
honor and uphold the ideals they fought to preserve.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2010, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of 
remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and 
interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the 
United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of those American 
patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8615 of December 7, 2010

National Influenza Vaccination Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Last year, as the world prepared for a pandemic of the 2009 H1N1 
influenza virus, we were reminded of the severity and unpredictability 
of this serious disease. Thousands of Americans suffered serious 
complications from the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in 
hospitalization or even death. Tragically, influenza and flu-related 
complications take American lives each year. During National Influenza 
Vaccination Week, we remind all Americans that the flu vaccine is safe 
and effective in preventing the spread of flu viruses.
Annual flu vaccination is recommended for all people 6 months of age and 
older. Under the new health reform law, the Affordable Care Act, 
individuals enrolled in new group or individual private health plans 
have no co-payment or deductible for influenza vaccinations. While the 
flu can make even healthy children and adults very sick, certain 
individuals are at greater risk for serious complications from the flu. 
Pregnant women, young children, older adults, as well as people living 
with HIV, chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, neurologic 
conditions, and certain other chronic health conditions are especially 
encouraged to get a flu vaccine. Our Nation's health care workers and 
those caring for infants under 6 months of age should also be vaccinated 
to protect themselves and those within their care. I encourage all 
Americans to visit www.Flu.gov for information and resources on 
vaccinations and how to prevent and treat the flu.
Everyone can take steps to promote America's health this flu season. 
Though there is no way to accurately predict the course or severity of 
influenza, we know from experience that it will pose serious health 
risks for thousands of Americans this season. We can all take common-
sense precautions to prevent infection with influenza, including washing 
hands frequently, covering coughs or sneezes with sleeves and not hands, 
and staying home when ill.
However, vaccination is the best protection against contracting and 
spreading the flu. The vaccine is available through doctors' offices, 
clinics, State and local health departments, pharmacies, college and 
university health centers, as well as through many employers and some 
primary and secondary schools. Seasonal flu activity is usually most 
intense between January and March, and vaccinating now can help curb the 
spread of this disease. Together, we can prepare as individuals and as a 
Nation for this year's flu season and help ensure that our fellow 
Americans remain healthy and safe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 5 through 
December 11, 2010, as National Influenza Vaccination Week. I encourage 
Americans to get vaccinated this week if they have not yet done so, and 
to urge their families, friends, and co-workers to do the same.

Proclamation 8616 of December 10, 2010

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. More than 60 years later, the Declaration 
reflects the world's commitment to the idea that ``all human beings are 
born free and equal in dignity and rights.'' As Americans, this self-
evident truth lies at the heart of our Declaration of Independence, our 
Constitution, and our Bill of Rights. It is a belief that, while every 
nation pursues a path rooted in the culture of its own citizens, certain 
rights belong to all people: freedom to live as they choose, to speak 
openly, to organize peacefully, to worship freely, and to participate 
fully in the public life of their society with confidence in the rule of 
law.
Freedom, justice, and peace for the world must begin with basic security 
and liberty in the lives of individual human beings. Today, we continue 
the fight to make universal human rights a reality for every person, 
regardless of race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, 
or circumstance. From the freedom to associate or criticize to the 
protection from violence or unlawful detention, these inherent civil 
rights are a matter of both pragmatic and moral necessity.
The challenges of a new century call for a world that is more purposeful 
and more united. The United States will always speak for those who are 
voiceless, defend those who are oppressed, and bear witness to those who 
want nothing more than to exercise their universal human rights. Our 
Bill of Rights protects these fundamental values at home, and guides our 
actions as we stand with those who seek to exercise their universal 
rights, wherever they live. Countries whose people choose their leaders 
and rely on the rule of law are more likely to be peaceful neighbors and 
prosperous partners in the world community.
Part of the price of our own blessings of freedom is standing up for the 
liberty of others. As we observe Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, 
and Human Rights Week, let us recommit to advancing human rights as our 
common cause and moral imperative. Let us continue to stand with 
citizens, activists, and governments around the world who embrace 
democratic reforms and empower free expression. Together, we can advance 
the arc of human progress toward a more perfect Union and a more perfect 
world--one in which each human being lives with dignity, security, and 
equality.

[[Page 177]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2010, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 2010, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 2010, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to mark these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8617 of December 17, 2010

Wright Brothers Day, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On December 17, 1903, after years of determination and creativity, 
Orville and Wilbur Wright's wooden aircraft sailed the steady winds of 
Kitty Hawk, North Carolina and conquered the age-old dream of manned 
flight. That day, the two brothers from Dayton, Ohio, could only imagine 
what we now know--that those moments aloft in the North Carolina sky 
would send mankind on a revolutionary journey and modernize 
transportation. On this day, we celebrate their historic accomplishment, 
the limitless potential they represent, and the vision they spurred for 
the next generation of inventors and entrepreneurs.
The Wright brothers' monumental achievement solidified their place in 
history and earned them status as American and global icons. They moved 
aviation from a curiosity into an indispensable global industry. Self-
taught and relentless in their years of work and experimentation, these 
brothers were a shining illustration of the limitless capacity of human 
intellect and the resourcefulness of the American entrepreneur. As part 
of an era of great visionaries, Orville and Wilbur Wright helped hasten 
an age of discovery and great technological advancement. Their 
unyielding pursuit of powered flight stands as a proud example for young 
and curious minds eager to transform and advance the world around them.
Just as the Wright brothers' breakthrough led to a new industry that 
forever altered our world, a new generation of space pioneers is now 
following in their footsteps and setting our Nation's sights even 
higher. Working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
and the Federal Aviation Administration, leaders in spaceflight are 
making great progress in ushering in a new commercial space industry 
that can help boost our economy, create new jobs, and take Americans to 
soaring new heights.
America's long history of technological leadership and innovation has 
been the product of learning and ingenuity. To maintain this tradition 
and propel it forward, America must empower the next generation of doers 
and makers. We must ensure our Nation's students receive the world-class

[[Page 178]]

mathematics and science education they need to challenge the boundaries 
of human knowledge and realize tomorrow what we can only dream today. We 
must also ready our children to become the entrepreneurs whose tenacity 
and creativity will power the engine of our Nation's economy for 
centuries to come. On Wright Brothers Day, in remembrance of that 
celebrated flight, let us recommit to preparing the next generation of 
scientists, engineers, inventors, and entrepreneurs to create a future 
of promise and progress.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as 
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of 
each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested 
the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of 
the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2010, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010

To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, 
and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) 
(AGOA), authorizes the President to designate a country listed in 
section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 
3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an ``eligible sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
3. In Proclamation 7657 of March 28, 2003, the President designated the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as an eligible sub-Saharan African 
country pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA.
4. Proclamation 7657 also authorized the United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) to exercise the authority provided to the 
President under section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act to designate the DRC 
as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

[[Page 179]]

5. Pursuant to the authority delegated to the USTR, on October 31, 2003, 
the USTR designated the DRC as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country 
(68 FR 62158-04).
6. Section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) authorizes 
the President to terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if he 
determines that the country is not making continual progress in meeting 
the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act.
7. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the DRC is not making continual progress in meeting the 
requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act. 
Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designation of the DRC as a 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of 
the 1974 Act, effective on January 1, 2011.
8. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the 
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel 
(the ``USIFTA''), which the Congress approved in the United States-
Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``USIFTA Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2112 note).
9. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President 
determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, 
suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such 
continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such 
additional duties as the President determines to be required or 
appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.
10. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, 
on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with 
Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products 
during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 
Agreement'').
11. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 
Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the 
USIFTA Act, that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level 
of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to 
Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the 
United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
12. On December 10, 2008, the United States entered into an agreement 
with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force 
through December 31, 2009, to allow additional time for the two 
governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
13. In Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008, the President determined 
that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
provided for by the USIFTA to extend such duty-free treatment through 
December 31, 2009. In that proclamation, the President also modified the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to provide duty-
free access into

[[Page 180]]

the United States through December 31, 2009, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
14. On December 6, 2009, the United States entered into a further 
agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in 
force through December 31, 2010, to allow for further negotiations on an 
agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
15. In Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009, I determined that it was 
necessary in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and 
mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by 
the USIFTA to extend such duty-free treatment through December 31, 2010. 
In that proclamation, I also modified the HTS to provide duty-free 
access into the United States through December 31, 2010, for specified 
quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.
16. On December 12, 2010, the United States entered into a further 
agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in 
force through December 31, 2011, to allow for further negotiations on an 
agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
17. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that 
it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal 
and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided 
for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States 
through the close of December 31, 2011, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
18. During the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (the 
``Uruguay Round''), a group of major trading countries agreed to 
reciprocal elimination of tariffs on certain pharmaceuticals and 
chemical intermediates, and that participants in this agreement would 
revise periodically the list of products subject to duty-free treatment. 
On December 13, 1996, as the result of negotiations under the auspices 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United States and 16 other 
WTO members agreed to eliminate tariffs on additional pharmaceuticals 
and chemical intermediates. The United States implemented this agreement 
in Proclamation 6982 of April 1, 1997. In 1998, the United States and 21 
other WTO members negotiated a second revision to the list of products 
subject to duty-free treatment. The United States implemented this 
revision in Proclamation 7207 of July 1, 1999. In 2006, the United 
States and 30 other WTO members concluded negotiations, under the 
auspices of the WTO, on a further revision to the list of 
pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates subject to duty-free 
treatment. The United States implemented this revision in Proclamation 
8095 of December 29, 2006. The United States and 31 other WTO members 
have negotiated, under the auspices of the WTO, a fourth revision to the 
list of pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates subject to duty-free 
treatment.
19. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 
3521(b)) authorizes the President under specified circumstances to 
proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any 
duty set forth in Schedule XX-United States of America, annexed to the 
Marrakesh Protocol to the GATT 1994 (Schedule XX) for products that were 
the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the 
Uruguay Round, if the United States agrees to such action in a 
multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO.

[[Page 181]]

20. On September 15, 2010, consistent with section 115 of the URAA (19 
U.S.C. 3524), the USTR submitted a report to the Committee on Ways and 
Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of 
the Senate that set forth the proposed further revision to the list of 
pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates subject to duty-free 
treatment. The consultation and layover period specified in section 115 
ended on November 14, 2010.
21. Pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined that 
Schedule XX should be modified to reflect the implementation by the 
United States of the multilateral agreement on certain pharmaceuticals 
and chemical intermediates negotiated under the auspices of the WTO. In 
addition, I have determined that the pharmaceuticals appendix to the HTS 
should be modified to reflect the duty eliminations provided for in that 
agreement.
22. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the 
relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import 
treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 104 of the AGOA, title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, 
section 4 of the USIFTA Act, and section 111 of the URAA do proclaim 
that:
    (1) The designation of the DRC as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act is terminated, 
effective on January 1, 2011.
    (2) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning on January 1, 
2011, the DRC shall no longer be designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by deleting 
``Democratic Republic of Congo'' from the list of beneficiary sub-
Saharan African countries.
    (3) In order to implement U.S. tariff commitments under the 2004 
Agreement through December 31, 2011, the HTS is modified as provided in 
the Annex to this proclamation.
    (4)(a) The modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods that are the 
product of Israel and are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.

(b) The provisions of subchapter VIII of chapter 99 of the HTS, as modified 
by the Annex to this proclamation, shall continue in effect through 
December 31, 2011.

    (5) In order to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated 
under the auspices of the WTO to eliminate tariffs on certain 
pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates, and to make 
technical corrections in the tariff treatment accorded to such products, 
the HTS is modified as set forth in Publication 4208 of the United 
States International Trade Commission, entitled ``Modifications to the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement Changes to 
the Pharmaceutical Appendix'' (Publication 4208), which is incorporated 
by reference into this proclamation.

[[Page 182]]

    (6) The modifications to the HTS made in Publication 4208 shall be 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.
    (7) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8619 of December 21, 2010

National Mentoring Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our Nation, mentors steer our youth through challenging times and 
support their journey into adulthood. During National Mentoring Month, 
we honor these important individuals who unlock the potential and 
nurture the talent of our country, and we encourage more Americans to 
reach out and mentor young people in their community.
The dedication of mentors has helped countless young men and women 
succeed when they might have otherwise fallen short of their full 
potential. Mentors can provide a steady presence and share their 
valuable knowledge and experiences. Even brief amounts of quality time 
set aside by these compassionate adults can have a lasting impact on the 
development of a child. Mentors can also support the lessons of parents 
and teachers by encouraging students to complete their schoolwork and by 
instilling enduring values of commitment and persistence. From coaches 
to community leaders, tutors to trusted friends, mentors are working 
with today's youth to develop tomorrow's leaders.
We know the difference that a responsible, caring adult can make in a 
child's life. Effective mentoring programs can result in better school 
attendance, positive student attitudes, and a reduced likelihood of 
initiating drug and alcohol use. Across the Federal Government, we have 
provided resources to expand mentoring opportunities for America's young 
people. We are increasing mentoring efforts in Native American and rural 
communities and are working to ensure our investments are coordinated, 
effective, and focused on those most in need. To help build healthy 
families and communities and provide our youth with strong role-models, 
I launched the President's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative. First 
Lady Michelle Obama and I have also established mentoring programs 
within the White House, pairing staff with young men and women in the 
Washington, D.C., area. For information and resources about mentoring 
opportunities, I encourage all Americans to visit: www.Serve.gov/Mentor.
Many Americans have realized their promise because a mentor encouraged 
them to reach for new heights and guided them along the path to 
achievement. The contributions of these engaged adults extend beyond the 
lives they touch and have a lasting impact that strengthens our country 
and our future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2011 as 
National Mentoring Month. I call upon all public officials, business and 
community leaders, educators, and Americans across the country to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

Proclamation 8620 of December 21, 2010

National Stalking Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Stalking is a serious and pervasive crime that affects millions of 
Americans each year in communities throughout our country. Though we 
have gained a better understanding of stalking and its prevalence since 
the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, this dangerous 
and criminal behavior is still often mischaracterized as harmless. 
During Stalking Awareness Month, we acknowledge the seriousness of 
stalking, we recognize its impact on victims, and we recommit to 
reducing its incidence.
Persistent stalking and harassment can lead to serious consequences for 
victims, whose lives may be upended by fear. Some victims may be forced 
to take extreme measures to protect themselves, such as changing jobs, 
relocating to a new home, or even assuming a new identity. Stalking can 
happen to anyone, and most victims are stalked by someone they know. 
Young adults are particularly vulnerable, and women are at greater risk 
for stalking victimization than men.
Stalking can be a difficult crime to recognize. The majority of 
survivors do not report stalking victimization to the police, in part 
because perpetrators use a variety of tactics to intimidate and harass 
their victims. Increasingly, stalkers use modern technology to monitor 
and torment their victims, and one in four victims report some form of 
cyberstalking--such as threatening emails or instant messaging--as part 
of their harassment.
My Administration is working across the Federal Government to protect 
victims of violence and enable survivors to break the cycle of abuse or 
harassment. Stalking affects too many Americans to remain a hidden 
crime, and a strong stand is required in order to both support victims 
and hold perpetrators accountable.
As a Nation, we have made progress, but much work remains to respond to 
this criminal behavior. We must work together to educate the public 
about the potentially deadly nature of stalking, to encourage victims to 
seek help, to inform criminal justice professionals about the 
intersection of stalking and other dangerous crimes, and to support law 
enforcement in their efforts.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2011 as 
National Stalking Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to learn to 
recognize the signs of stalking, acknowledge stalking as a serious 
crime, and urge those impacted not to be afraid to speak out or ask for 
help. Let us also resolve

[[Page 185]]

to support victims and survivors, and to create communities that are 
secure and supportive for all Americans.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8621 of December 22, 2010

National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation was founded on the enduring principles of equality and 
freedom for all. As Americans, it is our solemn responsibility to honor 
and uphold this legacy. Yet, around the world and even within the United 
States, victims of modern slavery are deprived of the most basic right 
of freedom. During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention 
Month, we rededicate ourselves to preventing and ending human 
trafficking, and we recognize all who continue to fight this serious 
human rights violation.
Human trafficking is a global travesty that takes many forms. Whether 
forced labor or sexual trafficking, child soldiering or involuntary 
domestic servitude, these abuses are an affront to our national 
conscience, and to our values as Americans and human beings. There is no 
one type of victim--men and women, adults and children are all 
vulnerable. From every corner of our Nation to every part of the globe, 
we must stand firm in defense of freedom and bear witness for those 
exploited by modern slavery.
At the start of each year, Americans commemorate the Emancipation 
Proclamation, which became effective on January 1, 1863, and the 13th 
Amendment, which was signed by President Abraham Lincoln and sent to the 
States for ratification on February 1, 1865. These seminal documents 
secured the promise of freedom for millions enslaved within our borders, 
and brought us closer to perfecting our Union. We also recall that, over 
10 years ago, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 
2000 renewed America's commitment to combating modern slavery 
domestically and internationally. With this law, America reaffirmed the 
fundamental promise of ``forever free'' enshrined within the 
Emancipation Proclamation.
We cannot strengthen global efforts to end modern slavery without first 
accepting the responsibility to prevent, identify, and aggressively 
combat this crime at home. No country can claim immunity from the 
scourge of human rights abuses, or from the responsibility to confront 
them. As evidence of our dedication to a universal struggle against this 
heinous practice, the Department of State's ``Trafficking in Persons 
Report 2010'' included America in its rankings for the first time, 
measuring our efforts by the same standards to which we hold other 
nations. Looking ahead, we must continue to aggressively investigate and 
prosecute human trafficking cases within our own borders.

[[Page 186]]

Although the United States has made great strides in preventing the 
occurrence of modern slavery, prosecuting traffickers and dismantling 
their criminal networks, and protecting victims and survivors, our work 
is not done. We stand with those throughout the world who are working 
every day to end modern slavery, bring traffickers to justice, and 
empower survivors to reclaim their rightful freedom. This month, I urge 
all Americans to educate themselves about all forms of modern slavery 
and the signs and consequences of human trafficking. Together, we can 
combat this crime within our borders and join with our partners around 
the world to end this injustice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2011 as 
National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in 
the annual celebration of National Freedom Day on February 1. I call 
upon the people of the United States to recognize the vital role we can 
play in ending modern slavery and to observe this month with appropriate 
programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA

Promoting Excellence, Innovation, and Sustainability at Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, in order to advance the 
development of the Nation's full human potential and to advance equal 
opportunity in higher education, strengthen the capacity of historically 
black colleges and universities to provide the highest quality 
education, increase opportunities for these institutions to participate 
in and benefit from Federal programs, and ensure that our Nation has the 
highest proportion of college graduates in the world by the year 2020, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:

[[Page 194]]

Section 1. Policy. Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) 
have made historic and ongoing contributions to the general welfare and 
prosperity of our country. Established by visionary leaders, America's 
HBCUs, for over 150 years, have produced many of the Nation's leaders in 
business, government, academia, and the military and have provided 
generations of American men and women with hope and educational 
opportunity. The Nation's 105 HBCUs are located in 20 States, the 
District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and serve more than 
300,000 undergraduate and graduate students. These institutions continue 
to be important engines of economic growth and community service, and 
they are proven ladders of intergenerational advancement for men and 
women of all ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, especially 
African Americans. These institutions also produce a high number of 
baccalaureate recipients who go on to assume leadership and service 
roles in their communities and who successfully complete graduate and 
professional degree programs.
Sec. 2. White House Initiative on HBCUs.
    (a) Establishment. There is established the White House Initiative 
on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Initiative), to be 
housed in the Department of Education (Department).
    (b) Mission and Functions. The Initiative shall work with executive 
departments, agencies, and offices, the private sector, educational 
associations, philanthropic organizations, and other partners to 
increase the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education 
to a greater number of students, and to take advantage of these 
institutions' capabilities in serving the Nation's needs through five 
core tasks:

(i) strengthening the capacity of HBCUs to participate in Federal programs;

(ii) fostering enduring private-sector initiatives and public-private 
partnerships while promoting specific areas and centers of academic 
research and programmatic excellence throughout all HBCUs;

(iii) improving the availability, dissemination, and quality of information 
concerning HBCUs to inform public policy and practice;

(iv) sharing administrative and programmatic practices within the HBCU 
community for the benefit of all; and

(v) exploring new ways of improving the relationship between the Federal 
Government and HBCUs.

    (c) Administration. There shall be an Executive Director of the 
Initiative. The Department shall provide the staff, resources, and 
assistance for the Initiative, and shall assist the Initiative in 
fulfilling its mission and responsibilities under this order.
    (d) Federal Agency Plans. (1) Each executive department and agency 
designated by the Secretary of Education (Secretary) shall prepare an 
annual plan (agency plan) of its efforts to strengthen the capacity of 
HBCUs through increased participation in appropriate Federal programs 
and initiatives. Where appropriate, each agency plan shall address, 
among other things, the agency's proposed efforts to:

[[Page 195]]

  (i) establish how the department or agency intends to increase the 
capacity of HBCUs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or 
cooperative agreements and to encourage HBCUs to participate in Federal 
programs;

  (ii) identify Federal programs and initiatives in which HBCUs may be 
either underserved or underused as national resources, and improve HBCUs' 
participation therein; and

  (iii) encourage public-sector, private-sector, and community involvement 
in improving the overall capacity of HBCUs.

(2) Each department and agency, in its agency plan, shall provide 
appropriate measurable objectives and, after the first year, shall annually 
assess that department's or agency's performance on the goals set in the 
previous year's agency plan.

(3) The Secretary shall establish a date by which agency plans shall be 
submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary and the Executive Director shall 
review the agency plans in consultation with the President's Board of 
Advisors on HBCUs, established in section 3 of this order, and shall submit 
to the President an annual plan to strengthen the overall capacity of 
HBCUs.

(4) To help fulfill the objectives of these plans, the head of each 
department and agency identified by the Secretary shall provide, as 
appropriate, technical assistance and information to the Executive Director 
for purposes of communicating with HBCUs concerning program activities of 
the department or agency and the preparation of applications or proposals 
for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.

(5) To help fulfill the goals of this order, each executive department and 
agency identified by the Secretary shall appoint a senior official to 
report directly to the department or agency head with respect to that 
department's or agency's activities under this order, and to serve as 
liaison to the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs and to the 
Initiative.

    (e) Interagency Working Group. There is established the Interagency 
Working Group, which shall be convened by the Executive Director and 
that shall consist of representatives from agencies designated by the 
Secretary, to help advance and coordinate the work of Federal agencies 
pursuant to this order, where appropriate.
Sec. 3. President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs.
    (a) Establishment. There is established in the Department the 
President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (the Board). The Board shall consist of not more than 25 
members appointed by the President. The President shall designate one 
member of the Board to serve as Chair, who shall coordinate with the 
Executive Director to convene meetings and help direct the work of the 
Board. The Board shall include representatives of a variety of sectors, 
including philanthropy, education, business, finance, entrepreneurship, 
innovation, and private foundations, as well as sitting HBCU presidents.
    (b) Mission and Functions. Through the Initiative, the Board shall 
advise the President and the Secretary on all matters pertaining to 
strengthening the educational capacity of HBCUs. In particular, the 
Board shall advise the President and the Secretary in the following 
areas:

[[Page 196]]

(i) improving the identity, visibility, and distinctive capabilities and 
overall competitiveness of HBCUs;

(ii) engaging the philanthropic, business, government, military, homeland-
security, and education communities in a national dialogue regarding new 
HBCU programs and initiatives;

(iii) improving the ability of HBCUs to remain fiscally secure institutions 
that can assist the Nation in reaching its goal of having the highest 
proportion of college graduates by 2020;

(iv) elevating the public awareness of HBCUs; and

(v) encouraging public-private investments in HBCUs.

    (c) Administration. The Executive Director of the Initiative shall 
also serve as the Executive Director of the Board. The Department shall 
provide funding and administrative support for the Board to the extent 
permitted by law and within existing appropriations. Members of the 
Board shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for 
travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as 
authorized by law. Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as 
amended (5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the Board, any functions of the 
President under that Act, except for those of reporting to the Congress, 
shall be performed by the Secretary, in accordance with guidelines 
issued by the Administrator of General Services.
    (d) Report. As part of the annual report of the Initiative, the 
Board shall report to the President and the Secretary on their progress 
in carrying out its duties under this section.

provide information through the White House Initiative to the Board, 
consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the 
functions of the Board. Each executive department and agency shall bear 
its own expenses of participating in the Initiative.

head thereof; or

and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (f) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

National Export Initiative

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Export Enhancement 
Act of 1992, Public Law 102-429, 106 Stat. 2186, and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, in order to enhance and coordinate Federal 
efforts to facilitate the creation of jobs in the United States through 
the promotion of exports, and to ensure the effective use of Federal 
resources in support of these goals, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The economic and financial crisis has led to the loss 
of millions of U.S. jobs, and while the economy is beginning to show 
signs

[[Page 199]]

of recovery, millions of Americans remain unemployed or underemployed. 
Creating jobs in the United States and ensuring a return to sustainable 
economic growth is the top priority for my Administration. A critical 
component of stimulating economic growth in the United States is 
ensuring that U.S. businesses can actively participate in international 
markets by increasing their exports of goods, services, and agricultural 
products. Improved export performance will, in turn, create good high-
paying jobs.
The National Export Initiative (NEI) shall be an Administration 
initiative to improve conditions that directly affect the private 
sector's ability to export. The NEI will help meet my Administration's 
goal of doubling exports over the next 5 years by working to remove 
trade barriers abroad, by helping firms--especially small businesses--
overcome the hurdles to entering new export markets, by assisting with 
financing, and in general by pursuing a Government-wide approach to 
export advocacy abroad, among other steps.
Sec. 2. Export Promotion Cabinet. There is established an Export 
Promotion Cabinet to develop and coordinate the implementation of the 
NEI. The Export Promotion Cabinet shall consist of:
    (a) the Secretary of State;
    (b) the Secretary of the Treasury;
    (c) the Secretary of Agriculture;
    (d) the Secretary of Commerce;
    (e) the Secretary of Labor;
    (f) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
    (g) the United States Trade Representative;
    (h) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy;
    (i) the National Security Advisor;
    (j) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;
    (k) the President of the Export-Import Bank of the United States;
    (l) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
    (m) the President of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation;
    (n) the Director of the United States Trade and Development Agency; 
and
    (o) the heads of other executive branch departments, agencies, and 
offices as the President may, from time to time, designate.
The Export Promotion Cabinet shall meet periodically and report to the 
President on the progress of the NEI. A member of the Export Promotion 
Cabinet may designate, to perform the NEI-related functions of that 
member, a senior official from the member's department or agency who is 
a full-time officer or employee. The Export Promotion Cabinet may also 
establish subgroups consisting of its members or their designees, and, 
as appropriate, representatives of other departments and agencies. The 
Export Promotion Cabinet shall coordinate with the Trade Promotion 
Coordinating Committee (TPCC), established by Executive Order 12870 of 
September 30, 1993.
Sec. 3. National Export Initiative. The NEI shall address the following:

[[Page 200]]

    (a) Exports by Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Members of 
the Export Promotion Cabinet shall develop programs, in consultation 
with the TPCC, designed to enhance export assistance to SMEs, including 
programs that improve information and other technical assistance to 
first-time exporters and assist current exporters in identifying new 
export opportunities in international markets.
    (b) Federal Export Assistance. Members of the Export Promotion 
Cabinet, in consultation with the TPCC, shall promote Federal resources 
currently available to assist exports by U.S. companies.
    (c) Trade Missions. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with 
the TPCC and, to the extent possible, with State and local government 
officials and the private sector, shall ensure that U.S. Government-led 
trade missions effectively promote exports by U.S. companies.
    (d) Commercial Advocacy. Members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, in 
consultation with other departments and agencies and in coordination 
with the Advocacy Center at the Department of Commerce, shall take steps 
to ensure that the Federal Government's commercial advocacy effectively 
promotes exports by U.S. companies.
    (e) Increasing Export Credit. The President of the Export-Import 
Bank, in consultation with other members of the Export Promotion 
Cabinet, shall take steps to increase the availability of credit to 
SMEs.
    (f) Macroeconomic Rebalancing. The Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with other members of the Export Promotion Cabinet, shall 
promote balanced and strong growth in the global economy through the G20 
Financial Ministers' process or other appropriate mechanisms.
    (g) Reducing Barriers to Trade. The United States Trade 
Representative, in consultation with other members of the Export 
Promotion Cabinet, shall take steps to improve market access overseas 
for our manufacturers, farmers, and service providers by actively 
opening new markets, reducing significant trade barriers, and robustly 
enforcing our trade agreements.
    (h) Export Promotion of Services. Members of the Export Promotion 
Cabinet shall develop a framework for promoting services trade, 
including the necessary policy and export promotion tools.
Sec. 4. Report to the President. Not later than 180 days after the date 
of this order, the Export Promotion Cabinet, through the TPCC, shall 
provide the President a comprehensive plan to carry out the goals of the 
NEI. The Chairman of the TPCC shall set forth the steps taken to 
implement this plan in the annual report to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs of the House of Representatives required by the Export 
Enhancement Act of 1992, Public Law 102-249, 106 Stat. 2186, and 
Executive Order 12870, as amended.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal 
Government; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

[[Page 201]]

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13535 of March 24, 2010

Ensuring Enforcement and Implementation of Abortion Restrictions in the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the ``Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act'' (Public Law 111-148), I hereby order as 
follows:
Section. 1. Policy. Following the recent enactment of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ``Act''), it is necessary to 
establish an adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that Federal funds 
are not used for abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, 
or when the life of the woman would be endangered), consistent with a 
longstanding Federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the 
Hyde Amendment. The purpose of this order is to establish a 
comprehensive, Government-wide set of policies and procedures to achieve 
this goal and to make certain that all relevant actors--Federal 
officials, State officials (including insurance regulators) and health 
care providers--are aware of their responsibilities, new and old.
The Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion 
policy and extends those restrictions to the newly created health 
insurance exchanges. Under the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect 
conscience (such as the Church Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7, and the 
Weldon Amendment, section 508(d)(1) of Public Law 111-8) remain intact 
and new protections prohibit discrimination against health care 
facilities and health care providers because of an unwillingness to 
provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.
Numerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that these 
restrictions are enforced, including the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the 
Office of Personnel Management.
Sec. 2.  Strict Compliance with Prohibitions on Abortion Funding in 
Health Insurance Exchanges. The Act specifically prohibits the use of 
tax credits and cost-sharing reduction payments to pay for abortion 
services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the 
woman would be endangered) in the health insurance exchanges that will 
be operational in 2014.

[[Page 202]]

The Act also imposes strict payment and accounting requirements to 
ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services in exchange 
plans (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman 
would be endangered) and requires State health insurance commissioners 
to ensure that exchange plan funds are segregated by insurance companies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, OMB funds 
management circulars, and accounting guidance provided by the Government 
Accountability Office.
I hereby direct the Director of the OMB and the Secretary of HHS to 
develop, within 180 days of the date of this order, a model set of 
segregation guidelines for State health insurance commissioners to use 
when determining whether exchange plans are complying with the Act's 
segregation requirements, established in section 1303 of the Act, for 
enrollees receiving Federal financial assistance. The guidelines shall 
also offer technical information that States should follow to conduct 
independent regular audits of insurance companies that participate in 
the health insurance exchanges. In developing these model guidelines, 
the Director of the OMB and the Secretary of HHS shall consult with 
executive agencies and offices that have relevant expertise in 
accounting principles, including, but not limited to, the Department of 
the Treasury, and with the Government Accountability Office. Upon 
completion of those model guidelines, the Secretary of HHS should 
promptly initiate a rulemaking to issue regulations, which will have the 
force of law, to interpret the Act's segregation requirements, and shall 
provide guidance to State health insurance commissioners on how to 
comply with the model guidelines.
Sec. 3. Community Health Center Program. The Act establishes a new 
Community Health Center (CHC) Fund within HHS, which provides additional 
Federal funds for the community health center program. Existing law 
prohibits these centers from using Federal funds to provide abortion 
services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the 
woman would be endangered), as a result of both the Hyde Amendment and 
longstanding regulations containing the Hyde language. Under the Act, 
the Hyde language shall apply to the authorization and appropriations of 
funds for Community Health Centers under section 10503 and all other 
relevant provisions. I hereby direct the Secretary of HHS to ensure that 
program administrators and recipients of Federal funds are aware of and 
comply with the limitations on abortion services imposed on CHCs by 
existing law. Such actions should include, but are not limited to, 
updating Grant Policy Statements that accompany CHC grants and issuing 
new interpretive rules.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: (i) authority granted by law or 
Presidential directive to an agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) 
functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.
    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party

against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its 
officers, employees or agents, or any other person.

Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in 
Somalia

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 5 of 
the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) 
(UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that 
the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of 
violence in Somalia, and acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the 
coast of Somalia, which have repeatedly been the subject of United 
Nations Security Council resolutions (including Resolution 1844 of 
November 20, 2008; Resolution 1846 of December 2, 2008; Resolution 1851 
of December 16, 2008; and Resolution 1897 of November 30, 2009), and 
violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security 
Council in Resolution 733 of January 23, 1992, and elaborated upon and 
amended by subsequent resolutions (including Resolution 1356 of June 19, 
2001; Resolution 1725 of December 6, 2006; Resolution 1744 of February 
20, 2007; Resolution 1772 of August 20, 2007; Resolution 1816 of June 2, 
2008; and Resolution 1872 of May 26, 2009), constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with 
that threat.
I hereby order:
Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:

(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and

(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

  (A) to have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the 
peace, security, or stability of Somalia, including but not limited to:

    (1) acts that threaten the Djibouti Agreement of August 18, 
2008, or the political process; or

[[Page 204]]

    (2) acts that threaten the Transitional Federal Institutions, 
the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), or other 
international peacekeeping operations related to Somalia;

  (B) to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance to 
Somalia, or access to, or distribution of, humanitarian assistance in 
Somalia;

  (C) to have directly or indirectly supplied, sold, or transferred to 
Somalia, or to have been the recipient in the territory of Somalia of, arms 
or any related materiel, or any technical advice, training, or assistance, 
including financing and financial assistance, related to military 
activities;

  (D) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in 
support of, the activities described in subsections (a)(ii)(A), (a)(ii)(B), 
or (a)(ii)(C) of this section or any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order; or

  (E) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

    (b) I hereby determine that, among other threats to the peace, 
security, or stability of Somalia, acts of piracy or armed robbery at 
sea off the coast of Somalia threaten the peace, security, or stability 
of Somalia.
    (c) I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the 
type of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of 
any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to subsection (a) of this section would seriously impair my ability to 
deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby 
prohibit such donations as provided by subsection (a) of this section.
    (d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include but 
are not limited to:

(i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and

(ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.

    (e) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;

[[Page 205]]

    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;
    (d) the term ``Transitional Federal Institutions'' means the 
Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic adopted in February 
2004 and the Somali federal institutions established pursuant to such 
charter, and includes their agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled 
entities; and
    (e) the term ``African Union Mission in Somalia'' means the mission 
authorized by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1744 of 
February 20, 2007, and reauthorized in subsequent resolutions, and 
includes its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities.
Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, 
there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made 
pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA, as may be necessary to 
carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may 
redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of 
the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this 
order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine that circumstances 
no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property 
of a person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take necessary 
action to give effect to that determination.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

April 13, 2010.

Executive Order 13546 of July 2, 2010

Optimizing the Security of Biological Select Agents and Toxins in the 
United States

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States that:
    (a) A robust and productive scientific enterprise that utilizes 
biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) is essential to national 
security;
    (b) BSAT shall be secured in a manner appropriate to their risk of 
misuse, theft, loss, and accidental release; and
    (c) Security measures shall be taken in a coordinated manner that 
balances their efficacy with the need to minimize the adverse impact on 
the legitimate use of BSAT.
Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) ``Select Agent Program'' (SAP) means the 
regulatory oversight and administrative activities conducted by the 
Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture and the 
Attorney General to implement the Public Health Security and 
Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and the Agricultural 
Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002.
    (b) ``Select Agent Regulations'' (SAR) means the Federal regulations 
found in Part 73 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 
331 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and Part 121 of Title 
9 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (c) ``Biological Select Agents and Toxins'' means biological agents 
and toxins with the potential to pose a severe threat to public health 
and safety, animal and plant health, or animal and plant products and 
whose possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the Department of 
Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture under the 
SAR.
Sec. 3. Findings. (a) The use of BSAT presents the risk that BSAT might 
be lost, stolen, or diverted for malicious purpose. The SAP exists to 
provide effective regulatory oversight of the possession, use, and 
transfer of BSAT that reduces the risk of their misuse or mishandling. 
The absence of clearly defined, risk-based security measures in the SAR/
SAP has raised concern about the need for optimized security and for 
risk management.
    (b) In addition, variations in, and limited coordination of, 
individual executive departments' and agencies' oversight, security 
practices, and inspections have raised concerns that the cost and 
complexity of compliance for those who are registered to work with BSAT 
could discourage research or other legitimate activities.

[[Page 224]]

    (c) Understanding that research and laboratory work on BSAT is 
essential to both public health and national security, it is in the 
interest of the United States to address these issues.
Sec. 4. Risk-based Tiering of the Select Agent List. To help ensure that 
BSAT are secured according to level of risk, the Secretaries of Health 
and Human Services and Agriculture shall, through their ongoing review 
of the biological Select Agents and Toxins List (``Select Agent List'') 
contained in regulations, and no later than 18 months from the date of 
this order:
    (a) designate a subset of the Select Agent List (Tier 1) that 
presents the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with most significant 
potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, 
critical infrastructure, or public confidence;
    (b) explore options for graded protection of Tier 1 agents and 
toxins as described in subsection (a) of this section to permit tailored 
risk management practices based upon relevant contextual factors; and
    (c) consider reducing the overall number of agents and toxins on the 
Select Agent List.
Sec. 5. Revision of Regulations, Rules, and Guidance to Accommodate a 
Tiered Select Agent List. Consistent with section 4 of this order, I 
request that:
    (a) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, no 
later than 15 months from the date of this order, propose amendments to 
their respective parts of the SAR that would establish security 
standards specific to Tier 1 agents and toxins.
    (b) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture 
each, no later than 27 months from the date of this order, promulgate 
final rules and guidance that clearly articulate security actions for 
registrants who possess, use, or transfer Tier 1 agents and toxins.
Sec. 6. Coordination of Federal Oversight for BSAT Security. To ensure 
that the policies and practices used to secure BSAT are harmonized and 
that the related oversight activities of the Federal Government are 
coordinated, the heads of executive departments and agencies identified 
in section 7(a)(ii) of this order shall:
    (a) no later than 6 months from the date of this order, develop and 
implement a plan for the coordination of BSAT security oversight that:

(i) articulates a mechanism for coordinated and reciprocal inspection of 
and harmonized administrative practices for facilities registered with the 
SAP;

(ii) ensures consistent and timely identification and resolution of BSAT 
security and compliance issues;

(iii) facilitates information sharing among departments and agencies 
regarding ongoing oversight and inspection activities; and

(iv) provides for comprehensive and effective Federal oversight of BSAT 
security; and

    (b) no later than 6 months from the issuance of final rules and 
guidance as described in section 5 of this order, and annually 
thereafter, review for inconsistent requirements and revise or rescind, 
as appropriate, any regulations, directives, guidance, or policies 
regarding BSAT security within their

[[Page 225]]

department or agency that exceed those in the updated SAR and guidance 
as described in section 5 of this order.
Sec. 7. Implementation. (a) Establishment, Operation, and Functions of 
the Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel.

(i) There is hereby established, within the Department of Health and Human 
Services for administrative purposes only, the Federal Experts Security 
Advisory Panel (Panel), which shall make technical and substantive 
recommendations on BSAT security concerning the SAP.

(ii) The Panel shall consist of representatives from the following, who may

Executive Order 13547 of July 19, 2010

Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. The ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes provide 
jobs, food, energy resources, ecological services, recreation, and 
tourism opportunities, and play critical roles in our Nation's 
transportation, economy, and trade, as well as the global mobility of 
our Armed Forces and the maintenance of international peace and 
security. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and 
resulting environmental crisis is a stark reminder of how vulnerable our 
marine environments are, and how much communities and the Nation rely on 
healthy and resilient ocean and coastal ecosystems. America's 
stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes is 
intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability, human health and 
well-being, national prosperity, adaptation to climate and other 
environmental changes, social justice, international diplomacy, and 
national and homeland security.
This order adopts the recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy 
Task Force, except where otherwise provided in this order, and directs 
executive agencies to implement those recommendations under the guidance 
of a National Ocean Council. Based on those recommendations, this order 
establishes a national policy to ensure the protection, maintenance, and 
restoration of the health of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems 
and resources, enhance the sustainability of ocean and coastal 
economies, preserve our maritime heritage, support sustainable uses and 
access, provide for adaptive management to enhance our understanding of 
and capacity to respond to climate change and ocean acidification, and 
coordinate with our national security and foreign policy interests.
This order also provides for the development of coastal and marine 
spatial plans that build upon and improve existing Federal, State, 
tribal, local, and regional decisionmaking and planning processes. These 
regional plans will enable a more integrated, comprehensive, ecosystem-
based, flexible, and proactive approach to planning and managing 
sustainable multiple uses across sectors and improve the conservation of 
the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes.
Sec. 2. Policy. (a) To achieve an America whose stewardship ensures that 
the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes are healthy and resilient, 
safe and productive, and understood and treasured so as to promote the 
well-being, prosperity, and security of present and future generations, 
it is the policy of the United States to:

(i) protect, maintain, and restore the health and biological diversity of 
ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems and resources;

(ii) improve the resiliency of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems, 
communities, and economies;

(iii) bolster the conservation and sustainable uses of land in ways that 
will improve the health of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems;

[[Page 228]]

(iv) use the best available science and knowledge to inform decisions 
affecting the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes, and enhance 
humanity's capacity to understand, respond, and adapt to a changing global 
environment;

(v) support sustainable, safe, secure, and productive access to, and uses 
of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes;

(vi) respect and preserve our Nation's maritime heritage, including our 
social, cultural, recreational, and historical values;

(vii) exercise rights and jurisdiction and perform duties in accordance 
with applicable international law, including respect for and preservation 
of navigational rights and freedoms, which are essential for the global 
economy and international peace and security;

(viii) increase scientific understanding of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes 
ecosystems as part of the global interconnected systems of air, land, ice, 
and water, including their relationships to humans and their activities;

(ix) improve our understanding and awareness of changing environmental 
conditions, trends, and their causes, and of human activities taking place 
in ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters; and

(x) foster a public understanding of the value of the ocean, our coasts, 
and the Great Lakes to build a foundation for improved stewardship.

    (b) The United States shall promote this policy by:

(i) ensuring a comprehensive and collaborative framework for the 
stewardship of the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes that facilitates 
cohesive actions across the Federal Government, as well as participation of 
State, tribal, and local authorities, regional governance structures, 
nongovernmental organizations, the public, and the private sector;

(ii) cooperating and exercising leadership at the international level;

(iii) pursuing the United States' accession to the Law of the Sea 
Convention; and

(iv) supporting ocean stewardship in a fiscally responsible manner.

Sec. 3. Definitions. As used in this order:
    (a) ``Final Recommendations'' means the Final Recommendations of the 
Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force that shall be made publicly 
available and for which a notice of public availability shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The term ``coastal and marine spatial planning'' means a 
comprehensive, adaptive, integrated, ecosystem-based, and transparent 
spatial planning process, based on sound science, for analyzing current 
and anticipated uses of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes areas. Coastal 
and marine spatial planning identifies areas most suitable for various 
types or classes of activities in order to reduce conflicts among uses, 
reduce environmental impacts, facilitate compatible uses, and preserve 
critical ecosystem services to meet economic, environmental, security, 
and social objectives. In practical terms, coastal and marine spatial 
planning provides a public policy process for society to better 
determine how the ocean, our coasts, and Great Lakes are sustainably 
used and protected--now and for future generations.

[[Page 229]]

    (c) The term ``coastal and marine spatial plans'' means the plans 
that are certified by the National Ocean Council as developed in

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish the 
Federal Government as a model employer of individuals with disabilities, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Approximately 54 million Americans are living with a 
disability. The Federal Government has an important interest in reducing 
discrimination against Americans living with a disability, in 
eliminating the stigma associated with disability, and in encouraging 
Americans with disabilities to seek employment in the Federal workforce. 
Yet Americans with disabilities have an employment rate far lower than 
that of Americans without disabilities, and they are underrepresented in 
the Federal workforce. Individuals with disabilities currently represent 
just over 5 percent of the nearly 2.5 million people in the Federal 
workforce, and individuals with targeted disabilities (as defined below) 
currently represent less than 1 percent of that workforce.
    On July 26, 2000, in the final year of his administration, President 
Clinton signed Executive Order 13163, calling for an additional 100,000 
individuals with disabilities to be employed by the Federal Government 
over 5 years. Yet few steps were taken to implement that Executive Order 
in subsequent years.
    As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government must become 
a model for the employment of individuals with disabilities. Executive 
departments and agencies (agencies) must improve their efforts to employ 
workers with disabilities through increased recruitment, hiring, and 
retention of these individuals. My Administration is committed to 
increasing the number of individuals with disabilities in the Federal 
workforce through compliance with Executive Order 13163 and achievement 
of the goals set forth therein over 5 years, including specific goals 
for hiring individuals with targeted disabilities.
Sec. 2. Recruitment and Hiring of Individuals with Disabilities. (a) 
Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the 
Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget, shall design model recruitment 
and hiring strategies for agencies seeking to increase their employment 
of people with disabilities and develop mandatory training programs for 
both human resources personnel and hiring managers on the employment of 
individuals with disabilities.
    (b) Within 120 days of the date the Office of Personnel Management 
sets forth strategies and programs required under subsection (a), each 
agency shall develop an agency-specific plan for promoting employment 
opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The plan shall be 
developed in consultation with and, as appropriate, subject to approval 
by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget, and shall, consistent with law, 
include performance

[[Page 233]]

targets and numerical goals for employment of individuals with 
disabilities and sub-goals for employment of individuals with targeted 
disabilities.
    (c) Each agency shall designate a senior-level agency official to be 
accountable for enhancing employment opportunities for individuals with 
disabilities and individuals with targeted disabilities within the 
agency, consistent with law, and for meeting the goals of this order. 
This official, among other things, shall be accountable for developing 
and implementing the agency's plan under subsection (b), creating 
recruitment and training programs for employment of individuals with 
disabilities and targeted disabilities, and coordinating employment 
counseling to help match the career aspirations of individuals with 
disabilities to the needs of the agency.
    (d) In implementing their plans, agencies, to the extent permitted 
by law, shall increase utilization of the Federal Government's Schedule 
A excepted service hiring authority for persons with disabilities and 
increase participation of individuals with disabilities in internships, 
fellowships, and training and mentoring programs.
    (e) The Office of Personnel Management shall assist agencies with 
the implementation of their plans. The Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management, in consultation with the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, shall implement a system for reporting regularly 
to the President, the heads of agencies, and the public on agencies' 
progress in implementing their plans and the objectives of this order. 
The Office of Personnel Management, to the extent permitted by law, 
shall compile and post on its website Government-wide statistics on the 
hiring of individuals with disabilities.
Sec. 3. Increasing Agencies' Retention and Return to Work of Individuals 
with Disabilities. (a) The Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Chair of 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, shall identify and assist 
agencies in implementing strategies for retaining Federal workers with 
disabilities in Federal employment including, but not limited to, 
training, the use of centralized funds to provide reasonable 
accommodations, increasing access to appropriate accessible 
technologies, and ensuring the accessibility of physical and virtual 
workspaces.
    (b) Agencies shall make special efforts, to the extent permitted by 
law, to ensure the retention of those who are injured on the job. 
Agencies shall work to improve, expand, and increase successful return-
to-work outcomes for those of their employees who sustain work-related 
injuries and illnesses, as defined under the Federal Employees' 
Compensation Act (FECA), by increasing the availability of job 
accommodations and light or limited duty jobs, removing disincentives 
for FECA claimants to return to work, and taking other appropriate 
measures. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Director of 
the Office of Personnel Management, shall pursue innovative re-
employment strategies and develop policies, procedures, and structures 
that foster improved return-to-work outcomes, including by pursuing 
overall reform of the FECA system. The Secretary of Labor shall also 
propose specific outcome measures and targets by which each agency's 
progress in carrying out return-to-work and FECA claims processing 
efforts can be assessed.
Sec. 4. Definitions. (a) ``Disability'' shall be defined as set forth in 
the ADA Amendments Act of 2008.

[[Page 234]]

    (b) ``Targeted disability'' shall be defined as set forth on the 
form for self-identification of disability, Standard Form 256 (SF 256), 
issued by the Office of Personnel Management, or any replacements, 
updates, or revisions thereto.
    (c) Not less than 1 year after the date of this order and in 
consultation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the 
Department of Labor, and the Office of Management and Budget, the Office 
of Personnel Management shall review the effectiveness of the definition 
of targeted disability set forth in SF 256 and replace, update, or 
revise it as appropriate.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations, and shall not be 
construed to require any Federal employee to disclose disability status 
involuntarily.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Tribal, and Private Sector Entities

safeguarding of information shared with State, local, tribal, and 
private sector entities, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment and Policy.
Sec. 1.1. There is established a Classified National Security 
Information Program (Program) designed to safeguard and govern access to 
classified national security information shared by the Federal 
Government with State, local, tribal, and private sector (SLTPS) 
entities.
Sec. 1.2. The purpose of this order is to ensure that security standards 
governing access to and safeguarding of classified material are applied 
in accordance with Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009 
(``Classified National Security Information''), Executive Order 12968 of 
August 2, 1995, as amended (``Access to Classified Information''), 
Executive Order 13467 of June 30, 2008 (``Reforming Processes Related to 
Suitability for Government

[[Page 235]]

Employment, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access 
to Classified National Security Information''), and Executive Order 
12829 of January 6, 1993, as amended (``National Industrial Security 
Program''). Procedures for uniform implementation of these standards by 
SLTPS entities shall be set forth in an implementing directive to be 
issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security within 180 days of the date 
of this order, in consultation with affected executive departments and 
agencies (agencies), and with the concurrence of the Secretary of 
Defense, the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, 
and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.
Sec. 1.3. Additional policy provisions for access to and safeguarding of 
classified information shared with SLTPS personnel include the 
following:
    (a) Eligibility for access to classified information by SLTPS 
personnel shall be determined by a sponsoring agency. The level of 
access granted shall not exceed the Secret level, unless the sponsoring

demonstrated and foreseeable need for access to Top Secret, Special 
Access Program, or Sensitive Compartmented Information.
    (b) Upon the execution of a non-disclosure agreement prescribed by 
the Information Security Oversight Office or the Director of National 
Intelligence, and absent disqualifying conduct as determined by the 
clearance granting official, a duly elected or appointed Governor of a 
State or territory, or an official who has succeeded to that office 
under applicable law, may be granted access to classified information 
without a background investigation in accordance with the implementing 
directive for this order. This authorization of access may not be 
further delegated by the Governor to any other person.
    (c) All clearances granted to SLTPS personnel, as well as 
accreditations granted to SLTPS facilities without a waiver, shall be 
accepted reciprocally by all agencies and SLTPS entities.
    (d) Physical custody of classified information by State, local, and 
tribal (SLT) entities shall be limited to Secret information unless the 
location housing the information is under the full-time management, 
control, and operation of the Department of Homeland Security or another 
agency. A standard security agreement, established by the Department of 
Homeland Security in consultation with the SLTPS Advisory Committee, 
shall be executed between the head of the SLT entity and the U.S. 
Government for those locations where the SLT entity will maintain 
physical custody of classified information.
    (e) State, local, and tribal facilities where classified information 
is or will be used or stored shall be inspected, accredited, and 
monitored for compliance with established standards, in accordance with

    (g) Access to information systems that store, process, or transmit 
classified information shall be enforced by the rules established by the 
agency that controls the system and consistent with approved 
dissemination and handling markings applied by originators, separate 
from and in addition to criteria for determining eligibility for access 
to classified information. Access to information within restricted 
portals shall be based on criteria applied by the agency that controls 
the portal and consistent with approved dissemination and handling 
markings applied by originators.
    (h) The National Industrial Security Program established in 
Executive Order 12829, as amended, shall govern the access to and 
safeguarding of classified information that is released to contractors, 
licensees, and grantees of SLT entities.
    (i) All access eligibility determinations and facility security 
accreditations granted prior to the date of this order that do not meet 
the standards set forth in this order or its implementing directive 
shall be reconciled with those standards within a reasonable period.
    (j) Pursuant to section 4.1(i)(3) of Executive Order 13526, 
documents created prior to the effective date of Executive Order 13526 
shall not be re-disseminated to other entities without the consent of

waive this requirement for specific information that originated within 
that agency.

Security Advisor and in consultation with the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office, the Director of the Office of

practicable, make use of existing structures and authorities to preclude 
duplication and to ensure efficiency.
Sec. 3. SLTPS Policy Advisory Committee. (a) There is established an 
SLTPS Policy Advisory Committee (Committee) to discuss Program-related

situation in North Korea,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, hereby 
expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13466 of June 26, 2008, finding that the continued actions and policies 
of the Government of North Korea, manifested most recently by its 
unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea 
Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its 
announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its 
actions in violation of UNSCRs 1718 and 1874, including the procurement 
of luxury goods; and its illicit and deceptive activities in 
international markets through which it obtains financial and other 
support, including money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods and 
currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics trafficking, destabilize 
the Korean peninsula and imperil U.S. Armed Forces, allies, and trading

  (A) to have, directly or indirectly, imported, exported, or reexported

trafficking, or other illicit economic activity that involves or supports 
the Government of North Korea or any senior official thereof;

  (E) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial,

support of, the activities described in subsections (a)(ii)(A)-(D) of this

pursuant to this order;

for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or

subsections (a)(ii)(A)-(F) of this section.

    (b) I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the 
types of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit 
of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 and expanded in 
scope in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by 
subsection (a) of this section.
    (c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to:

(i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and

(ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.

    (d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. The provisions of Executive Order 13466 remain in effect, and 
this order does not affect any action taken pursuant to that order.
Sec. 4. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States

[[Page 244]]

or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States;
    (d) the term ``North Korea'' includes the territory of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of North Korea;
    (e) the term ``Government of North Korea'' means the Government of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, its agencies, 
instrumentalities, and controlled entities; and
    (f) the term ``luxury goods'' includes those items listed in 15 
C.F.R. 746.4(b)(l) and Supplement No. 1 to part 746 and similar items.
Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13466 and expanded in scope in this order, there need be no prior 
notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of 
this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA, as may be necessary to 
carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may 
redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of 
the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this 
order.
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine that circumstances 
no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property 
of a person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take necessary 
action to give effect to that determination.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, agents, or any other person.
Sec. 9. This order is effective at 12:01 p.m., eastern daylight time on 
August 30, 2010.

Executive Order 13554 of October 5, 2010

Establishing the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. The Gulf Coast is a national treasure. Its natural 
resources are an important economic engine for the entire United States; 
its waters sustain a diverse and vibrant ecosystem; and the Gulf's 
culture, natural beauty, and historic significance are unique. Each 
year, millions of tourists visit the Gulf to vacation, swim, boat, fish, 
hunt, and bird-watch; and, together, the Gulf's tourism and commercial 
and recreational fishing industries make a significant contribution to 
the United States economy. More than 90 percent of the Nation's offshore 
oil and gas is produced in the Gulf, and it is where nearly one-third of 
seafood production in the continental United States is harvested.
The United States needs a vibrant Gulf Coast, and the Federal Government 
is committed to helping Gulf Coast residents conserve and restore 
resilient and healthy ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding 
regions that support the diverse economies, communities, and cultures of 
the region. To effectively address the damage caused by the BP Deepwater 
Horizon Oil Spill, address the longstanding ecological decline, and 
begin moving toward a more resilient Gulf Coast ecosystem, ecosystem 
restoration is needed. Ecosystem restoration will support economic 
vitality, enhance human health and safety, protect infrastructure, 
enable communities to better withstand impact from storms and climate 
change, sustain safe seafood and clean water, provide recreational and 
cultural opportunities, protect and preserve sites that are of 
historical and cultural significance, and contribute to the overall 
resilience of our coastal communities and Nation.
In order to achieve these objectives, it is necessary that Federal 
efforts be efficiently integrated with those of local stakeholders and 
that particular focus be given to innovative solutions and complex, 
large-scale restoration projects. Efforts must be science-based and 
well-coordinated to minimize duplication and ensure effective delivery 
of services. This order establishes a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration 
Task Force to coordinate intergovernmental responsibilities, planning, 
and exchange of information so as to better implement Gulf Coast 
ecosystem restoration and to facilitate appropriate accountability and 
support throughout the restoration process.
Sec. 2. Establishment of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task 
Force. There is established the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task 
Force (Task Force).
    (a) The Task Force shall consist of:

(1) A senior official from each of the following executive departments, 
agencies, and offices, selected by the head of the respective department, 
agency, or office:

  a. the Department of Defense;

  b. the Department of Justice;

  c. the Department of the Interior;

[[Page 259]]

  d. the Department of Agriculture;

recommendation of the Governors of each Gulf State, who shall be elected 
officers of State governments (or their designated employees with authority 
to act on their behalf) acting in their official capacities.

    (b) The Task Force may include representatives from affected tribes, 
who shall be elected officers of those tribes (or their designated 
employees with authority to act on their behalf) acting in their 
official capacities. The Task Force shall, in collaboration with 
affected tribes, determine an appropriate structure for tribal 
participation in matters within the scope of the Task Force's 
responsibilities.
    (c) The President shall designate a Chair of the Task Force from 
among senior officials of executive departments, agencies, and offices 
represented on the Task Force. The Chair shall lead the coordination of 
intergovernmental Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration efforts and oversee 
the work of the Task Force. The Chair shall regularly convene and 
preside at meetings of the Task Force, determine its agenda, and direct 
its work. The Chair's duties shall also include:

(1) facilitating a smooth transition from the response phase of addressing 
the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill to the restoration phase;

(2) communicating and engaging with States, tribes, local governments, 
other stakeholders in the Gulf Coast region, and the public on ecosystem 
restoration, as well as other aspects of Gulf recovery, including economic 
recovery and public health efforts; and

(3) coordinating the efforts of executive departments, agencies, and 
offices related to the functions of the Task Force.

    (d) Representatives of the Gulf States under subsection (a)(2) of 
this section shall select from among themselves a Vice-Chair of the Task 
Force.
Sec. 3. Functions of the Task Force. The Task Force shall be an advisory 
body to:
    (a) coordinate intergovernmental efforts to improve efficiency and 
effectiveness in the implementation of Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration 
actions;
    (b) support the Natural Resource Damage Assessment process by 
referring potential ecosystem restoration actions to the Natural 
Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council for consideration and 
facilitating coordination among the relevant departments, agencies, and 
offices, as appropriate, subject to the independent statutory 
responsibilities of the trustees;

[[Page 260]]

    (c) present to the President a Gulf of Mexico Regional Ecosystem 
Restoration Strategy (Strategy) as provided in section 4 of this order;
    (d) engage local stakeholders, communities, the public, and other 
officials throughout the Gulf Coast region to ensure that they have an 
opportunity to share their needs and viewpoints to inform the work of 
the Task Force, including the development of the Strategy;
    (e) provide leadership and coordination of research needs in support 
of ecosystem restoration planning and decisionmaking in the Gulf Coast 
region, and work with existing Federal and State advisory committees, as

the goals of Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration, as outlined in the 
Strategy;
    (g) communicate with affected tribes in a manner consistent with

coordination with Indian tribal governments; and
    (h) coordinate with relevant executive departments, agencies, and 
offices on ways to encourage health and economic benefits associated 
with proposed ecosystem restoration actions.
Sec. 4. Gulf of Mexico Regional Ecosystem Restoration Strategy. (a) 
Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Task Force shall prepare a 
Strategy that proposes a Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration agenda, 
including goals for ecosystem restoration, development of a set of 
performance indicators to track progress, and means of coordinating 
intergovernmental restoration efforts guided by shared priorities. In 
developing the Strategy, the Task Force shall:

(1) define ecosystem restoration goals and describe milestones for making 
progress toward attainment of those goals;

(2) consider existing research and ecosystem restoration planning efforts 
in the region, including initiatives undertaken by the National Ocean 
Council and the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task 
Force (Gulf Hypoxia Task Force), in order to identify planning and 
restoration needs and ways under existing authorities to address those 
needs;

(3) identify major policy areas where coordinated intergovernmental action 
is necessary;

(4) propose new programs or actions to implement elements of the Strategy 
where existing authorities are not sufficient;

(5) identify monitoring, research, and scientific assessments needed to 
support decisionmaking for ecosystem restoration efforts and evaluate 
existing monitoring programs and gaps in current data collection; and

(6) describe the circumstances under which termination of the Task Force 
would be appropriate.

    (b) The executive departments, agencies, and offices enumerated in 
section 2(a)(1) of this order shall, to the extent permitted by law, 
consider ways to align their relevant programs and authorities with the 
Strategy.

[[Page 261]]

Sec. 5. Administration. (a) The Task Force shall have a staff, headed by 
an Executive Director, which shall provide support for the functions of 
the Task Force.
    (b) The Executive Director shall be selected by the Chair and shall 
supervise, direct, and be accountable for the administration and 
operation of the Task Force.
    (c) The Departments of Commerce (through the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration), the Interior (through the Fish and Wildlife 
Service), and Justice shall identify linkages and opportunities for the 
Task Force to complement the restoration progress of the Natural 
Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council.
    (d) At the request of the Chair, executive departments and agencies, 
including the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Energy, 
and Homeland Security, the Small Business Administration, and the 
National Science Foundation, shall serve in an advisory role to the Task 
Force on issues within their expertise.
    (e) The Task Force may establish such technical working groups as 
necessary to support its function. These working groups may include 
additional representatives from State and tribal governments, as 
appropriate, to provide for greater collaboration.
    (f) The first meeting of the Task Force shall be held within 90 days 
of the date of this order.
Sec. 6. Definitions. (a) ``Affected tribe'' means any Indian tribe,

Executive Order 13555 of October 19, 2010

White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, to restore the country to its role 
as the global leader in education, to strengthen the Nation by expanding 
educational opportunities and improving educational outcomes for 
Hispanics and Latinos (Hispanics) of all ages, and to help ensure that 
all Hispanics receive an education that properly prepares them for 
college, productive careers, and satisfying lives, it is hereby ordered 
as follows:

[[Page 263]]

Section 1. Policy. At more than 52 million strong, including 4 million 
in Puerto Rico, Hispanics constitute the country's largest and fastest 
growing minority group. They have had a profound and positive impact on 
our country through, among other things, their community's strong 
commitment to family, faith, hard work, and service. Many Hispanics 
contribute to this Nation bilingually in the English and Spanish 
languages--a true asset for our country in an increasingly global, 
interdependent world.
Hispanic students are the largest minority group in our Nation's 
schools, numbering more than 11 million in our public elementary and 
secondary school system, and constituting more than 22 percent of all 
pre-K-12 students. Hispanic students face educational challenges of 
crisis proportions. Fewer than half of all Hispanic children participate 
in early childhood education programs, and far too few Hispanic students 
graduate from high school; of those who do complete high school, many 
are not adequately prepared for college. Only 12 percent of adult 
Hispanics have a bachelor's degree, and just 3 percent have completed 
graduate or professional degree programs. At the same time, large 
numbers of Hispanic adults lack the education or literacy skills they 
need to advance their careers; they also are less likely than members of 
other groups to have taken job- or career-related courses, with the 
exception of basic education classes, such as English as a second 
language.
Our country was built on and continues to thrive on its diversity, and 
there is no doubt that the future of the United States is inextricably 
linked to the future of the Hispanic community. To reach the ambitious 
education goals we have set for our Nation, as well as to ensure 
equality of opportunity for all, we must provide the opportunities that 
will enable Hispanic students to raise their educational attainment at 
every level of the American education system. America's future 
competitiveness in our global economy will be substantially enhanced by 
improving educational outcomes for Hispanics.
Sec. 2. White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics.
    (a) Establishment. There is established the White House Initiative 
on Educational Excellence for Hispanics (Initiative), to be housed in 
the Department of Education (Department). The mission of the Initiative 
shall be to help restore the United States to its role as the global 
leader in education and to strengthen the Nation by expanding 
educational opportunities and improving educational outcomes for 
Hispanics of all ages and by helping to ensure that all Hispanics 
receive a complete and competitive education that prepares them for 
college, a career, and productive and satisfying lives.
    (b) Initiative Administration. There shall be an Executive Director 
of the Initiative, to be appointed by the Secretary of Education 
(Secretary). The Initiative shall be advised by the Commission 
established under section 3 of this order and supported by the Working 
Group established under subsection (c) of this section. The Department 
shall provide the staff, resources, and assistance for the Initiative 
and the Working Group. To the extent permitted by law, departments, 
agencies, and offices represented on the Working Group shall provide 
resources, including personnel detailed to the Initiative, to assist the 
Department in meeting the objectives of this order.
    (c) Interagency Working Group.

[[Page 264]]

(1) There is established the Federal Interagency Working Group on 
Educational Excellence for Hispanics (Working Group), which shall be 
convened and chaired by the Initiative's Executive Director.

(2) The Working Group shall consist of senior officials from the 
Department, the White House Domestic Policy Council, the Department of 
Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as such 
additional departments, agencies, and offices as the President may 
designate. Senior officials shall be designated by the heads of their 
respective departments, agencies, and offices.

(3) The Initiative's Executive Director may establish subgroups of the 
Working Group to focus on different aspects of the educational system or 
educational challenges facing Hispanics, such as early childhood education, 
K-12 education, higher education, career and technical education, language 
acquisition, and adult education.

    (d) Initiative Objectives.

(1) To expand educational opportunities, improve education outcomes, and 
deliver a complete and competitive education for all Hispanics, the 
Initiative shall, consistent with law, promote, encourage, and undertake 
efforts designed to meet the following objectives:

  (i) increasing general understanding of the causes of the educational 
challenges faced by Hispanic students;

  (ii) increasing the percentage of Hispanic children who enter 
kindergarten ready for success by improving access by Hispanics to high-
quality programs and services that encourage the early learning and 
development of children from birth through age 5;

  (iii) implementing successful and innovative education reform strategies 
and practices in America's public schools to ensure that Hispanic students, 
like their peers, receive a rigorous and well-rounded education, and have 
access to student support services that will prepare them for college, a 
career, and civic participation;

  (iv) ensuring that all Hispanic students have access to excellent 
teachers and school leaders, in part by supporting efforts to improve the 
recruitment, preparation, development, and retention of successful Hispanic 
teachers and school leaders and other effective teachers and school leaders 
responsible for the education of Hispanic students;

  (v) reducing the dropout rate of Hispanic students and helping Hispanic 
students graduate from high school prepared for college and a career, in 
part by promoting a positive school climate and supporting successful and 
innovative dropout prevention and recovery strategies that better engage 
Hispanic youths in their learning, help them catch up academically, and 
provide those who have left the educational system with pathways to 
reentry;

  (vi) increasing college access and success for Hispanic students and 
providing support to help ensure that a greater percentage of Hispanics 
complete college and contribute to the goal of having America again lead 
the world in the proportion of college graduates by 2020, in part through 
strategies to strengthen the capacity of Hispanic-Serving Institutions, 
community colleges, and other institutions of higher education serving 
large numbers of Hispanic students; and

[[Page 265]]

  (vii) enhancing the educational and life opportunities of Hispanics by 
fostering positive family and community engagement, improving the quality 
of, and expanding access to, adult education, literacy, and career and 
technical education, as well as increasing opportunities for education and 
career advancement in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics.

(2) In working to fulfill its mission and objectives, the Initiative shall, 
consistent with law:

  (i) help ensure that Federal programs and initiatives administered by the 
Department and other agencies are serving and meeting the needs of Hispanic 
children, youths, and adults;

  (ii) work closely with the Executive Office of the President on key 
Administration priorities related to the education of Hispanics;

  (iii) increase the Hispanic community's participation in, and capacity to 
participate in, the Department's programs and education-related programs at 
other executive departments and agencies;

  (iv) advise Department officials and, through the Working Group, other 
agency officials on issues related to the Hispanic community and the 
educational attainment of Hispanic students;

  (v) advise the Secretary on the development, implementation, and 
coordination of educational programs and initiatives at the Department and 
other agencies designed to improve educational opportunities and outcomes 
for Hispanics of all ages;

  (vi) encourage and develop partnerships with public, private, 
philanthropic, and nonprofit stakeholders to improve Hispanics' readiness 
for school, college, and career, as well as their college persistence and 
completion; and

  (vii) develop a national network of individuals, organizations, and 
communities to share and implement best practices related to the education 
of Hispanics.

(3) The Initiative shall periodically publish reports on its activities. 
The Secretary and the Executive Director of the Initiative, in consultation 
with the Interagency Working Group and the Chair of the Commission 
established under section 3 of this order, may develop and submit to the 
President recommendations designed to advance and promote educational 
opportunities and attainment for Hispanics, including recommendations for 
short- and long-term initiatives.

    (e) Collaboration Among White House Initiatives. The White House 
Initiatives on Educational Excellence for Hispanics, Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Asian-
American and Pacific Islanders shall work together whenever appropriate 
in light of their shared objectives.
Sec. 3. President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for 
Hispanics. There is established the President's Advisory Commission on 
Educational Excellence for Hispanics (Commission) in the Department.
    (a) Commission Mission and Scope. The Commission shall advise the 
President and the Secretary on matters pertaining to the educational 
attainment of the Hispanic community, including:

[[Page 266]]

initiatives at the Department and other agencies to improve educational 
opportunities and outcomes for Hispanics of all ages;

(2) increasing the participation of the Hispanic community and Hispanic-
Serving Institutions in the Department's programs and in education programs 
at other agencies;

(3) engaging the philanthropic, business, nonprofit, and education 
communities in a national dialogue regarding the mission and objectives of 
this order; and

may work through task forces composed exclusively of Commission members, 
as appropriate.
    (b) Commission Membership and Chair.

(1) The Commission shall consist of no more than 30 members appointed by 
the President. The Commission may include individuals with relevant 
experience or subject matter expertise that the President deems

Executive Order 13556 of November 4, 2010

Controlled Unclassified Information

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. This order establishes an open and uniform program 
for managing information that requires safeguarding or dissemination 
controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and 
Government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under 
Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009, or the Atomic Energy Act, as 
amended.
At present, executive departments and agencies (agencies) employ ad hoc, 
agency-specific policies, procedures, and markings to safeguard and 
control this information, such as information that involves privacy, 
security, proprietary business interests, and law enforcement 
investigations. This inefficient, confusing patchwork has resulted in 
inconsistent marking and safeguarding of documents, led to unclear or 
unnecessarily restrictive dissemination policies, and created 
impediments to authorized information sharing. The fact that these 
agency-specific policies are often hidden from public view has only 
aggravated these issues.
To address these problems, this order establishes a program for managing 
this information, hereinafter described as Controlled Unclassified 
Information, that emphasizes the openness and uniformity of Government-
wide practice.
Sec. 2. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).
    (a) The CUI categories and subcategories shall serve as exclusive 
designations for identifying unclassified information throughout the 
executive branch that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls, 
pursuant to and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and 
Government-wide policies.
    (b) The mere fact that information is designated as CUI shall not 
have a bearing on determinations pursuant to any law requiring the 
disclosure of information or permitting disclosure as a matter of 
discretion, including disclosures to the legislative or judicial 
branches.
    (c) The National Archives and Records Administration shall serve as 
the Executive Agent to implement this order and oversee agency actions 
to ensure compliance with this order.
Sec. 3. Review of Current Designations.
    (a) Each agency head shall, within 180 days of the date of this 
order:

[[Page 268]]

(1) review all categories, subcategories, and markings used by the agency 
to designate unclassified information for safeguarding or dissemination 
controls; and

(2) submit to the Executive Agent a catalogue of proposed categories and 
subcategories of CUI, and proposed associated markings for information 
designated as CUI under section 2(a) of this order. This submission shall 
provide definitions for each proposed category and subcategory and identify 
the basis in law, regulation, or Government-wide policy for safeguarding or 
dissemination controls.

    (b) If there is significant doubt about whether information should 
be designated as CUI, it shall not be so designated.
Sec. 4. Development of CUI Categories and Policies.
    (a) On the basis of the submissions under section 3 of this order or 
future proposals, and in consultation with affected agencies, the 
Executive Agent shall, in a timely manner, approve categories and 
subcategories of CUI and associated markings to be applied uniformly 
throughout the executive branch and to become effective upon publication 
in the registry established under subsection (d) of this section. No 
unclassified information meeting the requirements of section 2(a) of 
this order shall be disapproved for inclusion as CUI, but the Executive 
Agent may resolve conflicts among categories and subcategories of CUI to 
achieve uniformity and may determine the markings to be used.
    (b) The Executive Agent, in consultation with affected agencies, 
shall develop and issue such directives as are necessary to implement 
this order. Such directives shall be made available to the public and 
shall provide policies and procedures concerning marking, safeguarding, 
dissemination, and decontrol of CUI that, to the extent practicable and 
permitted by law, regulation, and Government-wide policies, shall remain 
consistent across categories and subcategories of CUI and throughout the 
executive branch. In developing such directives, appropriate 
consideration should be given to the report of the interagency Task 
Force on Controlled Unclassified Information published in August 2009. 
The Executive Agent shall issue initial directives for the 
implementation of this order within 180 days of the date of this order.
    (c) The Executive Agent shall convene and chair interagency meetings 
to discuss matters pertaining to the program established by this order.
    (d) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Executive Agent 
shall establish and maintain a public CUI registry reflecting authorized 
CUI categories and subcategories, associated markings, and applicable 
safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol procedures.
    (e) If the Executive Agent and an agency cannot reach agreement on 
an issue related to the implementation of this order, that issue may be 
appealed to the President through the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget.
    (f) In performing its functions under this order, the Executive 
Agent, in accordance with applicable law, shall consult with 
representatives of the public and State, local, tribal, and private 
sector partners on matters related to approving categories and 
subcategories of CUI and developing implementing directives issued by 
the Executive Agent pursuant to this order.
Sec. 5. Implementation.

[[Page 269]]

    (a) Within 180 days of the issuance of initial policies and 
procedures by the Executive Agent in accordance with section 4(b) of 
this order, each agency that originates or handles CUI shall provide the 
Executive Agent with a proposed plan for compliance with the 
requirements of this order, including the establishment of interim 
target dates.
    (b) After a review of agency plans, and in consultation with 
affected agencies and the Office of Management and Budget, the Executive 
Agent shall establish deadlines for phased implementation by agencies.
    (c) In each of the first 5 years following the date of this order 
and biennially thereafter, the Executive Agent shall publish a report on 
the status of agency implementation of this order.
Sec. 6. General Provisions.
    (a) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with:

(1) applicable law, including protections of confidentiality and privacy 
rights;

(2) the statutory authority of the heads of agencies, including authorities 
related to the protection of information provided by the private sector to 
the Federal Government; and

(3) applicable Government-wide standards and guidelines issued by the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology, and applicable policies 
established by the Office of Management and Budget.

    (b) The Director of National Intelligence (Director), with respect 
to the Intelligence Community and after consultation with the heads of 
affected agencies, may issue such policy directives and guidelines as 
the Director deems necessary to implement this order with respect to 
intelligence and intelligence-related information. Procedures or other 
guidance issued by Intelligence Community element heads shall be in 
accordance with such policy directives or guidelines issued by the 
Director. Any such policy directives or guidelines issued by the 
Director shall be in accordance with this order and directives issued by 
the Executive Agent.
    (c) This order shall not be construed to impair or otherwise affect 
the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, and legislative proposals.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
    (e) This order shall be implemented subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
    (f) The Attorney General, upon request by the head of an agency or 
the Executive Agent, shall render an interpretation of this order with 
respect to any question arising in the course of its administration.

    (d) All organizations that receive Federal financial assistance 
under social service programs should be prohibited from discriminating 
against beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of the social service 
programs on the basis of religion or religious belief. Accordingly, 
organizations, in providing services supported in whole or in part with 
Federal financial assistance, and in their outreach activities related 
to such services, should not be allowed to discriminate against current 
or prospective program beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a 
religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to 
attend or participate in a religious practice.
    (e) The Federal Government must implement Federal programs in 
accordance with the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of 
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as other 
applicable law, and must monitor and enforce standards regarding the 
relationship between religion and government in ways that avoid 
excessive entanglement between religious bodies and governmental 
entities.
    (f) Organizations that engage in explicitly religious activities 
(including activities that involve overt religious content such as 
worship, religious instruction, or proselytization) must perform such 
activities and offer such services outside of programs that are 
supported with direct Federal financial assistance (including through 
prime awards or sub-awards), separately in time or location from any 
such programs or services supported with direct Federal financial 
assistance, and participation in any such explicitly religious 
activities must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of the social service 
program supported with such Federal financial assistance.
    (g) Faith-based organizations should be eligible to compete for 
Federal financial assistance used to support social service programs and 
to participate fully in the social service programs supported with 
Federal financial assistance without impairing their independence, 
autonomy, expression outside the programs in question, or religious 
character. Accordingly, a faith-based organization that applies for, or 
participates in, a social service program supported with Federal 
financial assistance may retain its independence and may continue to 
carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, 
and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use 
direct Federal financial assistance that it receives (including through 
a prime award or sub-award) to support or engage in any explicitly 
religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious 
content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), or 
in any other manner prohibited by law. Among other things, faith-based 
organizations that receive Federal financial assistance may use their 
facilities to provide social services supported with Federal financial 
assistance, without removing or altering religious art, icons, 
scriptures, or other symbols from these facilities. In addition, a 
faith-based organization that applies for, or participates in, a social 
service program supported with Federal financial assistance may retain 
religious terms in its name, select its board members on a religious 
basis, and include religious references in its

[[Page 275]]

organization's mission statements and other chartering or governing 
documents.
    (h) Each agency responsible for administering or awarding Federal 
financial assistance for social service programs shall offer protections 
for beneficiaries of such programs pursuant to the following principles:

(i) Referral to an Alternative Provider. If a beneficiary or prospective 
beneficiary of a social service program supported by Federal financial 
assistance objects to the religious character of an organization that 
provides services under the program, that organization shall, within a 
reasonable time after the date of the objection, refer the beneficiary to 
an alternative provider.

(ii) Agency Responsibilities. Each agency responsible for administering a 
social service program or supporting a social service program with Federal 
financial assistance shall establish policies and procedures designed to 
ensure that (1) appropriate and timely referrals are made to an alternative 
provider; (2) all referrals are made in a manner consistent with all 
applicable privacy laws and regulations; (3) the organization subject to 
subsection (h)(i) notifies the agency of any referral; (4) such 
organization has established a process for determining whether the 
beneficiary has contacted the alternative provider; and (5) each 
beneficiary of a social service program receives written notice of the 
protections set forth in this subsection prior to enrolling in or receiving 
services from such program.

    (i) To promote transparency and accountability, agencies that 
provide Federal financial assistance for social service programs shall 
post online, in an easily accessible manner, regulations, guidance 
documents, and policies that reflect or elaborate upon the fundamental 
principles described in this section. Agencies shall also post online a 
list of entities that receive Federal financial assistance for provision 
of social service programs, consistent with law and pursuant to guidance 
set forth in paragraph (c) of section 3 of this order.
    (j) Decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be 
free from political interference or even the appearance of such 
interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of 
the religious affiliation of a recipient organization or lack 
thereof.'';
    (c) by striking section 3, and inserting in lieu thereof the 
following:

``Sec. 3. Ensuring Uniform Implementation Across the Federal Government.
In order to promote uniformity in agencies' policies that have 
implications for faith-based and other neighborhood organizations and in 
related guidance, and to ensure that those policies and guidance are 
consistent with the fundamental principles set forth in section 2 of 
this order, there is established an Interagency Working Group on Faith-
Based and Other Neighborhood Partnerships (Working Group).
    (a) Mission and Function of the Working Group. The Working Group 
shall meet periodically to review and evaluate existing agency 
regulations, guidance documents, and policies that have implications for 
faith-based and other neighborhood organizations. Where appropriate, 
specified agency heads shall, to the extent permitted by law, amend all 
such existing policies of their respective agencies to ensure that they 
are consistent with the fundamental principles set forth in section 2 of 
this order.

[[Page 276]]

    (b) Uniform Agency Implementation. Within 120 days of the date of 
this order, the Working Group shall submit a report to the President on 
amendments, changes, or additions that are necessary to ensure that 
regulations and guidance documents associated with the distribution of 
Federal financial assistance for social service programs are consistent 
with the fundamental principles set forth in section 2 of this order. 
The Working Group's report should include, but not be limited to, a 
model set of regulations and guidance documents for agencies to adopt in 
the following areas:
    (i) prohibited uses of direct Federal financial assistance and 
separation requirements; (ii) protections for religious identity; (iii) 
the distinction between ``direct'' and ``indirect'' Federal financial 
assistance; (iv) protections for beneficiaries of social service 
programs; (v) transparency requirements, consistent with and in 
furtherance of existing open government initiatives; (vi) obligations of 
nongovernmental and governmental intermediaries; (vii) instructions for 
peer reviewers and those who recruit peer reviewers; and (viii) training 
on these matters for government employees and for Federal, State, and 
local governmental and nongovernmental organizations that receive 
Federal financial assistance under social service programs. In 
developing this report and in reviewing agency regulations and guidance 
for consistency with section 2 of this order, the Working Group shall 
consult the March 2010 report and recommendations prepared by the 
President's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood 
Partnerships on the topic of reforming the Office of Faith-Based and 
Neighborhood Partnerships.
    (c) Guidance. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), following receipt of a copy of the report of the Working Group, 
and in coordination with the Department of Justice, shall issue guidance 
to agencies on the implementation of this order, including in particular 
subsections 2(h)-(j).
    (d) Membership of the Working Group. The Director of the Office of 
Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships and a senior official from the 
OMB designated by the Director of the OMB shall serve as the Co-Chairs 
of the Working Group. The Co-Chairs shall convene regular meetings of 
the Working Group, determine its agenda, and direct its work. In 
addition to the Co-Chairs, the Working Group shall consist of a senior 
official with knowledge of policies that have implications for faith-
based and other neighborhood organizations from the following agencies 
and offices:

(i) the Department of State;

(ii) the Department of Justice;

(iii) the Department of the Interior;

(iv) the Department of Agriculture;

(v) the Department of Commerce;

(vi) the Department of Labor;

(vii) the Department of Health and Human Services;

(xiii) the Small Business Administration;

(xiv) the United States Agency for International Development;

(xv) the Corporation for National and Community Service; and

(xvi) other agencies and offices as the President, from time to time, may 
designate.

    (e) Administration of the Initiative. The Department of Health and 
Human Services shall provide funding and administrative support for the 
Working Group to the extent permitted by law and within existing 
appropriations.''; and
    (d) by striking in the title, preamble, and section 1(c), 
``community'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``other neighborhood''.
Sec. 2. General Provisions.
    (a) This order amends the requirements contained in Executive Order 
13279. This order supplements, but does not supersede, the requirements 
contained in Executive Orders 13198 and 13199 of January 29, 2001, and 
Executive Order 13498 of February 5, 2009.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13562 of December 27, 2010

Recruiting and Hiring Students and Recent Graduates

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 
of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The Federal Government benefits from a diverse 
workforce that includes students and recent graduates, who infuse the 
workplace with their enthusiasm, talents, and unique perspectives. The 
existing competitive hiring process for the Federal civil service, 
however, is structured in a manner that, even at the entry level, favors 
job applicants who have significant previous work experience. This 
structure, along with the complexity of the rules governing admission to 
the career civil service, creates a barrier to recruiting and hiring 
students and recent graduates. It places the Federal Government at a 
competitive disadvantage compared to private-sector employers when it 
comes to hiring qualified applicants for entry-level positions.
To compete effectively for students and recent graduates, the Federal 
Government must improve its recruiting efforts; offer clear paths to 
Federal internships for students from high school through post-graduate 
school; offer clear paths to civil service careers for recent graduates; 
and provide meaningful training, mentoring, and career-development 
opportunities. Further, exposing students and recent graduates to 
Federal jobs through internships and similar programs attracts them to 
careers in the Federal Government and enables agency employers to 
evaluate them on the job to determine whether they are likely to have 
successful careers in Government.
Accordingly, pursuant to my authority under 5 U.S.C. 3302(1), and in 
order to achieve a workforce that represents all segments of society as 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), I find that conditions of good 
administration (specifically, the need to promote employment 
opportunities for students and recent graduates in the Federal 
workforce) make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules 
for certain positions in the Federal civil service.
Sec. 2. Establishment. There are hereby established the Internship 
Program and the Recent Graduates Program, which, along with the 
Presidential Management Fellows Program, as modified herein, shall 
collectively be known as the Pathways Programs. I therefore direct the 
Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue 
regulations implementing the Pathways Programs consistent with this 
order, including:
    (a) a description of the positions that executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) may fill through the Pathways Programs because 
conditions of good administration necessitate excepting those positions 
from the competitive hiring rules;
    (b) rules governing whether, to what extent, and in what manner 
public notice should be provided of job opportunities in the Pathways 
Programs;
    (c) a description of career-development, training, and mentorship 
opportunities for participants in the Pathways Programs;

[[Page 292]]

    (d) requirements that managers meaningfully assess the performance 
of participants in the Pathways Programs to identify those who should be 
considered for conversion to career civil service positions;
    (e) a description of OPM oversight of agency use of the Pathways 
Programs to ensure that (i) they serve as a supplement to, and not a 
substitute for, the competitive hiring process, and (ii) agencies are 
using the Pathways Programs in a genuine effort to develop talent for 
careers in the civil service;
    (f) a description of OPM plans to evaluate agencies' effectiveness 
in recruiting and retaining talent using the Pathways Programs and of 
the satisfaction of Pathways Programs participants and their hiring 
managers; and
    (g) standard naming conventions across agencies, so that students 
and recent graduates can clearly understand and compare the career 
pathway opportunities available to them in the Federal Government.
Sec. 3. Internship Program. The Internship Program shall provide 
students in high schools, community colleges, 4-year colleges, trade 
schools, career and technical education programs, and other qualifying 
educational institutions and programs, as determined by OPM, with paid 
opportunities to work in agencies and explore Federal careers while 
still in school. The Internship Program would replace the existing 
Student Career Experience Program, established pursuant to Executive 
Order 12015 of October 26, 1977. The following principles and policies 
shall govern the Internship Program:
    (a) Participants in the program shall be referred to as ``Interns'' 
and shall be students enrolled, or accepted for enrollment, in 
qualifying educational institutions and programs, as determined by OPM.
    (b) Subject to any exceptions OPM may establish by regulation, 
agencies shall provide Interns with meaningful developmental work and 
set clear expectations regarding the work experience of the intern.
    (c) Students employed by third-party internship providers but placed 
in agencies may, to the extent permitted by OPM regulations, be treated 
as participants in the Internship Program.
Sec. 4. Recent Graduates Program. The Recent Graduates Program shall 
provide individuals who have recently graduated from qualifying 
educational institutions or programs with developmental experiences in 
the Federal Government intended to promote possible careers in the civil 
service. The following principles and policies shall govern the Recent 
Graduates Program:
    (a) Participants in the program shall be referred to as ``Recent 
Graduates'' and must have obtained a qualifying degree, or completed a 
qualifying career or technical education program, as determined by OPM, 
within the preceding 2 years, except that veterans who, due to their 
military service obligation, were precluded from participating in the 
Recent Graduates Program during the 2-year period after obtaining a 
qualifying degree or completing a qualifying program shall be eligible 
to participate in the Program within 6 years of obtaining a qualifying 
degree or completing a qualifying program.
    (b) Responsibilities assigned to a Recent Graduate shall be 
consistent with his or her qualifications, educational background, and 
career interests, the purpose of the Recent Graduates Program, and 
agency needs.

[[Page 293]]

Sec. 5. Presidential Management Fellows Program. The Presidential 
Management Fellows (PMF) Program is an existing program established 
pursuant to Executive Order 13318 of November 21, 2003, that aims to 
attract to the Federal service outstanding men and women from a variety 
of academic disciplines at the graduate level who have a clear interest 
in, and commitment to, the leadership and management of public policies 
and programs. The following requirements shall govern the PMF Program 
upon the revocation of Executive Order 13318, as provided in section 8 
of this order:
    (a) Participants in this program shall continue to be known as 
Presidential Management Fellows (PMFs or Fellows) and must have 
received, within the preceding 2 years, a qualifying advanced degree, as 
determined by OPM.
    (b) Responsibilities assigned to a PMF shall be consistent with the 
PMF's qualifications, educational background, and career interests, the 
purposes of the PMF Program, and agency needs.
    (c) OPM shall establish the eligibility requirements and minimum 
qualifications for the program, as well as a process for assessing 
eligible individuals for consideration for appointment as PMFs.
Sec. 6. Appointment and Conversion. (a) Appointments to any of the 
Pathways Programs shall be under Schedule D of the excepted service, as 
established by section 7 of this order.
    (b) Appointments to the Recent Graduates or PMF Programs shall not 
exceed 2 years, unless extended by the employing agency for up to 120 
days thereafter.
    (c) Appointment to a Pathways Program shall confer no right to 
further Federal employment in either the competitive or excepted service 
upon the expiration of the appointment, except that agencies may convert 
eligible participants noncompetitively to term, career, or career 
conditional appointments after satisfying requirements to be established 
by OPM, and agencies may noncompetitively convert participants who were 
initially converted to a term appointment under this section to a career 
or career-conditional appointment before the term appointment expires.

5 CFR Part 6
[squf] PART 6--[AMENDED]
Sec. 7. Implementation. (a) Civil Service Rule VI is amended as follows:

(i) 5 CFR 6.1(a) is amended to read:

  OPM may except positions from the competitive service when it determines 
that (A) appointments thereto through competitive examination are not 
practicable, or (B) recruitment from among students attending qualifying 
educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed 
qualifying educational programs can better be achieved by devising 
additional means for recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from 
the processes generally applicable to the competitive service. These 
positions shall be listed in OPM's annual report for the fiscal year in 
which the exceptions are made.

(ii) 5 CFR 6.2 is amended to read:

[[Page 294]]

  OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in 
Schedules A, B, C, and D, which schedules shall constitute parts of this 
rule, as follows:

    Schedule A. Positions other than those of a confidential or 
policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to 
examine shall be listed in Schedule A.
    Schedule B. Positions other than those of a confidential or 
policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to 
hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B. 
Appointments to these positions shall be subject to such 
noncompetitive examination as may be prescribed by OPM.
    Schedule C. Positions of a confidential or policy-determining 
character shall be listed in Schedule C.
    Schedule D. Positions other than those of a confidential or 
policy-determining character for which the competitive service 
requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of 
sufficient numbers of students attending qualifying educational 
institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying 
educational programs. These positions, which are temporarily 
placed in the excepted service to enable more effective 
recruitment from all segments of society by using means of 
recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the rules 
generally applicable to the competitive service, shall be listed 
in Schedule D.

(iii) The first sentence of 5 CFR 6.4 is amended to read:

  Except as may be required by statute, the Civil Service Rules and 
Regulations shall not apply to removals from positions listed in Schedules 
A, C, or D or from positions excepted from the competitive service by 
statute.

The second sentence of 5 CFR 6.4 is to remain unchanged.

(iv) The first sentence of 5 CFR 6.6 is amended to read:

  OPM may remove any position from or may revoke in whole or in part any 
provision of Schedule A, B, C, or D.

The second sentence of 5 CFR 6.6 is to remain unchanged.

    (b) The Director of OPM shall:

(i) promulgate such regulations as the Director determines may be necessary 
to implement this order;

(ii) provide oversight of the Pathways Programs;

(iii) establish, if appropriate, a Government-wide cap on the number of 
noncompetitive conversions to the competitive service of Interns, Recent 
Graduates, or PMFs (or a Government-wide combined conversion cap applicable 
to all three categories together);

(iv) administer, and review and revise annually or as needed, any 
Government-wide cap established pursuant to this subsection;

(v) provide guidance on conducting an orderly transition from existing 
student and internship programs to the Pathways Programs established 
pursuant to this order; and

[[Page 295]]

(vi) consider for publication in the Federal Register at an appropriate 
time a proposed rule seeking public comment on the elimination of the

Memorandum of January 20, 2010

Addressing Tax Delinquency by Government Contractors

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The Federal Government pays more than half a trillion dollars a year to 
contractors and has an important obligation to protect American taxpayer 
money and the integrity of the Federal acquisition process. Yet reports 
by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) state that Federal 
contracts are awarded to tens of thousands of companies with serious tax 
delinquencies. The total amount in unpaid taxes owed by these 
contracting companies is estimated to be more than $5 billion.
Too often, Federal contracting officials do not have the most basic 
information they need to make informed judgments about whether a company 
trying to win a Federal contract is delinquent in paying its taxes. We 
need to give our contracting officials the tools they need to protect 
taxpayer dollars.
Accordingly, I hereby direct the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
(Commissioner) to direct a review of certifications of non-delinquency 
in taxes that companies bidding for Federal contracts are required to 
submit pursuant to a 2008 amendment to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation. I further direct that the Commissioner report to me within 
90 days on the overall accuracy of contractors' certifications.
I also direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, 
working with the Secretary of the Treasury and other agency heads, to 
evaluate

[[Page 298]]

practices of contracting officers and debarring officials in response to 
contractors' certifications of serious tax delinquencies and to provide 
me, within 90 days, recommendations on process improvements to ensure 
these contractors are not awarded new contracts, including a plan to 
make contractor certifications available in a Government-wide database, 
as is already being done with other information on contractors.
Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of 
this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum is not 
intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or 
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the 
United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized 
and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of January 20, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt 
the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures 
adopted on that date and on August 20, 1998, to deal with that emergency 
must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2010. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process.

Memorandum of January 29, 2010

Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future

Memorandum for the Secretary of Energy
Expanding our Nation's capacity to generate clean nuclear energy is 
crucial to our ability to combat climate change, enhance energy 
security, and increase economic prosperity. My Administration is 
undertaking substantial steps to expand the safe, secure, and 
responsible use of nuclear energy. These efforts are critical to 
accomplishing many of my Administration's most significant goals.
An important part of a sound, comprehensive, and long-term domestic 
nuclear energy strategy is a well-considered policy for managing used 
nuclear fuel and other aspects of the back end of the nuclear fuel 
cycle. Yet the Nation's approach, developed more than 20 years ago, to 
managing materials derived from nuclear activities, including nuclear 
fuel and nuclear waste, has not proven effective. Fortunately, over the 
past two decades scientists and engineers in our country and abroad have 
learned a great deal about effective strategies for managing nuclear 
material. My Administration is committed to using this advanced 
knowledge to meet the Government's obligation to dispose of our Nation's 
used nuclear material.
Accordingly, I request that you establish a Blue Ribbon Commission on 
America's Nuclear Future (Commission) and appoint its members. Those 
members should include recognized representatives and experts from a 
range of disciplines and with a range of perspectives, and may include 
participation of appropriate Federal officials. The Commission's 
business should be conducted in an open and transparent manner.
The Commission should conduct a comprehensive review of policies for 
managing the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, including all 
alternatives for the storage, processing, and disposal of civilian and 
defense used nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. This review should include 
an evaluation of advanced fuel cycle technologies that would optimize 
energy recovery, resource utilization, and the minimization of materials 
derived from nuclear activities in a manner consistent with U.S. 
nonproliferation goals.
In performing its functions, the Commission should consider a broad 
range of technological and policy alternatives, and should analyze the 
scientific, environmental, budgetary, economic, financial, and 
management issues, among others, surrounding each alternative it 
considers. Where appropriate, the Commission may also identify potential 
statutory changes.
The Commission should provide an interim report to you within 18 months 
of the date of this memorandum, and that report should be made available 
for public comment. The Commission should provide a final report to you

[[Page 300]]

within 24 months of the date of this memorandum. The Department of 
Energy shall provide funding and administrative support for the 
Commission, as you determine appropriate, so that it can complete its 
functions within these time periods. Additionally, all executive 
departments and agencies shall provide such information and assistance 
to the Commission as you or the Commission may request for purposes of 
carrying out the Commission's functions, to the extent permitted by law. 
Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to require the disclosure 
of classified, proprietary, law enforcement sensitive, or other 
information protected under governing law. This memorandum shall be 
implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the 
availability of appropriations. This memorandum is not intended to, and 
does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, 
its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or 
agents, or any other person.
You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in 
or in Relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire

On February 7, 2006, by Executive Order 13396, the President declared a 
national emergency, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire and ordered related measures blocking the property 
of certain persons contributing to the conflict in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire. 
The situation in or in relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, which has been 
addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1572 of 
November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, has resulted in the 
massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread human rights abuses, 
significant political violence and unrest, and fatal attacks against 
international peacekeeping forces. Because the situation in or in 
relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on February 7, 2006, and 
the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must 
continue in effect beyond February 7, 2010. Therefore, in accordance 
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13396.

Memorandum of February 3, 2010

A Comprehensive Federal Strategy on Carbon Capture and Storage

Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the 
Treasury[,] the Attorney General[,] the Secretary of the Interior[,] the 
Secretary of Agriculture[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary 
of Labor[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of 
Energy[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency[,] the Chairman of 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission[,] the Director of the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy[, and] the Chair of the Council on 
Environmental Quality
For decades, the coal industry has supported quality high-paying jobs 
for American workers, and coal has provided an important domestic source 
of reliable, affordable energy. At the same time, coal-fired power 
plants are the largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and 
coal accounts for 40 percent of global emissions. Charting a path toward 
clean coal is essential to achieving my Administration's goals of 
providing clean energy, supporting American jobs, and reducing emissions 
of carbon pollution. Rapid commercial development and deployment of 
clean coal technologies, particularly carbon capture and storage (CCS), 
will help position the United States as a leader in the global clean 
energy race.
My Administration is already pursuing a set of concrete initiatives to 
speed the commercial development of safe, affordable, and broadly 
deployable CCS technologies. We have made the largest Government 
investment in carbon capture and storage of any nation in history, and 
these investments are being matched by private capital. The Department 
of Energy is conducting a comprehensive clean coal technology program 
including research, development, and demonstration of CCS technologies 
and is pursuing important international cooperative initiatives to spur 
demonstration and deployment of CCS. The Environmental Protection Agency 
is developing regulations that address the safety, efficacy, and 
environmental soundness of injecting and storing carbon dioxide 
underground. The Department of the Interior is assessing, in 
coordination with the Department of Energy, the country's geologic 
capacity to store carbon dioxide and promoting geological storage 
demonstration projects on public lands. All of this work builds on the 
firm scientific basis that now exists for the viability of CCS 
technology.
To further this work and develop a comprehensive and coordinated Federal 
strategy to speed the commercial development and deployment of clean 
coal technologies, I hereby establish an Interagency Task Force on 
Carbon Capture and Storage (Task Force). You shall each designate a 
senior official from your respective agency to serve on the Task Force, 
which shall be Co-

[[Page 302]]

Chaired by the designees from the Department of Energy and the 
Environmental Protection Agency.
The Task Force shall develop within 180 days of the date of this 
memorandum a proposed plan to overcome the barriers to the widespread, 
cost-effective deployment of CCS within 10 years, with a goal of 
bringing 5 to 10 commercial demonstration projects online by 2016. The 
plan should explore incentives for commercial CCS adoption and address 
any financial, economic, technological, legal, institutional, social, or 
other barriers to deployment. The Task Force should consider how best to 
coordinate existing administrative authorities and programs, including 
those that build international collaboration on CCS, as well as identify 
areas where additional administrative authority may be necessary. The 
Co-Chairs shall report progress periodically to the President through 
the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality.
Ultimately, comprehensive energy and climate legislation that puts a cap 
on carbon pollution will provide the largest incentive for CCS because 
it will create stable, long-term, market-based incentives to channel 
private investment in low-carbon technologies. My Administration's new 
CCS strategy will pave the way for this energy transition by identifying 
and removing barriers to rapid commercial deployment and by providing 
greater legal and regulatory clarity. This will help to spur private 
investment in CCS in the near term--investment that will create good 
jobs and benefit communities.
This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations. This memorandum is not 
intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or 
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the 
United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Secretary of Energy is hereby authorized and directed to publish 
this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of February 9, 2010

Establishing a Task Force on Childhood Obesity

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Across our country, childhood obesity has reached epidemic rates and, as 
a result, our children may live shorter lives than their parents. 
Obesity has been recognized as a problem for decades, but efforts to 
address this crisis to date have been insufficient. My Administration is 
committed to redoubling our efforts to solve the problem of childhood 
obesity within a generation through a comprehensive approach that builds 
on effective strategies, engages families and communities, and mobilizes 
both public and private sector resources.
Nearly one third of children in America are overweight or obese--a rate 
that has tripled in adolescents and more than doubled in younger 
children since 1980. One third of all individuals born in the year 2000 
or later will eventually suffer from diabetes over the course of their 
lifetime, while too many others will face chronic obesity-related health 
problems such as heart

[[Page 304]]

disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and asthma. Without effective 
intervention, many more children will endure serious illnesses that will 
put a strain on our health-care system. We must act now to improve the 
health of our Nation's children and avoid spending billions of dollars 
treating preventable disease.
Therefore, I have set a goal to solve the problem of childhood obesity 
within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at 
a healthy weight. The First Lady will lead a national public awareness 
effort to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity. She will encourage 
involvement by actors from every sector--the public, nonprofit, and 
private sectors, as well as parents and youth--to help support and 
amplify the work of the Federal Government in improving the health of 
our children. But to meet our goal, we must accelerate implementation of 
successful strategies that will prevent and combat obesity. Such 
strategies include updating child nutrition policies in a way that 
addresses the best available scientific information, ensuring access to 
healthy, affordable food in schools and communities, as well as 
increasing physical activity and empowering parents and caregivers with 
the information and tools they need to make good choices for themselves 
and their families. To succeed, these efforts must be strategically 
targeted, and accountability should be clear. They will help our 
children develop lifelong healthy habits, ensuring they reach their 
greatest potential toward building a healthier and more prosperous 
America. To these ends, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. Establishment of the Task Force on Childhood Obesity. There 
is established a Task Force on Childhood Obesity (Task Force) to develop 
an interagency action plan to solve the problem of obesity among our 
Nation's children within a generation. The Assistant to the President 
for Domestic Policy shall serve as Chair of the Task Force.
    (a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Chair, the Task 
Force shall consist of the following members, or any senior official 
designated by one of the following members who is a part of the member's 
department, agency, or office, and who is a full time officer or 
employee of the Federal Government:

(1) the Secretary of the Interior;

(2) the Secretary of Agriculture;

(3) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;

(4) the Secretary of Education;

(5) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;

(6) the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to the First Lady;

(7) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and

(8) the heads of other executive departments, agencies, or offices as the 
Chair may designate.

    At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish 
subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their 
designees under this section, as appropriate.
    (b) Administration of the Task Force. The Department of Health and 
Human Services shall provide funding and administrative support for the

[[Page 305]]

Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing 
appropriations.
Sec. 2. Mission and Functions of the Task Force. The Task Force shall 
work across executive departments and agencies to develop a coordinated 
Federal response while also identifying nongovernmental actions that can 
be taken to solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation. 
The functions of the Task Force are advisory only and shall include, but 
are not limited to, making recommendations to meet the following 
objectives:
    (a) ensuring access to healthy, affordable food;
    (b) increasing physical activity in schools and communities;
    (c) providing healthier food in schools; and
    (d) empowering parents with information and tools to make good 
choices for themselves and their families.
Sec. 3. Interagency Action Plan. Within 90 days of the date of this 
memorandum, the Task Force shall develop and submit to the President a 
comprehensive interagency plan that:
    (a) details a coordinated strategy by executive departments and 
agencies to meet the objectives of the Task Force and identifies areas 
for reform to ensure complementary efforts and avoid duplication, both 
across the Federal Government and between other public or 
nongovernmental actors;
    (b) includes comprehensive, multi-sectoral strategies from each 
member executive department, agency, or office and describes the status 
and scope of its efforts to achieve this goal;
    (c) identifies key benchmarks and provides for regular measurement, 
assessment, and reporting of executive branch efforts to combat 
childhood obesity;
    (d) describes a coordinated action plan for identifying relevant 
evidence gaps and conducting or facilitating needed research to fill 
those gaps;
    (e) assists in the assessment and development of legislative, 
budgetary, and policy proposals that can improve the health and well-
being of children, their families, and communities; and
    (f) describes potential areas of collaboration with other public or 
nongovernmental actors, taking into consideration the types of 
implementation or research objectives the Federal Government, other 
public actors, or nongovernmental actors may be particularly well-
situated to accomplish.
Sec. 4. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives set out in this 
memorandum, the Task Force, in accordance with applicable law, and in 
addition to regular meetings, shall conduct outreach with 
representatives of private and nonprofit organizations, State, tribal 
and local authorities, and other interested persons that can assist with 
the Task Force's development of a detailed set of recommendations to 
solve the problem of childhood obesity.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) The heads of executive departments and 
agencies shall assist and provide information to the Task Force, 
consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the 
functions of the Task Force. Each executive department, agency, and 
office shall bear its own expense for participating in the Task Force.

[[Page 306]]

    (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by 
Proclamation 7757, the national emergency was extended and its scope was 
expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. 
The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the 
use of excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may engage 
in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. And the 
unauthorized entry of any U.S.-registered vessel into Cuban territorial 
waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United 
States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national 
emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to 
the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in 
Proclamation 6867 as amended by Proclamation 7757.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a 
national emergency and blocked the property of persons undermining 
democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). He 
took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other 
persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. 
These actions and policies have contributed to the deliberate breakdown 
in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and 
intimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability 
in the southern African region.
On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13288 by ordering the blocking of the property of 
additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Zimbabwe.
On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which 
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288 and ordered the blocking of the property of additional persons 
undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 
2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 
6, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions.

Memorandum of March 10, 2010

Finding and Recapturing Improper Payments

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to reducing payment errors and 
eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs--a commitment 
reflected in Executive Order 13520 of November 20, 2009, Reducing 
Improper Payments. Executive departments and agencies should use every 
tool available to identify and subsequently reclaim the funds associated 
with improper payments. Thorough identification of improper payments 
promotes accountability at executive departments and agencies; it also 
makes the integrity of Federal spending transparent to taxpayers. 
Reclaiming the funds associated with improper payments is a critical 
component of the proper stewardship and protection of taxpayer dollars, 
and it underscores that waste, fraud, and abuse by entities receiving 
Federal payments will not be tolerated.
Today, to further intensify efforts to reclaim improper payments, my 
Administration is expanding the use of ``Payment Recapture Audits,'' 
which have proven to be effective mechanisms for detecting and 
recapturing payment errors. A Payment Recapture Audit is a process of 
identifying improper payments paid to contractors or other entities 
whereby highly skilled accounting specialists and fraud examiners use 
state-of-the-art tools and technology to examine payment records and 
uncover such problems as duplicate payments, payments for services not 
rendered, overpayments, and fictitious vendors. (A Payment Recapture 
Audit as used in this memorandum shall have the same meaning as the term 
``recovery audit'' as defined in Appendix C to Office of Management and 
Budget Circular A-123.) One approach that has worked effectively is 
using professional and specialized auditors on a contingency basis, with 
their compensation tied to the identification of misspent funds.
Therefore, I hereby direct executive departments and agencies to expand 
their use of Payment Recapture Audits, to the extent permitted by law 
and where cost-effective. The Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) shall develop guidance within 90 days of the date of this 
memorandum on actions executive departments and agencies must take to 
carry out the requirements of this memorandum. The guidance may require 
additional actions and strategies designed to improve the recapture of 
improper payments, including, as appropriate, agency-specific targets 
for increasing recoveries. The Director of the OMB shall further 
coordinate with the Council for Inspectors General on Integrity and 
Efficiency to identify an appropriate process for obtaining review by 
Inspectors General of the effectiveness of agency efforts under this 
memorandum. The agencies' expanded use of Payment Recapture Audits does 
not preclude Offices of Inspectors General from performing any 
activities to identify and prevent improper payments.
Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to require the disclosure 
of classified information, law enforcement sensitive information, or 
other information that must be protected in the interests of national 
security.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any

party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish 
this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of March 10, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued 
Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, the President issued 
Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.

[[Page 310]]

Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2009. This notice shall 
be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Combating Noncompliance With Recovery Act Reporting Requirements

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to transparency in tracking recovery 
dollars and to elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse by recipients of 
hard-earned taxpayer dollars. Executive departments and agencies 
(agencies) should use every means available to: (1) identify every prime 
recipient under an obligation to file a report on FederalReporting.gov 
arising from its receipt of American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 
2009 (Recovery Act) funds; and (2) to ensure that every such recipient 
has filed a report. Any prime recipient that has failed to report is not 
living up to the standards set by my Administration and must be held 
accountable by all agencies to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our 
efforts to ensure timely, comprehensive, and accurate recipient 
reporting must succeed if we are to effectively meet the transparency 
and accountability objectives of the Recovery Act.
Therefore, I hereby direct agencies to further intensify their efforts 
to improve reporting compliance by prime recipients of Recovery Act 
funds, wherever authorized and appropriate, by terminating awards; 
pursuing measures such as suspension and debarment; reclaiming funds; 
and considering, initiating, and implementing punitive actions. In 
addition, agencies shall intensify efforts to timely report the 
identities of noncompliant prime recipients to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) and specify to the OMB the detailed actions they have 
taken to respond to each instance of noncompliance. The Director of the 
OMB shall, within 30 days of the

[[Page 311]]

date of this memorandum, review current OMB guidance concerning agency 
responsibilities for addressing noncompliance with Recovery Act 
reporting requirements and, where appropriate, update that guidance with 
actions agencies should take to carry out the requirements of this 
memorandum. The guidance may include additional agency actions and 
strategies designed to improve prime recipient reporting compliance and 
the potential recapture of funds from noncompliant prime recipients.
Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to require the disclosure 
of classified information, law enforcement sensitive information, or 
other information that must be protected in the interests of national 
security or is otherwise protected from disclosure by law.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by

Memorandum of April 15, 2010

Respecting the Rights of Hospital Patients To Receive Visitors and To 
Designate Surrogate Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies

Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services
There are few moments in our lives that call for greater compassion and 
companionship than when a loved one is admitted to the hospital. In 
these hours of need and moments of pain and anxiety, all of us would 
hope to have a hand to hold, a shoulder on which to lean--a loved one to 
be there for us, as we would be there for them.
Yet every day, all across America, patients are denied the kindnesses 
and caring of a loved one at their sides--whether in a sudden medical 
emergency or a prolonged hospital stay. Often, a widow or widower with 
no children is denied the support and comfort of a good friend. Members 
of religious orders are sometimes unable to choose someone other than an 
immediate family member to visit them and make medical decisions on 
their behalf. Also uniquely affected are gay and lesbian Americans who 
are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may 
have spent decades of their lives--unable to be there for the person 
they love, and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is 
incapacitated.
For all of these Americans, the failure to have their wishes respected 
concerning who may visit them or make medical decisions on their behalf 
has real consequences. It means that doctors and nurses do not always 
have the best information about patients' medications and medical 
histories and that friends and certain family members are unable to 
serve as intermediaries to help communicate patients' needs. It means 
that a stressful and at times terrifying experience for patients is 
senselessly compounded by indignity and unfairness. And it means that 
all too often, people are made to suffer or even to pass away alone, 
denied the comfort of companionship in their final moments while a loved 
one is left worrying and pacing down the hall.
Many States have taken steps to try to put an end to these problems. 
North Carolina recently amended its Patients' Bill of Rights to give 
each patient ``the right to designate visitors who shall receive the 
same visitation privileges as the patient's immediate family members, 
regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the 
patient''--a right that applies in every hospital in the State. 
Delaware, Nebraska, and Minnesota have adopted similar laws.
My Administration can expand on these important steps to ensure that 
patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment during their 
hospital stays. By this memorandum, I request that you take the 
following steps:
1. Initiate appropriate rulemaking, pursuant to your authority under 42 
U.S.C. 1395x and other relevant provisions of law, to ensure that 
hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid respect the rights of 
patients to designate visitors. It should be made clear that designated 
visitors, including individuals designated by legally valid advance 
directives (such as durable powers of attorney and health care proxies), 
should enjoy visitation privileges that are no more restrictive than 
those that immediate family

[[Page 314]]

members enjoy. You should also provide that participating hospitals may 
not deny visitation privileges on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
disability. The rulemaking should take into account the need for 
hospitals to restrict visitation in medically appropriate circumstances 
as well as the clinical decisions that medical professionals make about 
a patient's care or treatment.
2. Ensure that all hospitals participating in Medicare or Medicaid are 
in full compliance with regulations, codified at 42 CFR 482.13 and 42 
CFR 489.102(a), promulgated to guarantee that all patients' advance 
directives, such as durable powers of attorney and health care proxies, 
are respected, and that patients' representatives otherwise have the 
right to make informed decisions regarding patients' care. Additionally, 
I request that you issue new guidelines, pursuant to your authority 
under 42 U.S.C. 1395cc and other relevant provisions of law, and provide 
technical assistance on how hospitals participating in Medicare or 
Medicaid can best comply with the regulations and take any additional 
appropriate measures to fully enforce the regulations.
3. Provide additional recommendations to me, within 180 days of the date 
of this memorandum, on actions the Department of Health and Human 
Services can take to address hospital visitation, medical 
decisionmaking, or other health care issues that affect LGBT patients 
and their families.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

Memorandum of April 16, 2010

A 21st Century Strategy for America's Great Outdoors

Memorandum for for the Secretary of the Interior[,] the Secretary of 
Agriculture[,] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency[, and] the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality
Americans are blessed with a vast and varied natural heritage. From 
mountains to deserts and from sea to shining sea, America's great 
outdoors have shaped the rugged independence and sense of community that 
define the American spirit. Our working landscapes, cultural sites, 
parks, coasts, wild lands, rivers, and streams are gifts that we have 
inherited from previous generations. They are the places that offer us 
refuge from daily demands, renew our spirits, and enhance our fondest 
memories, whether they are fishing with a grandchild in a favorite spot, 
hiking a trail with a friend,

[[Page 315]]

or enjoying a family picnic in a neighborhood park. They also are our 
farms, ranches, and forests--the working lands that have fed and 
sustained us for generations. Americans take pride in these places, and 
share a responsibility to preserve them for our children and 
grandchildren.
Today, however, we are losing touch with too many of the places and 
proud traditions that have helped to make America special. Farms, 
ranches, forests, and other valuable natural resources are disappearing 
at an alarming rate. Families are spending less time together enjoying 
their natural surroundings. Despite our conservation efforts, too many 
of our fields are becoming fragmented, too many of our rivers and 
streams are becoming polluted, and we are losing our connection to the 
parks, wild places, and open spaces we grew up with and cherish. 
Children, especially, are spending less time outside running and 
playing, fishing and hunting, and connecting to the outdoors just down 
the street or outside of town.
Across America, communities are uniting to protect the places they love, 
and developing new approaches to saving and enjoying the outdoors. They 
are bringing together farmers and ranchers, land trusts, recreation and 
conservation groups, sportsmen, community park groups, governments and 
industry, and people from all over the country to develop new 
partnerships and innovative programs to protect and restore our outdoors 
legacy. However, these efforts are often scattered and sometimes 
insufficient. The Federal Government, the Nation's largest land manager, 
has a responsibility to engage with these partners to help develop a 
conservation agenda worthy of the 21st Century. We must look to the 
private sector and nonprofit organizations, as well as towns, cities, 
and States, and the people who live and work in them, to identify the 
places that mean the most to Americans, and leverage the support of the 
Federal Government to help these community-driven efforts to succeed. 
Through these partnerships, we will work to connect these outdoor spaces 
to each other, and to reconnect Americans to them.
For these reasons, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment.
    (a) There is established the America's Great Outdoors Initiative 
(Initiative), to be led by the Secretaries of the Interior and 
Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and 
implemented in coordination with the agencies listed in section 2(b) of 
this memorandum. The Initiative may include the heads of other executive 
branch departments, agencies, and offices (agencies) as the President 
may, from time to time, designate.
    (b) The goals of the Initiative shall be to:

(i) Reconnect Americans, especially children, to America's rivers and 
waterways, landscapes of national significance, ranches, farms and forests, 
great parks, and coasts and beaches by exploring a variety of efforts, 
including:

  (A) promoting community-based recreation and conservation, including 
local parks, greenways, beaches, and waterways;

  (B) advancing job and volunteer opportunities related to conservation and 
outdoor recreation; and

[[Page 316]]

  (C) supporting existing programs and projects that educate and engage 
Americans in our history, culture, and natural bounty.

(ii) Build upon State, local, private, and tribal priorities for the 
conservation of land, water, wildlife, historic, and cultural resources, 
creating corridors and connectivity across these outdoor spaces, and for 
enhancing neighborhood parks; and determine how the Federal Government can 
best advance those priorities through public private partnerships and 
locally supported conservation strategies.

(iii) Use science-based management practices to restore and protect our 
lands and waters for future generations.

Sec. 2. Functions. The functions of the Initiative shall include:
    (a) Outreach. The Initiative shall conduct listening and learning 
sessions around the country where land and waters are being conserved 
and community parks are being established in innovative ways. These 
sessions should engage the full range of interested groups, including 
tribal leaders, farmers and ranchers, sportsmen, community park groups, 
foresters, youth groups, businesspeople, educators, State and local 
governments, and recreation and conservation groups. Special attention 
should be given to bringing young Americans into the conversation. These 
listening sessions will inform the reports required in subsection (c) of 
this section.
    (b) Interagency Coordination. The following agencies shall work with 
the Initiative to identify existing resources and align policies and 
programs to achieve its goals:

(i) the Department of Defense;

(ii) the Department of Commerce;

(iii) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;

(iv) the Department of Health and Human Services;

(v) the Department of Labor;

(vi) the Department of Transportation;

(vii) the Department of Education; and

(viii) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

    (c) Reports. The Initiative shall submit, through the Chair of the 
CEQ, the following reports to the President:

(i) Report on America's Great Outdoors. By November 15, 2010, the 
Initiative shall submit a report that includes the following:

  (A) a review of successful and promising nonfederal conservation 
approaches;

  (B) an analysis of existing Federal resources and programs that could be 
used to complement those approaches;

  (C) proposed strategies and activities to achieve the goals of the 
Initiative; and

  (D) an action plan to meet the goals of the Initiative.

The report should reflect the constraints in resources available in, and be 
consistent with, the Federal budget. It should recommend efficient

[[Page 317]]

and effective use of existing resources, as well as opportunities to 
leverage nonfederal public and private resources and nontraditional 
conservation programs.

(ii) Annual reports. By September 30, 2011, and September 30, 2012, the 
Initiative shall submit reports on its progress in implementing the action 
plan developed pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(D) of this section.

Sec. 3. General Provisions. 
    (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of any necessary appropriations.
    (b) This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
    (c) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and 
provide information to the Initiative, consistent with applicable law, 
as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Initiative. Each 
executive department and agency shall bear its own expenses of 
participating in the Initiative.
    (d) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the OMB relating to 
budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
    (e) The Chair of the CEQ is authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of April 26, 2010

Establishing an Interagency Task Force on Federal Contracting 
Opportunities for Small Businesses

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The Federal Government is the world's largest purchaser of goods and 
services, with purchases totaling over $500 billion per year. The 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and other 
national investments are providing new opportunities for small 
businesses to compete for Federal contracts, and it is critical that 
these investments tap into the talents and skills of a broad cross-
section of American business and industry. Small businesses must be able 
to participate in the Nation's economic recovery, including businesses 
owned by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed Forces. These 
businesses should be able to compete and participate effectively in 
Federal contracts.
The Congress has established a number of statutory goals designed to 
help small businesses compete for Federal contracts. In addition to the 
goal of awarding at least 23 percent of all Federal prime contracting 
dollars to small businesses, the Congress also established Government-
wide contracting goals for participation by small businesses that are 
located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (at least 3 
percent) or that are owned by women (at least 5 percent), socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals (at least 5 percent), and 
service-disabled veterans (at least 3 percent). These aspirational goals 
help ensure that all Americans share in the jobs and opportunities 
created by Federal procurement.
In recent years, the Federal Government has not consistently reached its 
small business contracting goals. Although we have made some progress--
particularly with respect to Recovery Act contracts--more work can and 
should be done. I am committed to ensuring that small businesses, 
including firms owned by women, minorities, socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans, have fair 
access to Federal Government contracting. Indeed, where small businesses 
have the capacity to do more, we should strive to exceed the statutory 
goals. While Chief Acquisition Officers and Senior Procurement 
Executives have many priorities, small business contracting should 
always be a high priority in the procurement process.
Obtaining tangible results will require an honest and accurate 
accounting of our progress so that we can have transparency and 
accountability

[[Page 319]]

through Federal small business procurement data. Additionally, we must 
expand outreach strategies to alert small firms to Federal contracting 
opportunities.
In order to coordinate executive departments' and agencies' efforts 
towards ensuring that all small businesses have a fair chance to 
participate in Federal contracting opportunities, it is hereby ordered 
as follows:
Section 1. Establishment. There is established an Interagency Task Force 
on Federal Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses (Task Force). 
The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget (Director), and the Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration (Administrator) shall serve as Co-Chairs of the 
Task Force and shall direct its work.
Sec. 2. Membership. In addition to the Secretary, the Director, and the 
Administrator, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:

(i) the Secretary of the Treasury;

(ii) the Secretary of Defense;

(iii) the Attorney General;

(iv) the Secretary of Labor;

(v) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;

(vi) the Secretary of Transportation;

(vii) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;

(viii) the Secretary of Homeland Security;

(ix) the Administrator of General Services;

(x) the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;

(xi) the Director of the Minority Business Development Agency;

(xii) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;

(xiii) the Director of the Domestic Policy Council;

(xiv) the Director of the National Economic Council;

(xv) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; and

(xvi) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices 
as the President may, from time to time, designate.

A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force 
functions of the member, one or more senior officials who are part of 
the member's department, agency, or office, and who are full-time 
officers or employees of the Federal Government.
Sec. 3. Functions. The Task Force shall provide to the President, not 
later than 120 days after the date of this memorandum, proposals and 
recommendations for:

(i) using innovative strategies, such as teaming, to increase opportunities 
for small business contractors and utilizing and expanding mentorship 
programs, such as the mentor-prot[eacute]g[eacute] program;

(ii) removing barriers to participation by small businesses in the Federal 
marketplace by unbundling large projects, improving training of Federal

[[Page 320]]

acquisition officials with respect to strategies for increasing small 
business contracting opportunities, and utilizing new technologies to 
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Federal program managers, 
acquisition officials, and the Directors of Offices of Small Business 
Programs and Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, their 
managers, and procurement center representatives in identifying and 
providing access to these opportunities;

(iii) expanding outreach strategies to match small businesses, including 
firms located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones and firms owned 
and controlled by women, minorities, socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed 
Forces, with contracting and subcontracting opportunities; and

(iv) establishing policies, including revision or clarification of existing 
legislation, regulations, or policies, that are necessary or appropriate to 
effectuate the objectives of this memorandum.

Sec. 4. Using Technology to Improve Transparency and Accountability. 
Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Assistant to the 
President and Chief Technology Officer and the Federal Chief Information 
Officer, in coordination with the Task Force, shall develop a website 
that illustrates the participation of small businesses, including those 
owned by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed Forces, in 
Federal contracting. To foster greater accountability and transparency 
in, and allow oversight of, the Federal Government's progress, this 
website shall be designed to encourage improved collection, 
verification, and availability of Federal procurement data and provide 
accurate data on the Federal Government's progress in ensuring that all 
small businesses have a fair chance to participate in Federal 
contracting opportunities.
Sec. 5. Outreach. In developing its recommendations, the Task Force 
shall conduct outreach with representatives of small businesses and 
small business associations.
Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) This memorandum shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of any 
necessary appropriations.
    (b) This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
    (c) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and 
provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, 
as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Task Force. Each 
executive department and agency shall bear its own expenses of 
participating in the Task Force.

Memorandum of May 3, 2010

Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] 
the Secretary of Labor[,] the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of 
Education[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the 
Administrator of the Small Business Administration[,] the Administrator 
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[,] the Chair of the 
Council of Economic Advisers[,] the Director of National Intelligence[,] 
the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[, and] the 
Director of the National Economic Council
My Administration is committed to implementing a bold, new approach to 
human spaceflight. Supported by a $6 billion increase to the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) budget over the next 5 
years, this strategy will foster the development of path-breaking 
technologies, increase the reach and reduce the cost of human and 
robotic exploration of space, and help create thousands of new jobs.
NASA's budget also includes $429 million next year, and $1.9 billion 
over the next 5 years, to modernize the Kennedy Space Center and other 
nearby space launch facilities in Florida. This modernization effort 
will help spur new commercial business and innovation and provide 
additional good jobs to the region. While all of the new aspects of my 
Administration's plan together will create thousands of new jobs in 
Florida, past decisions to end the Space Shuttle program will still 
affect families and communities along Florida's ``Space Coast.''
Building on this significant new investment at the Kennedy Space Center 
and my increased budget for NASA overall, I am committed to taking 
additional steps to help local economies like Florida's Space Coast 
adapt and thrive in the years ahead. The men and women who work in 
Florida's aerospace industry are some of the most talented and highly 
trained in the Nation. It is critical that their skills are tapped as we 
transform and expand the country's space exploration efforts. That is 
why I am launching a $40 million, multi-agency initiative to help the 
Space Coast transform their economies and prepare their workers for the 
opportunities of tomorrow. This effort will build on and complement 
ongoing local and Federal economic and workforce-development efforts 
through a Task Force composed of senior-level Administration officials 
from relevant agencies that will construct an economic development 
action plan by August 15, 2010.
To these ends, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. Establishment of the Task Force on Space Industry Workforce 
and Economic Development. There is established a Task Force on Space 
Industry Workforce and Economic Development (Task Force) to develop, in 
collaboration with local stakeholders, an interagency action plan to 
facilitate economic development strategies and plans along the Space 
Coast and to provide training and other opportunities for affected 
aerospace workers so they are equipped to contribute to new developments 
in America's space program and related industries. The Secretary of 
Commerce and the Administrator of NASA shall serve as Co-Chairs of the 
Task Force.

Notice of May 3, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of 
the Government of Syria

On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria 
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public 
Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he 
declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the 
Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive 
Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and 
prohibited the exportation or re-exportation of certain goods to Syria. 
On April 25, 2006, and February 13, 2008, the President issued Executive 
Order 13399 and Executive Order 13460, respectively, to take additional 
steps with respect to this national emergency.
The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the 
Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then 
existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and 
missile programs, and undermining U.S. and international efforts with 
respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.
While the Syrian government has made some progress in suppressing 
networks of foreign fighters bound for Iraq, its actions and policies, 
including continuing support for terrorist organizations and pursuit of 
weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, the national 
emergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures adopted on that 
date, on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399, and on February 13, 
2008, in Executive Order 13460, to deal with that emergency must 
continue in effect beyond May 11, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared with respect to 
certain actions of the Government of Syria. The United States will 
consider changes in the policies and actions of the Government of Syria 
in determining whether to continue or terminate this national emergency 
in the future and would welcome progress by the Government of Syria on 
these matters.

Memorandum of May 11, 2010

Improving the Federal Recruitment and Hiring Process

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
To deliver the quality services and results the American people expect 
and deserve, the Federal Government must recruit and hire highly 
qualified employees, and public service should be a career of choice for 
the most talented Americans. Yet the complexity and inefficiency of 
today's Federal hiring process deters many highly qualified individuals 
from seeking and obtaining jobs in the Federal Government.
I therefore call on executive departments and agencies (agencies) to 
overhaul the way they recruit and hire our civilian workforce. Americans 
must be able to apply for Federal jobs through a commonsense hiring 
process and agencies must be able to select high-quality candidates 
efficiently and

[[Page 328]]

quickly. Moreover, agency managers and supervisors must assume a 
leadership role in recruiting and selecting employees from all segments 
of our society. Human resource offices must provide critical support for 
these efforts. The ability of agencies to perform their missions 
effectively and efficiently depends on a talented and engaged workforce, 
and we must reform our hiring system to further strengthen that 
workforce.
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, including section 3301 of title 5, United 
States Code, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. Directions to Agencies. Agency heads shall take the following 
actions no later than November 1, 2010:
    (a) consistent with merit system principles and other requirements 
of title 5, United States Code, and subject to guidance to be issued by 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), adopt hiring procedures that:

(1) eliminate any requirement that applicants respond to essay-style 
questions when submitting their initial application materials for any 
Federal job;

(2) allow individuals to apply for Federal employment by submitting resumes 
and cover letters or completing simple, plain language applications, and 
assess applicants using valid, reliable tools; and

(3) provide for selection from among a larger number of qualified 
applicants by using the ``category rating'' approach (as authorized by 
section 3319 of title 5, United States Code), rather than the ``rule of 3'' 
approach, under which managers may only select from among the three highest 
scoring applicants;

    (b) require that managers and supervisors with responsibility for 
hiring are:

(1) more fully involved in the hiring process, including planning current 
and future workforce requirements, identifying the skills required for the 
job, and engaging actively in the recruitment and, when applicable, the 
interviewing process; and

(2) accountable for recruiting and hiring highly qualified employees and 
supporting their successful transition into Federal service, beginning with 
the first performance review cycle starting after November 1, 2010;

    (c) provide the OPM and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
timelines and targets to:

(1) improve the quality and speed of agency hiring by:

  (i) reducing substantially the time it takes to hire mission-critical and 
commonly filled positions;

  (ii) measuring the quality and speed of the hiring process; and

  (iii) analyzing the causes of agency hiring problems and actions that 
will be taken to reduce them; and

(2) provide every agency hiring manager training on effective, efficient, 
and timely ways to recruit and hire well-qualified individuals;

    (d) notify individuals applying for Federal employment through 
USAJOBS, an OPM-approved Federal web-based employment search portal, 
about the status of their application at key stages of the application 
process; and

[[Page 329]]

    (e) identify a senior official accountable for leading agency 
implementation of this memorandum.
Sec. 2. Directions to the OPM. The OPM shall take the following actions 
no later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum:
    (a) establish a Government-wide performance review and improvement 
process for hiring reform actions described in section 1 of this 
memorandum, including:

(1) a timeline, benchmarks, and indicators of progress;

(2) a goal-focused, data-driven system for holding agencies accountable for 
improving the quality and speed of agency hiring, achieving agency hiring 
reform targets, and satisfying merit system principles and veterans' 
preference requirements; and

    (b) develop a plan to promote diversity in the Federal workforce, 
consistent with the merit system principle (codified at 5 U.S.C. 
2301(b)(1)) that the Federal Government should endeavor to achieve a 
workforce from all segments of society;
    (c) evaluate the Federal Career Intern Program established by 
Executive Order 13162 of July 6, 2000, provide recommendations 
concerning the future of that program, and propose a framework for 
providing effective pathways into the Federal Government for college 
students and recent college graduates;
    (d) provide guidance or propose regulations, as appropriate, to 
streamline and improve the quality of job announcements for Federal 
employment to make sure they are easily understood by applicants;
    (e) evaluate the effectiveness of shared registers used in filling 
positions common across multiple agencies and develop a strategy for 
improving agencies' use of these shared registers for commonly filled 
Government-wide positions;
    (f) develop a plan to increase the capacity of USAJOBS to provide 
applicants, hiring managers, and human resource professionals with 
information to improve the recruitment and hiring processes; and
    (g) take such further administrative action as appropriate to 
implement sections 1 and 2 of this memorandum.
Sec. 3. Senior Administration Officials. Agency heads and other senior 
administration officials visiting university or college campuses on 
official business are encouraged to discuss career opportunities in the 
Federal Government with students.
Sec. 4. Reporting. (a) The OPM, in coordination with the OMB and in 
consultation with other agencies, shall develop a public human resources 
website to:

(1) track key human resource data, including progress on hiring reform 
implementation; and

(2) assist senior agency leaders, hiring managers, and human resource 
professionals with identifying and replicating best practices within the 
Federal Government for improving new employee quality and the hiring 
process.

[[Page 330]]

    (b) Each agency shall regularly review its key human resource 
performance and work with the OPM and the OMB to achieve timelines and 
targets for correcting agency hiring problems.
    (c) The OPM shall submit to the President an annual report on the 
impact of hiring initiatives set forth in this memorandum, including its 
recommendations for further improving the Federal Government's hiring 
process.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Except as expressly stated herein, 
nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(1) authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(2) functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
    (d) The Director of the OPM, in consultation with the OMB, may grant 
an exception to any of the requirements set forth in section 1 of this 
memorandum to an agency that demonstrates that exceptional circumstances 
prevent it from complying with that requirement.
Sec. 6. Publication. The Director of the OPM is hereby authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

national emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain 
other property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The 
President took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq.
In Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 of 
July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, and Executive

Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, the President modified the scope of the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and took additional 
steps in response to this national emergency.
Because the obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13303, as modified in scope and 
relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Orders 13315, 13350, 
13364, and 13438, must continue in effect beyond May 22, 2010. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208), that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale 
repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions 
and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter 
alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date, on July 28, 2003, 
in Executive Order 13310, on October 18, 2007, in Executive Order 13448, 
and on April 30, 2008, in Executive Order 13464 to deal with that 
emergency, must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2010. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50

Memorandum of May 21, 2010

Improving Energy Security, American Competitiveness and Job Creation, 
and Environmental Protection Through a Transformation of Our Nation's 
Fleet of Cars and Trucks

Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of 
Energy[,] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency[, 
and] the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration
America has the opportunity to lead the world in the development of a 
new generation of clean cars and trucks through innovative technologies 
and manufacturing that will spur economic growth and create high-quality 
domestic jobs, enhance our energy security, and improve our environment. 
We already have made significant strides toward reducing greenhouse gas 
pollution and enhancing fuel efficiency from motor vehicles with the 
joint rulemaking issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on 
April 1, 2010, which regulates these attributes of passenger cars and 
light-duty trucks for model years 2012-2016. In this memorandum, I 
request that additional coordinated steps be taken to produce a new 
generation of clean vehicles.
Section 1. Medium- and Heavy-Duty Trucks. 
While the Federal Government and many States have now created a 
harmonized framework for addressing the fuel economy of and greenhouse 
gas emissions from cars and light-duty trucks, medium- and heavy-duty 
trucks and buses continue to be a major source of fossil fuel 
consumption and greenhouse gas pollution. I therefore request that the 
Administrators of the EPA and the NHTSA immediately begin work on a 
joint rulemaking under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Energy 
Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) to establish fuel 
efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards for commercial medium- 
and heavy-duty vehicles beginning with model year 2014, with the aim of 
issuing a final rule by July 30, 2011. As part of this rule development 
process, I request that the Administrators of the EPA and the NHTSA:
    (a) Propose and take comment on strategies, including those designed 
to increase the use of existing technologies, to achieve substantial 
annual progress in reducing transportation sector emissions and fossil 
fuel consumption consistent with my Administration's overall energy and 
climate security goals. These strategies should consider whether 
particular segments of the diverse heavy-duty vehicle sector present 
special opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase 
fuel economy. For example, preliminary estimates indicate that large 
tractor trailers, representing half of all greenhouse gas emissions from 
this sector, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 20 
percent and increase their fuel efficiency by as much as 25 percent with 
the use of existing technologies;
    (b) Include fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards 
that take into account the market structure of the trucking industry and 
the unique demands of heavy-duty vehicle applications; seek 
harmonization with applicable State standards; consider the findings and 
recommendations published in the National Academy of Science report on 
medium-

[[Page 334]]

and heavy-duty truck regulation; strengthen the industry and enhance job 
creation in the United States; and
    (c) Seek input from all stakeholders, while recognizing the 
continued leadership role of California and other States.
Sec. 2. Passenger Cars and Light-Duty Trucks.
Building on the earlier joint rulemaking, and in order to provide 
greater certainty and incentives for long-term innovation by automobile 
and light-duty vehicle manufacturers, I request that the Administrators 
of the EPA and the NHTSA develop, through notice and comment rulemaking, 
a coordinated national program under the CAA and the EISA to improve 
fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of passenger cars 
and light-duty trucks of model years 2017-2025. The national program 
should seek to produce joint Federal standards that are harmonized with 
applicable State standards, with the goal of ensuring that automobile 
manufacturers will be able to build a single, light-duty national fleet. 
The program should also seek to achieve substantial annual progress in 
reducing transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel 
consumption, consistent with my Administration's overall energy and 
climate security goals, through the increased domestic production and 
use of existing, advanced, and emerging technologies, and should 
strengthen the industry and enhance job creation in the United States. 
As part of implementing the national program, I request that the 
Administrators of the EPA and the NHTSA:
    (a) Work with the State of California to develop by September 1, 
2010, a technical assessment to inform the rulemaking process, 
reflecting input from an array of stakeholders on relevant factors, 
including viable technologies, costs, benefits, lead time to develop and 
deploy new and emerging technologies, incentives and other flexibilities 
to encourage development and deployment of new and emerging 
technologies, impacts on jobs and the automotive manufacturing base in 
the United States, and infrastructure for advanced vehicle technologies; 
and
    (b) Take all measures consistent with law to issue by September 30, 
2010, a Notice of Intent to Issue a Proposed Rule that announces plans 
for setting stringent fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions 
standards for light-duty vehicles of model year 2017 and beyond, 
including plans for initiating joint rulemaking and gathering any 
additional information needed to support regulatory action. The Notice 
should describe the key elements of the program that the EPA and the 
NHTSA intend jointly to propose, under their respective statutory 
authorities, including potential standards that could be practicably 
implemented nationally for the 2017-2025 model years and a schedule for 
setting those standards as expeditiously as possible, consistent with 
providing sufficient lead time to vehicle manufacturers.
Sec. 3. Cleaner Vehicles and Fuels and Necessary Infrastructure.
The success of our efforts to achieve enhanced energy security and to 
protect the environment also depends upon the development of 
infrastructure and promotion of fuels, including biofuels, which will 
enable the development and widespread deployment of advanced 
technologies. Therefore, I further request that:

[[Page 335]]

    (a) The Administrator of the EPA review for adequacy the current 
nongreenhouse gas emissions regulations for new motor vehicles, new 
motor vehicle engines, and motor vehicle fuels, including tailpipe 
emissions standards for nitrogen oxides and air toxics, and sulfur 
standards for gasoline. If the Administrator of the EPA finds that new 
emissions regulations are required, then I request that the 
Administrator of the EPA promulgate such regulations as part of a 
comprehensive approach toward regulating motor vehicles; and
    (b) The Secretary of Energy promote the deployment of advanced 
technology vehicles by providing technical assistance to cities 
preparing for deployment of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids 
and all-electric vehicles; and
    (c) The Department of Energy work with stakeholders on the 
development of voluntary standards to facilitate the robust deployment 
of advanced vehicle technologies and coordinate its efforts with the 
Department of Transportation, the NHTSA, and the EPA.
Sec. 4. General Provisions.
    (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law, including international trade obligations, and subject to the 
availability of appropriations.
    (b) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
    (c) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

(1) authority granted by law to a department, agency, or the head thereof; 
or

(2) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Sec. 5. Publication.
The Secretary of Transportation is hereby authorized and directed to 
publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of June 2, 2010

Extension of Benefits to Same-Sex Domestic Partners of Federal Employees

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
For far too long, many of our Government's hard-working, dedicated LGBT 
employees have been denied equal access to the basic rights and benefits 
their colleagues enjoy. This kind of systemic inequality undermines the 
health, well-being, and security not just of our Federal workforce, but 
also of their families and communities. That is why, last June, I 
directed the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies), in 
consultation with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to conduct a 
thorough review of the benefits they provide and to identify any that 
could be extended to LGBT employees and their partners and families. 
Although legislative action is necessary to provide full equality to 
LGBT Federal employees, the agencies have identified a number of 
benefits that can be extended under existing law. OPM, in consultation 
with the Department of Justice, has provided me with a report 
recommending that all of the identified benefits be extended.
Accordingly, I hereby direct the following:

[[Page 337]]

Section 1. Immediate Actions To Extend Benefits. Agencies should 
immediately take the following actions, consistent with existing law, in 
order to extend benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of Federal 
employees, and, where applicable, to the children of same-sex domestic 
partners of Federal employees:
    (a) The Director of OPM should take appropriate action to:

(i) clarify that the children of employees' same-sex domestic partners fall 
within the definition of ``child'' for purposes of Federal child-care 
subsidies, and, where appropriate, for child-care services;

(ii) clarify that, for purposes of employee assistance programs, same-sex 
domestic partners and their children qualify as ``family members'';

(iii) issue a proposed rule that would clarify that employees' same-sex 
domestic partners qualify as ``family members'' for purposes of 
noncompetitive appointments made pursuant to Executive Order 12721 of July 
30, 1990;

(iv) issue a proposed rule that would add a Federal retiree's same-sex 
domestic partner to the list of individuals presumed to have an insurable 
interest in the employee pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8339(k)(1), 8420;

(v) clarify that under appropriate circumstances, employees' same-sex 
domestic partners and their children qualify as dependents for purposes of 
evacuation payments made under 5 U.S.C. 5522-5523; Folio: 1632

(vi) amend its guidance on implementing President Clinton's April 11, 1997, 
memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies on ``Expanded 
Family and Medical Leave Policies'' to specify that the 24 hours of unpaid 
leave made available to Federal employees in connection with (i) school and 
early childhood educational activities; (ii) routine family medical 
purposes; and (iii) elderly relatives' health or care needs, may be used to 
meet the needs of an employee's same-sex domestic partner or the same-sex 
domestic partner's children; and

(vii) clarify that employees' same-sex domestic partners qualify as 
dependents for purposes of calculating the extra allowance payable under 5 
U.S.C. 5942a to assist employees stationed on Johnston Island, subject to 
any limitations applicable to spouses.

    (b) The Administrator of General Services should take appropriate 
action to amend the definitions of ``immediate family'' and 
``dependent'' appearing in the Federal Travel Regulations, 41 C.F.R. 
Chs. 300-304, to include same-sex domestic partners and their children, 
so that employees and their domestic partners and children can obtain 
the full benefits available under applicable law, including certain 
travel, relocation, and subsistence payments.
    (c) All agencies offering any of the benefits specified by OPM in 
implementing guidance under section 3 of this memorandum, including 
credit union membership, access to fitness facilities, and access to 
planning and counseling services, should take all appropriate action to 
provide the same level of benefits that is provided to employees' 
spouses and their children to employees' same-sex domestic partners and 
their children.
    (d) All agencies with authority to provide benefits to employees 
outside of the context of title 5, United States Code should take all 
appropriate actions to ensure that the benefits being provided to 
employees' spouses and

[[Page 338]]

their children are also being provided, at an equivalent level wherever 
permitted by law, to their employees' same-sex domestic partners and 
their children.
Sec. 2.  Continuing Obligation To Provide New Benefits. In the future, 
all agencies that provide new benefits to the spouses of Federal 
employees and their children should, to the extent permitted by law, 
also provide them to the same-sex domestic partners of their employees 
and those same-sex domestic partners' children. This section applies to 
appropriated and nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of such 
agencies.
Sec. 3. Monitoring and Guidance. The Director of OPM shall monitor 
compliance with this memorandum, and may instruct agencies to provide 
the Director with reports on the status of their compliance, and 
prescribe the form Folio: 1633 and manner of such reports. The Director 
of OPM shall also issue guidance to ensure consistent and appropriate 
implementation.
Sec. 4. Reporting. By April 1, 2011, and annually thereafter, the 
Director of OPM shall provide the President with a report on the 
progress of the agencies in implementing this memorandum until such time 
as all recommendations have been appropriately implemented.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Except as expressly stated herein, 
nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
Sec. 6. Publication. The Director of OPM is hereby authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of June 8, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions and 
Policies of Certain Members of the Government of Belarus and Other 
Persons That Undermine Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus

On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Belarus, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to 
undermine Belarus democratic processes or institutions, to commit human 
rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and 
disappearances, and to engage in public corruption, including by 
diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public 
authority.
Despite the release of internationally recognized political prisoners in 
the fall of 2008 and our continuing efforts to press for further reforms 
related to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Belarus, 
serious challenges remain. The actions and policies of certain members 
of the Government of Belarus and other persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States. Accordingly, the national emergency 
declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal 
with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 16, 2010. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) 
extremist violence in

[[Page 341]]

the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, 
or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia 
or the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, 
in Kosovo. The President subsequently amended that order in Executive 
Order 13304 of May 28, 2003.
Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and international 
stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and 
the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that 
emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2010. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the Western Balkans.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Memorandum of June 10, 2010

Disposing of Unneeded Federal Real Estate--Increasing Sales Proceeds, 
Cutting Operating Costs, and Improving Energy Efficiency

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to eliminating all forms of Government 
waste and to leading by example as our Nation transitions to a clean 
energy economy. For decades, the Federal Government, the largest 
property owner and energy user in the United States, has managed more 
real estate than necessary to effectively support its programs and 
missions. Both taxpayer dollars and energy resources are being wasted to 
maintain these excess assets. In addition, many of the properties 
necessary for the Government's work are not operated efficiently, 
resulting in wasted funds and excessive greenhouse gas pollution. For 
example, over the past decade, the private sector reduced its data 
center footprint by capitalizing on innovative technologies to increase 
efficiencies. However, during that same period, the Federal Government 
experienced a substantial increase in the number of data centers, 
leading to increased energy consumption, real property expenditures, and 
operations and maintenance costs. Past attempts at reducing the Federal 
Government's civilian real property assets produced small savings and 
had a minor impact on the condition and performance of mission-critical 
properties. These efforts were not sufficiently comprehensive in 
disposing of excess real estate and did not emphasize making more 
efficient use of existing assets.

[[Page 342]]

To eliminate wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars, save energy and 
water, and further reduce greenhouse gas pollution, I hereby direct 
executive departments and agencies (agencies) to accelerate efforts to 
identify and eliminate excess properties. Agencies shall also take 
immediate steps to make better use of remaining real property assets as 
measured by utilization and occupancy rates, annual operating cost, 
energy efficiency, and sustainability. To the extent permitted by law, 
agency actions shall include accelerating cycle times for identifying 
excess assets and disposing of surplus assets; eliminating lease 
arrangements that are not cost effective; pursuing consolidation 
opportunities within and across agencies in common asset types (such as 
data centers, office space, warehouses, and laboratories); increasing 
occupancy rates in current facilities through innovative approaches to 
space management and alternative workplace arrangements, such as 
telework; and identifying offsetting reductions in inventory when new 
space is acquired. Agency actions taken under this memorandum shall 
align with and support the actions to measure and reduce resource use 
and greenhouse gas emissions in Federal facilities pursuant to Executive 
Order 13514 of October 5, 2009 (Federal Leadership in Environmental, 
Energy, and Economic Performance), and the Federal Data Center 
Consolidation Initiative, which was announced by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) in February 2010.
In total, agency efforts required by this memorandum should produce no 
less than $3 billion in cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2012, 
yielded from increased proceeds from the sale of assets and reduced 
operating, maintenance, and energy expenses from disposals or other 
space consolidation efforts, including leases that are ended. This is in 
addition to the Department of Defense's Base Realignment and Closure 
efforts that are expected to achieve $9.8 billion in savings from fiscal 
year 2010 to fiscal year 2012, of which $5 billion is a direct result of 
reduced operating and maintenance from disposals or other consolidation 
efforts. In addition, in order to address the growth of data centers 
across the Federal Government, agencies shall immediately adopt a policy 
against expanding data centers beyond current levels, and shall develop 
plans to consolidate and significantly reduce data centers within 5 
years. Agencies shall submit their plans to OMB for review by August 30, 
2010.
To achieve these goals, the Director of the OMB shall develop, in 
consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Federal 
Real Property Council established pursuant to Executive Order 13327 of 
February 4, 2004 (Federal Real Property Asset Management), within 90 
days of the date of this memorandum, guidance for actions agencies 
should take to carry out the requirements of this memorandum. The 
guidance shall include agency-specific targets to achieve $3 billion in 
cost savings and shall be developed in consultation with the agencies. 
The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Director 
of the OMB, shall coordinate agency efforts to satisfy the requirements 
of this memorandum and shall submit to the President periodic reports on 
the results achieved.
This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea

On June 26, 2008, by Executive Order 13466, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the current existence and risk of the 
proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean 
Peninsula. The President also found that it was necessary to maintain 
certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise 
have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which 
terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy 
Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea.
Because the existence and the risk of proliferation of weapons-usable 
fissile material on the Korean Peninsula continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2008, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond June 26, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``order'') blocking property and interests in property of the Government 
of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of United States persons that are directly related 
to the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation 
Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from 
Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related contracts and 
agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU Agreements 
allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from 
nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of 
the Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2010, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian 
Federation. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Memorandum of June 18, 2010

Enhancing Payment Accuracy Through a ``Do Not Pay List''

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in 
Federal programs, including reducing and recapturing erroneous 
payments--a commitment I reinforced in Executive Order 13520 of November

[[Page 345]]

20, 2009, and in a memorandum to the heads of executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) of March 10, 2010. While identifying and recapturing 
improper payments is important, prevention of payment errors before they 
occur should be the first priority in protecting taxpayer resources from 
waste, fraud, and abuse. In those cases where data available to agencies 
clearly shows that a potential recipient of a Federal payment is 
ineligible for it, subsequent payment to that recipient is unacceptable. 
We must ensure that such payments are not made.
Agencies maintain many databases containing information on a recipient's 
eligibility to receive Federal benefits payments or Federal awards, such 
as grants and contracts. By checking these databases before making 
payments or awards, agencies can identify ineligible recipients and 
prevent certain improper payments from being made in the first place.
Therefore, I hereby direct agencies to review current pre-payment and 
pre-award procedures and ensure that a thorough review of available 
databases with relevant information on eligibility occurs before the 
release of any Federal funds, to the extent permitted by law. At a 
minimum, agencies shall, before payment and award, check the following 
existing databases (where applicable and permitted by law) to verify 
eligibility: the Social Security Administration's Death Master File, the 
General Services Administration's Excluded Parties List System, the 
Department of the Treasury's Debt Check Database, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert System or Credit Alert 
Interactive Voice Response System, and the Department of Health and 
Human Services' Office of Inspector General's List of Excluded 
Individuals/Entities. This network of databases, and additional 
databases so designated by the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) in consultation with agencies, shall be collectively known 
as the ``Do Not Pay List.'' This memorandum requires agencies to review 
these databases with the recognition that there may be circumstances 
when the law nevertheless requires a payment or award to be made to a 
recipient listed in them. My Administration began coordination of the 
databases discussed in this memorandum in April 2010 by launching the 
Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), 
which integrates various sources of information on the eligibility of 
Government contractors for award. No later than 120 days of the date of 
this memorandum, the Director of the OMB shall provide to the President 
a plan for completing integration for the remaining databases, to the 
extent permitted by law, so that agencies can access them through a 
single entry point.
Each agency shall, within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, submit 
to the OMB a plan that includes information on its current pre-payment 
and pre-award procedures and a list of databases that the agency checks 
pursuant to those procedures. Within 180 days of the date of this 
memorandum, the Director of the OMB shall issue guidance, to be 
developed in consultation with affected agencies and taking into account 
current agency pre-payment and pre-award practices, on actions agencies 
must take to carry out this memorandum's requirements. This guidance 
shall clarify that the head of each agency is responsible for ensuring 
an efficient and accurate process for determining whether the 
information provided on the ``Do Not Pay List'' is sufficient to stop a 
payment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and, if so, 
whether a payment should be stopped

[[Page 346]]

under the circumstances. In addition, this guidance shall identify best 
practices and databases that agencies should utilize to conduct pre-
payment checks to ensure that only eligible recipients receive 
Government benefits or payments.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish 
this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of June 18, 2010

Lobbyists on Agency Boards and Commissions

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to reducing the undue influence of 
special interests that for too long has shaped the national agenda and 
drowned out the voices of ordinary Americans. Special interests exert 
this disproportionate influence, in part, by relying on lobbyists who 
have special access that is not available to all citizens. Although 
lobbyists can sometimes play a constructive role by communicating 
information to the government, their service in privileged positions 
within the executive branch can perpetuate the culture of special-
interest access that I am committed to changing.
On the day after my inauguration, I signed Executive Order 13490, which 
places strict limits on the ability of lobbyists to serve in Government 
positions related to their prior lobbying activities. Last September, we 
took another step to close the revolving door through which lobbyists 
enter and exit Government positions when we announced that my 
Administration aspires to keep Federal agencies' advisory boards free of 
federally registered lobbyists. Many departments and agencies are making 
this aspiration a reality by no longer placing federally registered 
lobbyists on advisory boards--a practice that I am now establishing as 
the official policy of my Administration.
Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive departments and 
agencies not to make any new appointments or reappointments of federally 
registered lobbyists to advisory committees and other boards and 
commissions. Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue proposed guidance 
designed to implement this policy to the full extent permitted by law. 
The final guidance shall be issued following public comment on the 
proposed guidance.

The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized 
and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of June 28, 2010

Unleashing the Wireless Broadband Revolution

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
America's future competitiveness and global technology leadership 
depend, in part, upon the availability of additional spectrum. The world 
is going wireless, and we must not fall behind. The resurgence of 
American productivity growth that started in the 1990s largely reflects 
investments by American companies, the public sector, and citizens in 
the new communications technologies that are what we know today as the 
Internet. The Internet, as vital infrastructure, has become central to 
the daily economic life of almost every American by creating 
unprecedented opportunities for small businesses and individual 
entrepreneurs. We are now beginning the next transformation in 
information technology: the wireless broadband revolution.
Few technological developments hold as much potential to enhance 
America's economic competitiveness, create jobs, and improve the quality 
of our lives as wireless high-speed access to the Internet. Innovative 
new mobile technologies hold the promise for a virtuous cycle--millions 
of consumers gain faster access to more services at less cost, spurring 
innovation, and then a new round of consumers benefit from new services. 
The wireless revolution has already begun with millions of Americans 
taking advantage of wireless access to the Internet.
Expanded wireless broadband access will trigger the creation of 
innovative new businesses, provide cost-effective connections in rural 
areas, increase productivity, improve public safety, and allow for the 
development of mobile telemedicine, telework, distance learning, and 
other new applications that will transform Americans' lives.
Spectrum and the new technologies it enables also are essential to the 
Federal Government, which relies on spectrum for important activities, 
such as emergency communications, national security, law enforcement, 
aviation, maritime, space communications, and numerous other Federal 
functions. Spectrum is also critical for many State, local, and tribal 
government functions. As the wireless broadband revolution unfolds, 
innovation can enable efficient and imaginative uses of spectrum to 
maintain and enhance the Government's capabilities.
In order to achieve mobile wireless broadband's full potential, we need 
an environment where innovation thrives, and where new capabilities also 
are secure, trustworthy, and provide appropriate safeguards for users' 
privacy.

[[Page 349]]

These characteristics will continue to be important to the adoption of 
mobile wireless broadband.
This new era in global technology leadership will only happen if there 
is adequate spectrum available to support the forthcoming myriad of 
wireless devices, networks, and applications that can drive the new 
economy. To do so, we can use our American ingenuity to wring abundance 
from scarcity, by finding ways to use spectrum more efficiently. We can 
also unlock the value of otherwise underutilized spectrum and open new 
avenues for spectrum users to derive value through the development of 
advanced, situation-aware spectrum-sharing technologies.
I therefore am hereby directing that executive departments, agencies, 
and offices, and strongly encourage that independent agencies, take the 
following steps:
Section 1. The Secretary of Commerce, working through the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), shall:
(a) collaborate with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to make 
available a total of 500 MHz of Federal and nonfederal spectrum over the 
next 10 years, suitable for both mobile and fixed wireless broadband 
use. The spectrum must be available to be licensed by the FCC for 
exclusive use or made available for shared access by commercial and 
Government users in order to enable licensed or unlicensed wireless 
broadband technologies to be deployed;
(b) collaborate with the FCC to complete by October 1, 2010, a specific 
Plan and Timetable for identifying and making available 500 MHz of 
spectrum as described in subsection (a) of this section. For purposes of 
successfully implementing any repurposing of existing spectrum in 
accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the Plan and Timetable 
must take into account the need to ensure no loss of critical existing 
and planned Federal, State, local, and tribal government capabilities, 
the international implications, and the need for appropriate enforcement 
mechanisms and authorities;
(c) convene the Policy and Plans Steering Group (PPSG) to advise NTIA on 
achieving the objectives in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. The 
Secretaries of Defense, the Treasury, Transportation, State, the 
Interior, Agriculture, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney 
General, the Administrators of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration, the 
Director of National Intelligence, the Commandant of the United States 
Coast Guard, and the head of any other executive department or agency 
that is currently authorized to use spectrum shall participate and 
cooperate fully, or in the case of independent agencies are strongly 
encouraged to, in the activities of the Department of Commerce in 
accomplishing subsections (a) and (b) of this section and promptly 
provide appropriate funding and staff resources for agency support to 
these efforts and the work of the PPSG; and
(d) submit, not later than 180 days after the Plan and Timetable 
described in subsection (b) of this section are completed, to the 
National Economic Council (NEC), the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) an interim 
report to assess progress against the Plan and Timetable developed in 
accordance with subsection (b) of this section. Additional interim 
reports shall be submitted

[[Page 350]]

180 days after the submission of the first interim report and then 
annually thereafter until such time as the Plan and Timetable are 
completed. In preparing these reports, the Secretary of Commerce shall 
work cooperatively with the FCC and other relevant departments, 
agencies, and offices.
Sec. 2. The Director of OMB shall work with the Secretary of Commerce, 
through NTIA and in consultation with affected departments, agencies, 
and offices, to incorporate into the Plan and Timetable referred to in 
section 1(b) of this memorandum adequate funding, incentives, and 
assistance to enable executive agencies or other affected entities to 
accomplish the actions specified in section 1(a) of this memorandum.
Sec. 3. The Secretary of Commerce, working through NTIA, in consultation 
with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, National 
Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Defense, the Department of 
Justice, NASA, and other agencies as appropriate, shall create and 
implement a plan to facilitate research, development, experimentation, 
and testing by researchers to explore innovative spectrum-sharing 
technologies, including those that are secure and resilient.
Sec. 4. The FCC is strongly encouraged to work closely with the 
Department of Commerce, through NTIA, to carry out this memorandum as it 
relates to the FCC, including the repurposing of nonfederal Government 
spectrum as appropriate and identifying the mechanisms necessary to 
ensure compliance with the FCC's decisions.
Sec. 5. The NEC, the OMB, and the OSTP (in consultation with the 
Department of Commerce, working through NTIA, FCC, and the National 
Security Staff) shall assess, based on the interim report developed 
pursuant to section 1(d) of this memorandum, whether there has been 
sufficient progress in achieving the objectives of this memorandum or 
whether some other mechanism, such as an independent review panel, is 
needed to address those areas where sufficient progress is not 
occurring. The NEC, the OMB, and the OSTP shall make any necessary 
recommendations to the President regarding such progress 45 days after 
receiving the initial interim report required by section 1(d) of this 
memorandum and, as appropriate, following subsequent reports.
Sec. 6.
(a) To the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations, 
the Department of Commerce, through NTIA, shall provide administrative 
support for the interagency groups created in this memorandum.
(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.
(c) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to require the 
disclosure of classified information, law enforcement sensitive 
information, or other information that must be protected in the 
interests of national security.
(d) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(e) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
by any

[[Page 351]]

party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 7. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized and directed to publish 
this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of June 30, 2010

Long-Term Gulf Coast Restoration Support Plan

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the worst environmental disaster 
America has ever faced. The oil spill represents just the latest blow to 
an area that has already suffered significant hardship. In addition to 
fighting the spill, conducting environmental cleanup, and ensuring such 
a crisis does not happen again, we must help the Gulf Coast and its 
people recover from this tragedy. A long-term plan to restore the unique 
beauty and bounty of this region is therefore necessary.
As I announced on June 15, 2010, and pursuant to the authority vested in 
me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, I assign to the Secretary of the Navy (Secretary) the 
responsibility to lead the effort to create a plan of Federal support 
for the long-term economic and environmental restoration of the Gulf 
Coast region, in coordination with States, local communities, tribes, 
people whose livelihoods depend on the Gulf, businesses, 
conservationists, scientists, and other entities and persons as he deems 
necessary. In addition to working with these stakeholders, the Secretary 
shall coordinate, as appropriate, with the heads of executive 
departments and agencies, as well as offices within the Executive Office 
of the President (collectively, executive branch components).
Specifically, I direct the following:
Section 1. As soon as possible, the Secretary shall develop a Gulf Coast 
Restoration Support Plan (Plan), based on the following principles:
    (a) The Plan shall provide a comprehensive assessment of post-spill 
needs, as well as a proposal for Federal assistance in the overall 
recovery of the region.
    (b) The purpose of the Plan shall be to develop an approach that 
will ensure economic recovery, community planning, science-based 
restoration of the ecosystem and environment, public health and safety 
efforts, and support of individuals and businesses who suffered losses 
due to the spill.
    (c) The Plan shall take into account resources already available to 
respond to the oil spill, and complement the on-going oil spill response 
efforts. The Secretary will also coordinate, as needed, with the State, 
Federal,

[[Page 352]]

and tribal trustees who have responsibility for directing the natural 
resource damage planning process under the Oil Pollution Act and other 
applicable law.
    (d) The Plan shall identify long- and short-term objectives and, 
where applicable, how the achievement of these objectives will be 
measured.
Sec. 2. (a) This assignment is prescribed as an additional 
responsibility of the Secretary in accordance with section 5013 of title 
10, United States Code. This additional responsibility may not be 
delegated under section 5013(f) of title 10, United States Code.
    (b) To assist in accomplishing the directive in section 1 of this 
memorandum, executive branch components shall make available information 
and other resources, including personnel, deemed by the Secretary to be 
necessary for development of the Plan.
Sec. 3. (a) Executive branch components shall carry out the provisions 
of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law, subject to the 
availability of appropriations, and consistent with their statutory and 
regulatory authorities and their enforcement mechanisms.
    (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person. Nothing in this memorandum shall relieve or otherwise affect the 
obligations of any responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act or 
other applicable law.
Sec. 4. The Secretary is hereby authorized to publish this memorandum in 
the Federal Register.

Memorandum of July 13, 2010

Implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
As we approach 30 years from the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 
United States, new actions are needed to prevent HIV infection and 
better serve people living with HIV. The actions we take now will build 
upon a legacy of global leadership, national commitment, and sustained 
efforts on the part of Americans from all parts of the country and all 
walks of life

[[Page 353]]

to end the HIV epidemic in the United States and around the world. I am 
committed to renewing national leadership to fight HIV/AIDS here at 
home, as we continue our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS around the world. My 
Administration has engaged in an extensive process to engage Americans 
and listen to their ideas for improving our national response to HIV/
AIDS.
Today I am releasing a National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States 
(Strategy) and a National HIV/AIDS Strategy Federal Implementation Plan 
(Federal Implementation Plan), which identifies specific actions to be 
taken by Federal agencies to implement the Strategy's goals. While 
agencies already undertake many actions to address HIV/AIDS, successful 
implementation of the Strategy will require new levels of coordination, 
collaboration, and accountability. This will require the Federal 
Government to work in new ways across agency lines, as well as in 
enhanced and innovative partnerships with State, tribal, and local 
governments. Government cooperation at all levels, moreover, is not 
enough. Success will require the commitment of all parts of society, 
including businesses, faith communities, philanthropic organizations, 
scientific and medical communities, educational institutions, people 
living with HIV, and others. It is also necessary to sustain public 
commitment to ending the epidemic, and this calls for regular 
communications between governments at all levels to identify the 
challenges we face and report the progress we are making. To these ends, 
I hereby direct the following:
Section 1.  Role of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy 
(ONAP). 
    (a) The Director of the ONAP, in consultation with the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), shall be responsible for setting the 
Administration's domestic HIV/AIDS priorities and monitoring the 
implementation of the Strategy. The Director of the ONAP shall convene 
regular meetings with representatives of executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) to coordinate HIV/AIDS-related policies, programs, 
and activities.
    (b) The Director of the ONAP shall annually report to the President 
on the implementation of the Strategy, including progress in meeting key 
targets and taking key actions identified in the Strategy and the 
Federal Implementation Plan.
Sec. 2. Lead Responsible Agencies. While the Strategy requires a 
Government-wide effort in order to succeed fully, certain agencies have 
primary responsibilities and competencies in implementing the Strategy.
    (a) Designation of Lead Agencies. Lead agencies for implementing the 
Strategy shall be:

(i) the Department of Health and Human Services;

(ii) the Department of Justice;

(iii) the Department of Labor;

(iv) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;

(v) the Department of Veterans Affairs; and

(vi) the Social Security Administration.

    (b) Lead Agency Implementation Plans. Within 150 days of the date of 
this memorandum, the head of each lead agency shall submit a report to

[[Page 354]]

the ONAP and the OMB on the agency's operational plans for implementing 
the Strategy. The plans shall assign responsibilities to agency 
officials, designate reporting structures for actions identified in the 
Federal Implementation Plan, and identify other appropriate actions to 
advance the Strategy. The plans shall also include steps to strengthen 
coordination in planning, budgeting for, and evaluating domestic HIV/
AIDS programs within and across agencies. Lead agencies are encouraged 
to consider, and reflect in their plans, steps to streamline grantee 
reporting requirements and funding announcements related to HIV/AIDS 
programs and activities.
    (c) Ongoing Responsibilities of Lead Agencies. The head of each lead 
agency shall:

(i) designate an official responsible for coordinating the agency's ongoing 
efforts to implement the Strategy;

(ii) develop a process for sharing progress reports, including status 
updates on achieving specific quantitative targets established by the 
Strategy, with relevant agencies and the ONAP on an annual basis, or at 
such other times as the ONAP requests; and

(iii) in consultation with the OMB, use the budget development process to 
prioritize programs and activities most critical to meeting the goals of 
the Strategy.

Sec. 3. Role of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The 
Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), or the Secretary's 
designee, shall be responsible for improving coordination of domestic 
HIV/AIDS programs and activities across the Federal Government.
    (a) Coordination within the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, shall develop and implement 
specific plans and procedures for improving intra-departmental 
coordination and collaboration on HIV/AIDS care, research, and 
prevention services.
    (b) Coordination with Other Agencies. The Secretary, or the 
Secretary's designee, shall be responsible for convening interagency

days of the date of this memorandum, the Chair of the Commission shall 
submit to the ONAP and the OMB recommendations for increasing employment 
opportunities for people living with HIV and a plan for addressing 
employment-related discrimination against people living with HIV, 
consistent with the Commission's authorities and other applicable law.
Sec. 5. General Provisions.
    (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and 
provide information to the Director of the ONAP, consistent with 
applicable law, as may be necessary to implement the Strategy. Each 
agency shall bear its own expense for carrying out activities to 
implement the Strategy.
    (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency or the head thereof, 
or to other executive branch officials; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
Sec. 6. Publication. The Secretary is authorized and directed to publish 
this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of July 19, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Former 
Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures, including the blocking 
of the property of certain persons connected to the former Liberian 
regime of Charles Taylor, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers

[[Page 356]]

Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this action to deal with 
the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States constituted by the actions and policies of former Liberian 
President Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their unlawful 
depletion of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia and 
secreting of Liberian funds and property, which have undermined 
Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly development of its 
political, administrative, and economic institutions and resources.
The actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others have left a legacy 
of destruction that continues to undermine Liberia's transformation and 
recovery. Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on July 22, 2004, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond July 22, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13348.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of July 19, 2010

The Presidential POWER Initiative: Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring 
Reemployment

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Each year Federal civilian employees are injured or fall ill on the job 
in significant numbers. Although the Federal Government has made 
progress in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses in recent years, 
its workers (excluding those employed by the U.S. Postal Service) still 
filed more than 79,000 new claims and received over $1.6 billion in 
workers' compensation payments in fiscal year 2009. Many of these work-
related injuries and illnesses are preventable, and executive 
departments and agencies can and should do even more to improve 
workplace safety and health, reduce the financial burden of injury on 
taxpayers, and relieve unnecessary suffering by workers and their 
families.
Therefore, I am establishing a 4-year Protecting Our Workers and 
Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) Initiative, covering fiscal years 2011 
through 2014. The POWER Initiative will extend prior workplace safety 
and health efforts of the Federal Government by setting more aggressive 
performance targets, encouraging the collection and analysis of data on 
the causes and consequences of frequent or severe injury and illness, 
and prioritizing safety and health management programs that have proven 
effective in the past.
Under the POWER Initiative, each executive department and agency will be 
expected to improve its performance in seven areas:

[[Page 357]]

(i) reducing total injury and illness case rates;

(ii) reducing lost time injury and illness case rates;

(iii) analyzing lost time injury and illness data;

(iv) increasing the timely filing of workers' compensation claims;

(v) increasing the timely filing of wage-loss claims;

(vi) reducing lost production day rates; and

(vii) speeding employees' return to work in cases of serious injury or 
illness.

Executive departments and agencies (except the U.S. Postal Service) 
shall coordinate with the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration and Office of Workers' Compensation Programs to 
establish performance targets in each category. The Secretary of Labor 
shall lead the POWER Initiative by measuring both Government-wide and 
agency-level performance and reporting to me annually.
Each executive department and agency shall bear its own costs for 
participating in the POWER Initiative, and nothing in this memorandum 
shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority granted 
by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Secretary of Labor is authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

Designation of the National Science and Technology Council to Coordinate 
Certain Activities Under the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984

Memorandum for the Director of the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, including the Arctic Research and Policy Act 
of 1984 (Title I of Public Law 98-373) (the ``Act''), I hereby assign to 
the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) responsibility to 
coordinate activities assigned in sections 107 and 108 of the Act to the 
Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, including through 
committees of the NSTC.
The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is 
authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal

Notice of July 29, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of 
Certain Persons to Undermine the Sovereignty of Lebanon or Its 
Democratic Processes and Institutions

On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic 
processes or institutions and certain other persons, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The

[[Page 360]]

President determined that the actions of certain persons to undermine 
Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic 
institutions; to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of 
law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and 
intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian 
interference in Lebanon; or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese 
sovereignty contribute to political and economic instability in that 
country and the region and constitute an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
While there have been some recent positive developments in the Syrian-
Lebanese relationship, continuing arms transfers to Hizballah that 
include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems serve to undermine 
Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and economic instability 
in Lebanon, and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond August 1, 2010. In accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13441.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of August 3, 2010

Freeze on Discretionary Awards, Bonuses, and Similar Payments for 
Federal Political Appointees

Memorandum for the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff [and] 
the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
At a time when so many American families are struggling to make ends 
meet, I am committed to making sure the Federal Government is spending 
the taxpayers' money wisely and carefully, and cutting costs wherever 
possible. I am committed to ending programs that do not work, 
streamlining those that do, and bringing a new responsibility for 
stewardship of tax dollars. Like households and businesses across the 
country, the Federal Government is tightening its belt. This effort 
began during my first days in office, when I froze the salaries of the 
senior members of my White House Staff.
As a next step in this effort, I direct you to suspend cash awards, 
quality step increases, bonuses, and similar discretionary payments or 
salary adjustments to any politically appointed Federal employee, 
commencing immediately, and continuing through the end of Fiscal Year 
2011. I also direct the Office of Personnel Management to issue 
guidance, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, to 
assist departments and agencies in implementing this policy.

[[Page 361]]

In addition to these actions freezing discretionary payments, I have 
proposed in my Budget for Fiscal Year 2011 a salary freeze for senior 
political appointees throughout the Federal Government. Unlike the 
administrative action I have taken today in this memorandum, my proposed 
salary freeze requires legislation, so it cannot be implemented absent 
legislative action by the Congress.
I appreciate the hard work of our Federal workforce, and understand how 
important these payments can be to many workers and their families. Yet 
like households and businesses across the country, we need to make tough 
choices about how to spend our funds.
This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and 
consistent with executive departments' and agencies' legal authorities. 
Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to affect payments or 
salary adjustments for Federal employees who are not political 
appointees. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized 
and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 2010-11 of August 10, 2010

Continuation of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of 
Colombia

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Colombia, that (1) 
interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in 
illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary, 
because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to 
the national security of that country; and (2) that country has 
appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life 
in the air and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which 
shall at a minimum include effective means to identify and warn an 
aircraft before the use of force is directed against the aircraft.

The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this 
determination in the Federal Register and to notify the Congress of this 
determination.

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided to the 
President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the President issued Executive Order 13222. In 
that order, he declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States in light of the expiration of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). 
Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the 
Congress, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must 
continue in effect beyond August 17, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13222.

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Consistent with section 110 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of

Notice of September 10, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist 
Attacks

Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 
U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency 
previously declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with 
respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the 
continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.
Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared 
on September 14, 2001, and the powers and authorities adopted to deal 
with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14, 2010. 
Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national 
emergency that was declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the 
terrorist threat.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 2010-16 of September 15, 2010

Presidential Determination on Major Illicit Drug Transit or Major 
Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2011

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-28) (FRAA), I hereby identify the 
following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug-
producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, 
India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and 
Venezuela.

[[Page 368]]

A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse 
reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of 
cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory 
definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth 
in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit 
drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of 
geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit 
or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous 
enforcement measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, 
Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during 
the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under 
international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set 
forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Accompanying this report are 
justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, 
as required by section 706(2)(B).
I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 
706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that continued support for bilateral programs in 
Bolivia and limited programs in Venezuela are vital to the national 
interests of the United States.
Afghanistan continues to be the world's largest producer of opium 
poppies and a major source of heroin. The United States Government 
recognized the Government of Afghanistan's ongoing commitment to combat 
narcotics and the range of initiatives undertaken in this regard under 
the auspices of the government of President Karzai. A noteworthy 
achievement is the reduction of opium poppy cultivation from 157,000 
hectares in 2008, to 131,000 hectares in 2009, a 17 percent decline.
The connections between opium production, the resulting narcotics trade, 
corruption, and the insurgency continue to be among the most challenging 
obstacles to reducing the drug threat in Afghanistan. Poppy cultivation 
remains largely confined to provinces in the south and west where 
security problems greatly impede counternarcotics efforts. Nearly all 
significant poppy cultivation occurs in insecure areas with active 
insurgent elements, although progress has been made in stabilizing these 
regions. Nevertheless, the country must demonstrate even greater 
political will and programmatic effort to combat opium trafficking and 
production nationwide.
Pakistan is a major transit country for opiates and hashish for markets 
around the world, especially for narcotics originating in Afghanistan. 
Pakistan also is a major transit country for precursor chemicals 
illegally smuggled to Afghanistan where they are used to process heroin.
Pakistan is still challenged by extremist groups who have power over 
parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, particularly where 
most of Pakistan's poppy is grown. These extremist groups are also found 
in settled areas of the Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa Province such as its 
capital, Peshawar, and the Swat Valley. The Government of Pakistan is 
forced to divert law enforcement resources and equipment from poppy 
eradication efforts to address these incursions.
The Government of Pakistan remains concerned about opium poppy 
cultivation in Pakistan and is working to return to opium poppy-free 
status soon. A joint U.S.-Pakistan survey in 2009 estimated that 1,779 
hectares of

[[Page 369]]

opium poppies were under cultivation in Pakistan, approximately 130 
hectares less than was under cultivation in the country during the 
previous year.
The range of U.S.-Pakistan initiatives, which include programs to defeat 
the insurgency on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and prevent terrorist 
safe-havens, have the spin-off effect of helping Pakistan to fortify its 
land borders and seacoast against drug trafficking and terrorists, 
support expanded regional cooperation, and encourages Pakistan to return 
to opium poppy-free status. United States Government support focuses 
especially on upgrading the institutional capacity of Pakistan's law 
enforcement agencies.
Although Brazil no longer qualifies as a major drug transit country to 
the United States, narcotics control in this country which occupies such 
a large landmass in the hemisphere is of serious concern. Dynamic drug 
trafficking trends from Brazil are directed primarily at other 
countries, especially to and through Africa, and onward to Europe. For 
example, seizures of maritime vessels that departed Brazil in 2009, 
primarily to European destinations, recorded an unprecedented 2.2 metric 
tons of cocaine. With its vast terrain and shared borders with so many 
other countries, Brazil faces unique challenges in terms of patrolling 
so much illegal land, air, and sea activity. Brazil is seeking to reduce 
its growing domestic drug use at home, especially the use of cocaine, 
cocaine base, and crack cocaine, primarily from Bolivia; and marijuana. 
The United States recognizes Brazil's emergence as a forward-leaning 
regional leader for cooperation among neighboring states to thwart drug 
production, trafficking, and use. Like all hemispheric countries, it is 
important for Brazil to place narcotics and crime control at the top of 
its national security agenda to thwart these negative influences.
As Mexico and Colombia continue to apply pressure on drug traffickers, 
the countries of Central America are increasingly targeted for 
trafficking of cocaine and other drugs primarily destined for the United 
States. This growing problem resulted in Costa Rica, Honduras, and 
Nicaragua meeting the threshold for inclusion in the Majors List. Panama 
and Guatemala, already on the Majors List, are especially vulnerable 
because of their geographic location. Enhanced and effective 
counternarcotics measures are needed to thwart smugglers from moving 
illegal drugs through the seven countries on the isthmus, as well as the 
waters along the region's long Atlantic and Pacific coastlines between 
the coca producing Andes to the south and determined and flexible 
criminal trafficking organizations based in Mexico. United States 
Government support through the Central American Regional Security 
Initiative provides Central American countries with the opportunity to 
boost their rule of law institutions and promote greater regional law 
enforcement cooperation to counter drug trafficking and transnational 
organized crime.
United States and international data show a continued strengthening of 
illegal drug trafficking between Latin America and West Africa, 
especially via Brazil and Venezuela, with a considerable portion of 
illegal product destined for Europe. Nigeria, a worldwide drug 
trafficking focal point, makes counternarcotics a top national security 
concern for the country, but Nigeria's efforts are often thwarted by 
lack of resources, institutional capability, and corruption. A number of 
U.S. projects in Nigeria and other West

[[Page 370]]

African countries are aimed at building limited capacity to investigate 
and prosecute organized drug traffickers.
Drug traffickers continue to move significant quantities of cocaine 
through West Africa. For example, Gambian officials recently discovered 
over two tons of cocaine being stockpiled in the country. The crash of a 
Boeing 727 in Mali, which was believed to be carrying cocaine, points to 
new trafficking methods being used in the region. Drug trafficking 
remains a threat to security, good governance, and increasingly, public 
health in West Africa. Many countries in the region have weak criminal 
justice institutions and are vulnerable to corruption. The facilitation 
of drug trafficking by government officials continues to be a 
significant challenge, especially in Guinea-Bissau. The United States is 
encouraged that some countries are actively investigating illegal drug 
traffickers. Liberia, for example, worked closely with the United States 
to arrest suspects and deliver them into U.S. custody to stand trial.
The assistance of international donors and organizations to West African 
governments to improve their counternarcotics capability is increasingly 
urgent. The United States fully supports all efforts to promote, 
preserve, and protect the stability and positive growth of countries in 
West Africa.
The United States continues to maintain a strong and productive law 
enforcement relationship with Canada. Both countries are making 
significant efforts to disrupt the two-way flow of drugs, bulk currency, 
and other contraband. Canadian criminal groups continue to produce large 
quantities of MDMA (ecstasy) and high-potency marijuana that is 
trafficked to the United States. The frequent mixing of methamphetamine 
and other unknown substances into pills marketed as MDMA by Canada-based 
criminal groups poses an emerging public health risk in the United 
States, as well as in Canada.
The stealth with which both natural and synthetic drugs including 
marijuana, MDMA, and methamphetamine are produced in Canada and 
trafficked to the United States, makes it extremely difficult to measure 
the overall impact of such transshipments from this shared border 
country, although U.S. law enforcement agencies record considerable 
seizures of these substances from Canada.
At the same time, the Drug Enforcement Administration reports that of 
the amount of MDMA seized in the United States, about half was traced to 
Canada as its country of origin in 2009.
You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination 
under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish 
it in the Federal Register.

Notice of September 16, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who 
Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, the President declared 
a national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted 
by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by 
foreign terrorists, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
2001, in New York and Pennsylvania, and against the Pentagon, and the 
continuing and immediate threat of further attacks against United States 
nationals or the United States. Because the actions of persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an

Memorandum of October 4, 2010

Establishing a Task Force on Skills for America's Future

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
In order to compete in the global economy, the United States needs the 
most educated workforce in the world. The high-wage jobs of the 21st 
century will require more knowledge and skills than the jobs of the 
past. We therefore must develop innovative strategies to train more 
Americans with the skills that businesses and the economy will need to 
ensure American competitiveness.
Community colleges are a key part of our education system, providing a 
flexible and affordable place to sharpen relevant workforce skills and 
align them with the needs of employers in their communities. Traditional 
four-year colleges, on-line institutions, and nontraditional educational 
outlets also can play an essential role in providing training 
opportunities. To prepare students for 21st-century jobs, these 
institutions need to develop flexible, affordable, and responsive 
training programs that meet regional and national economic needs. An 
important way to ensure that training programs meet such needs is 
through partnerships between these institutions and labor unions, small 
businesses, and other regional employers. As educational institutions 
develop these innovative programs, we should assess what works and what 
does not, so that we reward excellent outcomes and true innovation that 
meets the needs of entrepreneurs and other employers in every part of 
the country, from rural communities to urban centers.
Therefore, I am establishing a task force to develop skills for 
America's future by identifying, developing, and increasing the scale of 
promising approaches to improving the skills of our Nation's workers. By 
coordinating the work of relevant agencies with that of nonprofits, 
labor unions, and private sector organizations, and by leveraging the 
assets of these entities, this effort will build better partnerships 
between businesses, community colleges, and other training providers to 
get Americans trained for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
Section 1. Establishment. There is established an interagency Task Force 
on Skills for America's Future (Task Force) to ensure that Federal 
policies promote innovative training programs and curricula, including 
successful public-private partnerships, at community colleges as well as 
in other settings, that will prepare the American workforce for 21st-
century jobs. The Chair

[[Page 376]]

of the Council of Economic Advisers, the Assistant to the President for 
Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy 
shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Task Force.
Sec. 2. Membership. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall 
consist of the following members, or any senior official designated by 
one of the following members who is a part of the member's department, 
agency, or office, and who is a full time employee of the Federal 
Government:
    (a) the Secretary of Defense;
    (b) the Secretary of Agriculture;
    (c) the Secretary of Commerce;
    (d) the Secretary of Labor;
    (e) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;
    (f) the Secretary of Transportation;
    (g) the Secretary of Energy;
    (h) the Secretary of Education;
    (i) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;
    (j) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
    (k) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
    (l) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and
    (m) the heads of other executive departments, agencies, or offices 
as the Co-Chairs may designate.
Sec. 3. Administration. The Council of Economic Advisers shall provide 
administrative support for the Task Force to the extent permitted by law 
and within existing appropriations.
Sec. 4. Mission and Functions. The Task Force shall work across 
executive departments and agencies to ensure that Federal policies 
facilitate, and offer incentives for, innovative career-training and 
education opportunities at community colleges as well as in other 
settings, and that these opportunities are directly related to skills 
and job requirements across a range of industries. Using the best 
evidence available regarding effective practice, the Task Force shall 
develop recommendations and options for meeting the following 
objectives:
    (a) improved public-private collaboration to develop career pathway 
and training programs with effective curricula, certifiable skills, and 
industry-recognized credentials and degrees;
    (b) identification of opportunities to amplify, accelerate, or 
increase the scale of, successful public-private partnerships that match 
trained workers with prospective employers;
    (c) identification and development of stackable credentials that 
provide entry to and advancement along a career pathway in an in-demand 
occupation;
    (d) outreach to relevant stakeholders--including industry, the adult 
workforce, younger students, educational institutions, labor unions, 
policymakers, and community leaders--with expertise in skill 
development;

[[Page 377]]

    (e) alignment of workforce training programs funded by the 
Departments of Education and Labor, as well as other Federal agencies, 
with innovative practices and regional market demands, to build on 
effective skills-based training for adult workers and younger students, 
including individuals with disabilities;
    (f) partnership with appropriate non-profit entities to engage the 
private sector in developing effective training programs that provide 
students with recognizable and portable skills that are needed in the 
marketplace; and
    (g) greater use of technology to improve training, skills 
assessment, and labor market information.
Sec. 5. General Provisions.
    (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of any necessary appropriations.
    (b) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
    (c) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and 
provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, 
as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Task Force. Each 
executive department, agency, and office shall bear its own expenses of 
participating in the Task Force.
    (d) The Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers is hereby 
authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal 
Register.

Notice of October 14, 2010

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant 
Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States 
and abroad.
Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States and cause an extreme level of violence, 
corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad, the national 
emergency declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted 
pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
beyond October 21, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50

respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. This

Provision of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of 
Brazil

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Brazil, that (1) interdiction 
of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in illicit drug 
trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary because of the 
extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the national 
security of that country; and (2) that country has appropriate 
procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air 
and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which shall at a 
minimum include effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before 
the use of force is directed against the aircraft.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this

the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), ordered related

Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and 
atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability.

[[Page 381]]

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Sudan, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the 
Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, in Executive Order 13400, the 
President determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States, expanded the scope of the national 
emergency to deal with that threat, and ordered the blocking of property 
of certain persons connected to the conflict. On October 13, 2006, the 
President issued Executive Order 13412 to take additional steps with 
respect to the national emergency and to implement the Darfur Peace and 
Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 3, 1997, as expanded on April 26, 2006, and with respect to 
which additional steps were taken on October 13, 2006, must continue in 
effect beyond November 3, 2010. Therefore, consistent with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Sudan.

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to Weapons of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such 
weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 
amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the 
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
activities. On June 28, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13382 
which, inter alia, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our 
ability to combat proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of

[[Page 391]]

delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States; 
therefore, the national emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, 
and extended in each subsequent year, must continue. In accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am

Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in 
Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, 
and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with 
Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2010. Therefore, 
consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year this national emergency with 
respect to Iran.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of December 22, 2010

Freezing Federal Employee Pay Schedules and Rates That Are Set By 
Administrative Discretion

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
On November 29, 2010, I proposed a two-year freeze in the pay of 
civilian Federal employees as the first of a number of difficult actions 
required to put our Nation on a sound fiscal footing. As I said then, 
Federal workers are not just a line in a budget. They are public 
servants who, like their private sector counterparts, may be struggling 
in these difficult economic times.
Despite the sacrifices that I knew a pay freeze would entail for our 
dedicated civil servants, I concluded that a two-year freeze in the 
upward statutory adjustment of pay schedules is a necessary first step 
in our effort to address the challenge of our fiscal reality. The 
Congress responded to my proposal by including such a freeze in the 
Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 
2011 (H.R. 3082), which I signed into law today (the ``Act''). The Act 
freezes statutory pay adjustments for all executive branch pay schedules 
for a two-year period. It also generally prohibits executive departments 
and agencies from providing any base salary increases at all to senior 
executives or senior level employees, including performance-based 
increases.
While this legislation will prevent adjustments in executive branch pay 
schedules that are made by statute, some laws allow such adjustments to 
be made by agency heads as an exercise of administrative discretion. In 
order to ensure consistent treatment of executive branch employees and 
to promote the fiscal purposes of my original proposal, agency heads who 
have such discretion should not provide any upward adjustments in 
Federal employees' pay schedules or rates during the two-year period 
covered by the statutory pay freeze.
Accordingly, you should suspend any increases to any pay systems or pay 
schedules covering executive branch employees that could otherwise take 
effect as a result of an exercise of administrative discretion during 
the period beginning on January 1, 2011, and ending on December 31, 
2012. You also should forgo any general increases (including general 
increases for a geographic area, such as locality pay) in covered 
employees' rates of pay that could otherwise take effect as a result of 
the exercise of administrative discretion during the same period. To the 
extent that an agency pay system

[[Page 394]]

provides performance-based increases in lieu of general increases, funds 
allocated for those performance-based increases should be 
correspondingly reduced to reflect the freezing of the employees' base 
pay schedule.
This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and 
consistent with executive departments' and agencies' legal authorities. 
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall issue guidance 
on implementing this memorandum, and is also hereby authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec.  102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec.  102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec.  102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 401]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec.  102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec.  102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

Sec.  102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

Sec.  102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints

jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which

    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec.  102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for 
making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.
