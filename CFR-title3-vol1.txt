                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

 Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2007 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2007 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 8099 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2007 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2008, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

             This book was prepared in the Presidential and Legislative 
     Publications Unit under the supervision of Gwendolyn J. Henderson. 
                                    Michael J. Forcina was Chief Editor.

Proclamation 8099 of January 11, 2007

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, Americans honor the 
memory of a man who stirred the conscience of a Nation. We also recommit 
ourselves to the dream to which Dr. King devoted his life--an America 
where the dignity of every person is respected; where people are judged 
not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character; 
and where the hope of a better tomorrow is in every neighborhood.
When Martin Luther King, Jr., came to our Nation's Capital in the summer 
of 1963, he came to inspire America and to call on our citizens to live 
up to the principles of our founding. His dream spread a message of 
hope, justice, and brotherhood that took hold in the hearts of men and 
women across our great land, and it continues to speak to millions here 
at home and around the world.
We honor Martin Luther King, Jr., and remember his strength of character 
and his leadership. We also remember the work that still remains. 
America has come a long way since Dr. King's time, yet our journey to 
justice is not complete. There is still a need for all Americans to hear 
the power and hope of Dr. King's enduring words so that we can hasten 
the day when his dream is made real. Last year, I was proud to sign the 
``Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act 
Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.'' This Act renewed the 1965 
bill that reaffirmed our belief that all men are created equal, broke 
the segregationist lock on the ballot box, and helped bring an excluded 
community into the center of American democracy. Our Nation will 
continue to build on the legal equality championed by Dr. King and all 
the heroes of the civil rights

[[Page 2]]

movement, and we will continue our work to protect the promise of our 
Declaration and guarantee the rights of every citizen.
As we observe Dr. King's birthday, let us honor his legacy and go 
forward with confidence as a Nation united, committed to destroying 
discrimination, and dedicated to extending the full blessings of liberty 
and opportunity to all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 15, 2007, 
as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all 
Americans to observe this special day with appropriate civic, community, 
and service programs and activities in honor of Dr. King's life and 
legacy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.
GEORGE W. BUSH


<R05>

Proclamation 8100 of January 11, 2007

Religious Freedom Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Religious Freedom Day, we commemorate the passage of the 1786 
Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, authored by Thomas Jefferson, 
and we celebrate the First Amendment's protection of religious freedom.
Across the centuries, people have come to America seeking to worship the 
Almighty freely. Today, our citizens profess many different faiths, and 
we welcome every religion. Yet people in many countries live without the 
freedom to worship as they choose and some face persecution for their 
beliefs. My Administration is working with our friends and allies around 
the globe to advance common values and spread the blessings of liberty 
to every corner of the world. Freedom is a gift from the Almighty, 
written in the heart and soul of every man, woman, and child, and we 
must continue to promote the importance of religious freedom at home and 
abroad.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2007, as

blessing of religious liberty, endeavor to preserve this freedom for 
future generations, and commemorate this day with appropriate events and

Proclamation 8101 of January 18, 2007

National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America was founded on the principle that we are all endowed by our 
Creator with the right to life and that every individual has dignity and 
worth. National Sanctity of Human Life Day helps foster a culture of 
life and reinforces our commitment to building a compassionate society 
that respects the value of every human being.
Among the most basic duties of Government is to defend the unalienable 
right to life, and my Administration is committed to protecting our 
society's most vulnerable members. We are vigorously promoting parental 
notification laws, adoption, abstinence education, crisis pregnancy 
programs, and the vital work of faith-based groups. Through the ``Born-
Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002,'' the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban 
Act of 2003,'' and the ``Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004,'' we 
are helping to make our country a more hopeful place.
One of our society's challenges today is to harness the power of science 
to ease human suffering without sanctioning practices that violate the 
dignity of human life. With the right policies, we can continue to 
achieve scientific progress while living up to our ethical and moral 
responsibilities.
National Sanctity of Human Life Day serves as a reminder that we must 
value human life in all forms, not just those considered healthy, 
wanted, or convenient. Together, we can work toward a day when the 
dignity and humanity of every person is respected.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, January 21, 2007, 
as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize this day with appropriate ceremonies and to underscore our 
commitment to respecting and protecting the life and dignity of every 
human being.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8102 of January 25, 2007

Fifth Anniversary of USA Freedom Corps, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The great strength of our Nation is found in the heroic kindness, 
courage, and self-sacrifice of the American people. Every day, 
individuals show the

[[Page 4]]

good heart of our country by volunteering to help make someone's life 
better. Since 2002, the USA Freedom Corps has provided access to 
volunteer opportunities for millions of Americans. On the fifth 
anniversary of the USA Freedom Corps, we honor volunteers who give their 
time and talents to make a difference in the lives of others, and we 
recognize that helping those in need makes America a more hopeful 
country.
The USA Freedom Corps was created to encourage Americans to answer the 
call to serve a cause greater than themselves. By matching willing 
volunteers with opportunities in their communities, the USA Freedom 
Corps brings Americans together to mentor children, assist the elderly, 
clean up neighborhoods, and perform countless acts of generosity. The 
USA Freedom Corps has helped support national service programs such as 
AmeriCorps, Citizen Corps, Peace Corps, and Senior Corps. Through 
programs like these, volunteers all across the country bring comfort and 
kindness to people at home and abroad.
Through the USA Freedom Corps website at volunteer.gov, all Americans 
can find ways to serve in our country's armies of compassion. By 
answering the universal call to help a neighbor, individual Americans 
can transform towns and cities into more caring communities and 
neighborhoods and make America a better place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 29, 2007, as the 
Fifth Anniversary of the USA Freedom Corps. I call upon the citizens of 
this great country to find ways to volunteer and help their fellow 
Americans. I commend the efforts of the USA Freedom Corps and all those 
who have already answered the call to serve, and I encourage all 
Americans to give of their time, energy, and talents to make America 
even stronger.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8103 of January 26, 2007

National African American History Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

African Americans have been an integral part of America for generations, 
and our Nation is stronger because of their contributions. During 
National African American History Month, we honor the achievements of 
African Americans and recognize our continued responsibility to strive 
for equality for all our citizens.
With grace and determination, African-American men and women have shaped 
our Nation and influenced American life. Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. 
DuBois, Rosa Parks, and Martin Luther King, Jr., advanced the cause of 
civil rights for all Americans and helped change the course of American

[[Page 5]]

history. Educators Booker T. Washington and Carter G. Woodson helped 
break down racial barriers in education to provide opportunity for all 
people. Americans have benefited from the achievements of scientists 
like George Washington Carver. Artists such as Pearl Bailey, Ella 
Fitzgerald, and Louis Armstrong inspired Americans and created some of 
the most celebrated music this Nation has ever produced.
The theme of this year's National African American History Month, ``From 
Slavery to Freedom: Africans in the Americas,'' recalls African 
Americans' long journey to justice and commemorates the courage and 
persistence of the heroes who called on our Nation to live up to its 
founding promise. A century after African-American soldiers fought for 
their freedom on the battlefields of the Civil War, African Americans 
struggled peacefully for their rights in the streets of Birmingham, 
Alabama, and on the Mall in Washington, D.C. Courageous civil rights 
leaders answered hate and discrimination with love and dignity, toppled 
segregation laws, and worked to make America a more just and hopeful 
Nation.
All Americans can be proud of the progress we have made, yet the work 
for a more perfect union is not done. As we celebrate National African 
American History Month, we reaffirm our commitment to build a society 
where every individual has the opportunity to achieve the promise of 
this great land.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2007 as National 
African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities that honor the significant 
contributions African Americans have made to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8104 of February 1, 2007

American Heart Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, 
claiming hundreds of thousands of lives each year. During American Heart 
Month, we renew our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease by 
increasing public awareness of this deadly disease and understanding of 
how it can be prevented.
Today, millions of Americans live with some form of cardiovascular 
disease, including congenital heart disease, coronary heart disease, and 
high blood pressure. Individuals can reduce their chance of developing 
these

[[Page 6]]

and other types of heart disease by exercising regularly, maintaining 
healthy eating habits and weight, avoiding tobacco use, and monitoring 
cholesterol and blood pressure levels. All Americans should speak with 
their doctors about the dangers of this disease and get regular 
preventive screenings.
My Administration continues to help raise awareness of heart disease 
through initiatives such as ``The Heart Truth'' campaign, sponsored by 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. First Lady Laura Bush 
serves as the National Ambassador of ``The Heart Truth'' campaign and 
works with partner organizations as part of her Women's Health and 
Wellness Initiative. The campaign informs women about the dangers of 
this deadly illness and encourages them to make cardiovascular health a 
priority. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the campaign, which 
uses the red dress as a symbol to remind women to protect their heart 
health and inspire them to take action. New data shows that fewer women 
are dying from heart disease, and more women are aware heart disease is 
the number one killer.
During American Heart Month, we honor the medical professionals, 
researchers, and all those whose tireless efforts are making a positive 
difference in the lives of those battling heart disease. By working 
together, we can continue to help the American people live longer and 
healthier lives.
In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has 
requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating 
February as ``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2007 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 
2, 2007. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and 
reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8105 of February 2, 2007

National Consumer Protection Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Consumer Protection Week, citizens are urged to learn 
more about the risks of fraud and identity theft and take precautions to 
protect themselves from these crimes.

[[Page 7]]

Americans can help prevent fraud and identity theft by becoming informed 
consumers. The Federal Trade Commission suggests that individuals 
safeguard personal information such as Social Security and account 
numbers, closely monitor their financial accounts, and report any 
problems or suspicious activity. When doing business through the 
Internet, it is especially important to protect personal data with 
appropriate software and commonsense security practices. Consumers and 
businesses can find resources on how to avoid identity theft and fraud 
by visiting the Federal Government's consumer protection website, 
www.consumer.gov.
My Administration is committed to protecting consumers from fraud, 
deception, and unfair business practices. In May 2006, I signed an 
Executive Order creating the Nation's first Identity Theft Task Force, 
comprised of the heads of executive departments and agencies. This Task 
Force is implementing a comprehensive strategy to prevent identity 
theft, prosecute those who commit fraud, and help victims. Through these 
and other efforts, we are helping to ensure that consumers have the 
tools they need to secure their personal information, monitor their 
financial accounts, maintain their privacy, and make responsible 
decisions to guard against fraud.
Consumer fraud takes advantage of the trust and integrity that 
characterizes our country's marketplace. By remaining vigilant and 
defending against fraud, Americans can protect their financial security 
and help our Nation's economy remain strong.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 4 through 
February 10, 2007, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon 
Government officials, industry leaders, and consumer advocates to 
provide citizens with information about how they can prevent fraud and 
identity theft, and I encourage all citizens to be responsible consumers 
and take an active role in protecting their personal information.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8106 of February 16, 2007

275th Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Two hundred seventy-five years after the birth of George Washington, we 
honor the life and legacy of a surveyor from Virginia who became 
Commander of the Continental Army, a major force at the Constitutional 
Convention, and the first President of the United States of America.
 Remembered by the Congress as ``first in war, first in peace, and first 
in the hearts of his countrymen,'' George Washington dedicated his life 
to the success of America. During the Revolutionary War, Washington's 
small

[[Page 8]]

band of hungry soldiers faced the professional army of a great empire, 
and his unshakable vision for a new democracy proved a powerful 
inspiration to his troops. Knowing that the outcome of their struggle 
would determine ``the destiny of unborn Millions,'' Washington led his 
often ragged forces beyond incredible hardships into battle and on to 
victory with strength, steadfastness, and a quiet confidence.
 The triumphant General treasured his brief time at home, but his 
devotion to duty and belief in the promise of a more perfect Union lured 
Washington from Mount Vernon. He presided over the Constitutional 
Convention with wisdom, diplomacy, and humility and helped form the 
working model of our democracy. When the Constitution was ratified, 
America again turned to a beloved and proven leader, electing George 
Washington as the first President of the United States.
 As we celebrate the life of George Washington and his contributions to 
the American experiment, we can also take pride in our stewardship of 
the Republic he forged. Today, he would see in America the world's 
foremost champion of liberty--a Nation that stands for freedom for all, 
a Nation that stands with democratic reformers, and a Nation that stands 
up to tyranny and terror. On his 275th birthday, George Washington would 
see an America fulfilling the promise of her Founders, honoring the 
durable wisdom of our Constitution, and moving forward in the world with 
confidence, compassion, and strength.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 22, 2007, as the 
275th Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington. I encourage all 
Americans to join me in honoring the Father of our Country with 
appropriate civic and service programs and activities in remembrance of 
George Washington and with gratitude for all he gave for his country.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The friendship between Ireland and the United States has deep roots, and 
Irish Americans have played an integral role in making our country a 
place of hope and opportunity. During Irish-American Heritage Month, we 
recognize the vital contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.
Since our founding, Irish immigrants have come to America's shores in 
search of better lives. Today, millions of American citizens are of 
Irish descent, and they and their forbearers have helped shape our way 
of life, strengthened our economy, and contributed to the arts, and 
protected our

[[Page 9]]

Nation. Irish Americans have shown their devotion to our country by 
serving in our Armed Forces. America is especially grateful to these 
brave men and women for the sacrifices that have helped preserve the 
ideals of our country and made the world a safer place.
During the month of March, we reflect on our Nation's past and how Irish 
Americans helped create the country we live in today. America is a 
melting pot of cultures, and Irish-American Heritage Month is an 
opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of Irish-American citizens 
and remind our people we are blessed to be a Nation of immigrants.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2007 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by celebrating the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.

Proclamation 8108 of February 27, 2007

American Red Cross Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American Red Cross demonstrates the power of human compassion and 
embodies the capacity for kindness and generosity of this great Nation. 
This month, we honor the men and women of the American Red Cross who 
exhibit the spirit and character of America by serving others in need.
Since its founding in 1881, the American Red Cross has helped millions 
of individuals overcome the effects of natural disasters and emergencies 
by providing shelter, food, counseling, and other assistance. It plays 
an important role in our communities by helping maintain our country's 
blood supply, offering programs for youth and the elderly, supporting 
members of the military and their families, and promoting health and 
emergency preparedness. This inspiring organization helps improve the 
lives of those in need and continues to assist in the recovery efforts 
in the Gulf Coast.
The humanitarian mission of the American Red Cross extends around the 
world. My Administration is proud to work with it to support efforts to 
combat malaria, measles, HIV/AIDS, and other diseases that affect 
millions of people each year in Africa and throughout the world. The 
American Red Cross is committed to helping improve the prevention and 
treatment of diseases and is working to strengthen community health 
programs in developing areas of the world. These efforts help save lives 
and show the strength and generosity of America.

[[Page 10]]

We are grateful for the tireless work of the volunteers and staff of the 
American Red Cross. During this month, we pay tribute to this remarkable 
organization and all those who have answered the call to serve a cause 
greater than self and offered support and healing in times of need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 2007 as American Red Cross Month. I 
commend the good work of the American Red Cross, and I encourage all 
Americans to help make our world a better place by volunteering their 
time, energy, and talents for others.

Proclamation 8109 of February 27, 2007

Women's History Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, the vision and determination of women have 
strengthened and transformed America. As we celebrate Women's History 
Month, we recognize the vital contributions women have made to our 
country.
The strong leadership of extraordinary women has altered our Nation's 
history. Sojourner Truth, Alice Stone Blackwell, and Julia Ward Howe 
opened doors for future generations of women by advancing the cause of 
women's voting rights and helping make America a more equitable place. 
In 1855, Dr. Mary E. Walker became one of the first female physicians in 
the country. Dr. Walker volunteered her medical services during the 
Civil War and became the only woman in United States history to receive 
the Medal of Honor. Vivian Malone Jones stood her ground in the face of 
a great injustice and helped integrate the University of Alabama, 
breaking down racial barriers to higher education and becoming the 
school's first African-American graduate.
Our Nation is a land of great opportunity, and women are seizing that 
opportunity and shaping the future of America in all walks of life. A 
record number of women are serving in the halls of Congress, and the 
number of women-owned businesses continues to grow. The women of our 
Armed Forces are making a vital contribution to our Nation's security by 
serving the cause of freedom and peace around the world. And by giving 
care and guidance, America's mothers are helping to build the foundation 
for the success of our Nation's children and strengthening the character 
of our country. This month, we honor the spirit, leadership, and hard 
work of American women.

[[Page 11]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2007 as Women's 
History Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that 
honor the history, accomplishments, and contributions of American women.

Save Your Vision Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our Nation, millions of Americans suffer from eye diseases and 
vision loss. During Save Your Vision Week, we reinforce the importance 
of proper eye care and raise awareness about how to protect and prolong 
healthy vision.
By taking simple preventative steps such as wearing sunglasses and using 
protective goggles while exposed to hazardous objects or environments, 
Americans can help maintain their eyesight. Regular eye exams are also 
key to safeguarding healthy vision. As a result of the Medicare 
Modernization Act, Medicare may pay the cost of exams for those who are 
eligible and have a high risk of diabetic eye disease or glaucoma. More 
information about healthy vision and eye care can be found by visiting 
nei.nih.gov. My Administration is committed to helping Americans lead 
better, healthier lives. By working with community organizations, eye 
care professionals, and compassionate citizens, we can increase 
awareness of the importance of regular and diligent eye care and 
encourage people to takes steps to maintain eye health and keep the 
precious gift of sight.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended 
(77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and requested the 
President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as ``Save 
Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 4 through March 10, 2007, as Save Your 
Vision Week. I encourage all Americans to learn more about eye care and 
eye safety, and take measures to help ensure a lifetime of healthy 
vision.

Proclamation 8111 of February 28, 2007

To Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free 
Trade Agreement With Respect to the Dominican Republic and for Other 
Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the 
``Agreement'') with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the ``Agreement countries''). The 
Agreement was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the 
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``Act'') (Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462) (19 
U.S.C. 4011 note).
2. Section 201 of the Act authorizes the President to proclaim such 
modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-
free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President 
determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Article 
3.3 and Annex 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty 
reductions with respect to originating goods) of the Agreement.
3. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Act, each Agreement country 
is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement enters into force with 
respect to that country.
4. Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Act, each Agreement country 
is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 
U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) on the date the Agreement enters into force with 
respect to that country, subject to the exceptions set out in section 
201(a)(3)(B) of the Act.
5. Consistent with section 213(b)(5)(D) of the CBERA, as amended by the 
United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) (Public Law 
106-200), each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration 
of designated CBTPA beneficiary countries on the date the Agreement 
enters into force with respect to that country.
6. Section 1634(c)(2) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law

Nicaragua provided in Annex 3.28 of the Agreement if the President 
determines that

[[Page 13]]

Nicaragua has failed to comply with a commitment under an agreement 
between the United States and Nicaragua with regard to the 
administration of such tariff preference level.
7. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United 
States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182) (the ``NAFTA Implementation 
Act''), incorporated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or 
appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
8. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides 
rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States 
originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for 
the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 
202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes 
the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set 
out in the NAFTA and to proclaim modifications to such previously 
proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the consultation and layover 
requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19

consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with 3 U.S.C. 301, when carrying out functions vested in the 
President by statute and assigned by the President to CITA, the 
officials collectively exercising those functions are all to be officers 
required to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of 
the Senate.
11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting 
import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.

of 2006, section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act, section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, and the 
Act having taken effect pursuant to section 107(a), do proclaim that:
(1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment 
being accorded under the Agreement to the Dominican Republic, to provide

the removal of the Dominican Republic from the enumeration of designated 
beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, to reflect the 
removal of the Dominican Republic from the enumeration of designated 
beneficiary countries for purposes of the CBERA and the CBTPA, and to 
make technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, 
the HTS is modified as set forth in Annexes I and II of Publication 3901 
of the United States International Trade Commission, entitled 
Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to 
Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free 
Trade Agreement With Respect to the Dominican Republic (Publication

Proclamation 8113 of March 16, 2007

National Poison Prevention Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the 45 years since the first National Poison Prevention Week was 
proclaimed by President John F. Kennedy, many lives have been saved from 
unintentional poisoning through awareness efforts across our country. 
This week, we reaffirm our commitment to the safety of our fellow 
citizens and to guarding against accidental poisonings.
Protecting our children is a solemn and special responsibility, and we 
must all continue to work to reduce the number of poison-related 
injuries and deaths. I encourage parents to make homes safer by keeping 
toxic substances sealed and out of reach and by carefully reading the 
labels on

[[Page 17]]

medicines before giving them to children and on household products 
before using them around children. In addition, carbon monoxide alarms 
can help protect against carbon monoxide poisoning, which claims the 
lives of hundreds of Americans each year.
If a poisoning is suspected, citizens can reach their nearest Poison 
Control Center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by calling 1-800-222-1222. 
This number should be called immediately at the first sign of a 
suspected poison emergency. The Poison Prevention Week Council website, 
poisonprevention.org, can provide additional information about poison 
prevention. By staying informed, being proactive, and remaining 
vigilant, we can avoid poison exposure and save more lives.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 18 through March 24, 2007, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to participate in 
appropriate activities this week and to learn how to prevent poisonings, 
especially among children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8114 of March 19, 2007

To Implement Modifications to the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act 
and the African Growth and Opportunity Act and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 5002 of the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through 
Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006 (Division D, Title V of Public Law 
109-432)(the ``HOPE Act''), which amends the Caribbean Basin Economic 
Recovery Act (Title II of the Trade and Development Act of 2000, Public 
Law 106-200)(CBERA), provides that preferential tariff treatment may be 
provided to certain articles that are imported directly from Haiti into 
the customs territory of the United States, provided the President 
determines that Haiti meets the eligibility requirements of section 
213A(d) of CBERA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2703a(d)), and Haiti is meeting 
the conditions regarding enforcement of circumvention set forth in 
section 213A(e) of CBERA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2703a(e)(1)).

[[Page 18]]

2. Section 6002 of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (Division 
D, Title VI of Public Law 109-432) amends section 112 of the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (Title I of the Trade and Development Act of 
2000, Public Law 106-200)(AGOA) to modify the preferential tariff 
treatment accorded to designated lesser developed beneficiary sub-
Saharan African countries.
3. Pursuant to section 213A(d) of CBERA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
2703a(d)), I have determined that Haiti meets the eligibility 
requirements set forth in section 213A(d)(1).

2006 (Public Law 109-432)(the ``Tax Relief Act'') suspended or reduced

December 27, 2006, modified the HTS to conform it to the International 
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. 
Modifications to the HTS are necessary to reflect accurately the 
suspension or reduction of duties that were enacted in the Tax Relief 
Act.
7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting 
import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
8. I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the Secretary 
of the Treasury to perform the functions specified in section 213A(f) of

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 604 of the 
1974 Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do proclaim 
that:

proclamation.
(3) In order to provide the tariff treatment provided for in Title I, 
subtitles A and B of the Tax Relief Act, and to make technical

Proclamation 8115 of March 21, 2007

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States and Greece share a long friendship built on common 
values and an abiding love for freedom. On Greek Independence Day, we 
underscore the warm ties between our countries, recognize the Greek 
Americans who enrich our society, and commemorate the anniversary of 
modern Greece.
The ancient Greeks entrusted their citizens with the right to govern, 
and they believed in the power of freedom to protect human dignity and 
basic human rights. Many of America's Founding Fathers studied Greek 
history and took inspiration from these democratic ideals as they framed 
our Constitution. The founders of modern Greece had the strong support 
of our own young democracy when they declared their independence in 
1821, and our nations have stood as allies in the major conflicts of the 
20th century. Today, we continue to defend freedom together in the 
global war on terror, as Greek and American Armed Forces work to lay the 
foundation of peace for generations to come.
On Greek Independence Day, and throughout the year, we celebrate the 
universality of freedom and the enduring bonds between Greece and the 
United States.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2007, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8116 of March 26, 2007

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A future of hope and opportunity in America requires that all our 
children develop the knowledge and character they need in life. On 
Education and Sharing Day, we recognize our responsibility to ensure 
that our young people have the foundation necessary to lead lives rich 
in purpose and fulfillment.

[[Page 34]]

Education and Sharing Day honors the legacy of Rabbi Menachem Mendel 
Schneerson and emphasizes our commitment to teach the next generation of 
Americans the values that make our country strong. The Lubavitcher Rebbe 
believed that society should ``make a new commitment to kindness,'' and 
he helped to establish education and outreach centers offering social 
service programs and humanitarian aid around the world.
The character of our young people is strengthened by serving a cause 
greater than self and by the anchor of virtues, including courage and 
compassion. By instilling a spirit of service in our children, we create 
a more optimistic future for them and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 30, 2007, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon government officials, 
educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to reach 
out to young people and work to create a better, brighter, and more 
hopeful future for all.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8117 of March 27, 2007

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All Americans share a responsibility to protect our Nation's children. 
During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to 
prevent child abuse and neglect and to work to enable our children to 
realize their full potential.
Childhood is a formative time, and abuse can have devastating long-term 
effects on young lives. In order to provide a safe environment for our 
young people, parents must work to protect their children from the 
dangers that threaten them. Family members, educators, public officials, 
and faith-based and community organizations all play important roles in 
helping to ensure that children are safe and can grow surrounded by love 
and stability.
My Administration is committed to supporting children and promoting safe 
and stable families across America. Last year, I signed into law the 
Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006, which will help to 
prevent and address child abuse and neglect by improving child welfare 
services and continuing vital mentoring and family programs. 
Additionally, the Department of Justice's Project Safe Childhood program 
and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 help 
officials at all levels of government protect our children and bring 
sexual and online predators, Internet pornographers who prey on our 
children, and other violent criminals to justice with stronger laws and 
improved coordination among authorities.

[[Page 35]]

As we observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we underscore our 
commitment to building an America where all children can thrive, develop 
character, and learn to be responsible citizens in an environment of 
security and love. By honoring our obligation to support and protect our 
young people, all Americans have an opportunity to make a positive 
difference in the life of a child and build a brighter future for our 
country. For more information about how each of us can help stop child 
abuse, please visit childwelfare.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2007 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I encourage all citizens to help protect 
our children and work to create strong, healthy communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8118 of March 28, 2007

National Donate Life Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Donating organs, marrow, and tissue is a kind and compassionate act that 
can protect and enhance the precious gift of life. During National 
Donate Life Month, we recognize the generosity of donors and raise 
awareness of the importance of donating.
In recent years, there has been great progress in this important effort, 
and the rate of organ donation has steadily increased--helping save 
thousands of lives. Despite this success, more than 95,000 Americans 
currently await organ transplants, and hundreds more are added to the 
transplant list each month. My Administration strongly supports organ, 
marrow, and tissue donation, and we are working with public and private 
groups to help more citizens understand the impact of organ donation.
Americans who wish to become organ and tissue donors can register with 
their State's donor registry, designate their intent on their driver's 
license, and sign and carry donor cards, which are available at 
organdonor.gov. I urge all citizens to consider becoming donors and 
encourage all donors to inform their loved ones of their decision so 
their wishes can be fulfilled. Every human life holds inherent dignity 
and matchless value, and National Donate Life Month is an opportunity to 
celebrate our country's organ and tissue donors. The decision to donate 
the gift of life demonstrates the compassionate spirit of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 36]]

laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2007 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
private organizations to help raise awareness of the urgent need for 
organ and tissue donors throughout our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8119 of March 29, 2007

Cancer Control Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Cancer Control Month is an opportunity to educate all Americans about 
cancer, to raise awareness about treatments, and to renew our commitment 
to fighting this deadly disease.
Through developments in medical science, we continue to make advances in 
the prevention and treatment of cancer. Yet millions of our citizens 
continue to live with some form of this disease, and it remains the 
second leading cause of death in the United States. Individuals can 
reduce their risk of developing cancer by practicing healthy eating 
habits, exercising, limiting sun exposure, avoiding tobacco, knowing 
their family history, and getting regular screenings from the doctor.
My Administration remains committed to the fight against cancer. In 
2005, the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome 
Research Institute launched the Cancer Genome Atlas, a revolutionary 
research project to help scientists understand the genetic sources of 
cancer. The discoveries from this project have the potential to bring 
about rapid advances in cancer research. And last year the National 
Institutes of Health invested more than $5 billion in cancer research.
We are making progress. Cancer related deaths have declined for 2 
consecutive years. Thirty years ago, there were only 3 million cancer 
survivors, and today there are more than 10 million.
During Cancer Control Month, we remember those who have lost their lives 
to cancer. And we commend the determination, courage, and strength of 
cancer survivors. Our Nation is grateful for medical professionals, 
researchers, family members, and friends who support cancer patients. 
Their dedication to these individuals is a reflection of the true spirit 
of America. Our country will continue the fight against cancer until it 
is won.
In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution (52 
Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103) as amended, requesting the President to issue 
an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 37]]

laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2007 as Cancer 
Control Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private 
businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join 
in activities that will increase awareness about the steps Americans can 
take to prevent and control cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8120 of April 5, 2007

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year on Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we 
underscore our commitment to supporting the citizens in the Pan American 
community, strengthening democracy in the Western Hemisphere, and 
advancing the cause of peace worldwide.
In 1890, the International Union of American Republics was established 
to promote cooperation among the Americas. Today, the United States and 
our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere are a community linked by common 
values, shared interests, and the close bonds of family and friendship. 
As the expansion of freedom continues in our region, the democratic 
nations of the Western Hemisphere are working together to build a safer 
and more prosperous society and to ensure that all the people of the 
Americas have the opportunity to achieve their dreams.
My Administration is working to advance the cause of social justice in 
the Pan American region, and we are committed to supporting our 
neighbors' efforts to meet the needs of their citizens. In 2004, we 
created the Millennium Challenge Corporation to provide increased aid to 
nations that govern justly, invest in the education and health of their 
people, and promote economic freedom. We are working with the citizens 
of the Pan American community to expand economic opportunity through 
debt relief and to encourage reforms through such mechanisms as the 
North America Free Trade Agreement, the Chile Free Trade Agreement, and 
the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade 
Agreement. These agreements facilitate the flow of trade and help 
establish market economies. We have also recently notified the Congress 
of our intention to enter into a free trade agreement with Panama and 
signed free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia. These agreements 
will generate export opportunities for the United States and benefit the 
people of Panama, Peru, and Colombia by providing economic opportunity 
and helping to strengthen democratic institutions. By working with our 
democratic neighbors to build strong and vibrant economies, we are 
helping the citizens of the Western Hemisphere realize the promise of a 
free and just society.

[[Page 38]]

The ties between the democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere are 
deep and lasting, and together we can continue our great strides toward 
freedom and prosperity for people everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2007, as Pan 
American Day and April 8 through April 14, 2007, as Pan American Week. I 
urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the 
United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The men and women of the United States Armed Forces have made great 
sacrifices to defend our Nation. They have triumphed over brutal 
enemies, liberated continents, and answered the prayers of millions 
around the globe. On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we 
honor the brave individuals who put service above self and were taken 
captive while protecting America and advancing the cause of freedom.
Throughout our Nation's conflicts, American prisoners of war have defied 
ruthless enemies and endured tremendous hardships as they braved 
captivity. Their strength showed the power and resilience of the 
American spirit and the indomitable character of our men and women in 
uniform. Their sacrifices are a great example of courage, devotion, and 
love of country.
Our Nation's former prisoners of war have helped secure the priceless 
gift of freedom for all our citizens, and we will always be grateful to 
them and their families. On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition 
Day and throughout the year, we honor the American heroes who have been 
taken as prisoners of war and remember their legacy of bravery and 
selflessness.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2007, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the 
United States to join me in honoring the service and sacrifices of all 
American prisoners of war. I call upon Federal, State, and local 
government officials and private organizations to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 8122 of April 6, 2007

400th Anniversary of Jamestown, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Four centuries ago, after a long journey, a small group of colonists 
stepped boldly onto the shores of the New World and established the 
first permanent English settlement in North America. During the 400th 
anniversary of Jamestown, America honors the early pioneers whose epic 
of endurance and courage started the story of our Nation.
The ideals that distinguish and guide the United States today trace back 
to the Virginia settlement where free enterprise, the rule of law, and 
the spirit of discovery took hold in the hearts and practices of the 
American people. Noble institutions and grand traditions were 
established in Jamestown. Amid tremendous difficulties, a determined few 
worked the land and expanded into the wilderness. Without knowing it, 
the colonists who built communities at Jamestown laid the foundation for 
a Nation that would become the ultimate symbol and force for freedom 
throughout the entire world.
Much has changed in the 400 years since that three-sided fort was raised 
on the banks of the James River. Today, we are a strong and growing 
Nation of more than 300 million, and we are blessed to live in a land of 
plenty during a time of great prosperity. The long struggle that started 
at Jamestown has inspired generations of Americans. Advancing the right 
to live, work, and worship in liberty is the mission that created our 
country, the honorable achievement of our ancestors, and the calling of 
our time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim 2007 as the 400th 
Anniversary of Jamestown. I encourage all Americans to commemorate this

Proclamation 8123 of April 11, 2007

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) teaches millions 
of children across our country how to resist drugs and violence. On 
National D.A.R.E. Day, we honor the individuals who help our Nation's 
young people avoid the dangers of substance abuse and become productive 
citizens.
For more than two decades, D.A.R.E. programs have taught America's youth 
about the devastating effects of drug use and encouraged them to lead 
drug-free and violence-free lives of purpose. By opening the lines of 
communication between law enforcement, educators, and students, all 
those involved in D.A.R.E. help save lives and stop drug use before it 
starts.
My Administration is dedicated to fighting drug use throughout our 
country. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is working with the 
Partnership for a Drug-Free America to teach our youth about resisting 
the pressure to use drugs. Additionally, the Helping America's Youth 
initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, encourages community 
partnerships that bring together families, faith-based and community 
organizations, and schools to help make a positive impact on the lives 
of young people. Through the Strategic Prevention Framework and the Drug 
Free Communities Program, we are also helping communities to develop 
effective local strategies to prevent substance abuse. By working 
together, we can reduce illicit drug use and help every child realize 
the promise of our country.
Youth development programs like D.A.R.E. encourage our Nation's children 
to make healthy choices that lead to a better future. This year's 
National D.A.R.E. day is an opportunity to renew our commitment to 
building strong, drug-free communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 12, 2007, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I urge all young people to make good decisions 
and call upon all Americans to recognize our collective responsibility 
to combat every form of drug abuse and to support all those who work to 
help our children avoid drug use and violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8124 of April 11, 2007

Thomas Jefferson Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Thomas Jefferson Day, we commemorate the birthday of a monumental 
figure whose place in our Nation's history will always be cherished. 
Thomas Jefferson was a scholar, statesman, author, architect, and 
patriot, and today we celebrate his many accomplishments and lasting 
legacy.
Thomas Jefferson continues to capture our imagination because our 
country still echoes his ideals. In 1776, as a young lawyer from 
Virginia, he drafted the Declaration of Independence for the Continental 
Congress and articulated the American creed. From that document was born 
a Nation with a message of hope--that all men are created equal and 
meant to be free. The words Jefferson penned were a bold statement of 
revolutionary principles, and they have lifted the lives of millions in 
America and around the world.
As the third President of the United States, Jefferson worked to realize 
the vision he held for our young democracy. He signed legislation in 
1802 that established the United States Military Academy at West Point, 
New York, and began the great tradition of service academies that have 
contributed immensely to the defense of our freedom. He believed in the 
possibility of westward expansion, doubling the size of our Nation with 
the Louisiana Purchase and encouraging the Lewis and Clark Expedition to 
help open the unknown West for future development.
Thomas Jefferson served his fellow citizens in many other important 
roles, including Governor of Virginia, Secretary of State, and 
Ambassador to France. Yet, of his many accomplishments, Thomas Jefferson 
will always be remembered for his belief in liberty and in the ability 
of citizens to govern their own country and their own lives. As we 
celebrate his birthday, we are proud that the Nation he helped establish 
remains free, independent, and true to the ideals of our founding. 
Today, the United States of America is the world's foremost champion of 
liberty, moving forward with confidence and strength, and an example to 
the world of what free people can achieve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 13, 2007, 
as Thomas Jefferson Day. I encourage all citizens to join in celebrating 
the achievements of this extraordinary American, reflecting on his 
words, and learning more about his influence on our history and ideals.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Volunteer Week, we celebrate the spirit of service in 
America and honor those who demonstrate the great character of our 
country through acts of kindness, generosity, and compassion.
Throughout the history of America, volunteers and civic organizations 
have helped extend the blessings of liberty and opportunity to our 
citizens. People across our Nation answer the universal call to love 
their neighbor by giving their time, talents, and energy to comfort 
those in despair, support others in need, and change lives for the 
better. The optimism and determination of our country's volunteers 
reflect the true spirit and strength of our Nation.
My Administration encourages Americans to seize the opportunity to help 
someone in need. Individuals can find ways to serve in communities 
throughout our Nation by visiting the USA Freedom Corps website at 
volunteer.gov. The USA Freedom Corps works to rally America's armies of 
compassion and bring together individuals and faith-based and community 
organizations committed to volunteer service. These efforts are helping 
to build a culture of service, citizenship, and responsibility across 
our country.
America's volunteers demonstrate that the strength of our Nation lies in 
the hearts and souls of our citizens. During National Volunteer Week, we 
recognize all those who have touched the lives of others with their 
kindness and who have made our country a better place by helping their 
fellow Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 15 through April 21, 
2007, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize 
and celebrate the important work that volunteers do every day throughout 
our country. I also encourage citizens to explore ways to help their 
neighbors in need and serve a cause greater than themselves.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence

Small Business Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Small Business Week, we honor small business owners and workers 
for their important role in ensuring that America remains the economic 
leader of the world. Every day, our Nation's small businesses help 
enhance the lives of our citizens and lead the way in an economy 
distinguished by low unemployment, sustained job creation, and one of 
the fastest growth rates of any major industrialized nation.
To help extend our Nation's prosperity, my Administration is committed 
to continuing the pro-growth economic policies that encourage enterprise 
and make America the best place in the world to do business. Our economy 
has created more than 7 million new jobs since major tax relief was 
enacted in 2003, and we are working to keep taxes low to help small 
businesses continue to expand. We are taking steps to make health care 
more affordable and available for small business owners and employees by 
encouraging Health Savings Accounts, supporting Association Health Plans 
legislation, and proposing a standard tax deduction for health 
insurance.

[[Page 44]]

My Administration is also committed to ensuring that small businesses 
can compete in the global economy.
By continuing to expand trade, we can open new markets for American 
products, lower prices for consumers, and create better American jobs.
 Small businesses are the lifeblood of cities and towns across the 
country, and we salute small business owners, entrepreneurs, and 
employees for enhancing our communities and expanding opportunities for 
all. The hard work and ingenuity of our Nation's small business men and 
women are helping to sustain America's economic strength.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22 through April 28, 
2007, as Small Business Week. I call upon the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs that celebrate the accomplishments of small business owners and 
their employees and encourage the development of new small businesses.

Proclamation 8128 of April 19, 2007

Dutch-American Friendship Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Dutch-American Friendship Day, we celebrate our longtime friendship 
with the Kingdom of the Netherlands and honor the many Dutch Americans 
who have made significant contributions to our country.
Our close partnership with the Netherlands dates back to the founding of 
our Nation, and it remains among our oldest continuous relationships. 
Many of the Pilgrims first sailed for the New World from a Dutch port, 
and when a small American warship approached the island of St. Eustatius 
in 1776, the Dutch port there gave the American flag its first friendly 
gun salute. A few years later, the Netherlands became one of the first 
nations to recognize the independence of the United States of America. 
The United States and the Netherlands are continuing that tradition of 
close cooperation in the 21st century, working together to bring hope 
and liberty to places where it has long been denied.
Dutch Americans have enriched the American experience and have helped 
write our history, strengthen our character, and shape our society. 
Today, we pay tribute to our allies in the Netherlands and recognize the 
proud citizens of Dutch ancestry who call America home.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19, 2007, as Dutch-

[[Page 45]]

American Friendship Day. I encourage all Americans to celebrate our 
country's Dutch heritage and the many ways Dutch Americans have 
strengthened our Nation.

National Day of Prayer, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A prayerful spirit has always been an important part of our national 
character, and it is a force that has guided the American people, given 
us strength, and sustained us in moments of joy and in times of 
challenge. On this National Day of Prayer, we acknowledge God's grace 
and ask for His continued guidance in the life of our Nation.
Americans of many faiths and traditions share a common belief that God 
hears the prayers of His children and shows grace to those who seek Him. 
Following the tragedy at Virginia Tech, in towns all across America, in 
houses of worship from every faith, Americans have joined together to 
pray for the lives that were lost and for their families, friends, and 
loved ones. We hold the victims in our hearts and pray for those who 
suffer and grieve. There is a power in these prayers, and we can find 
comfort in the grace and guidance of a loving God.
At this important time in our history, we also pray for the brave 
members of our Armed Forces and their families. We pray for their 
safety, for the recovery of the wounded, and for the peace we all seek.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on our 
Nation to reaffirm the role of prayer in our society and to respect the 
freedom of religion by recognizing each year a ``National Day of 
Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 3, 2007, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
ask the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, each according to his or 
her own faith, for the freedoms and blessings we have received and for 
God's continued guidance, comfort, and protection. I invite all 
Americans to join in observing this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Crime Victims' Rights Week is an opportunity to underscore our 
commitment to protecting the rights of crime victims and to recognize 
those who bring hope and healing to these individuals and their 
families. During this week, we especially remember and mourn the victims 
of the senseless acts of violence at Virginia Tech. A grieving Nation 
honors the innocent lives lost in this tragedy, and we pray for the 
families of the victims.
My Administration is committed to helping safeguard our communities and 
to ensuring that the rights of those who have been victimized by crime 
are protected. My Family Justice Center Initiative, announced in 2003, 
is now providing assistance and services for victims of domestic 
violence at centers nationwide. Additionally, last year I signed into 
law the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, which helps 
protect our youth by increasing the penalties for crimes against 
children and creating a National Child Abuse Registry. My Administration 
also supports a Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution to 
further protect the basic rights of crime victims.
During National Crime Victims' Rights Week and throughout the year, we 
remember and are grateful to our Nation's victim service providers, 
volunteers, law enforcement, and community organizations that support 
victims of crime through their commitment and compassion. To find out 
more information about victims' rights and volunteer opportunities, 
individuals may visit www.crimevictims.gov. Together, we can help ensure 
that crime victims have the rights and protections they deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22 through April 28, 
2007, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I encourage all Americans 
to help raise awareness and promote the cause of victims' rights in 
their communities.

National Park Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans take great pride in our country's natural beauty, and our 
Nation is blessed to have a park system of more than 80 million acres 
that belongs to us all. During National Park Week, we underscore our 
dedication to conserving these national treasures, and we pay tribute to 
the dedicated employees and volunteers of the National Park Service who 
care for them.
Established in 1916, the National Park Service now oversees a National 
Park System that has grown to include almost 400 sites, with parks in 
nearly every State. These parks protect beautiful landscapes, tell 
important stories about our country's past, and encourage our citizens 
to conserve our natural environment and celebrate our national history. 
They are places to learn, exercise, and spend time with family and 
friends. Through her work with the Junior Rangers and the National Park 
Foundation, First Lady Laura Bush and others are working to expand 
access to the riches of our parks.
In anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service in 
2016, my Administration has launched the National Parks Centennial 
Initiative. The initiative calls upon government, the private sector, 
and our citizenry to share in an effort to help prepare our parks for 
another century of conservation, preservation, and enjoyment. We will 
work to enhance park habitats, expand visitor services, increase 
educational opportunities, implement new technologies, and hire 
additional seasonal park rangers. By maintaining and improving our park 
system, we can ensure that our national parks will thrive for the next 
100 years and beyond.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22 through April 29, 
2007, as National Park Week. This year's theme is ``Your National Parks: 
Explore, Learn, and Protect.'' I invite all my fellow citizens to join 
me in celebrating America's national parks by visiting these wonderful 
spaces, discovering all they have to offer, and becoming active 
participants in park conservation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of

Proclamation 8132 of April 24, 2007

Malaria Awareness Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans are fortunate to live in a land that eliminated malaria 
decades ago. Today, our country helps fight this disease in Africa, 
because we believe in the timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is 
required. On Malaria Awareness Day, we renew our commitment to helping 
combat malaria in Africa and around the world.
Tragically, one child in Africa dies every 30 seconds from malaria, a 
disease that is highly treatable and preventable. To reduce malaria's 
mortality rate in the hardest-hit African countries, I announced the 
President's Malaria Initiative in 2005, a five-year, $1.2 billion 
program. At last year's White House Summit on Malaria, Laura and I were 
pleased to announce the expansion of this initiative to several 
additional countries. These efforts are making a difference, and 
millions of people have already benefited from insecticide-treated bed 
nets, indoor spraying, and anti-malaria medicine.
Across our Nation, Americans are answering the call to act. By simply 
donating an insecticide-treated bed net, one individual can help save a 
life. For more information about how to help and for a list of 
humanitarian organizations, visit fightingmalaria.gov.
Americans are a compassionate people who care deeply about the plight of 
others and the future of our world, and we can all be proud of the work 
our Nation is doing to fight disease and despair. By standing with the 
people of Africa in the fight against malaria, we can help lift a burden 
of unnecessary suffering, provide hope and health, and forge lasting 
friendships.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 25, 2007, as Malaria 
Awareness Day. I encourage Americans to answer the universal call to 
love a neighbor and join in our goal of eradicating malaria on the 
African continent.

During Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, we honor the many 
contributions citizens of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry have made to 
our great land.
The millions of Americans who trace their origins to nations in the 
Asian/Pacific region have enriched America. The entrepreneurship and 
innovation of Asian/Pacific Americans have strengthened our economy. 
Asian/Pacific Americans enrich our Nation with their strong values of 
love of family and community. Many Asian/Pacific Americans are serving 
the cause of freedom and peace around the world, and our Nation is 
grateful for their service. These good men and women defend our safety 
and contribute to the character and greatness of America.
To honor the achievements and contributions of Asian/Pacific Americans, 
the Congress, by Public Law 102-450, as amended, has designated the 
month of May each year as ``Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

National Charter Schools Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our country, charter schools are providing quality education for 
America's students. During National Charter Schools Week, we recognize 
the important contributions of charter schools and underscore our 
commitment to ensuring that all children receive the education they need 
to lead lives of purpose and success.
Charter schools are public schools that provide families with a valuable 
educational alternative. Because they are not bound by many regulatory 
requirements, charter schools have the flexibility to innovate in ways 
that will best meet students' academic needs. Today, there are about 
4,000 charter schools in 40 States and the District of Columbia helping 
more than one million students realize their full potential.

[[Page 50]]

My Administration is dedicated to providing parents with more choices so 
that their children will have the best opportunity to gain the skills 
necessary to compete and succeed in the global economy. Through the No 
Child Left Behind Act, we are setting high standards, expanding parents' 
options, and closing the achievement gap. Charter schools are getting 
results and helping guide children across the country on the path to a 
better life.
This week we thank educational entrepreneurs for supporting charter 
schools, and we honor all those involved in charter schools for helping 
their students reach high expectations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 29 through May 5, 
2007, as National Charter Schools Week. I applaud our Nation's charter 
schools and all those who make them a success, and I call on parents of 
charter school students to share their success stories and help 
Americans understand more about the important work of charter schools.

Law Day, U.S.A., 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation is built upon the rule of law and guided by our founding 
promise of freedom, equality, and justice for all. Law Day is an 
opportunity to celebrate the Constitution and the laws that protect our 
rights and liberties and to recognize our responsibility as citizens to 
uphold the values of a free and just society.
Generations of Americans have served the cause of justice and shaped our 
legal institutions to ensure that the blessings of liberty extend to 
every citizen. The men and women of America's legal community have 
worked to defend the Constitution, protect the innocent, and secure the 
rights of their fellow citizens. Their efforts have helped make our 
Nation a shining example of justice.
America's faith in the rule of law has endured through the centuries. 
Today, we strive to prepare our next generation of leaders to carry on 
America's tradition of freedom and democracy. The theme of this year's 
Law Day, ``Liberty Under Law: Empowering Youth, Assuring Democracy,'' 
highlights the importance of teaching our young people about the vital 
role they can play in our democratic society. We all have a duty to help 
our youth become responsible citizens by promoting the virtues that 
sustain our democracy and fostering a deeper understanding and respect 
for our Constitution and laws. These young men and women will shape the 
future

[[Page 51]]

of our country, and their spirit and character will help promote 
justice, equality, and opportunity throughout our country.
The strength of our legal system requires the ongoing commitment of 
every citizen. As we observe Law Day, we celebrate our Nation's legal 
heritage and honor those who work to advance the cause of justice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2007, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all the people of

Jewish American Heritage Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The faith and hard work of Jewish Americans have played an integral role 
in shaping the cultural fabric of America. During Jewish American 
Heritage Month, we celebrate the vital contributions of Jewish Americans 
to our Nation.
Throughout our history, Jewish Americans have contributed to the 
strength of our country and the preservation of our values. The talent 
and imagination of these citizens have helped our Nation prosper, and 
their efforts continue to remind us of America's gift of religious 
freedom and the blessings of God's steadfast love. Jewish Americans have 
worked to promote civil rights and build bridges of mutual understanding 
among the world's religions. Their deep commitment to faith and strong 
ties to family enrich our country and set a positive example for others.
This month is also a time to recognize the sacrifices of Jewish 
Americans who serve our Nation in the Armed Forces. These brave men and 
women are dedicated to freedom's cause, and all those who live in 
freedom live in their debt.
Jewish American Heritage Month is an opportunity to honor the 
accomplishments of Jewish-American citizens and to remember that our 
Nation is a melting pot of cultures. I join all Americans in celebrating 
the rich Jewish heritage and the many ways Jewish Americans contribute 
to a bright future for our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2007 as Jewish 
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month

America was founded by patriots who risked their lives to bring freedom 
to our Nation. Today, our citizens are grateful for our Founding Fathers 
and confident in the principles that lead us forward. On Loyalty Day, we 
celebrate the blessings of freedom and remember our responsibility to 
continue our legacy of liberty.
Our Nation has never been united simply by blood, birth, or soil, but 
instead has always been united by the ideals that move us beyond our 
background and teach us what it means to be Americans. We believe deeply 
in freedom and self-government, values embodied in our cherished 
documents and defended by our troops over the course of generations. Our 
citizens hold the truths of our founding close to their hearts and 
demonstrate their loyalty in countless ways. We are inspired by the 
patriotic service of the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform 
with honor and decency. The military spouses and families who stand by 
their loved ones represent the best of the American spirit, and we are 
profoundly grateful for their sacrifice. Our country is strengthened by 
the millions of volunteers who show deep compassion toward their 
neighbors in need. All citizens can express their loyalty to the United 
States by flying the flag, participating in our democracy, and learning 
more about our country's grand story of courage and simple dream of 
dignity.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of 
each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' This Loyalty Day, and throughout the year, 
I ask all Americans to join me in reaffirming our allegiance to our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2007, as Loyalty Day. I call upon the 
people of the United States to participate in this national observance 
and to display the flag of the United States on Loyalty Day as a symbol 
of pride in our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8138 of May 1, 2007

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month is an opportunity to educate 
Americans about the importance of healthy habits and regular physical 
activity. During this annual observance, we renew our commitment to 
helping keep our citizens physically active, and we recognize the value 
of incorporating exercise and sports into our daily lives.
Regular physical activity is vital to good health. By maintaining an 
active lifestyle, citizens can reduce their risk of developing chronic 
health conditions. Participating in outdoor activities and individual or 
team sports helps promote physical fitness. These activities also teach 
young people important life lessons, including teamwork, patience, and 
discipline.
My Administration is committed to helping ensure the good health of all 
Americans. This year is the fifth anniversary of the HealthierUS 
initiative, which helps Americans improve their personal health and 
fitness and prevent disease. The President's Council on Physical Fitness 
and Sports is spreading the message that a healthy America is a country 
that is physically active. Additionally, this year the Department of 
Health and Human Services and its partners launched a public awareness 
campaign to promote exercise and eating well to America's youth. This 
campaign encourages kids to ``Be a Player: Get Up and Play an Hour a 
Day.'' To find out other ways to improve health, Americans can visit 
fitness.gov or presidentschallenge.org. By making physical fitness a 
priority, our citizens can help prevent disease and live healthier 
lives.
NOW, THEREFORE I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2007 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon my fellow citizens to 
participate in athletic activities and make physical fitness a priority 
in their lives. I also encourage individuals, schools, and communities 
to celebrate this month with appropriate activities and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8139 of May 1, 2007

Older Americans Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Older Americans Month, we pay tribute to our senior citizens for 
the many ways they strengthen our Nation. Our country is blessed by 
their compassionate acts, the wisdom of their experiences, and the 
patriotism they demonstrate.
This year's theme, ``Older Americans: Making Choices for a Healthier 
Future,'' underscores the importance of making informed decisions 
regarding lifestyle and personal health. The President's Council on 
Physical Fitness and Sports encourages seniors to engage in physical 
activity through a program called the President's Challenge. By 
recognizing the importance of staying active, in conjunction with 
nutritious eating and proper medical care, older Americans can improve 
heart health, slow bone loss, and lengthen lives. By making an effort to 
enhance their quality of life, older Americans inspire younger 
generations to appreciate the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.
My Administration is working to modernize the Medicare system and 
provide better prescription drug coverage and health care so seniors 
have more choices and improved care. This year, I proposed a standard 
tax deduction for those who purchase private health insurance. The 
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 
and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, Medicare Part D, help 
seniors receive the medical services and the prescription drugs they 
need at more affordable prices.
This month, we honor older Americans for demonstrating the spirit of our 
Nation through their positive attitude, strong work ethic, and personal 
character. America will always be grateful for the legacy of 
responsibility and service they are leaving to future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2007 as Older 
Americans Month. I commend older Americans for the many contributions 
they make to our Nation. I also commend the Federal, State, local, and 
tribal organizations, service and health care providers, caregivers, and 
volunteers who dedicate their time and talents to our seniors. I 
encourage all citizens to honor their elders, care for those in need, 
and reaffirm our country's commitment to older Americans this month and 
throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8140 of May 7, 2007

Mother's Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Motherhood is one of the most cherished and valued roles in our society. 
On Mother's Day, we pay tribute to these dedicated women who give 
unconditional love and guidance to their children.
A mother's work requires extraordinary patience and compassion, and her 
example influences the formation of young lives. President Gerald Ford 
wrote that ``there is no undertaking more challenging, no responsibility 
more awesome, than that of being a mother.'' Mothers make great 
sacrifices and serve as caregivers and role models to help their 
children embrace dreams and aspirations. From these remarkable women, 
children learn character and values, the importance of giving back to 
their communities, and the courage to realize their potential. Mothers 
of military personnel provide support and encouragement while their sons 
and daughters defend our freedom in places far from home, and many 
mothers bring honor to the uniform of the United States while working to 
lay the foundations of peace for generations to come.
The bond between mothers and their children is one defined by love. As a 
mother's prayers for her children are unending, so are the wisdom, 
grace, and strength they provide to their children. On Mother's Day, we 
are reminded of the great debt we owe to our Nation's mothers for their 
love and devotion to their sacred duty.
To honor mothers, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 
1914, as amended (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May 
each year as ``Mother's Day'' and has requested the President to call 
for its appropriate observance. Throughout the year, and especially on 
this day, America's sons and daughters honor our mothers and celebrate 
their selfless gift of love.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 13, 2007, as Mother's Day. I encourage 
all Americans to show their gratitude and love to mothers for making a 
difference in the lives of their children, families, and communities. I 
call upon citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8141 of May 9, 2007

Military Spouse Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's military spouses inspire our Nation with their sense of duty 
and deep devotion to our country. On Military Spouse Day, we honor the 
husbands and wives of those who wear the uniform of the Armed Forces of 
the United States.
The husbands and wives of our service members have made significant 
sacrifices for freedom's cause, and they are an integral part of the 
success of our Armed Forces. Spouses may endure long periods of 
separation and frequent relocations, and they often set aside their own 
personal and professional ambitions for the benefit of their family and 
the Nation. Despite tremendous personal challenges, military spouses 
maintain everyday life for their families here at home, while sending 
love, prayers, encouraging words, and care packages to their loved ones 
stationed around the globe.
On behalf of a grateful Nation, we salute our Nation's military spouses. 
For ways to support our troops, their spouses, and their families, visit 
americasupportsyou.mil.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 11, 2007, as Military 
Spouse Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities and by expressing their 
gratitude to the husbands and wives of those serving in the United 
States Armed Forces.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8142 of May 10, 2007

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's transportation infrastructure is vital to our security, 
competitiveness, and prosperity and is critical to the everyday lives of 
our citizens. On National Defense Transportation Day and during National 
Transportation Week, we salute those in the transportation industry who 
work to help keep our Nation safe and moving.

[[Page 57]]

America is strengthened by transportation that helps to safely and 
efficiently transport our troops, deliver supplies, and serve in 
emergency situations. My Administration is committed to maintaining and 
modernizing our vast transportation infrastructure to serve the 
country's needs now and in the future. We continue to improve the safety 
and security of our roads, bridges, seaports, mass transit systems, 
airports, airplanes, and pipelines. Protecting our transportation 
systems increases safety for all our citizens and helps sustain our 
economy.
In addition to keeping Americans safe, our transportation system is 
critical to our citizens' everyday lives. Americans depend on our safe, 
reliable, and efficient infrastructure to travel for work or pleasure. 
Through the Department of Transportation, we are working to reduce 
congestion and improve the performance of America's transportation 
system.
There are many transportation professionals and military service members 
across our Nation who work to help ensure that our transportation 
systems run smoothly and continue to protect our homeland. We are 
grateful for their dedication and service, and we recognize their 
important contributions to making America's transportation system the 
strongest and most reliable in the world.
To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry 
and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, 
by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), 
has designated the third Friday in May of each year as ``National 
Defense Transportation Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 
1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), declared that the week during which 
that Friday falls be designated as ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 18, 2007, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 13 through May 19, 2007, as National 
Transportation Week. I encourage all Americans to learn how our modern 
transportation system contributes to the security of our citizens and 
the prosperity of our country and to celebrate these observances with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8143 of May 10, 2007

National Safe Boating Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Millions of Americans take advantage of and participate in the special 
beauty of our Nation's waterways. During National Safe Boating Week, we 
renew our commitment to raising awareness about the importance of making 
safe and sound boating decisions on the water.

[[Page 58]]

America's rivers, lakes, and oceans are wonderful places for boaters to 
gather with friends and family while enjoying the outdoors. As they do 
so, it is important that individuals avoid risky behaviors that can lead 
to boating accidents. Factors such as careless and reckless operation, 
inattention, and excessive speed contribute to accidents. To help ensure 
that individuals stay safe on America's waterways, the United States 
Coast Guard urges citizens to take basic safety precautions such as 
wearing a life jacket, participating in a boat safety course, getting a 
free vessel check, and never boating under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs. By practicing responsible boating habits, citizens can help 
contribute to a safer, more enjoyable experience on the water.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 19 through May 25, 2007, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors of the 50 States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing this week. I 
also urge all Americans to learn more about safe boating practices and 
always engage in proper and responsible conduct while on the water.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8144 of May 11, 2007

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In every American community, committed law enforcement officers watch 
over our neighborhoods and work to make our Nation a safer, more 
peaceful place. As we observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police 
Week, we honor the men and women who serve the cause of justice, and we 
pay tribute to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.
By taking an oath to serve and protect their fellow citizens, law 
enforcement officers answer a vital calling and accept a profound 
responsibility. These extraordinary Americans work to uphold our laws 
and serve on the front lines in the fight against crime and terrorism.
We owe a lasting debt to those who sacrificed their lives while serving 
and protecting our fellow citizens. These fallen officers live on in our 
national memory as Americans whose courage and commitment have shown the 
true meaning of heroism. We offer our respect and prayers to their loved 
ones.

[[Page 59]]

On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we recognize and 
honor the service and sacrifice of the men and women whose devotion to 
duty brings honor to our system of justice and makes America a better 
place.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended, (76 Stat. 
676), the Congress has authorized and requested the President to 
designate May 15 of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the 
week in which it falls as ``Police Week,'' and by Public Law 103-322, as 
amended, (36 U.S.C. 136), has directed that the flag be flown at half 
staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2007, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 13 through May 19, 2007, as Police Week. I call on all Americans 
to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I 
also call on Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half staff on Peace 
Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the 
flag at half staff from their homes and businesses on that day.

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Memorial Day, Americans pause with solemn gratitude and deep respect 
for all our fallen service men and women who have given their lives for 
our country and our freedom.
Through the generations, the courageous and selfless patriots of our 
Armed Forces have secured our liberty and borne its great and precious 
cost. When it has mattered most, patriots from every corner of our 
Nation have taken up arms to uphold the ideals that make our country a 
beacon of hope and freedom for the entire world. By answering the call 
of duty with valor and unrelenting determination, they have set a 
standard of courage and idealism that inspires us all.
All Americans honor the memory of the lives that have been lost in 
defense of our freedom. Our Nation mourns them, and their example of 
strength and perseverance gives us resolve. We are also thankful to 
those who have stood by our service men and women in times of war and 
times of peace.
Today, the members of our Armed Forces follow in a proud tradition 
handed down to them by the heroes that served before them. They are 
protecting our Nation, advancing the blessings of freedom, and laying 
the

[[Page 60]]

foundation for a more peaceful tomorrow through service that exemplifies 
the good and decent character of our Nation. America is grateful to all 
those who have worn the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, and we will never forget their sacrifices for our liberty.
On Memorial Day, we honor all those who have fallen by remembering their 
noble sacrifice for freedom. We also pray for our troops, their 
families, and for the peace we all seek.
In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a joint 
resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 Stat. 158), has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated the minute beginning at 3:00 p.m. local 
time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe the National 
Moment of Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 28, 2007, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m., local time, on Memorial Day. I encourage the 
media to participate in these observances. I also request the Governors 
of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the 
appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the 
flag be flown at half staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all 
buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States, and 
in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the 
people of the United States to display the flag at half staff from their 
homes for the customary forenoon period.

Proclamation 8146 of May 18, 2007

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, millions of Americans living in coastal areas are faced with 
the hazards of hurricanes. As hurricane season approaches, National 
Hurricane Preparedness Week provides an opportunity to raise awareness 
of steps that can be taken to help protect our citizens, and their 
communities and property.
Hurricanes can be devastatingly powerful and include storm surge, high 
winds, tornadoes, and flooding. To reduce the potentially deadly effects 
of these storms, it is imperative for people in hurricane-prone areas to 
prepare

[[Page 61]]

for each type of hurricane hazard. Taking the time to develop a family 
disaster plan, create a disaster supply kit, and stay aware of current 
weather situations can improve preparedness and help save lives.
My Administration is committed to strengthening our Nation's ability to 
prepare for, respond to, and recover from these types of disasters. I've 
asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to find ways to 
provide better assistance to those affected by catastrophe. FEMA has 
enhanced coordination between all levels of government during times of 
crisis and, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, is helping raise awareness about the dangers of 
hurricanes. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA 
provide Americans with important emergency preparation checklists and 
valuable resources about what to do after a disaster at ready.gov and 
fema.gov. By working together, citizens and Federal, State, local, and 
tribal officials can help safeguard lives and protect property.
Throughout the hurricane season, we are also grateful for the 
compassion, courage, and generosity of the volunteers and first 
responders who stand ready to help their neighbors in need. Their good 
hearts reflect the character of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 
2007, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, schools, and the media to share 
information about hurricane preparedness. I also urge all Americans 
living in vulnerable coastal areas of our Nation to take appropriate 
measures and precautions to protect themselves against the effects of 
hurricanes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

World Trade Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

World trade is essential to promoting global economic growth, 
development, freedom, and prosperity. During World Trade Week, we 
underscore our commitment to free and fair trade and acknowledge the 
benefits of open markets for our citizens and for people around the 
globe.
Trade creates wealth and opportunities, and United States engagement in 
the global economy has contributed to rising living standards throughout 
our country. Businesses that participate in international trade are more 
productive, have higher employment growth, and pay greater wages. 
Advancing free trade on a level playing field helps ensure that America 
benefits from the international market.

[[Page 62]]

My Administration is committed to reducing barriers to trade, 
strengthening our strategic partnerships, and promoting economic growth 
throughout the world. At the beginning of my Administration, America had 
free trade agreements with three countries. Today, we have free trade 
agreements in force with 14 countries, creating benefits for American 
businesses, workers, and consumers. These trade agreements are 
particularly important for small and medium-sized companies to help them 
identify and take full advantage of new trade opportunities.
The United States continues to work with other nations in the World 
Trade Organization to complete the Doha Development Round, which has the 
potential to lift millions of people out of poverty. I have also called 
upon the Congress to extend Trade Promotion Authority so we can complete 
the Doha Round and continue to negotiate robust trade agreements. By 
working to expand trade, we open new markets for American products and 
services and help build free economies that can raise the standard of 
living for families.
NOW, THEREFORE I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 
2007, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
the benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.

Proclamation 8148 of May 18, 2007

National Maritime Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America has a proud maritime history, and the United States Merchant 
Marine has played a vital role in helping meet our country's economic 
and national security needs. On National Maritime Day, we honor merchant 
mariners for their dedication to promoting commerce and protecting our 
freedom.
During times of peace, the U.S. Merchant Marine helps ensure our 
economic security by keeping the oceans open to trade. Ships operated by 
merchant mariners transport goods across our Nation's waterways and on 
the high seas around the world to connect American businesses and 
consumers with valuable foreign markets and commodities. The skill and 
expertise of merchant mariners facilitates trade and helps to strengthen 
our economy.
In times of war, the Merchant Marine is the lifeline of our troops 
overseas. By carrying critical supplies, equipment, and personnel, 
merchant mariners provide essential support to our Armed Forces and help 
advance the cause

[[Page 63]]

of freedom. Today, merchant mariners are supporting operations in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, and their devotion to duty is a tribute to the 
generations of men and women who have served our Nation with courage and 
determination in every conflict in America's history. On this day, and 
throughout the year, America is grateful for their service.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 20, 1933, as amended, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2007, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance by 
honoring the service of merchant mariners and by displaying the flag of 
the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also 
request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on 
that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8149 of May 25, 2007

Great Outdoors Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Great Outdoors Month, we celebrate the rich blessings of our 
Nation's natural beauty, and we renew our commitment to protecting our 
environment so that we can leave our children and grandchildren a 
healthy and flourishing land. This month is also an opportunity to pay 
tribute to those whose hard work and dedication keep our country's open 
spaces beautiful and accessible to our citizens.
Through recreational activities such as fishing, skiing, biking, and 
nature watching, we can teach our young people about the wonders of our 
Nation's landscapes. Experiencing our Nation's natural splendor 
contributes to healthier lives for our citizens and a deeper 
appreciation for the great outdoors.
My Administration is working to protect and conserve our natural wonders 
for future generations. To keep our National Park System vibrant, we 
requested the highest increase ever in park operations funding in the FY 
2008 Budget and launched the National Parks Centennial Initiative. We 
are also promoting responsible stewardship and conservation of our air, 
water, and land. Harmful air pollutants are down more than 10 percent 
since 2001, but there is more work to be done. Through the ``Twenty in 
Ten'' plan, my Administration aims to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
from motor vehicles and reduce America's dependence on oil by cutting 
our gasoline usage by 20 percent over the next 10 years.

[[Page 64]]

In addition, we have restored, improved, or protected millions of acres 
of wetlands and enhanced our parks and wildlife refuges. We are also 
encouraging cooperative conservation, innovation, and new technologies 
to help ensure America's outdoors remain places where families and 
friends can learn, exercise, and create meaningful memories.
Countless citizens volunteer their time and talents to protect America's 
natural resources. By working together with the private and non-profit 
sectors and the general public, we can help preserve our local parks, 
lakes, rivers, and working lands. I am grateful for the efforts of all 
those who work to conserve our Nation's natural wonders, and I encourage 
citizens to visit takepride.gov to learn about more opportunities to 
help keep our environment healthy and safe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Proclamation 8150 of May 30, 2007

National Oceans Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation benefits from the oceans that contain precious natural 
treasures, carry much of our trade, and provide us with food and 
recreational opportunities. During National Oceans Month, we celebrate 
these benefits, and we underscore our commitment to being good stewards 
of the oceans.
Since the release of my Ocean Action Plan in 2004, my Administration has 
made great strides in ocean conservation by working with State, tribal, 
and local governments, the private sector, and our international 
partners in the spirit of cooperative conservation. In June 2006, I 
designated a national monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to 
celebrate the area's natural, cultural, and historical importance. The 
tropical waters of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument are a 
sanctuary for 7,000 marine species. This important Monument is our 
Nation's largest single conservation area and the largest protected 
marine area in the world. Earlier this year, I was also proud to sign 
into law the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management 
Reauthorization Act of 2006 to end over-fishing and rebuild our Nation's 
fish stocks through more effective, market-based management. 
Internationally, we continue to lead in protecting the maritime 
environment while preserving the navigational freedoms essential to the 
security and prosperity of every nation. By working

[[Page 65]]

to build a well managed system of offshore aquaculture, we can provide a 
healthy source of food and reduce pressure on our ocean ecosystems.
During National Oceans Month and throughout the year, we recognize all 
who are dedicated to making our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes cleaner, 
healthier, and more productive, including the many Federal agencies that 
make up the Committee on Ocean Policy. One of these agencies, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, celebrates two 
centuries of dedicated research and conservation of coastal and marine 
environments. By continuing to work together, we can conserve and enjoy 
the splendor of these magnificent waters now and for generations to 
come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 2007 as National Oceans Month. I call 
upon the people of the United States to learn more about the vital role 
oceans play in the life of our country and ways we can conserve their 
many national treasures. I encourage all our citizens to observe this 
month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8151 of May 31, 2007

Black Music Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Black Music Month, we recognize the outstanding contributions 
that African-American singers, composers, and musicians have made to our 
country, and we express our appreciation for the extraordinary music 
that has enriched our Nation.
The music of African-American musicians has helped shape our national 
character and become an important part of our musical heritage. Often 
born out of great pain and strong faith, that music has helped African 
Americans endure tremendous suffering and overcome injustice with 
courage, faith, and hope. By speaking to the human experience and 
expressing heartfelt emotion, African-American artists have inspired 
people across the generations in America and around the world with their 
vision and creativity.
This month is an opportunity to honor the men and women who have created 
some of the best music America has ever produced. Great musical talents 
such as Ray Charles, Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, Ella Fitzgerald, 
Duke Ellington, and James Brown have enriched our culture with 
innovative talent and artistic legacies that continue to influence 
musicians today. We remember so many wonderful artists and celebrate the 
achievements of black musicians whose work reflects the diversity of our 
citizens and lifts the human spirit.

[[Page 66]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2007 as Black Music 
Month. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the history of 
black music and to enjoy the great contributions of African-American 
musicians.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8152 of May 31, 2007

National Child's Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today's children are tomorrow's leaders, and our Nation has a 
responsibility to ensure that they develop the character and skills 
needed to succeed. On National Child's Day, we underscore our commitment 
to our children and pledge to provide them with the care, protection, 
and education they deserve.
Children are great blessings in our lives. They rely on the love and 
guidance of parents, family members, mentors from faith-based and 
community organizations, and teachers to help them gain a sense of 
confidence and learn that their actions have consequences. All of us 
play an important role in teaching our children that the decisions they 
make today will affect them for the rest of their lives.
My Administration is committed to helping young Americans reach their 
full potential. One of my top priorities is to reauthorize the No Child 
Left Behind Act, a good law that has brought great progress. Students 
are scoring higher and beginning to close the achievement gap, proving 
that when we set expectations high, America's schools and students will 
rise to meet them. My Administration is also ensuring that our country 
is competitive by enhancing math and science education through the 
American Competitiveness Initiative. Additionally, the Department of 
Health and Human Services and its partners are working to prevent 
childhood obesity by encouraging America's youth to exercise and 
practice healthy eating habits. And the Helping America's Youth 
initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, raises awareness about the 
challenges that face our young people and motivates caring adults to 
connect with children in three key areas: family, school, and community. 
We will continue to work to provide a safe environment and a quality 
education for our Nation's boys and girls to ensure that they are 
prepared to lead lives of purpose and success.
On National Child's Day and throughout the year, we are grateful for 
young Americans and those who support them. Through a loving commitment 
to America's youth, we can create a more hopeful society, build a bright 
future for our country, and encourage our children to achieve their 
dreams.

[[Page 67]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 3, 2007 as National 
Child's Day. I call upon our citizens to celebrate National Child's Day 
with the appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also urge all 
Americans to dedicate time and energy to educating our youth and 
providing them with a safe and caring environment.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During June, we recognize Caribbean Americans and celebrate the many 
ways they contribute to our Nation.
Generations of Caribbean Americans have helped shape the spirit and 
character of our country. These individuals are justly proud of their 
Caribbean roots, and they enrich the American experience by sharing 
their traditions, history, and values. Caribbean Americans of all walks 
of life have added to the vitality, success, and prosperity of our 
country. Their hard work and determination inspire all who dream of a 
better life for themselves and their families.
Our Nation is deeply grateful to the Caribbean Americans who defend our 
liberty as members of our Armed Forces. The service and sacrifice of 
these courageous men and women are helping lay the foundation of peace 
for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2007 as Caribbean-
American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to learn more about 
the history and culture of Caribbean Americans and their contributions 
to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of

Proclamation 8154 of June 1, 2007

National Homeownership Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Owning a home is part of the American dream, and National Homeownership 
Month is an opportunity to encourage our citizens to explore the 
benefits of owning a home.
Owning a home provides a source of security and stability for many of 
our citizens. My Administration is committed to fostering an ownership 
society and helping more Americans realize the great promise of our 
country. Today, nearly 70 percent of Americans own their homes, and the 
rate of minority homeownership has climbed to above 50 percent since I 
took office in 2001. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is 
continuing to enforce the Fair Housing Act to confront housing 
discrimination and advance equal housing opportunities for everyone. We 
are also working with the Congress to modernize the Federal Housing 
Administration in order to better provide safe, fair, and affordable 
mortgages to first-time homeowners, minorities, and individuals with 
less than perfect credit. In addition, the American Dream Downpayment 
Act of 2003 is helping thousands of low to moderate income and minority 
families with the downpayment and closing costs on their homes. My 
Administration also continues to support more funding for the Self-Help 
Homeownership Opportunity Program and the HOME Investment Partnership 
Program, which provide low-income citizens and minorities with more 
homeownership opportunities.
During National Homeownership Month and throughout the year, I urge 
citizens to consider homeownership opportunities in their communities, 
and I applaud American homeowners for helping fuel the economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2007 as National 
Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to join 
me in recognizing the importance of homeownership and building a more 
prosperous future.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8155 of June 5, 2007

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American Flag represents freedom and has been an enduring symbol of 
our Nation's ideals since the earliest days of our Nation. Wherever it 
flies, we are reminded of America's unity and in the great cause of 
liberty and justice for all.
Two hundred and thirty years ago, the Second Continental Congress 
officially made the Stars and Stripes the symbol of America. The 
Founders declared that the 13 stars gracing the original flag 
represented ``a new constellation,'' just as America embodied new hope 
and new light for mankind. Today, our flag continues to convey the bold 
spirit of a proud and determined Nation.
Americans have long flown our flag as a sign of patriotism and gratitude 
for the blessings of liberty. We also pledge allegiance to the flag as 
an expression of loyalty to our country and to the belief in the 
American creed of freedom and justice. By displaying and showing respect 
for the flag, we honor the ideals upon which our democracy rests and 
show appreciation for the freedoms we enjoy today. Flying the flag can 
also be an expression of thanks for the men and women who have served 
and sacrificed in defense of our freedoms--from the early patriots of 
the Continental Army to the courageous Americans in uniform who are 
defending those freedoms around the world today.
During Flag Day and National Flag Week, we honor Old Glory and reflect 
on the foundations of our freedom. As citizens of this great Nation, we 
are proud of our heritage, grateful for our liberty, and confident in 
our future.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all citizens of the 
United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2007, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 10, 2007, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
suitable places. I also call upon the people of the United States to 
observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through 
Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a 
time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings 
and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the 
Flag of the United States of America.

Proclamation 8156 of June 11, 2007

Father's Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Father's Day, we reflect on the many ways that fathers contribute to 
the lives of their children with spoken words and unspoken kindness.
Fathers are one of the most important influences in the lives of 
children, and their unconditional love is an indispensable anchor of 
certainty and strength. By placing their family's well-being above their 
own, fathers provide children with an example of what it means to be a 
responsible person. Through unwavering devotion and daily sacrifice, 
fathers work to create an environment where children are protected and 
encouraged. Fathers instill in their children an understanding of right 
and wrong and help them to grow in confidence and character. These 
dedicated men strive to give their sons and daughters the necessary 
foundation to make good choices and lead lives of purpose.
On Father's Day and throughout the year, we honor the men who have taken 
on the great joy and responsibility of fatherhood, and we celebrate 
their extraordinary impact and influence. All Americans are especially 
grateful to the many fathers who are serving their country as members of 
the Armed Forces, and we lift them and their loved ones up in prayer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 17, 
2007, as Father's Day. I encourage all Americans to express admiration 
and appreciation to fathers for their many contributions to our Nation's 
children. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to 
display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on 
this day. I also call upon State and local governments and citizens to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8157 of June 28, 2007

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences, Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and 
Opportunity Act, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
(the ``1974 Act'')(19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing 
countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary 
developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as 
provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to competitive need limitations on the 
preferential treatment afforded under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) to eligible articles.
2. Section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(C)) 
provides that a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary 
developing country with respect to an eligible article may be 
redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such 
article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the 
competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act 
during the preceding calendar year.
3. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) 
provides that the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from 
any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of 
the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
4. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)), 
the President may waive the application of the competitive need 
limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary 
developing country if certain conditions are met.
5. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(5)), 
any waiver granted under section 503(d) shall remain in effect until the 
President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to 
changed circumstances.
6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that in 2006 certain beneficiary developing countries have exported 
certain eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable 
competitive need limitation, and I therefore terminate the duty-free 
treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.
7. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, and subject to the 
considerations set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2461 and 2462), I have determined to redesignate certain 
countries as beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain 
eligible articles that

[[Page 72]]

previously had been imported in quantities exceeding the competitive 
need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act.
8. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect 
to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing 
countries.
9. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the 
advice of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) on 
whether any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely 
affected by such waivers, and I have determined, based on that advice 
and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 
1974 Act, and after giving great weight to the considerations in section 
503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are 
in the national economic interest of the United States. Accordingly, I 
have determined that the competitive need limitations of section 
503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act should be waived with respect to certain 
eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.
10. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain previously granted waivers of the competitive need 
limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act are no longer 
warranted due to changed circumstances.
11. Section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added 
by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of 
Public Law 106-200)(AGOA), authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if the President determines that 
the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 
of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set 
forth in section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
12. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an eligible sub-Saharan 
African country if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
13. Section 112(c) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)) provides special 
rules for certain apparel articles imported from lesser developed 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.
14. In Proclamation 7970 of December 22, 2005, I determined that the 
Islamic Republic of Mauritania (Mauritania) was not making continual 
progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of 
the 1974 Act and terminated the designation of Mauritania as a 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of 
the 1974 Act.
15. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that Mauritania now meets the eligibility 
requirements set forth or referenced therein, and I have decided to 
redesignate Mauritania as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
16. I further determine that Mauritania satisfies the criterion for 
treatment as a ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country'' under section 112(c) of the AGOA.

[[Page 73]]

17. Presidential Proclamation 8114 of March 19, 2007, implemented 
section 112 of the AGOA, as amended in section 6002 of the Africa 
Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (Division D, Title VI, Public Law 109-
432)(19 U.S.C. 3721(c)(2)(A)). Technical corrections to the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are necessary to implement 
the intended tariff treatment.
18. In Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, I modified 
the HTS, pursuant to section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the ``1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3006), to 
conform it to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity 
Description and Coding System (the ``Convention''). Additional 
conforming changes to the HTS are required to implement the intended 
tariff treatment.
19. Section 2004(b)(1)(B) of the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical 
Corrections Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-429) amended section 
213(b)(2)(A)(v) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 
2703(b)(2)(A)(v)). A modification to the HTS needs to be made to reflect 
this amendment.
20. On April 22, 1985, the United States entered into the Agreement on 
the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of Israel (the ``Israel 
FTA''), which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free 
Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``Israel FTA Act'')(19 U.S.C. 
2112 note). In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and 
mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade 
with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an 
agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in 
agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through 
December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 Agreement'').
21. Presidential Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, implemented the 
2004 Agreement. Technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to 
reflect the tariff treatment intended under the 2004 Agreement for the 
years 2007 and 2008.
22. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to title V and 
section 604 of the 1974 Act, section 4 of the Israel FTA Act, section 
1206 of the 1988 Act, and section 104 of the AGOA, do hereby proclaim: 
(1) In order to provide that one or more countries that have not been 
treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more 
eligible articles should be redesignated as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to such article or articles for purposes of the 
GSP, and, in order to provide that one or more countries should no 
longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to 
one or more eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) 
to the HTS is modified as set forth in section A of Annex I to this 
proclamation.
(2) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles for 
purposes of the GSP when imported from any beneficiary developing 
country, the Rates

[[Page 74]]

of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for such HTS subheadings is modified as set

(3) In order to provide that one or more countries should not be treated 
as beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain eligible 
articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn 
for such HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in section B(2) of 
Annex I to this proclamation.
(4) The competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act is disregarded with respect to the 
eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary 
developing countries listed in Annex II to this proclamation.
(5) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act 
shall apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the 
beneficiary developing countries set forth in Annex III to this 
proclamation.
(6) The waivers of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 
Act to the articles in the HTS subheading and to the beneficiary 
developing countries listed in Annex IV to this proclamation are 
revoked.
(7) Mauritania is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan African country 
and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
(8) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) 
to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list 
of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ``Islamic Republic of 
Mauritania,'' effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after July 1, 2007.
(9) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, Mauritania is a lesser 
developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
(10) In order to provide the tariff treatment intended under section 112 
of the AGOA, as amended, the HTS is modified as set forth in section A 
of Annex V to this proclamation.
(11) In order to conform the HTS to the Convention or any amendment 
thereto recommended for adoption, to promote the uniform application of 
the Convention, to establish additional subordinate tariff categories, 
and to make technical and conforming changes to existing provisions, the

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In order to foster democratic institutions in Lebanon, to help the

Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or 
nonimmigrants, of the following aliens is hereby suspended:

employees, or any other person.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day

first.

Proclamation 8160 of July 10, 2007

Captive Nations Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Liberty is the path to lasting peace and the unalienable right of every 
man, woman, and child. During Captive Nations Week, we underscore our 
commitment to protecting human rights, advancing democracy and freedom, 
and ending tyranny across the globe.
Expanding freedom is a moral imperative, and today more people are free 
than ever before. Freedom is reaching around the world, and America is 
working side-by-side with new democracies in Liberia, Mauritania, 
Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. The people of Kuwait held elections in 
which women were able to vote and run for office for the first time, and 
the elected parliament is exercising real influence with the government. 
We continue to stand firmly behind the citizens of Lebanon, Afghanistan, 
and Iraq as they defend their democratic gains against extremist 
enemies. Many are making great sacrifices for liberty, and they deserve 
our steadfast support.
While there is progress in freedom's advance, nations such as Belarus, 
Burma, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Sudan, and Zimbabwe still oppress 
their citizens. My Administration recently created the Human Rights 
Defenders Fund to provide grants for the legal defense and medical 
expenses of democratic dissidents arrested or beaten by repressive 
governments. In addition, we have nearly doubled funding for democracy 
projects throughout the world. The American people believe that the 
flame for freedom burns in every human heart, and that light cannot be 
extinguished by governments, terrorists, or tyrants. During Captive 
Nations Week, we remember that human freedom is the key to achieving 
respect for all human rights.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''

[[Page 86]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 15 through 21, 2007, 
as Captive Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to 
reaffirm our commitment to all those seeking liberty, justice, and self-
determination.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of July, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8161 of July 12, 2007

Parents' Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Parents' Day, America honors our mothers and fathers for their 
extraordinary devotion and for the great sacrifices they make to provide 
a hopeful and promising future for their children.
The guidance and unconditional love of parents help create a nurturing 
environment so children can grow and reach their full potential. Parents 
work to impart to their children the strength and determination to 
follow their dreams and the courage to do what is right. They shape the 
character of their children by sharing their wisdom and setting a 
positive example. As role models, parents also instill the values and 
principles that help prepare children to be responsible adults and good 
citizens.
My Administration is committed to strengthening American families by 
supporting Federal, State, and faith-based and community programs that 
promote healthy marriages and responsible parenting. Parents are a 
child's first teachers, and we recognize their critical role in helping 
children do well in school. My Administration is committed to helping 
parents and schools ensure that every child has the best opportunity to 
learn and succeed.
On Parents' Day, we pay tribute to mothers and fathers and celebrate the 
special bonds of love between parents and their children. We also 
express our deep gratitude to parents who serve in the Armed Forces and 
those whose sons and daughters have answered the call to defend our 
country. Our Nation is grateful for their honorable service and for the 
sacrifices family members make as their loved ones work to advance the 
cause of freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, as 
amended, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 22, 2007, as Parents' Day. I 
call upon citizens, private organizations, and governmental bodies at 
all levels to engage in activities and educational efforts that 
recognize, support, and

[[Page 87]]

honor parents, and I encourage American sons and daughters to convey 
their love, respect, and appreciation to their parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Death of Lady Bird Johnson

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the memory of Lady Bird Johnson, I hereby 
order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the 
United States of America, that on the day of her interment, the flag of 
the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and 
upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval 
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the 
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions until sunset on such day. I also direct that 
the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United 
States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities 
abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and 
stations.

Proclamation 8163 of July 24, 2007

Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we 
celebrate our progress towards an America where individuals with 
disabilities are recognized for their talents and contributions to our 
society. We also underscore our commitment to extend the full liberties 
and freedoms of our great country to all Americans.
Seventeen years ago, President George H. W. Bush signed the ADA into 
law. This legislation became one of the most successful and 
compassionate reforms in our Nation's history, helping to ensure that 
individuals with disabilities are better able to develop meaningful 
skills, engage in productive work, and participate fully in the life of 
our Nation.

[[Page 88]]

My Administration continues our work to build on this landmark 
legislation. In 2001, I announced the New Freedom Initiative to promote 
the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of 
society by improving educational and employment opportunities, 
increasing access to assistive technologies, expanding transportation 
options, and promoting homeownership and integration into daily 
community life. The New Freedom Initiative and the ADA provide children 
with disabilities the tools they need to succeed in schools and 
communities. Working men and women living with disabilities contribute 
to our strong economy, and the ``Ticket to Work'' program and services 
at One-Stop Career Centers help expand employment opportunities. The 
DisabilityInfo.gov website connects individuals with disabilities and 
their families to vital information that helps more Americans share in 
the promises of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2007, as a day in 
celebration of the 17th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. I call on all Americans to celebrate the vital contributions of 
individuals with disabilities as we work towards fulfilling the promise 
of the ADA to give all our citizens the opportunity to live with 
dignity, work productively, and achieve their dreams.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8164 of August 6, 2007

Women's Equality Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Women's Equality Day, we commemorate the adoption of the 19th 
Amendment to our Constitution and the strong leadership of extraordinary 
women who have made America a more perfect Union by advancing women's 
suffrage.
At the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848, a group of visionaries gathered 
to proclaim the ideas that ``all men and women are created equal'' and 
``endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.'' That 
gathering grew into a national movement that led to the ratification of 
the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote. This 
achievement reflects the vision and determination of the suffragists who 
stood for a freer society and changed our Nation's history.
Since the passage of the 19th Amendment, pioneers such as Margaret Chase 
Smith and Sandra Day O'Connor rose above obstacles and broke down 
barriers to equality. Today, American women are shaping our Nation and 
the

[[Page 89]]

world by serving in all walks of life. Many brave women volunteer to 
wear the uniform of the United States, and they serve as an inspiration 
to all.
Our Nation is grateful for the bold leadership of American women who 
have opened doors of opportunity for women of future generations. On 
Women's Equality Day we honor the suffragists and all those who seek to 
expand equality in our world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2007, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
celebrate the achievements of women and observe this day with 
appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8165 of August 20, 2007

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity to underscore 
our commitment to fighting ovarian cancer and to finding a cure for this 
deadly disease.
Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths 
among women in our country, and the risk of developing it increases with 
age and a family history of this disease. Other risk factors include a 
history of endometrial, colon, or breast cancer, and obesity. Because 
early detection is crucial in treating ovarian cancer and its symptoms 
can be difficult to identify, women should consult their doctors about 
personal risk factors, early warning signs, and screening options.
Our Nation has made progress in the fight against ovarian cancer, yet 
much more work remains. I signed the ``Gynecologic Cancer Education and 
Awareness Act of 2005,'' or ``Johanna's Law,'' which supports a national 
campaign to raise awareness among women and health care providers 
regarding gynecologic cancers. In FY 2007, the National Institutes of 
Health will invest an estimated $102 million into ovarian cancer 
research through the National Cancer Institute and other institutes. In 
addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will dedicate 
nearly $5 million. We will continue to commit our resources to seek 
better ways to prevent, detect, and ultimately cure ovarian cancer.
During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, Americans remember those 
who have lost their lives to ovarian cancer, and we honor the courage 
and strength of those who continue to fight this disease. We also 
recognize

[[Page 90]]

the dedicated medical professionals and researchers whose tireless 
efforts help provide a brighter, healthier future for women.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2007 as National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and the people of the United States to continue our Nation's 
strong commitment to preventing and treating ovarian cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8166 of August 21, 2007

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we underscore our 
commitment to winning the battle against prostate cancer and raising 
awareness of the risk factors, prevention, and treatment of this 
disease.
All men can develop prostate cancer, yet studies have shown that risk 
increases with age. Although the exact cause of the disease is not yet 
known, factors that may affect the likelihood of developing prostate 
cancer include race, diet, general health, and family history. Because 
the chances of surviving prostate cancer may be higher when it is 
diagnosed and treated in its early stages, men should speak with their 
doctors about their risk and screening options.
America leads the world in medical research, and we are committed to 
continuing our progress in the search for a cure for prostate cancer. 
Through work at the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer 
Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the 
Department of Defense, we are exploring the genetic, biochemical, 
environmental, and lifestyle factors that increase prostate cancer risk 
and lead to its development and progression. These and other efforts are 
helping improve our knowledge of the causes of this disease.
As we observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the 
strength and courage of the men battling prostate cancer and of those 
who love and support them. We also pay tribute to the medical 
professionals, the researchers, and all those whose tireless efforts are 
making a positive difference in the lives of those living with prostate 
cancer. All Americans can raise awareness and help fight this disease by 
talking with their friends and families about the risk of prostate 
cancer and the ways to prevent, detect, and treat it.

[[Page 91]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2007 as National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, and the 
people of the United States to reaffirm our Nation's strong and ongoing 
commitment to the fight against prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of

Proclamation 8167 of August 21, 2007

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month provides an 
opportunity to underscore our commitment to stopping alcohol and drug 
abuse before it starts and to helping citizens in need overcome 
addiction and rebuild their lives.
Alcohol and drug addiction can ruin lives and devastate families. We 
must continue working toward a society in which our citizens can lead 
lives free from the influence of alcohol and drugs. Friends and family 
members can play a vital role in the fight and prevention of abuse by 
discussing the dangers and consequences with loved ones.
My Administration is dedicated to the battle against drug and alcohol 
addiction. We are expanding access to treatment and recovery support 
services through the Access to Recovery program. The Drug Enforcement 
Agency is helping stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States 
by targeting the production, distribution, and sale of methamphetamines 
and other precursor drugs. The Drug Free Communities Program helps our 
neighborhoods develop strategies to prevent substance abuse. First Lady 
Laura Bush also leads the Helping America's Youth program to help our 
Nation's young people make healthy choices throughout their lives and to 
encourage community and family-based approaches to the challenges and 
risks facing today's youth.
During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month and throughout 
the year, we seek to raise awareness about the destructive cycle of 
addiction and work to provide assistance to those who suffer from 
substance abuse. This year's theme, ``Join the Voices for Recovery: 
Saving Lives, Saving Dollars,'' encourages Americans to recognize the 
costs of substance use disorders and understand the benefits that 
treatment can bring to those individuals, their families, and 
communities. To find out more about how to

[[Page 92]]

help save lives from substance abuse, contribute to a culture of 
compassion, and create a healthy future for our country, citizens may 
visit recoverymonth.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2007 as National 
Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with the appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of

Proclamation 8168 of August 21, 2007

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and during Constitution Week, we 
celebrate the anniversary of our Nation's Constitution and honor the 
Framers who created the landmark document that continues to guide our 
Nation.
In the summer of 1787, delegates convened in Philadelphia to create ``a 
more perfect Union'' and craft the document that is the foundation of 
our country. With great diligence, they worked to develop a framework 
that would balance authority and inherent freedoms, Federal interests 
and State powers, individual rights and national unity. On September 
17th of the same year, the delegates signed the Constitution of the 
United States.
Today, every American shares in this legacy of liberty, and we are 
grateful for the courage, conviction, and sacrifice of all those who 
have helped preserve and uphold the principles of a free society. As we 
remember the enduring importance of the Constitution, we also recognize 
our responsibility as citizens to respect and defend the values of our 
founding and participate in the unfolding story of freedom.
In celebration of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106, as amended), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day 
and Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 
U.S.C. 108, as amended), requested that the President proclaim the week 
beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as 
``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2007, as Constitution Day

[[Page 93]]

and Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2007, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that celebrate our Constitution and 
reaffirm our rights and responsibilities as citizens of our great 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Minority Enterprise Development Week is a chance to highlight the 
accomplishments of minority business owners and underscore our 
commitment to strengthening minority businesses and helping these 
entrepreneurs succeed.
Minority business owners have made our Nation stronger. Our thriving and 
resilient economy is the envy of the world, and minority business owners 
are expanding opportunities for their fellow Americans.
More than 8 million jobs have been created in our country since August 
2003, and minority businesses have contributed to this progress. Our 
economy has experienced more than 5 years of uninterrupted growth, and 
the unemployment rate remains low. My Administration has worked with the 
Congress to deliver needed tax relief, and this has left more money in 
the hands of minority business owners to reinvest in their employees, 
their communities, and our country's robust economy. By adopting sound 
policies that help our businesses continue to grow and expand, we are 
ensuring that America remains the land of the entrepreneur.
Our Nation has the most innovative, industrious, and talented people on 
Earth and when we unleash their entrepreneurial spirit, there is no 
limit to what the American people can achieve. During Minority 
Enterprise Development Week, and throughout the year, we recognize the 
vital contributions of minority business owners. These dedicated 
individuals are helping create a more hopeful society for themselves and 
their families. We will continue to strive for a society where personal 
effort is rewarded and where the American dream is within the reach of 
all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 9 through 
September 15, 2007, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of our 
Nation's minority enterprises.

families for emergencies by taking simple steps such as organizing an 
emergency supply kit, making a personal preparedness plan, becoming 
informed about different threats, and getting involved in preparing 
their community. These activities create a culture of preparedness and 
can help save lives.
My Administration continues to improve our Nation's ability to prepare 
for emergencies. The Department of Homeland Security is working with 
other Federal, State, and local government organizations, as well as the 
private sector, to prevent, respond to, and recover from all types of 
emergencies. Together, Americans can significantly enhance the level of 
national preparedness to further safeguard our communities and secure 
our homeland.
This month is also an opportunity to pay tribute to America's first 
responders who put themselves at risk for the safety of their fellow 
citizens. These brave police officers, firefighters, and emergency 
service personnel exemplify the compassion and commitment that help 
strengthen our country. We will be forever grateful for their service 
and sacrifice.
During National Preparedness Month, I encourage all Americans to get 
involved in their community's preparedness efforts. Citizens may visit 
ready.gov and citizencorps.gov to learn more about emergency 
preparedness and ways to take action.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2007 as National 
Preparedness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
recognize the importance of preparing for potential emergencies and to 
observe this month by participating in appropriate events, activities, 
and preparedness programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we 
recognize the vital contributions of the brave men and women who serve 
our great Nation, and we pay tribute to the employers who support them.
The courageous men and women of the National Guard and Reserve are 
fighting a new and unprecedented war, having answered the call to defend 
our freedom and way of life. At home, the National Guard is working to 
protect our borders, and provide vital aid and assistance in times of

the uniform reflects the best of America, and all Americans are proud to 
stand behind the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve.
Our Nation also appreciates the sacrifice of employers across our 
country who support the important mission of our National Guard and 
Reserve personnel. Employers across America demonstrate their patriotism 
by providing time off, pay, health-care benefits, and job security to 
their Guard and Reserve employees, helping them prepare for their return 
to families and to civilian life. The commitment of our Nation's 
employers is a vital and integral part of the success of our Armed 
Forces.
During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we offer 
our country's deepest gratitude to the dedicated men and women of the 
National Guard and Reserve and to the employers who support them in 
their important service to our Nation.

America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

businesses, and all military commanders to observe this week with

Proclamation 8172 of September 4, 2007

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Education is a fundamental part of achieving the American dream, and 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) help ensure that 
every student has the opportunity to pursue a quality education. During 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we underscore our 
commitment to these distinguished institutions in their efforts to 
provide more Americans with the tools to realize their dreams.
The founding of many of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
over a century ago expanded the American education system and extended 
the opportunity of a higher education to some who had been wrongly 
denied access. Today, HBCUs throughout our Nation continue to be centers 
of quality education, advancing opportunity and inspiring individuals to 
meet the challenges of our time as responsible leaders.
My Administration has increased Federal support for HBCUs and remains 
committed to strengthening these colleges and universities. The HBCU 
Capital Financing Program has provided access to funds for 
infrastructure repairs, educational equipment, and construction of new 
facilities. The President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities works to help HBCUs develop new partnerships 
with the private sector and benefit from Federal programs to strengthen 
and advance faculty development and cooperative research.
We will continue to provide our strong support to HBCUs, so that every 
citizen can enjoy a future of hope and opportunity, and we salute these 
great institutions as they build on a foundation of continued success 
for every student.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 9 through 
September 15, 2007, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this week with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in respect and 
appreciation for the contributions these valuable institutions and their 
graduates have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During this year's National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we honor the 
thousands of victims who died in the brutal and ruthless attacks in New 
York City, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Our 
Nation remembers with gratitude the firefighters, police officers, first 
responders, and ordinary citizens who acted with courage and compassion

sacrifice, and dedication help preserve our freedom. We pray for their 
safety, for all those who love them, and for the peace we all seek.
We remain a hopeful America, inspired by the kindness and compassion of 
our citizens and our commitment to freedom and opportunity. During these 
days of prayer and remembrance, we reflect on all we have lost and take 
comfort in each other and in the grace and mercy of our Creator. May God

great country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 7, 
through Sunday, September 9, 2007, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States and their places 
of worship mark these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with 
memorial services, the ringing of bells, and evening candlelight 
remembrance vigils. I also invite the people of the world to share in 
these Days of Prayer and Remembrance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of

Proclamation 8174 of September 4, 2007

Patriot Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

September 11, 2001, was a defining moment in American history. On that 
terrible day, our Nation saw the face of evil as 19 men barbarously 
attacked us and wantonly murdered people of many races, nationalities, 
and creeds. On Patriot Day, we remember the innocent victims, and we pay 
tribute to the valiant firefighters, police officers, emergency 
personnel, and ordinary citizens who risked their lives so others might 
live.
After the attacks on 9/11, America resolved that we would go on the 
offense against our enemies, and we would not distinguish between the 
terrorists and those who harbor and support them. All Americans honor 
the selfless men and women of our Armed Forces, the dedicated members of 
our public safety, law enforcement, and intelligence communities, and 
the thousands of others who work hard each day to protect our country, 
secure our liberty, and prevent future attacks.
The spirit of our people is the source of America's strength, and 6 
years ago, Americans came to the aid of neighbors in need. On Patriot 
Day, we pray for those who died and for their families. We volunteer to 
help others and demonstrate the continuing compassion of our citizens. 
On this solemn occasion, we rededicate ourselves to laying the 
foundation of peace with confidence in our mission and our free way of 
life.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot 
Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2007, as Patriot Day. I call 
upon the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of government, to 
direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Patriot Day. I also call 
upon the people of the United States to observe Patriot Day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and remembrance services, to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes on that day, and to observe a 
moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor 
the innocent Americans and people from around the world who lost their 
lives as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Hispanic Americans have strengthened our country and contributed to the 
spirit of America. National Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity to 
honor these contributions and celebrate the rich cultural traditions of 
our Hispanic-American community.
Hispanic Americans have helped establish America as a place of freedom 
and opportunity, and their contributions have illustrated what is best 
about our great Nation. Their hard work, love of country, and deep 
commitment to faith and family have shaped the character of our country 
and helped preserve the values we all cherish. By sharing their vibrant 
culture and heritage, Hispanic Americans have also enriched the American 
experience and helped define the unique fabric of our Nation.
Americans of Hispanic heritage have carried on a proud tradition of 
service to our Nation. In times of great consequence, they have answered 
the call to defend America as members of our Armed Forces. These brave 
men and women bring honor to America, and we are grateful for their 
service and sacrifice. In our towns and communities, Hispanic Americans 
have also shown the good heart of our Nation by volunteering to help 
their fellow Americans. Their kindness and compassion have made a 
difference in the lives of others and have made our country a more 
hopeful place for all.
During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we celebrate the diversity that 
makes America stronger, and we recognize the many ways Hispanic 
Americans have enriched our Nation. To honor the achievements of 
Hispanic Americans, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
designating September 15 through October 15 as ``National Hispanic 
Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Proclamation 8176 of September 12, 2007

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's farmers and ranchers are good stewards of our land, providing 
a healthy, safe, and abundant food supply for our country and for people 
around the world. During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we pay 
tribute to our farmers and ranchers and their families for their 
contributions to our Nation, and we raise awareness of the importance of 
practicing and promoting safe work habits and conditions on farms and 
ranches.
Making a living off the land exposes agricultural workers to many 
potential dangers, such as extreme weather conditions, fertilizers and 
chemicals, and heavy machinery. Taking steps to identify these hazards 
and instructing family members in safe practices will help save lives 
and prevent injuries. Farmers and ranchers can help avoid accidents and 
protect lives by staying informed, being proactive, and remaining 
vigilant.
Across the United States, farm and ranch communities embody the values 
of hard work, faith, and love of family. This week and throughout the 
year, we encourage farmers and ranchers to practice responsible work 
habits as they continue to help America remain strong and prosperous.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16 through 
September 22, 2007, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, and businesses that serve America's 
agricultural workers to continue to strengthen their commitment to 
promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge all Americans to 
honor our agricultural heritage and to recognize our farmers and 
ranchers for their remarkable contributions to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

around the world. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor a 
special group of patriots: those who have been prisoners of war and 
those

[[Page 101]]

who are still missing in action. We remain forever in their debt, and we 
renew our commitment to them and to their families never to rest until 
we have accounted for every missing service member.
To commemorate this day, the National League of Families POW/MIA flag is 
flown over the White House, the Capitol, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 
the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the World War II Memorial, and other 
locations across our country. This flag is an enduring symbol that 
reflects our solemn commitment to our courageous service members who 
have been imprisoned while serving in conflicts around the world and to 
those who remain missing. America will always remember these heroes, and 
we underscore our pledge to achieve the fullest possible accounting for 
every missing member of our Armed Forces.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 21,

Family Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Families are the cornerstone of our Nation. On Family Day, we underscore 
our dedication to strengthening America's families and recognize the 
importance that the bonds between parents and children hold for the 
future of our country.
Parents and family members are the first and most important influence in 
a child's life. Families offer a stable and nurturing environment by 
providing love, guidance, support, and comfort. They help young people 
gain the skills they need to succeed in life and the courage and drive 
to realize their dreams. By caring for and spending time with their 
children, parents instill lifelong values and help build a better 
America.
My Administration is committed to supporting American families. We are 
working with faith-based and community organizations to promote healthy 
marriages, responsible fatherhood, and positive youth development. When

[[Page 102]]

children are connected to family, community, school, and places of 
worship, they are more likely to make good choices and reach their full 
potential.
Families help prepare children for the opportunities and challenges of 
the 21st century by encouraging them and insisting on high standards. 
Strong, loving families help young Americans grow into successful adults 
and build a Nation shining with optimism.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24, 2007, as 
Family Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day by engaging in activities that strengthen the bonds between parents 
and children.

The gift of liberty is secured by heroes who have answered the call to 
serve when America needed them most. On Gold Star Mother's Day, we honor 
the mothers of the service men and women who have given their lives in 
the defense of our great Nation.
America's Gold Star Mothers are remarkable patriots who serve their 
communities by demonstrating good citizenship, providing support and 
services to our troops and veterans, and helping comfort the families 
whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice. Their sense of duty 
and deep devotion to our country inspire our Nation, and we thank them 
for their compassion, determination, and strength. Though they carry a 
great burden of grief, these courageous mothers help ensure that the 
legacy of our fallen heroes will be forever remembered. On this day, we 
offer our deep gratitude and respect to our Nation's Gold Star Mothers; 
we honor the sons and daughters who died while wearing the uniform of 
the United States; and we pray for God's blessings on them, their 
mothers, and their families.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat.

To Provide for Duty Elimination for Certain Goods of Mexico Under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On December 17, 1992, the Governments of Canada, Mexico, and the 
United States of America entered into the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA). The NAFTA was approved by the Congress in section 
101(a) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 
(Public Law 103-182) (the ``NAFTA Implementation Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
3311(a)) and was implemented with respect to the United States by 
Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993.
2. Section 201(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3331(b)) 
authorizes the President, subject to the consultation and layover 
requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 
U.S.C. 3313(a)), to proclaim accelerated schedules of duty elimination 
that the United States may agree to with Mexico or Canada. Consistent 
with Article 302(3) of the NAFTA, I, through my duly empowered 
representative, have entered into an agreement with the Government of 
Mexico providing for an accelerated schedule of duty elimination for 
specific goods of Mexico. The consultation and layover requirements of 
section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act with respect to such 
schedule of duty elimination have been satisfied.
3. Pursuant to section 201(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, I have 
determined that the modifications herein proclaimed of duties on goods 
originating in the territory of Mexico are necessary or appropriate to 
maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous 
concessions with respect to Mexico provided for by the NAFTA, and to 
carry out the agreement with Mexico providing an accelerated schedule of 
duty elimination for specific goods.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of relevant 
provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import treatment, and 
actions taken thereunder.

[[Page 104]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 201(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act and section 604 of the 
1974 Act, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to provide an accelerated schedule of duty elimination for 
specific goods of Mexico under the terms of general note 12 to the HTS, 
the tariff treatment set forth in the HTS is modified as provided in the 
Annex to this proclamation.
(2) The amendments made to the HTS by the Annex to this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after October 1, 2007.
(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

Proclamation 8181 of September 28, 2007

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among 
American women. During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we renew 
our commitment to fighting this disease, raising awareness, and 
supporting those affected by breast cancer.
Research has shown that several factors may increase the risk of 
developing breast cancer, including family history, age, genetics, and 
obesity. By making healthy lifestyle choices and exercising regularly, 
individuals can help reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. 
Mammograms, regular self-exams, and clinical breast exams are also vital 
because they can help doctors diagnose cancer before it has a chance to 
spread. When breast cancer is detected early, treatment is more 
effective, giving hope to patients and helping save lives.
My Administration is committed to strengthening our Nation's efforts 
against this devastating disease. Earlier this year I was pleased to 
sign the ``National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program 
Reauthorization Act,'' which will allow us to continue helping low-
income and uninsured women gain access to vital cancer screening. In 
order to best detect and treat breast cancer, Federal agencies are 
collaborating with national organizations, State health agencies, and 
other key groups to promote important disease education and prevention 
activities. Our Nation leads the world in medical research, and through 
the dedicated efforts of thousands of Americans, we can build a 
healthier and more hopeful future for our citizens.
During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we remember those living 
with breast cancer and their family and friends who provide them with 
love and support. Their courage and determination are an inspiration to 
us all. We also recognize the innovative, lifesaving work of doctors, 
researchers, and other medical professionals. Through their efforts to 
prevent, detect, and treat breast cancer, they are helping make a 
difference in the lives of our citizens. Until we find a cure for breast 
cancer, we will continue our Nation's fight against this disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the power vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2007 as National 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and the people of the United States to continue our Nation's 
strong commitment to preventing, treating, and ultimately curing breast 
cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8182 of September 28, 2007

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Disability Employment Awareness Month is an opportunity to 
recognize the contributions and accomplishments of Americans with 
disabilities and to underscore our Nation's commitment to advancing 
employment opportunities for all our citizens.
Americans with disabilities strengthen our country's workforce, and 
their achievements help keep our Nation the world's economic leader. 
Landmark reforms such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
have helped to ensure that individuals with disabilities are better able 
to engage in productive work and participate fully in the life of our 
Nation. It is important that we continue to expand on these 
opportunities for Americans with disabilities by eliminating the 
barriers and false perceptions that hinder them from joining the 
workforce. By enhancing the workplace environment for people with 
disabilities, employers can help provide access to jobs that allow these 
individuals to demonstrate their potential and realize their dreams.
Since 2001, my New Freedom Initiative has helped promote the full 
participation of people with disabilities in all areas of society, 
including education, training, and employment. Programs such as ``Ticket 
to Work'' and services at One-Stop Career Centers have helped improve 
access to employment training and placement services for individuals who 
want to work. Throughout the Federal Government, we have worked to 
improve access to jobs for individuals with disabilities and to promote 
greater inclusiveness in the workforce. Individuals and employers can 
learn more about the Federal Government's disability-related programs by 
visiting DisabilityInfo.gov. We will continue to build on the progress 
that has been made for individuals with disabilities and will work to 
ensure that our Nation remains a place of opportunity for all Americans.
To recognize the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to 
encourage all citizens to ensure equal opportunity in the workforce, the 
Congress (36 U.S.C. 121) has designated October of each year as 
``National Disability Employment Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 2007 as National Disability 
Employment Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, labor 
leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

generation. When a family member is abused, it can have long-term 
damaging effects on the victim that leave a mark on family, friends, and 
the community at large. Our society must continue to work to prevent 
domestic violence and help create a loving and stable environment for 
our children and grandchildren.
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month is an opportunity to renew 
our commitment to preventing domestic violence and to assisting those 
who suffer from its devastating effects. My Administration is dedicated 
to helping victims of domestic violence. The Family Justice Center 
Initiative, announced in 2003, continues to work towards eradicating 
domestic violence in our Nation. This program provides assistance and 
services for victims of domestic violence by bringing professionals, 
advocates, law enforcement, and organizations together at centers 
nationwide. In 2006, I signed legislation that reauthorized the Violence 
Against Women Act to fight domestic violence, dating violence, sexual 
assault, and stalking. We also are working with faith-based and 
community organizations to assist victims in need. In addition, the 
Department of Justice's Domestic Violence Transitional Housing 
Assistance Program provides access to transitional housing services 
while working to move victims of violence into permanent housing.
As we observe National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we underscore 
our commitment to building an America where all citizens can live with 
dignity, work productively, and achieve their dreams. We encourage 
victims and their families and friends to seek assistance through Family 
Justice Centers and to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 
1-800-799-SAFE. Together, we can help prevent, recognize, and stop 
domestic violence in America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2007 as 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to 
reach out to those who have been abused and help educate people about 
the vital importance of ending domestic violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8184 of October 1, 2007

Child Health Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation is committed to the health and well-being of our youth. On 
Child Health Day, we reaffirm our commitment to helping children develop 
good nutrition habits and active lifestyles, so that they can grow into 
healthy and productive adults.
Children today face many risks, such as alcohol and drug use, obesity, 
smoking, and other dangers. As parents and role models to America's 
youth, we have a responsibility to teach them about the importance of 
healthy behavior, daily exercise, and good nutrition.
My Administration supports programs that give parents, mentors, and 
teachers the resources they need to help and encourage children to 
maintain an active and healthy way of life. The National Youth Anti-Drug 
Media Campaign is working with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America 
to educate our young people about resisting the pressure to use drugs. 
Additionally, the Helping America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady 
Laura Bush, encourages our Nation's children to make healthy choices 
that lead to a better future. The HealthierUS initiative offers ways to 
improve lives, prevent and reduce the costs of disease, and promote 
community health and wellness. These nationwide initiatives provide the 
tools and resources to help children learn the importance of healthy 
living.
With hard work and dedication, parents can encourage good nutrition and 
healthy lifestyles so children can make the right choices, avoid risky 
behavior, and realize their full potential.
On this day it is also appropriate to recognize the important role the 
State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) has played in helping 
poor children stay healthy. To preserve that role and ensure that poor 
children can get the coverage they need, SCHIP should be reauthorized.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in 
October as ``Child Health Day'' and has requested the President to issue 
a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 1, 2007, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, schools, child health professionals, faith-
based and community organizations, and State and local governments to 
reach out to our Nation's young people, encourage them to avoid 
dangerous behavior, and help them make the right choices and achieve 
their dreams.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

A Proclamation

Generations of German Americans have helped shape our national culture 
and advance our legacy of freedom. On German-American Day, we recognize 
the many contributions that Americans of German descent have made to our 
vibrant country.
German immigrants, in search of a brighter future, were among the first 
pioneers to settle in Jamestown. Since then, German Americans have 
influenced our society in all walks of life and helped expand our 
democratic heritage and our deeply held belief in individual liberty. 
The leadership and strong spirit of German Americans have helped shape 
our country and advance the great blessings of our Nation.
German-American Day is also an opportunity to honor the strong ties 
between the United States and Germany and to celebrate our friendship. 
On this day, we underscore our commitment to working together to promote 
peace and making the world a more hopeful place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

Proclamation 8186 of October 4, 2007

Columbus Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail on a journey that changed the 
course of history. On Columbus Day, we celebrate this voyage of 
discovery and honor an Italian explorer who shaped the destiny of the 
New World.
Christopher Columbus' bold journey across the Atlantic opened new 
frontiers of exploration and demonstrated the power of perseverance. His 
journeys inspired other risk-takers and dreamers to test the bounds of 
their imagination and gave them the courage to accomplish great feats, 
whether crossing the world's oceans or walking on the moon. Today, a new 
generation of innovators and pioneers continues to uphold the finest 
values of our country--discipline, ingenuity, and unity in the pursuit 
of great goals.

[[Page 111]]

As we look back on the contributions of the great explorer from Genoa, 
we also celebrate the many contributions that generations of Italian 
Americans have made to our Nation. Their service to America and ties to 
family, faith, and community have strengthened our country and enriched 
our culture.
In commemoration of Columbus' journey, the Congress, by joint resolution 
of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has 
requested that the President proclaim the second Monday of October of 
each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 8, 2007, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

Leif Erikson Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Leif Erikson Day, we commemorate the enduring legacy of a brave 
explorer and honor the significant contributions of Nordic Americans who 
continue to enrich our culture and our way of life.
Leif Erikson, a son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, led a determined 
crew across the Atlantic more than 1,000 years ago and became one of the 
first Europeans known to reach North America. The courage of these 
pioneers helped open the world to new exploration and important 
discoveries. Today, Nordic Americans help strengthen our country, and 
their determination and optimism make America a more hopeful land. Our 
Nation continues to benefit from strong ties with Denmark, Finland, 
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, and we are grateful for their continued 
friendship.
To honor Leif Erikson and to celebrate our citizens of Nordic-American 
heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved 
on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President to proclaim October 9 
of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2007, as Leif Erikson Day. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.

Fire Prevention Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Fire Prevention Week, we reaffirm our commitment to raising 
awareness about fire safety and prevention, and we salute our country's 
firefighters who perform heroic acts to keep their fellow citizens safe.
Fires injure or kill thousands of people each year. Americans can help 
reduce the devastating effects of fires with careful planning and by 
installing smoke alarms and fire extinguishers in their homes and 
workplaces. This year's theme, ``Practice Your Escape Plan,'' highlights 
the importance of creating a fire escape plan and knowing the routes to 
quickly exit a burning building. By taking these special precautions, 
lives can be saved.
America's firefighters demonstrate the true meaning of heroism by taking 
great risks to safeguard our communities. During Fire Prevention Week, 
we honor our selfless firefighters and underscore the importance of fire 
safety. We also pay special tribute to those who have fallen in the line 
of duty. Our country is grateful for their service and sacrifice, and we 
pray for God's comfort and strength for their loved ones.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7 through October 
13, 2007, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 7, 2007, in 
accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be 
flown at half staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans 
to participate in this observance through appropriate programs and 
activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their 
tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of

Proclamation 8189 of October 10, 2007

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than two hundred years after the death of General Casimir Pulaski, 
we honor the life and legacy of a Polish patriot and American 
Revolutionary War soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.
Casimir Pulaski first demonstrated his devotion to the cause of liberty 
while defending his native Poland and earned a reputation for courage 
and resolve. He later met Benjamin Franklin in Paris and learned of 
America's struggle for independence. Inspired by freedom's call, Pulaski 
joined General George Washington in the American Revolution in 1777 and 
was soon commissioned as a Brigadier General. General Pulaski recruited 
and trained a special corps of American, Polish, Irish, French, and 
German troops, and he became known as ``the Father of the American 
Cavalry.'' Although he was mortally wounded at the siege of Savannah in 
1779, his legacy lives on.
As we celebrate General Pulaski Memorial Day, we honor a son of Poland 
who stood with our country at the dawn of our independence. Casimir 
Pulaski's determined efforts in Poland and America remind us of the 
great contributions Polish Americans have made to our country. Today, we 
recognize the enduring bond between the Polish and American people, and 
we are grateful for Poland's efforts in support of freedom and democracy 
in Afghanistan and Iraq and in the global war on terror.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2007, as 
General Pulaski Memorial Day. I urge Americans to commemorate this 
occasion with appropriate activities and ceremonies honoring General 
Casimir Pulaski and all those who defend our freedom.

October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

Proclamation 8190 of October 12, 2007

National School Lunch Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The National School Lunch Program provides millions of lunches to our 
Nation's children each school day. During National School Lunch Week, we 
renew our commitment to the health of our children and to ensuring that 
they receive nutritious meals and develop good eating habits.

[[Page 114]]

Since it began in 1946, the National School Lunch Program has provided 
nutritious meals in schools across the country. The United States 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) has worked to ensure that these meals 
include fresh fruits, vegetables, and milk and that they meet dietary 
recommendations so children limit fat, sodium, cholesterol, and excess 
calories in their diet.
By learning to eat well, children can avoid problems that can lead to 
serious long-term health problems, including heart disease, asthma, and 
diabetes. Team Nutrition, part of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, 
is playing an important role in promoting good nutrition to children in 
thousands of our Nation's schools, providing training and resources to 
food service professionals across our country.
National School Lunch Week is an opportunity to recognize food service 
professionals, school officials, and parents for their dedicated efforts 
to provide healthy foods to America's children. This week, we recommit 
ourselves to encouraging children to make nutritious food choices and 
lead healthy lifestyles.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch Program 
to the health, education, and well-being of America's children, the 
Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), as 
amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in 
October of each year as ``National School Lunch Week'' and has requested 
the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 14 through October 20, 
2007, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join 
the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being 
of our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

White Cane Safety Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our country upholds the value of every person, and all Americans deserve 
an opportunity to realize the American dream. Many citizens who are 
blind or visually impaired use white canes to achieve greater 
independence and increase mobility and productivity. On White Cane 
Safety Day, we celebrate the symbolism of the white cane, and we 
underscore our dedication to ensuring more individuals have the ability 
to lead active lives and achieve their personal and professional goals.

[[Page 115]]

My Administration is committed to helping Americans with disabilities 
live and work with greater freedom. Through the New Freedom Initiative, 
we are building on the progress of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
and helping our citizens who are blind or visually impaired gain greater 
access to the workplace, school, and community life. By working to tear 
down barriers, we are creating a society where all people are encouraged 
to reach their full potential and where the promise of our great Nation 
is accessible for everyone.
The Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-628) approved on 
October 6, 1964, as amended, has designated October 15 of each year as 
``White Cane Safety Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2007, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon public officials, business leaders, educators, and all the 
people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation 8192 of October 19, 2007

National Character Counts Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The greatness of a nation is measured not by power or wealth but by the 
character of its people. During National Character Counts Week, we 
underscore our dedication to promoting values for our young people and 
encourage all Americans to demonstrate good character.
As America's youth strive to become responsible adults, they carry with 
them the values and traditions they were taught as children. At home, 
parents and families can teach universal values such as respect, 
tolerance, self-restraint, fairness, and compassion. In the community, 
we all can set good examples and demonstrate the virtues of leadership, 
patriotism, and responsible citizenship. The members of our Armed Forces 
demonstrate the strength of America's character by answering the call of 
service to our Nation.
Through the Helping America's Youth initiative, caring adults are 
connected with at-risk youth so that they have a mentor and an example 
as they navigate the challenges young people face. By working together, 
we can give children the skill and habits they need to reach their full 
potential.

[[Page 116]]

During National Character Counts Week and throughout the year, I urge 
all citizens to support the character development of our youth and make 
a difference in the lives of others. One way for all Americans to add to 
the character of our country is to volunteer to help a neighbor in need, 
and more information can be found at volunteer.gov. I encourage every 
American to serve a cause greater than themselves and set a positive 
example in their community.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 21 through October 
27, 2007, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, librarians, parents, students, and all Americans 
to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

National Forest Products Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Forest Products Week, we celebrate the rich blessings of 
our Nation's forests, and we recognize the important resources they 
provide to our communities and our economy.
Our Nation's forests supply vital products and create important 
employment opportunities. Trees provide wood to make homes, furniture, 
musical instruments, paper for books and newspapers, and packaging 
materials. These and other products are created by the construction and 
manufacturing industries and provide economic security for many of our 
citizens.
All Americans have an obligation to protect the Earth and a 
responsibility to be good stewards of our land, and my Administration 
has made forest health a high priority. Under the Healthy Forest 
Initiative, we are helping to protect the American people, their 
communities, and the environment from potentially devastating wildfires. 
Together we can conserve our woodlands and help leave a lasting legacy 
for future generations.
Recognizing the importance of our forests in ensuring our Nation's well-
being, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, 
has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each 
year as ``National Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

United Nations Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

After World War II, representatives from around the globe gathered to 
begin deliberations on a new international bill of rights. The document 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, stands as a landmark achievement in the 
history of human liberty. On United Nations Day, we recognize the 
contributions of this important body and underscore our dedication to 
reforming the institution and advancing the high ideals on which it was 
founded.
Today, the United Nations must recommit itself to maintaining 
international security and helping solve economic, social, and 
humanitarian problems. This great institution must work for great 
purposes: to free people from tyranny and violence, hunger and disease, 
illiteracy and ignorance, and poverty and despair. With renewed 
commitment and courage, we can pursue the vision of the Universal 
Declaration and build a world where people are free to speak, assemble, 
and worship as they wish, and where opportunity crosses every border.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2007, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor

Proclamation 8195 of October 31, 2007

National Adoption Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Adoption Month, we recognize the adoptive and foster 
families who have shared their homes and hearts with children in need, 
and we encourage more Americans to consider adopting young people of all 
ages.
Families who adopt show the generous spirit of our Nation. Every child 
desires a permanent home, and when parents adopt a child to love as 
their own, lives are forever changed. For parents, the decision to adopt 
a child is among life's greatest and happiest turning points. On 
November 17, families across the country will celebrate National 
Adoption Day by finalizing their adoptions, and each one of these homes 
will be richer for the addition of new family members.
My Administration is committed to promoting adoption of children of all 
ages. We are working to bring together more children with loving, 
adoptive parents through the Collaboration to AdoptUsKids at 
adoptuskids.org and by providing States with financial assistance 
through the Adoption Incentives Program. The Promoting Safe and Stable 
Families Program helps improve care and services to children and 
families and ensure more young people in America have a caring, secure, 
and permanent home. Together, these efforts are building a brighter 
future for our youth.
During National Adoption Month, we honor adoptive and foster parents as 
they raise children of conviction and character. By accepting the gift 
of these children, parents are helping shape lives and contributing to 
the strength of our great Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2007 as National 
Adoption Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor adoptive families and to 
participate in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of

Proclamation 8196 of October 31, 2007

National American Indian Heritage Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National American Indian Heritage Month is an opportunity to honor the 
many contributions of American Indians and Alaska Natives and to 
recognize the strong and living traditions of the first people to call 
our land home.
American Indians and Alaska Natives continue to shape our Nation by 
preserving the heritage of their ancestors and by contributing to the 
rich diversity that is our country's strength. Their dedicated efforts 
to honor their proud heritage have helped others gain a deeper 
understanding of the vibrant and ancient customs of the Native American 
community. We also express our gratitude to the American Indians and 
Alaska Natives who serve in our Nation's military and work to extend the 
blessings of liberty around the world.
My Administration is committed to supporting the American Indian and 
Alaska Native cultures. In June, I signed the ``Native American Home 
Ownership Opportunity Act of 2007,'' which reauthorizes the Indian 
Housing Loan Guarantee Program, guaranteeing loans for home improvements 
and expanding home ownership for Native American families. Working with 
tribal governments, we will strive for greater security, healthier 
lifestyles, better schools, and new economic opportunities for American 
Indians and Alaska Natives.
During National American Indian Heritage Month, we underscore our 
commitment to working with tribes on a government-to-government basis 
and to supporting tribal sovereignty and self-determination. During this 
month, I also encourage Federal agencies to continue their work with 
tribal governments to ensure sound cooperation. Efforts such as on-line 
training programs will improve interagency collaboration in the Federal 
Indian Affairs community and help to strengthen relationships with 
tribes, building a brighter future for all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2007 as National 
American Indian Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate 
this month with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of

National Family Caregivers Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year during National Family Caregivers Month, we celebrate all 
those who dedicate themselves to caring for others and recognize their 
efforts to comfort and improve the lives of their loved ones in need.
One of our Nation's defining values is compassion, and we must do our 
best to see that every citizen is treated with dignity and respect. 
Family caregivers demonstrate this compassion, often at great sacrifice, 
to assist with everyday activities for family members who are elderly, 
chronically ill, or disabled. This dedication contributes to a culture 
of caring and responsibility across our country.
My Administration remains committed to supporting family caregivers by 
enhancing their access to services, agencies, and other providers. Late 
last year, I signed ``The Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2006,'' which 
establishes a program to assist family caregivers in accessing 
affordable and high-quality respite care. The National Family Caregiver 
Support Program encourages cooperation among agencies and other 
organizations that support and work with the family caregivers. This 
program offers information, training, and counseling to help family 
caregivers assist their loved ones.
National Family Caregivers Month is a time to recognize family 
caregivers for their good hearts and tireless support. Their love and 
devotion exemplify the true spirit of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2007 as National 
Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to honor the selfless 
service of caregivers who support their loved ones in need.

One of America's greatest values is compassion, and our country is 
blessed by all those who dedicate themselves to caring for others. 
During National Hospice Month, we recognize the dedicated professionals 
and volunteers who provide love and comfort to those who are terminally 
ill.

[[Page 121]]

Across our Nation, hospice physicians, nurses, counselors, and 
volunteers provide invaluable support that enables many of our citizens 
to spend their final days in comfort and dignity. By providing physical, 
psychological, and social assistance, hospice care workers help ensure 
their patients can spend valuable time with loved ones. Hospice 
caregivers also help by providing guidance and counseling to the 
families of those who are ill.
Our Nation is committed to helping ensure that citizens with terminal 
illness and their families receive the assistance they need. We believe 
in the dignity and worth of every person at every stage of life, and 
hospice care brings support and comfort to those in need.
Hospice care professionals and volunteers are answering a timeless call 
to love their neighbors as themselves. During National Hospice Month, we 
recognize these individuals for their strength and compassion. Their 
efforts make our country a more loving and caring place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2007 as National 
Hospice Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities. I also ask Americans to recognize 
our health care professionals and volunteers for their contributions to 
helping provide comfort and care to those facing terminal illness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8199 of October 31, 2007

Veterans Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, America has been protected by patriots who 
cherished liberty and made great sacrifices to advance the cause of 
freedom. The brave members of the United States Armed Forces have 
answered the call to serve our Nation, ready to give all for their 
country. On Veterans Day, we honor these extraordinary Americans for 
their service and sacrifice, and we pay tribute to the legacy of freedom 
and peace that they have given our great Nation.
In times of war and of peace, our men and women in uniform stepped 
forward to defend their fellow citizens and the country they love. They 
shouldered great responsibility and lived up to the highest standards of 
duty and honor. Our veterans held fast against determined and ruthless 
enemies and helped save the world from tyranny and terror. They ensured 
that America remained what our founders meant her to be: a light to the 
nations, spreading the good news of human freedom to the darkest corners 
of the earth.

[[Page 122]]

Like the heroes before them, today a new generation of men and women are 
fighting for freedom around the globe. Their determination, courage, and 
sacrifice are laying the foundation for a more secure and peaceful 
world.
Veterans Day is dedicated to the extraordinary Americans who protected 
our freedom in years past, and to those who protect it today. They 
represent the very best of our Nation. Every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, 
Marine, and Coast Guardsman has earned the lasting gratitude of the 
American people, and their service and sacrifice will be remembered 
forever. In the words of Abraham Lincoln: `` . . . let us strive on to 
finish the work we are in, to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for 
him who shall have borne the battle . . . .'' On this Veterans Day, I 
ask all Americans to express their appreciation to our Nation's 
veterans.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service men 
and women have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's 
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2007, as Veterans Day and urge 
all Americans to observe November 11 through November 17, 2007, as 
National Veterans Awareness Week. I encourage all Americans to recognize 
the valor and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers. 
I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of 
the United States and to support and participate in patriotic activities 
in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places 
of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this 
national observance with commemorative expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month is an opportunity to honor 
and support those living with Alzheimer's disease. During this month, we 
also seek to express our gratitude to the family members and caretakers 
who love and comfort those afflicted, and we renew our commitment to 
finding a cure to this devastating disease.
The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is age. Scientists are 
studying how other factors such as family history, nutrition, 
environment, and

[[Page 123]]

education, also affect an individual's risk for Alzheimer's disease. The 
National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
continue to conduct research to better prevent, detect, and treat 
Alzheimer's disease and provide information and support to caretakers 
and families.
During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we recognize the 
millions of Americans affected by this tragic disease and honor those 
who have lost their lives to Alzheimer's. Americans are grateful for the 
resolve and dedication of medical professionals, scientific researchers, 
family members, and caregivers who give their time and talents and help 
provide hope to many.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2007 as National 
Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.

Proclamation 8201 of October 31, 2007

National Diabetes Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Diabetes is a debilitating disease that affects millions of Americans of 
all ages and all walks of life. National Diabetes Month is an 
opportunity to raise awareness about risk factors, prevention, and 
treatment of this serious disease.
Diabetes is a chronic illness that leaves the body unable to produce or 
properly use insulin to maintain healthy blood glucose levels. The two 
most common forms of the disease that affect our citizens are Type 1 and 
Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes, is 
usually diagnosed in children and young adults who are unable to produce 
insulin and require daily medication. Type 2 diabetes, the most common 
form of the disease, is often attributed to lifestyle risk factors and 
can be controlled by a modified diet, regular physical activity, and 
medication. Americans can take steps to control the disease and lower 
the risk of complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney 
disease by maintaining healthy eating and exercise habits, and 
consulting with a doctor about diabetes testing.
My Administration is committed to providing better care for people 
living with diabetes and furthering efforts to find a cure. We have 
supported research initiatives and education programs that encourage 
healthy living, and we have also modified Medicare coverage to include 
diabetes

[[Page 124]]

screenings. This year, the National Institutes of Health estimates that 
more than $1 billion will be spent on diabetes research. By working 
together, we can help identify problems early, manage them before they 
grow worse, and help ensure more Americans live longer, healthier lives.
Throughout National Diabetes Month, we recognize the medical 
professionals, scientists, researchers, and all those whose efforts have 
made a positive difference in the fight against diabetes. By raising 
public awareness, we can help combat the effects of diabetes in our 
society and bring hope to children and families living with this 
disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2007 as National 
Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the risk 
factors and symptoms associated with diabetes and to observe this month 
with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8202 of November 8, 2007

World Freedom Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On World Freedom Day, we commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall and 
reaffirm our conviction that freedom is the inalienable right of every 
man, woman, and child.
On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell--a triumph of freedom over 
those who denied hope and opportunity to millions. The collapse of this 
barrier signaled the demise of the Soviet empire and ushered in a new 
era of liberty for much of Central and Eastern Europe. In the end, 
tyranny was overpowered by ordinary people who wanted to live their 
lives freely, worship God freely, and speak the truth to their children. 
With moral clarity and courage, brave individuals can change the course 
of history.
Our Nation remains committed to the advance of freedom and democracy as 
the great alternatives to repression and radicalism. America calls on 
every country that stifles dissent to end its repression, to trust its 
people, and to grant its citizens the liberty they deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2007, as World 
Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our 
dedication to freedom and democracy.

Proclamation 8203 of November 15, 2007

America Recycles Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As citizens of this great Nation, we have a responsibility to practice 
good environmental stewardship. On America Recycles Day, we underscore 
our commitment to conserving our resources by recycling.
Through curbside collections and drop-off facilities, we are turning 
waste materials--including plastic, glass, aluminum cans, paper, tires, 
batteries, and building materials--into valuable resources. Recycling is 
one of our Nation's most successful environmental initiatives, and my 
Administration is working to increase opportunities for our citizens, 
communities, and businesses to recycle. The Resource Conservation 
Challenge, created by the Environmental Protection Agency, encourages 
public and private partnerships to promote recycling. Through Plug-In To 
eCycling, we are helping reduce waste by providing consumers with 
information on how and where they can donate or safely recycle old 
electronics. Working together, we can conserve valuable resources and 
energy by managing materials more efficiently.
On America Recycles Day and throughout the year, I encourage all 
Americans to recycle appropriate materials and products. By recycling, 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving energy, we can help 
build a healthier environment for everyone.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2007, as 
America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of

Proclamation 8204 of November 15, 2007

Thanksgiving Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans are a grateful people, ever mindful of the many ways we have 
been blessed. On Thanksgiving Day, we lift our hearts in gratitude for 
the freedoms we enjoy, the people we love, and the gifts of our 
prosperous land.
Our country was founded by men and women who realized their dependence 
on God and were humbled by His providence and grace. The early explorers 
and settlers who arrived in this land gave thanks for God's protection 
and for the extraordinary natural abundance they found. Since the first 
National Day of Thanksgiving was proclaimed by President George 
Washington, Americans have come together to offer thanks for our many 
blessings. We recall the great privilege it is to live in a land where 
freedom is the right of every person and where all can pursue their 
dreams. We express our deep appreciation for the sacrifices of the 
honorable men and women in uniform who defend liberty. As they work to 
advance the cause of freedom, our Nation keeps these brave individuals 
and their families in our thoughts, and we pray for their safe return.
While Thanksgiving is a time to gather in a spirit of gratitude with 
family, friends, and neighbors, it is also an opportunity to serve 
others and to share our blessings with those in need. By answering the 
universal call to love a neighbor as we want to be loved ourselves, we 
make our Nation a more hopeful and caring place.
This Thanksgiving, may we reflect upon the past year with gratefulness 
and look toward the future with hope. Let us give thanks for all we have 
been given and ask God to continue to bless our families and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 22, 
2007, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all Americans to 
gather together in their homes and places of worship with family, 
friends, and loved ones to reinforce the ties that bind us and give 
thanks for the freedoms and many blessings we enjoy.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

Proclamation 8205 of November 16, 2007

National Farm-City Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's agricultural industry contributes greatly to the strength 
of our economy. During National Farm-City Week, we honor the hard work 
and dedication of America's farmers and ranchers and we highlight the 
important urban and rural partnerships that help keep our country strong 
and prosperous.
America's farmers and ranchers embody an important part of our national 
heritage. As stewards of our land, our farmers and ranchers protect our 
soil, water, and wildlife habitat. With hard work, discipline, and 
ingenuity, they produce a safe and healthy food supply. Farmers and 
ranchers work closely with processors, transporters, and retailers, 
moving agricultural products from the farm to the homes of Americans and 
people around the world. My Administration is working to open new 
markets for American farm products and to encourage free and fair trade. 
By expanding opportunities for American farmers and ranchers, we can 
help keep our economy strong and growing.
As we celebrate Farm-City Week, we recognize the many contributions of 
America's farmers and ranchers and all those who work to strengthen the 
ties between our rural and urban communities. Our Nation is blessed by 
those who grow, harvest, and deliver these products, and we honor their 
dedication to feeding our country and the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 16 through 
November 22, 2007, as National Farm-City Week. I encourage all Americans 
to recognize the many accomplishments of our farmers and ranchers, and 
all those who contribute to the strength of America's agricultural 
industry.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the

Proclamation 8206 of November 16, 2007

National Family Week, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As families gather together to celebrate Thanksgiving, we underscore the 
comforting and positive role they play in our society. During National 
Family Week, we celebrate the contributions of families everywhere.

[[Page 128]]

Families strengthen our communities by teaching important values such as 
compassion and honesty to their children. Families also offer a 
supportive environment and help ensure that children grow into 
responsible members of society. By providing guidance and unconditional 
love, parents shape the character of their children.
My Administration believes that the strength of our Nation is built upon 
the foundation of strong families. To help support families, we have 
doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty, and lowered 
tax rates. We are also committed to promoting positive youth 
development. The Helping America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady 
Laura Bush, supports organizations, including faith-based and community 
groups, that continue this important mission.
All Americans are grateful to our Nation's military families, who have 
stood by their loved ones in times of war and peace. Our country will 
always be especially thankful for the sacrifices of our military 
personnel and for their devotion to duty and their love of country. 
During National Family Week, we pray for their safe return and for the 
families who await them at home.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18 through 
November 24, 2007, as National Family Week. I invite the States, 
communities, and all the people of the United States to join together in 
observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor 
our Nation's families.

Proclamation 8207 of November 29, 2007

World AIDS Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On World AIDS Day, we reaffirm our commitment to fighting and preventing 
HIV/AIDS in America and around the world. We also remember those who 
have lost their lives to this terrible disease and those who continue to 
suffer.
HIV/AIDS is a global challenge. In 2003, my Administration launched the 
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a $15 billion 
mobilization, to help support prevention, treatment, and care programs 
in some of the hardest hit countries around the world. PEPFAR's ABC 
approach--abstinence, being faithful, and using condoms--with abstinence 
as the only sure way to avoid the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS, is 
helping stop the spread of this devastating disease.

[[Page 129]]

In the United States as well, HIV/AIDS affects too many of our families, 
neighbors, and friends. We continue to fund research to develop new 
methods of treatment and prevention, and to emphasize voluntary HIV 
screening as a routine part of health care. The Ryan White CARE Act has 
provided Americans in need with better access to medical care, 
antiretroviral treatments, and counseling. With medicine, support, and 
their own daily courage, many citizens are managing a condition that was 
once often fatal.
The pandemic of HIV/AIDS can be defeated. The United States is taking 
the lead in this great effort, and we stand united with our 
international partners in combating this virus. We also recognize the 
essential role that faith-based and community organizations play in 
providing support and compassion to those living with the disease. By 
working together, we can give hope and comfort to millions.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2007, as World 
AIDS Day. On this day and throughout the year, the red ribbon helps 
raise awareness of the importance of fighting HIV/AIDS. This year, the 
White House will display this symbol from the North Portico to represent 
America's commitment to this struggle. I urge the Governors of the 
States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other 
territories subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the 
American people to join me in appropriate activities to remember those 
who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support and comfort to 
those living with this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Accidents related to drunk and drugged driving claim the lives of 
thousands of Americans every year. During National Drunk and Drugged 
Driving Prevention Month we seek to raise awareness about the dangers of 
driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and encourage citizens 
to drive responsibly.
As a Nation, we must work together to prevent drunk and drugged driving 
on our roads. We can all play an important role by educating family 
members and friends about the devastating consequences of impaired 
driving and by insisting that they have a designated driver. Businesses, 
community

[[Page 130]]

organizations, and faith-based groups can promote substance abuse 
prevention and encourage alternative sources of transportation. By 
encouraging our fellow citizens to make responsible choices, we can help 
save lives.
My Administration is dedicated to strengthening efforts against drunk 
and drugged driving. We have partnered with communities across America 
to increase public awareness about this serious crime and prevent 
impaired drivers from putting themselves and others at risk. Through 
high-visibility enforcement operations, the Department of 
Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is 
helping discourage individuals from drinking and driving. To take drug-
impaired drivers off the streets, the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy is working to give law enforcement officers the tools they need 
to detect when citizens are driving under the influence of drugs.
During National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month and 
throughout the year, we are reminded of the importance of driving free 
from the influence of alcohol and drugs. By working together, we can 
make our Nation's roadways safer for everyone.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2007 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make 
responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent drunk and 
drugged driving.

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On December 7, 1941, our Nation was viciously attacked at Pearl Harbor, 
America's Pacific Fleet was battered and broken, and more than 2,400 
American lives were lost. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 
America honors those brave individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice 
in defense of our homeland, and we recognize those veterans who with 
strength and resolve defended our Nation and advanced the cause of 
freedom during World War II.
When it mattered most, an entire generation of Americans stepped forward 
to protect our freedom and to defend liberty. Their devotion to duty and 
willingness to serve a cause greater than self helped secure our future 
and

[[Page 131]]

our way of life. Liberty prevailed because of the sacrifice of these 
courageous patriots, and America and her allies preserved a world where 
democracy could flourish. Our Nation remains forever in the debt of 
these brave Americans.
From the unprovoked attack at Pearl Harbor grew a steadfast resolve that 
has made America a defender of freedom around the world, and our mission 
continues as our men and women in uniform serve at home and in distant 
lands. Today, as we defend our Nation's founding ideals, we pay special 
tribute to those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor, honor our 
veterans of World War II, and celebrate the liberty that makes America a 
lasting symbol of hope to the world.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2007, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn 
occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal 
agencies, interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the 
flag of the United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of 
those who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans value deeply our ability to speak, assemble, and worship 
freely. As a Nation, we can help freedom-loving people everywhere build 
a world in which these rights are honored and respected. During Human 
Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we celebrate the 
freedoms guaranteed to all Americans and protected in our Constitution's 
Bill of Rights.
Many of these fundamental freedoms are still denied to people in 
countries around the world. The United States continues to stand with 
those who work to build democracy and secure the blessings of liberty. 
Individuals are struggling to create free societies in Cuba, Belarus, 
and Syria. And the day will come when they, and the citizens of other 
lands such as North Korea, Iran, Zimbabwe, and Sudan, will no longer be 
restricted from practicing their faith, voicing their opinions, and 
enjoying the many blessings of freedom.

[[Page 132]]

Freedom and dignity are God's gifts, and during Human Rights Day, Bill 
of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we look forward with confidence to 
the eventual triumph of human rights for all mankind.
NOW, THEREFORE, I , GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2007, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 2007, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week

Proclamation 8211 of December 11, 2007

Wright Brothers Day, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The cause of discovery and exploration is a desire written in the human 
heart. On Wright Brothers Day, we remember the achievement of two young 
brothers on the Outer Banks of North Carolina whose persistence, skill, 
ingenuity, and daring revolutionized the world.
Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first manned, powered flight on 
December 17, 1903. Orville experienced the thrill of flight when he felt 
the first lift of the wing of the small wood and canvas aircraft that 
would travel 120 feet in 12 seconds. The brothers' passion and spirit of 
discovery helped define our Nation and paved the way for future 
generations of innovators to launch satellites, orbit the Earth, and 
travel to the Moon and back.
Our country is continuing the Wright brothers' great American journey. 
My Administration is committed to advancing space science, human space 
flight, and space exploration. We will continue to work to expand the 
horizons of human knowledge to ensure that America is at the forefront 
of discovery for decades to come.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as 
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of 
each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested 
the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of 
the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2007, as Wright Brothers Day.

Millions of Americans lend their time, talent, and energy to become 
mentors and make a difference in children's lives. During National 
Mentoring Month, we honor these caring individuals for their dedication 
to changing our country one heart and soul at a time.
By sharing their knowledge and experiences, mentors serve as examples 
for young people and help teach them the skills they need to succeed in 
life. They also provide stability, instill important values, and build 
confidence in those they assist. Mentors are soldiers in the armies of 
compassion, and they encourage children to set goals and achieve their 
dreams.
My Administration is committed to helping our Nation's children realize 
their full potential by expanding opportunities for Americans to mentor. 
To raise awareness of the challenges facing our youth and encourage 
adults to connect with young people through family, school, and 
community, First Lady Laura Bush is leading the Helping America's Youth 
initiative. Through the USA Freedom Corps, we are connecting individuals 
with volunteer opportunities, including mentors who work with young 
people in schools and community organizations. By encouraging Americans 
to mentor, we are doing our part to see that more of America's children 
grow into strong, confident, and successful adults.
I appreciate all those who reach out to young people and inspire future 
generations to pass on this rich tradition that makes our country 
strong. I urge all Americans to get involved in mentoring programs and 
to visit the USA Freedom Corps website at volunteer.gov to learn more 
about mentoring opportunities in their communities. Together, we can 
build a culture of service and foster a more compassionate society that 
recognizes the value and purpose in every single human life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2008 as National 
Mentoring Month. I call upon all Americans to recognize the importance 
of mentoring, to look for opportunities to serve as mentors in their 
communities, and to observe this month with appropriate activities and 
programs.

Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

2. The Parties to the Agreement entered into an amendment to the 
Agreement on July 27, August 6, and August 14, 2007 (the ``Amendment''). 
The terms of the Amendment are contained in letters of understanding 
between the United States and the Agreement countries described in 
sections 1634(a)(2) and 1634(b)(2) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006

4. Section 203(o) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4033) authorizes the 
President to proclaim, as part of the HTS, the provisions set out in 
Annex 4.1 of the Agreement.
5. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the

consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with 3 U.S.C. 301, when carrying out functions vested in the 
President by statute and assigned by the President to CITA, the 
officials collectively exercising those functions are all to be officers 
required to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of 
the Senate.
6. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance

[[Page 135]]

of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import 
treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 203 of the CAFTA-DR Act, section 1634 of the Pension Protection 
Act, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the

 (b) Section D of that Annex.
(2) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraph (1)(a) of this 
proclamation shall enter into effect on the date, as announced by the 
United States Trade Representative in the Federal Register, that the 
Amendment enters into force and shall be effective with respect to goods 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after that 
date.
(3) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraph (1)(b) of this 
proclamation shall enter into effect on the date, as announced by the 
United States Trade Representative in the Federal Register, that the 
Amendment has entered into force and the conditions set forth in

of the Agreement have been fulfilled, and shall be effective with 
respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, 
on or after that date.
(4) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 203(o) 
of the CAFTA-DR Act to implement Appendix 4.1-B of the Agreement by 
determining whether and, if so, by what amount, to increase in 
accordance with paragraph 3 or footnote 2 of that Appendix the 
quantitative limits in the provisions of the HTS set out in section D of 
the Annex to this proclamation.
(5)The United States Trade Representative shall modify U.S. note 21 to

Proclamation 8214 of December 27, 2007

To Adjust the Rules of Origin Under the United States-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement and the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 
(the ``1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to 
proclaim modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) based on the recommendations of the U.S. International 
Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') under section 1205 of the 1988 Act 
(19 U.S.C. 3005), if he determines that the modifications are in 
conformity with United States obligations under the International 
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System 
(the ``Convention'') and do not run counter to the national economic 
interest of the United States. In 2006, the Commission recommended 
modifications to the HTS pursuant to section 1205 of the 1988 Act to 
conform the HTS to amendments made to the Convention. In Presidential 
Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, I modified the HTS pursuant to 
section 1206 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to the amendments to the 
Convention.
2. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Chile 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USCFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to 
be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3 
(including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to 
originating goods set forth in Annex 3.3 to the USCFTA), 3.7, 3.9, and 
3.20(8), (9), (10), and (11) of the USCFTA.
3. In order to ensure the continuation of the staged reductions in rates 
of duty for originating goods from Chile in categories that were 
modified to conform to the Convention, I proclaimed in Presidential 
Proclamation 8097 modifications to the HTS that I determined were 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in 
Proclamation 7746.
4. Chile is a party to the Convention. Because the substance of changes 
to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing form in the 
national tariff schedules of the parties to the USCFTA, the rules of 
origin set out in Annex 4.1 of that Agreement must be changed to ensure 
that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USCFTA to 
originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff 
categories that were modified in Proclamation 8097. The USCFTA parties 
have agreed to make these changes.
5. Section 202 of the USCFTA provides certain rules for determining 
whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing 
tariff treatment under the USCFTA. Section 202(o) of the USCFTA Act 
authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the 
USCFTA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the 
USCFTA, subject to the exceptions stated in section 202(o)(2)(A).

[[Page 153]]

6. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed 
pursuant to section 202 of the USCFTA Act and section 1206(a) of the 
1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of 
tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under 
tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and to carry out the 
duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 7746.
7. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to 
the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-
Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USSFTA Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I 
determined necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.2, 
2.5, 2.6, and 2.12 of the USSFTA and the schedule of reductions with 
respect to the United States set forth in Annex 2B of the USSFTA.
8. In order to ensure the continuation of the staged reductions in rates 
of duty for originating goods from Singapore in categories that were 
modified to conform to the Convention, in Presidential Proclamation 
8097, I proclaimed modifications to the HTS that I determined were 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in 
Proclamation 7747.
9. Singapore is a party to the Convention. Because the substance of the 
changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing form in 
the national tariff schedules of the parties to the USSFTA, the 
provisions set out in Annexes 3A and 3B of that Agreement must be 
changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded 
under the USSFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under 
the tariff categories that were modified in Presidential Proclamation 
8097. The USSFTA parties have agreed to make these changes.
10. Section 202 of the USSFTA Act provides certain rules for determining 
whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing 
tariff treatment under the USSFTA. Section 202(o) of the USSFTA Act 
authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the 
USSFTA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the 
USSFTA, subject to certain exceptions set out in section 202(o)(2)(A).
11. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed 
pursuant to section 202 of the USSFTA Act are necessary or appropriate 
to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded 
originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 
and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 7747.
12. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, affecting 
import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, 
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that any modifications proclaimed by the 
President under section 1206(a) of that Act may not take effect before 
the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation 
is published in the Federal Register.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution

[[Page 154]]

and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited 
to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, section 202 of the USSFTA Act, 
section 202 of the USCFTA Act, and section 604 of the Trade Act, do 
proclaim that:
(1) In order to reflect in the HTS the modifications to the rules of 
origin under the USCFTA, general note 26 to the HTS is modified as 
provided in Annex I to this proclamation.
(2) In order to reflect in the HTS the modifications to the rules of 
origin under the USSFTA, general note 25 to the HTS is modified as 
provided in Annex II to this proclamation.
(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
(4) The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS set forth 
in Annexes I and II to this proclamation shall be effective with respect 
to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after the later of (i) February 1, 2008, or (ii) the thirtieth day after 
the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.
GEORGE W. BUSH

maiming (article 124, UCMJ); or assault (article 128, UCMJ) against a 
pregnant woman. For all underlying offenses, except arson, this article 
requires that the victim of the underlying offense be the pregnant mother. 
For purposes of arson, the pregnant mother must have some nexus to the 
arson such that she sustained some ``bodily injury'' due to the arson. For 
the purposes of this article the term ``woman'' means a female of any age. 
This article does not permit the prosecution of any --

(a) person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the 
pregnant woman, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf, has 
been obtained or for which such consent is implied by law;

(b) person for any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn 
child; or

should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was 
pregnant; or

[[Page 211]]

(b) the accused intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the 
unborn child.

(3) The offense of ``attempting to kill an unborn child'' requires that the 
accused intended by his conduct to cause the death of the unborn child (See 
paragraph b(3)(c) above).

(4) Bodily injury. For the purpose of this offense, the term ``bodily 
injury'' is that which is provided by section 1365 of title 18, to wit: a 
cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement; physical pain; illness; 
impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or 
any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary.

Executive Order 13435 of June 20, 2007

Expanding Approved Stem Cell Lines in Ethically Responsible Ways

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and to provide leadership with 
respect to research on pluripotent stem cells derived by ethically 
responsible techniques so that the potential of pluripotent stem cells 
can be explored without violating human dignity or demeaning human life, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Research on Alternative Sources of Pluripotent Stem Cells. 
(a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall conduct 
and support research on the isolation, derivation, production, and 
testing of stem cells that are capable of producing all or almost all of 
the cell types of the developing body and may result in improved 
understanding of or treatments for diseases and other adverse health 
conditions, but are derived without creating a human embryo for research 
purposes or destroying, discarding, or subjecting to harm a human embryo 
or fetus.
(b) Within 90 days of this order, the Secretary, after such consultation 
with the Director of the National Institutes of Health (Director), shall 
issue a plan, including such mechanisms as requests for proposals, 
requests for applications, program announcements and other appropriate 
means, to implement subsection (a) of this section, that:

(i) specifies and reflects a determination of the extent to which specific 
techniques may require additional basic or animal research to ensure that 
any research involving human cells using these techniques is clearly 
consistent with the standards established under this order and applicable 
law;

(ii) prioritizes research with the greatest potential for clinical benefit;

(iii) takes into account techniques outlined by the President's Council on 
Bioethics, and any other appropriate techniques and research, provided they 
clearly meet the standard set forth in subsection (a) of this section;

(iv) renames the ``Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry'' the ``Human 
Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry;'' and

(v) adds to the registry new human pluripotent stem cell lines that clearly 
meet the standard set forth in subsection (a) of this section.

(c) Not later than December 31 of each year, the Secretary shall report 
to the President on the activities carried out under this order during 
the past fiscal year, including a description of the research carried 
out or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services, 
including the National Institutes of Health, and other developments in 
the science of pluripotent stem cells not derived from human embryos.
Sec. 2. Policy. The activities undertaken and supported by and under the 
direction of the Secretary shall be clearly consistent with the 
following policies and principles:
(a) the purposes of this order are (i) to direct the Department of 
Health and Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health, 
to intensify

[[Page 223]]

peer reviewed research that may result in improved understanding of or 
treatments for diseases and other adverse health conditions, and (ii) to 
promote the derivation of human pluripotent stem cell lines from a 
variety of alternative sources while clearly meeting the standard set 
forth in section 1(a) of this order;
(b) it is critical to establish moral and ethical boundaries to allow 
the Nation to move forward vigorously with medical research, while also 
maintaining the highest ethical standards and respecting human life and 
human dignity;
(c) the destruction of nascent life for research violates the principle 
that no life should be used as a mere means for achieving the medical 
benefit of another;
(d) human embryos and fetuses, as living members of the human species, 
are not raw materials to be exploited or commodities to be bought and 
sold; and
(e) the Federal Government has a duty to exercise responsible 
stewardship of taxpayer funds, both supporting important medical 
research and respecting ethical and moral boundaries.
Sec. 3. Interpretation of this Order. (a) For purposes of this order, 
the term ``human embryo'' shall mean any organism, not protected as a 
human subject under 45 CFR 46 as of the date of this order, that is 
derived by fertilization, parthenogenesis, cloning, or any other means 
from one or more human gametes or human diploid cells.
(b) For purposes of this order, the term ``subjecting to harm a human 
embryo'' shall mean subjecting such an embryo to risk of injury or death 
greater than that allowed for research on fetuses in utero under 45 CFR 
46.204(b) and section 498(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
289g(b)) as of the date of this order.
(c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to affect any policy, 
guideline, or regulation regarding embryonic stem cell research, human 
cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer, or any other research not 
specifically authorized by this order, or to forbid the use of existing 
stem cell lines deemed eligible for other federally funded research in 
accordance with the presidential policy decision of August 9, 2001, for 
research specifically authorized by this order.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
(b) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity, by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.

Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts 
in Iraq

seq.)(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.)(NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,

[[Page 225]]

I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that, 
due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States posed by acts of violence 
threatening the peace and stability of Iraq and undermining efforts to 
promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq and to 
provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, it is in the 
interests of the United States to take additional steps with respect to 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 
2003, and expanded in Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, and 
relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13350 of July 
29, 2004, and Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004. I hereby 
order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), 
and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or in 
regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant 
to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any 
license or permit granted prior to the date of this order, all property 
and interests in property of the following persons, that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States 
persons, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary 
of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the 
Secretary of Defense,

(i) to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, an act 
or acts of violence that have the purpose or effect of:

    (A) threatening the peace or stability of Iraq or the 
Government of Iraq; or
    (B) undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and 
political reform in Iraq or to provide humanitarian assistance to 
the Iraqi people;

(ii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in 
support of, such an act or acts of violence or any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or

(iii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

(b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include, but are 
not limited to, (i) the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order, 
and (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services from any such person.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For purposes of this order:

[[Page 226]]

(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type 
specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, 
or for the benefit of, any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my 
ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13303 and expanded in Executive Order 13315, and I hereby prohibit such 
donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13303 and expanded in Executive Order 13315, there need be no 
prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) 
of this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, is hereby authorized to 
take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, 
and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the 
Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and 
agencies of the United States Government, consistent with applicable 
law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to 
take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the 
provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary 
of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.
Sec. 7. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued 
effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other 
forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect 
heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly 
terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.

Executive Order 13440 of July 20, 2007

Interpretation of the Geneva Conventions Common Article 3 as Applied to 
a Program of Detention and Interrogation Operated by the Central 
Intelligence Agency

By the authority vested in me as President and Commander in Chief of the 
Armed Forces by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public 
Law 107-40), the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-366), 
and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as 
follows:
Section 1. General Determinations. (a) The United States is engaged in 
an armed conflict with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. 
Members of al Qaeda were responsible for the attacks on the United 
States of September 11, 2001, and for many other terrorist attacks, 
including against the United States, its personnel, and its allies 
throughout the world. These forces continue to fight the United States 
and its allies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, and they continue to 
plan additional acts of terror throughout the world. On February 7, 
2002, I determined for the United States that members of al Qaeda, the 
Taliban, and associated forces are unlawful enemy combatants who are not 
entitled to the protections that the Third Geneva Convention provides to 
prisoners of war. I hereby reaffirm that determination.
(b) The Military Commissions Act defines certain prohibitions of Common 
Article 3 for United States law, and it reaffirms and reinforces the 
authority of the President to interpret the meaning and application of 
the Geneva Conventions.
Sec. 2. Definitions. As used in this order:
(a) ``Common Article 3'' means Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.
(b) ``Geneva Conventions'' means:

(i) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and 
Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 
3114);

(ii) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick 
and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, done at Geneva August 12, 
1949 (6 UST 3217);

(iii) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, done at 
Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and

(iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time 
of War, done at Geneva August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).

(c) ``Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment'' means the 
cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the 
Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the 
United States.
Sec. 3. Compliance of a Central Intelligence Agency Detention and 
Interrogation Program with Common Article 3. (a) Pursuant to the 
authority of the

[[Page 230]]

President under the Constitution and the laws of the United States, 
including the Military Commissions Act of 2006, this order interprets 
the meaning and application of the text of Common Article 3 with respect 
to certain detentions and interrogations, and shall be treated as 
authoritative for all purposes as a matter of United States law, 
including satisfaction of the international obligations of the United 
States. I hereby determine that Common Article 3 shall apply to a 
program of detention and interrogation operated by the Central 
Intelligence Agency as set forth in this section. The requirements set 
forth in this section shall be applied with respect to detainees in such 
program without adverse distinction as to their race, color, religion or 
faith, sex, birth, or wealth.
(b) I hereby determine that a program of detention and interrogation 
approved by the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency fully 
complies with the obligations of the United States under Common Article 
3, provided that:

program do not include:

    (A) torture, as defined in section 2340 of title 18, United 
States Code;
    (B) any of the acts prohibited by section 2441(d) of title 18,

treatment, mutilation or maiming, intentionally causing serious 
bodily injury, rape, sexual assault or abuse, taking of hostages, 
or performing of biological experiments;
    (C) other acts of violence serious enough to be considered 
comparable to murder, torture, mutilation, and cruel or inhuman 
treatment, as defined in section 2441(d) of title 18, United 
States Code;
    (D) any other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment 
or punishment prohibited by the Military Commissions Act 
(subsection 6(c) of Public Law 109-366) and the Detainee Treatment 
Act of 2005 (section 1003 of Public Law 109-148 and section 1403 
of Public Law 109-163);
    (E) willful and outrageous acts of personal abuse done for the 
purpose of humiliating or degrading the individual in a manner so 
serious that any reasonable person, considering the circumstances, 
would deem the acts to be beyond the bounds of human decency, such

humiliation, forcing the individual to perform sexual acts or to 
pose sexually, threatening the individual with sexual mutilation, 
or using the individual as a human shield; or
    (F) acts intended to denigrate the religion, religious 
practices, or religious objects of the individual;

    (B) likely to be in possession of information that:

attacks, such as attacks within the United States or against its 
Armed Forces or other personnel, citizens, or facilities, or

other countries cooperating in the war on terror with the United 
States, or their armed forces or other personnel, citizens, or 
facilities; or
(2) could assist in locating the senior leadership of al Qaeda, 
the Taliban, or associated forces;

(iii) the interrogation practices are determined by the Director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, based upon professional advice, to be safe for 
use with each detainee with whom they are used; and

(iv) detainees in the program receive the basic necessities of life, 
including adequate food and water, shelter from the elements, necessary 
clothing, protection from extremes of heat and cold, and essential medical 
care.

(c) The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall issue written 
policies to govern the program, including guidelines for Central 
Intelligence Agency personnel that implement paragraphs (i)(C), (E), and 
(F) of subsection 3(b) of this order, and including requirements to 
ensure:

(i) safe and professional operation of the program;

(ii) the development of an approved plan of interrogation tailored for each 
detainee in the program to be interrogated, consistent with subsection 
3(b)(iv) of this order;

(iii) appropriate training for interrogators and all personnel operating 
the program;

(iv) effective monitoring of the program, including with respect to medical 
matters, to ensure the safety of those in the program; and

(v) compliance with applicable law and this order.

Sec. 4. Assignment of Function. With respect to the program addressed in 
this order, the function of the President under section 6(c)(3) of the 
Military Commissions Act of 2006 is assigned to the Director of National

Executive Order 13441 of August 1, 2007

Its Democratic Processes and Institutions

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)(NEA), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, determine 
that the actions of certain persons to undermine Lebanon's legitimate 
and democratically elected government or democratic institutions, to 
contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Lebanon, 
including through politically motivated violence and intimidation, to 
reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian interference in Lebanon, 
or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese sovereignty contribute to 
political and economic instability in that country and the region and 
constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national 
emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), 
and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or in 
regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant 
to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any 
license or permit granted prior to the date of this order, all property 
and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of any United States person, including any 
overseas branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
(i) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

(A) to have taken, or to pose a significant risk of taking, actions, 
including acts of violence, that have the purpose or effect of undermining 
Lebanon's democratic processes or institutions, contributing to the 
breakdown of the rule of law in Lebanon, supporting the reassertion of 
Syrian control or otherwise contributing to Syrian interference in Lebanon, 
or infringing upon or undermining Lebanese sovereignty;

(B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, 
such actions, including acts of violence, or any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order;

(C) to be a spouse or dependent child of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or

(D) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on 
behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

[[Page 233]]

(b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section would 
seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared 
in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include but are not 
limited to (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, 
goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order, 
and (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services from any such person.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in

permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that, for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, 
there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made 
pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, 
where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely 
manner of the measures taken. The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure 
compliance with those provisions of section 401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 
1641) applicable to the Department of the Treasury in relation to this 
order.

[[Page 234]]

final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any 
right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 
law or in equity by any party against the United States, its 
departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or 
employees, or any other person.

Executive Order 13448 of October 18, 2007

Blocking Property and Prohibiting Certain Transactions
Related to Burma

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), the Burmese Freedom 
and Democracy Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-61, as amended, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
note), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to 
take additional steps with respect to the Government of Burma's 
continued repression of the democratic opposition in Burma,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby 
expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13047 of May 20, 1997, and relied upon for additional steps taken in 
Executive Order 13310 of July 28, 2003, finding that the Government of 
Burma's continued repression of the democratic opposition in Burma, 
manifested most recently in the violent response to peaceful 
demonstrations, the commission of human rights abuses related to 
political repression, and engagement in public corruption, including by 
diverting or misusing Burmese public assets or by misusing public 
authority, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby 
order:
Section 1. Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), and 
(4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), the Trade Sanctions 
Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public Law 106-
387), or regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued 
pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or 
any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, 
all property and interests in property of the following persons that are 
in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or 
that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United 
States persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked and may 
not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
(a) the persons listed in the Annex attached and made a part of this 
order; and
(b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

(i) to be a senior official of the Government of Burma, the State Peace and 
Development Council of Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association of Burma, or any successor entity to any of the foregoing;

(ii) to be responsible for, or to have participated in, human rights abuses 
related to political repression in Burma;

(iii) to be engaged, or to have engaged, in activities facilitating public 
corruption by senior officials of the Government of Burma;

(iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in 
support

[[Page 305]]

of, the Government of Burma, the State Peace and Development Council of 
Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development Association of Burma, any 
successor entity to any of the foregoing, any senior official of any of the 
foregoing, or any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310 or section 1(b)(i)-(v) of this 
order;

(v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for 
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310 or 
section 1(b)(i)-(v) of this order; or

(vi) to be a spouse or dependent child of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order or Executive Order 
13310.

Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States; and
(d) the term ``Government of Burma'' means the Government of Burma 
(sometimes referred to as Myanmar), its agencies, instrumentalities and 
controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Burma.
Sec. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type 
specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, 
or for the benefit of, persons whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair 
my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13047, and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive 
Order 13310, and expanded in this order, and hereby prohibit such 
donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the 
ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice 
to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would 
render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these 
measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13047, and relied upon for additional steps taken in 
Executive Order 13310, and expanded in this order, there need be no 
prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order.

[[Page 306]]

Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and section 4 of the Burmese Freedom 
and Democracy Act of 2003 as may be necessary to carry out the purposes 
of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these 
functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government 
consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States 
Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within 
their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is authorized to determine, subsequent to the 
effective date of this order, that circumstances no longer warrant 
inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that the property 
and interests in property of that person are therefore no longer blocked 
pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued 
effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other 
forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect 
heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly 
terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.
Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other 
person.
Sec. 10. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
October 19, 2007.

or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any

Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 10 of the RLA, 
from the date of the creation of the Board and for 30 days after the 
Board has submitted its report to the President, no change in the 
conditions out of which the disputes arose shall be made by the parties 
to the controversy, except by agreement of the parties.
Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of the Board are 
records of the Office of the President and upon the Board's termination 
shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation 
Board.

report provided for in section 2 of this order.

Notice of January 18, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt 
the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, as expanded on August 
20, 1998, and the measures adopted on those dates to deal with that 
emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2007. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of February 5, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain 
Persons Contributing to the Conflict in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire

On February 7, 2006, by Executive Order 13396, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons contributing to the conflict in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, pursuant to 
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I 
took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the situation in or in relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, 
which has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council in 
Resolution 1572 of November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, and 
has resulted in the massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread 
human rights abuses, significant political violence and unrest, and 
attacks against international peacekeeping forces leading to fatalities.

[[Page 320]]

Because the situation in or in relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire continues 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
February 7, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond February 7, 2007. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13396.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent 
occasions, the Cuban government stated its intent to forcefully defend 
its sovereignty against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that 
might enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a 
flotilla or peaceful protest. Since these events, the Cuban government 
has not demonstrated that it will

[[Page 325]]

refrain from the future use of reckless and excessive force against U.S. 
vessels or aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful 
protest north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the 
scope of the national emergency was expanded in order to deny monetary 
and material support to the repressive Cuban government, which had taken 
a series of steps to destabilize relations with the United States, 
including threatening to abrogate the Migration Accords with the United 
States and to close the United States Interests Section. Further, Cuba's 
most senior officials repeatedly asserted that the United States 
intended to invade Cuba, despite explicit denials from the U.S. 
Secretaries of State and Defense that such action is planned. Therefore, 
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to 
Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the 
anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867 as 
amended and expanded by Proclamation 7757.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of February 28, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, I declared a national 
emergency and blocked the property of persons undermining democratic 
processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action 
to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy 
of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. These actions have 
contributed to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, 
politically motivated violence and intimidation, and political and 
economic instability in the southern African region. On November 22, 
2005, I issued Executive Order 13391 to take additional steps with 
respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 by 
ordering the blocking of the property of additional persons undermining 
democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date and on November 22, 2005, to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2007. Therefore, 
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government 
of

[[Page 326]]

Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes 
or institutions.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 490(b)(1)(A) of the Foreign Assistance Act, I hereby

pseudoephedrine and ephedrine in 2005 (Belgium, China, Germany, India,

the Director of National Intelligence
 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws

Code, the functions of the President under section 821 of the Foreign

Defense.
In the performance of their respective functions under this memorandum, 
the Secretaries of State and Defense shall, as appropriate, consult each

Notice of March 8, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued 
Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, the President issued 
Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2007. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2006.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law

repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the

and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter 
alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq. On July 28, 2003, I

[[Page 334]]

issued Executive Order 13310 taking additional steps with respect to 
that national emergency by putting in place an import ban required by 
the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, and prohibiting exports 
of financial services to Burma and the dealing in property in which 
certain designated Burmese persons have an interest.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on

emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other 
property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (IEEPA). I took this

Because the obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the

Accordingly, I hereby waive section 550(a) of the FOAA, as amended, and

Notice of June 14, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain 
Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus

On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Belarus, 
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706). I took this action in response to the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members 
of the Government of Belarus and other persons that have undermined 
democratic processes or institutions; committed human rights abuses 
related to political repression, including detentions and 
disappearances; and engaged in public corruption, including by diverting 
or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.
Because these actions and policies continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond June 16, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13405.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of June 19, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``order''), blocking property and interests in property of the 
Government of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of United States persons that are 
directly related to the implementation of the Agreement Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Russian Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium 
Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related 
contracts and agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU 
Agreements allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived 
from nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., and 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of 
the Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2007, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the 
Russian Federation. This notice shall be published in the Federal 
Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of June 22, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the Western Balkans pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy

[[Page 340]]

of the United States constituted by the actions of persons engaged in, 
or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) extremist violence in the 
Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or 
(ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in 
Kosovo. I subsequently amended that order in Executive Order 13304 of 
May 28, 2003.
Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and international 
stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and 
the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that 
emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2007. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the Western Balkans.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Notice of July 19, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Former 
Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures, including the blocking of 
property of certain persons associated with the former Liberian regime 
of Charles Taylor, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States constituted by the actions and policies of former Liberian 
President Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular, their 
unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia 
and secreting of Liberian funds and property, which have undermined 
Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly development of its 
political, administrative, and economic institutions and resources. I 
further noted that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on August 
18, 2003, and the related cease-fire had not yet been universally 
implemented throughout Liberia, and that the illicit trade in round logs

[[Page 345]]

and timber products was linked to the proliferation of and trafficking 
in illegal arms, which perpetuated the Liberian conflict and fueled and 
exacerbated other conflicts throughout West Africa.
Today, Liberia is engaged in a peaceful transition to a democratic order 
under the administration of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. The 
regulations implementing Executive Order 13348, clarify that the subject 
of this national emergency has been and remains limited to the former 
Liberian regime of Charles Taylor and specified other persons and not 
the country, citizens, Government, or Central Bank of Liberia.
Charles Taylor is today standing trial in The Hague by the Special Court 
for Sierra Leone. However, stability in Liberia is still fragile. The 
actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others have left a legacy of 
destruction that still has the potential to undermine Liberia's 
transformation and recovery.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on July 22, 2004, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond July 22, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergency Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13348.

national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 
1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). Because the Export 
Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national 
emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond 
August 17, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the

support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts 
of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, 
including the terrorist attacks in New York, in Pennsylvania, and 
against the Pentagon committed on September 11, 2001, and the continuing 
and immediate threat of further attacks against United States nationals 
or the United States. Because the actions of these persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the United States, the national emergency 
declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 
2007. Therefore, in accordance with section

[[Page 351]]

202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

The admission of up to 80,000 refugees to the United States during FY

immigrant admissions program, as provided below. The ceiling shall be 
construed as a maximum not to be exceeded and not a minimum to be 
achieved.

special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the 
following regional allocations; provided, however, that the number of 
admissions allocated to the East Asia region shall include persons 
admitted to the United States during FY 2008 with Federal refugee 
resettlement assistance under section 584 of the Foreign Operations,

Notice of October 18, 2007

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant 
Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States 
and abroad.
The order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, or within the possession or control of United States 
persons, of foreign persons listed in an annex to the order, as well as 
of foreign persons determined to play a significant role in 
international narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia. The order 
similarly blocks all property and interests in property of foreign 
persons determined to materially assist in, or provide financial or 
technological support for or goods or services in support of, the 
narcotics trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant to 
the order. In addition, the order blocks all property and interests in 
property of persons determined to be owned or controlled by, or to act 
for or on behalf of, persons designated in or pursuant to the order.
The order also prohibits any transaction or dealing by United States 
persons or within the United States in property or interests in property 
of the persons designated in or pursuant to the order.
Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States and to cause an extreme level of violence, 
corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad, the national 
emergency declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted 
pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
beyond October 21, 2007.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in

On October 27, 2006, by Executive Order 13413, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), ordered related 
measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the 
conflict in that country. I took this action to deal with the unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the situation in or in relation to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and 
atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability and was 
addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1596 of 
April 18, 2005, Resolution 1649 of December 21, 2005, and Resolution 
1698 of July 31, 2006.
Because this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared on October 27, 2006, and the measures adopted on that 
date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 
27, 2007. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Sudan, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
the Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, in Executive Order 13400, I 
determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States, expanded the scope of the national emergency to deal 
with that threat, and ordered the blocking of property of certain 
persons connected to the conflict. On October 13, 2006, I issued 
Executive Order 13412 to take additional steps with respect to the 
national emergency and to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability 
Act of 2006.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 3, 1997, as expanded on April 26, 2006, must continue in effect 
beyond November 3, 2007. Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency with respect to Sudan.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons

[[Page 361]]

``weapons of mass destruction'' and the means of delivering such 
weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 
amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the 
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
activities. On June 28, 2005, I issued Executive Order 13382 which, 
inter alia, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our ability 
to combat proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States; therefore, the national 
emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, and extended in each 
subsequent year, must continue. In accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.

Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in 
Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, 
and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981 agreements with 
Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2007. Therefore,

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws 
of the United States including 49 U.S.C. 44302, et seq., I hereby:

or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may

participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;

<R05>
Sec. 102.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 371]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

apply to buildings covered by this section.

Sec. 102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.
