                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    Source: 57 FR 56438, Nov. 30, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 400.27  Applicability.

    Notwithstanding any provisions of the crop insurance policy to the 
contrary, the mutual consent provision contained herein shall be 
applicable to all new crop insurance policies issued by the Federal Crop 
Insurance Corporation (7 CFR part 401 et seq.), or by a company 
reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, effective for the 
applicable crop year only if those policies meet the requirements of 
Sec. 400.28 of this subpart and if the crop insured is the same as the 
crop for which a disaster payment application (CCC 441) was filed for 
the previous crop year.

[58 FR 67304, Dec. 21, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 400.28  Mutual consent criteria.

which the insured filed a CCC 441 for the applicable crop year if 
written documentation is provided, signed by an authorized Agricultural 
Stabilization and Conservation Service official, certifying the 
cancellation is based on one of the following conditions:
    (1) Insurance was not a condition of eligibility for disaster 
payment, based on one or more of the statutory criteria; or
    (2) the producer withdrew his application for disaster payments with 
prejudice or it was rejected by Commodity Credit Corporation;
    (b) Cancellation requests must be received in writing no later than 
three weeks after the date:
    (1) The disaster payment check is issued; or
    (2) The producer is notified that an application for disaster 
payment has been rejected; or
    (3) The producer withdraws from the disaster payment program.
    (c) Carryover policies are not available for mutual consent 
cancellation. Crop insurance applications dated before the disaster 
cancellation date (available in the insureds' service office) are not 
eligible for mutual consent cancellations.

<R05>
Sec. 400.45  Applicability.

    (a) The regulations in this subpart implement Chapter XII and 
section 1764 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) (the Act) 
requiring the denial of crop insurance to persons who are determined to 
have performed certain practices prohibited by the Act or who have 
violated certain federal or State statutes or the regulations 
implementing the Act. The provisions of this subpart are applicable to 
all crop insurance policies written by the Federal Crop Insurance 
Corporation (the Corporation) or reinsured by the Corporation.
    (b) The provisions of this subpart will be effective for the crop 
and crop year immediately following the first crop cancellation date 
occurring after the effective date of the Act for all crop policies 
reinsured by FCIC, and for all policies and regulations for crop 
insurance issued by FCIC.


<R05>
Sec. 400.46  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this regulation and in addition to the 
definitions included at 7 CFR 12.2, the following definitions are 
applicable:
    (a) Controlled substance means any prohibited drug-producing plants 
including, but not limited to, cacti of the genus lophophora, coca 
bushes (erythroxylum coca), marijuana (cannabis satiua), opium poppies 
(papauer somniferum), and other drug-producing plants, the planting and 
harvesting of which is prohibited by Federal or State law.
    (b) Person means any producer, tenant, or landlord, insured under a 
policy of crop insurance issued by FCIC, or by a multi-peril insurance 
company whose crop insurance policy is reinsured by FCIC.
    (c) State means each of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United 
States, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, or the Trust Territory of the Pacific.
    (d) The Act means the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198).


<R05>
Sec. 400.47  Denial of crop insurance.

    (a) Any person convicted under Federal or State law of planting, 
cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting or storing a controlled 
substance in any crop year will be ineligible for crop insurance during 
that crop year and the four succeeding crop years.
    (1) The insurance of such person insured by FCIC who found to be 
ineligible under paragraph (a) of this section will be null and void, 
and any indemnity paid on such insurance must be returned in full to 
FCIC. Any premium paid for insurance coverage declared null and void 
will be returned, less a reasonable amount for expenses and handling not 
to exceed 20 percent of the premium paid.
    (2) The application and policy of insurance will be voided, or the 
person will be removed from the policy and the policyholder share 
reduced in accordance with 7 CFR 400.681(b), when any person becomes 
ineligible for crop insurance under the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section. To obtain crop insurance coverage following the period of 
ineligibility, the person must submit a new application for crop 
insurance.
    (b) Any insurance written by a multi-peril crop insurance company to 
any person who is ineligible under the provisions of this subpart is not 
eligible for reinsurance under the Corporation's standard reinsurance 
agreement. Any premium subsidy and expense allowance or loss paid by the 
Corporation because of such agreement will be immediately refunded to 
the Corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, policies 
written by multi-peril crop insurance companies to any person ineligible 
under the provisions of this subpart are null and void. Premium paid for 
such policies will be refunded to the person applying for insurance, 
less a reasonable amount for expenses and handling not to exceed 20

[[Page 11]]

percent of the premium paid, and no indemnity will be paid unless the 
multi-peril company expressly agrees to continue such policy in effect 
without FCIC reinsurance. However, if the reinsured company follows the 
procedure of the Corporation and the requirements of the regulations, 
reinsurance will continue to be provided under the reinsurance agreement 
on the policy unless it is shown that the agent or company had knowledge 
of facts which would indicate ineligibility on the part of the insured 
and failed to act on that knowledge.
    (c) FCIC employees or contractors are required to report all 
suspected cases of violation of the Act or the regulations to the 
appropriate agency for a determination of violation. Benefits shall not 
be paid in such cases pending a determination from the appropriate 
agency.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, any crop 
insurance policy where insurance attached to a crop prior to August 15, 
1986, will continue in effect for that crop until the next termination 
date following August 15, 1986.

    The APH program operates within limits prescribed by, and in 
accordance with, the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as 
amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), only on those crops identified in this 
section in those areas where the Actuarial Table provides coverage. 
Except when in conflict with this subpart, all provisions of the 
applicable crop insurance contract for these crops apply.


<R05>
Sec. 400.52  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions contained in the crop insurance 
contract,

[[Page 12]]

the following definitions apply for the purposes of the APH Coverage 
Program:
    (a) APH--Actual Production History.
    (b) Actual yield--The yield per acre for a crop year calculated from 
the production records or claims for indemnities. The actual yield is 
determined by dividing total production (which includes harvested and 
appraised production) by planted acres for annual crops or by insurable 
acres for perennial crops.
    (c) Adjusted yield--The transitional or determined yield reduced by 
the applicable percentage for lack of records. The adjusted yield will 
equal 65 percent of the transitional or determined yield, if no producer 
records are submitted; 80 percent, if records for one year are 
submitted; and 90 percent, if two years of records are submitted.
    (d) Appraised production--Production determined by the Agricultural 
Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), the FCIC, or a company 
reinsured by the FCIC, that was unharvested but which reflected the 
crop's yield potential at the time of the appraisal. For the purpose of 
APH ``appraised production'' specifically excludes production lost due 
to uninsurable causes.
    (e) Approved APH yield--A yield, calculated and approved by the 
verifier, used to determine the production guarantee and determined by 
the sum of the yearly actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted 
transitional or determined yields divided by the number of yields 
contained in the database. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive 
crop years of actual and or assigned yields. At least four yields will 
always exist in the database.
    (f) Assigned yield--A yield assigned by FCIC in accordance with the 
crop insurance contract, if the insured does not file production reports 
as required by the crop insurance contract. Assigned yields are used in 
the same manner as actual yields when calculating APH yields except for 
purposes of the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS).
    (g) Base period--Ten consecutive crop years (except peaches, which 
have a five-year base period) immediately preceding the crop year 
defined in the insurance contract for which the approved APH yield is 
being established (except for sugarcane, which begins the calendar year 
preceding the immediate previous crop year defined in the insurance 
contract).
    (h) Continuous production reports--Reports submitted by a producer 
for each crop year that the unit was planted to the crop and for the 
most recent crop year in the base period.
    (i) Crop year--Defined in the crop insurance contract, however, for 
APH purposes the term does not include any year when the crop was not 
planted or when the crop was prevented from being planted by an 
insurable cause. For example, if an insured plants acreage in a county 
to wheat one year, that year is a crop year in accordance with the 
policy definition. If the land is summerfallowed the next calendar year, 
that calendar year is not a crop year for the purpose of APH.
    (j) Database--A minimum of four years up to a maximum of ten crop 
years of production data used to calculate the approved APH yield.
    (k) Determined yield (D-yield)--An estimated year for certain crops, 
which can be determined by multiplying an average yield for the crop 
(attained by using data available from The National Agricultural 
Statistics Service (NASS) or comparable sources) by a percentage 
established by the FCIC for each county.
    (l) Master yields--Approved APH yields, for certain crops and 
counties as initially designated by the FCIC, based on a minimum of four 
crop years of production records for a crop within a county.
    (m) New producer--A person who has not been actively engaged in 
farming for a share of the production of the insured crop for more than 
two crop years.
    (n) Production report--A written record showing the insured crop's 
annual production and used to determine the insured's yield for 
insurance purposes. The report contains yield history by unit, if 
applicable, including planted acreage for annual crops, insurable 
acreage for perennial crops, and harvested and appraised production for 
the previous crop years. This report must be supported by written

[[Page 13]]

verifiable records, measurement of farm stored production, or by other 
records of production approved by FCIC on an individual basis. 
Information contained in a claim for indemnity is considered a 
production report for the crop year for which the claim was filed.
    (o) Production Reporting Date (PRD)--The PRD is contained in the 
crop insurance contract and is the last date production reports will be 
accepted for inclusion in the database for the current crop year.
    (p) Transitional yield (T-Yield)--An estimated yield, for certain 
crops, generally determined by multiplying the ASCS program yield by a 
percentage determined by the FCIC for each county and provided on the 
actuarial table to be used in the APH yield calculation process when 
less than four consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields are 
available.
    (q) Verifiable records--Contemporaneous records of acreage and 
production provided by the insured, which may be verified by FCIC 
through an independent source, and which are used to substantiate the 
acreage and production that have been reported on the production report.
    (r) Verifier--A person authorized by the FCIC to calculate approved 
APH yields.
    (s) Yield variance tables--Tables for certain crops that indicate 
unacceptable yield variations and yield trends which will require 
determination of the APH yield by the FCIC.


<R05>
Sec. 400.53  Yield certification and acceptability.

    (a) Production reports must be provided to the crop insurance agent 
no later than the production reporting date for the crop insured.
    (1) Production reports must provide an accurate account of planted 
acreage for annual crops or insurable acres for perennial crops, as well 
as harvested and appraised production by unit.
    (2) The insured must certify the accuracy of the information.
    (3) Production reported for more than one crop year must be 
continuous. A year in which no acreage was planted to the crop on a unit 
or no acreage was planted to a practice, type, or variety requiring an 
APH yield will not be considered a break in continuity. Assigned yields, 
at the discretion of the FCIC, may be used to maintain continuity of 
yield data of file. Production on uninsured (for those years a crop 
insurance policy under the Federal Crop Insurance Act is in effect) or 
uninsurable acreage (for other years of the period) will not be used to 
determine APH yield unless production from such acreage is commingled 
with production from insured or insurable acreage.
    (b) Production reports and supporting records are subject to audit 
or review to verify the accuracy of the information certified. 
Production and supporting records may be reviewed and verified if a 
claim for indemnity is submitted on the insured crop. The reported yield 
is subject to revision, if needed, so that the claim conforms to the 
records submitted at that time.
    (1) Inaccurate production reports or failure to retain acceptable 
records shall result in the verifier combining optional farm units and 
recomputing the approved APH yield. These actions shall be taken at any 
time after reporting or record discrepancies are identified and may 
result in reduction of the approved APH yield for any calendar year.
    (2) Records must be provided by the insured at the time of an audit, 
review, or as otherwise requested, to verify that the acreage and 
production certified are accurate. Records of any other person having 
shares in the insured crop, which are used by the insured to establish 
the approved APH yield, must also be provided upon request.
    (3) In the event acreage or production data certified by two or more 
persons sharing in the crop on the same acreage is different, the 
verifier shall, at the verifier's discretion, determine which acreage 
and production data, if any, will be used to determine the approved APH 
yield. If the correct acreage and production cannot be determined, the 
data submitted will be considered unacceptable by the verifier for APH 
purposes.
    (4) Failure of the producer to report acreage and production 
completely and accurately may result in voidance of the crop insurance 
contract, as well as criminal or civil false claims penalties

[[Page 14]]

pursuant to applicable Federal criminal or civil statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 400.54  Submission and accuracy of production reports.

    (a) The insured is solely responsible for the timely submission and 
certification of accurate, complete production reports to the agent. 
Production reports must be provided for all planted units.
    (b) Records may be requested by the FCIC, or an insurance company 
reinsured by the FCIC, or by anyone acting on behalf of the FCIC or the 
insurance company. The insured must provide such records upon request.
    (c) The agent will explain the APH Program to insureds and 
prospective insureds. When necessary, the agent will assist the insured 
in preparation of production reports. The agent will determine the 
adjusted or unadjusted transitional or determined yields in accordance 
with Sec. 400.54(b). The agent will review the production reports and 
forward them to the verifier, along with any requested and required 
supporting records for determination of an approved APH yield.
    (d) The verifier will determine if the certified production reports 
are acceptable and calculate the approved APH yield.


<R05>
Sec. 400.55  Qualification for actual production history coverage program.

    (a) The approved APH yield is calculated from a database containing 
a minimum of four yields and will be updated each subsequent crop year. 
The database may contain a maximum of the 10 most recent crop years and 
may include actual, assigned, and adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields. 
T or D-Yields, adjusted or unadjusted, will only occur in the database 
when there are less than four years of actual and/or assigned yields.
    (b) The insured may be required to provide production records to 
determine the approved APH yield, if production records for the most 
recent crop year are available. If acceptable records of actual 
production are provided, the records must be continuous and contain at 
least the most recent crop year's actual yield.
    (1) If no acceptable production records are available, the approved 
APH yield is the adjusted T or D-Yield (65 percent of T or D-Yield).
    (2) If acceptable production records containing information for only 
the most recent crop year are provided, the three T or D-Yields adjusted 
by 80 percent will be used to complete the minimum database and 
calculate the approved APH yield.
    (3) If acceptable production records containing information for only 
the two most recent crop years are provided, the two T or D-Yields 
adjusted by 90 percent and the two actual yields will be used to 
complete the database and calculate the approved APH yield.
    (4) If acceptable production records containing information for only 
the three most recent crop years are provided, the three actual yields 
and one unadjusted T or D-Yield are used to complete the database and 
calculate the approved APH yield.
    (5) When the database contains four or more (up to ten) continuous 
actual yields, the approved APH yield is a simple average of the actual 
yields.
    (6) New producers may have their approved APH yields based on 
unadjusted T or D-Yields or a combination of actual and unadjusted T or 
D-Yields.
    (7) Producers who add land or new practice, types and varieties to 
their farming operations and who do not have available records for the 
added land, practice, types or varieties may have approved APH yields 
for the added land, practice, types or varieties that are based on 
adjusted or unadjusted T or D-Yields as determined by FCIC.
    (8) If the producer's crop is destroyed or if it produces a low 
actual yield due to insured causes of loss, the resulting average yield 
may qualify for catastrophic yield adjustment according to FCIC 
guidelines. APH yields qualifying for catastrophic yield adjustment may 
be adjusted to mitigate the effect of catastrophic years. Premium rates 
for approved APH yields, which are adjusted for catastrophic years, may 
be based on the producer's APH average yield prior to the catastrophic 
adjustment or such other basis as determined appropriate by FCIC.

[[Page 15]]

    (c) If no insurable acreage of the insured crop is planted for a 
year, a production report indicating zero planted acreage will maintain 
the continuity of production reports for APH record purposes and that 
calendar year will not be included in the APH yield calculations.
    (d) Actual yields calculated from the claim for indemnity will be 
entered in the database. The resulting average yield will be used to 
determine the premium rate and approved APH yield, at the discretion of 
FCIC.
    (e) Optional units are not available to an insured who does not 
provide acceptable production reports for at least the most recent crop 
year with which to calculate an approved APH yield.
    (f) FCIC may determine approved APH yields for designated crops in 
the following situations:
    (1) If less than four years of yield history is certified and T or 
D-Yields are not provided in the actuarial documents,
    (2) If actual yield exceed tolerances specified in yield variance 
tables, and
    (3) For perennial crops:
    (i) If significant upward or downward yield trends are indicated;
    (ii) If tree or vine damage, or cultural practices will reduce the 
production level;
    (iii) if more than two percent of the trees or vines have been 
removed within the last two years; or
    (iv) If yield trends are evident and yields greater than the average 
yield are requested by the insured.
    (g) APH yields will not be approved the first insurance year on 
perennial crops until an inspection acceptable to FCIC has been 
performed and the acreage is accepted for insurance purposes in 
accordance with the crop insurance contract.
    (h) APH Master Yields may be established whenever crop rotation 
requirements and land leasing practices limit the yield history 
available. FCIC will establish crops and locations for which Master 
Yields are available. To qualify, the producer must have at least four 
recent continuous crop years' annual production reports and must certify 
the authenticity of the production reports of the insured crop. Master 
Yields are based on acreage and production history from all acreage of 
the insured crop in the county in which the operator has shared in the 
crop's production.
    (i) FCIC may use any production report available under the 
provisions of any crop insurance contract, whether continuous or not, 
involving the interests of the person's insured crops in determining the 
approved APH yield.


<R05>
Sec. 400.56  Administrative appeal exhaustion.

    The insured may appeal the approved APH yield in accordance with the 
procedures contained in 7 CFR part 400, subpart J. Administrative 
remedies through the appeal process must be exhausted prior to any 
action for judicial review. The approved APH yield determined as a 
result of the appeal process will be the yield applicable to the crop 
year.

<R05>
Sec. 400.91  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart applies to:
    (1) Adverse decisions made by personnel of the Agency with respect 
to:
    (i) Contracts of insurance insured by FCIC; and
    (ii) Contracts of insurance of private insurance companies and 
reinsured by FCIC under the provisions of the Act.

[[Page 19]]

    (2) Determinations of good farming practices made by personnel of 
the Agency.
    (b) This subpart is not applicable to any decision:
    (1) Made by the Agency with respect to any matter arising under the 
terms of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement with the reinsured company; 
or
    (2) Made by any private insurance company with respect to any 
contract of insurance issued to any producer by the private insurance 
company and reinsured by FCIC under the provisions of the Act.
    (c) With respect to matters identified in Sec. 400.91(a)(1), 
participants may request an administrative review, mediation, or appeal 
of adverse decisions by the Agency made with respect to:
    (1) Denial of participation in the crop insurance program;
    (2) Compliance with terms and conditions of insurance;
    (3) Issuance of payments or other program benefits to a participant 
in the crop insurance program; and
    (4) Issuance of payments or other benefits to an individual or 
entity who is not a participant in the crop insurance program.
    (d) Only a participant may seek an administrative review or 
mediation under this subpart, as applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 400.92  Appeals.

    (a) Except for determinations of good farming practices, nothing in 
this subpart prohibits a participant from filing an appeal of an adverse 
decision directly with NAD in accordance with part 11 of this title 
without first requesting administrative review or mediation under this 
subpart.
    (b) If the participant has timely requested administrative review or 
mediation, the participant may not participate in a NAD hearing until 
such administrative review or mediation is concluded. The time for 
appeal to NAD is suspended from the date of receipt of a request for 
administrative review or mediation until the conclusion of the 
administrative review or mediation. The participant will have only the 
remaining time to appeal to NAD after the conclusion of the 
administrative review or mediation.
    (c) There is no appeal to NAD of determinations regarding good 
farming practices.


<R05>
Sec. 400.93  Administrative review.

    (a) With respect to adverse decisions, an appellant may seek one 
administrative review or seek mediation under Sec. 400.94, but not both. 
Only an administrative review is available for determinations of good 
farming practices. Mediation is not available for determinations of good 
farming practices.
    (b) If the appellant seeks an administrative review, the appellant 
must file a written request for administrative review with the reviewing 
authority in accordance with Sec. 400.95. The written request must state 
the basis upon which the appellant relies to show that:
    (1) The decision was not proper and not made in accordance with 
applicable program regulations and procedures; or
    (2) All material facts were not properly considered in such 
decision.
    (c) The reviewing authority will issue a written decision that will 
not be subject to further administrative review by the Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 400.94  Mediation.

    For adverse decisions only:
    (a) Appellants have the right to seek mediation or other forms of 
alternative dispute resolution instead of an administrative review under 
Sec. 400.93.
    (b) All requests for mediation under this subpart must be made after 
issuance of the adverse decision by the Agency and before the appellant 
has a NAD hearing on the adverse decision.
    (c) An appellant who chooses mediation must request mediation not 
later than 30 calendar days from receipt of the written notice of the 
adverse decision. A request for mediation will be considered to have 
been ``filed'' when personally delivered in writing to the appropriate 
decision maker or when the properly addressed request, postage paid, is 
postmarked.
    (d) An appellant will have any balance of the days remaining in the 
30-day period to appeal to NAD if mediation is concluded without 
resolution. If a new adverse decision that raises new matters or relies 
on different

[[Page 20]]

grounds is issued as a result of mediation, the participant will have a 
new 30-day period for appeals to NAD.
    (e) An appellant is responsible for contacting the Certified State 
Mediation Program in States where such mediation program exists. The 
State mediation program will make all arrangements for the mediation 
process. A list of Certified State Mediation Programs is available at 
http://www.act.fcic.usda.gov.
    (f) An appellant is responsible for making all necessary contacts to 
arrange for mediation in non-certified States or in certified States 
that are not currently offering mediation on the subject in dispute. An 
appellant needing mediation in States without a certified mediation 
program may request mediation by contacting the RSO, which will provide 
the participant with a list of acceptable mediators.
    (g) An appellant may only mediate an adverse decision once.
    (h) If the dispute is not completely resolved in mediation, the 
adverse decision that was the subject of the mediation remains in effect 
and becomes the adverse decision that is appealable to NAD.
    (i) If the adverse decision is modified as a result of the mediation 
process, the modified decision becomes the new adverse decision for 
appeal to NAD.


<R05>
Sec. 400.95  Time limitations for filing and responding to requests for administrative review.

    (a) A request for administrative review must be filed within 30 days 
of receipt of written notice of the adverse decision or determination 
regarding good farming practices. A request for an administrative review 
will be considered to have been ``filed'' when personally delivered in 
writing to the appropriate decision maker or when the properly addressed 
request, postage paid, is postmarked.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an untimely 
request for administrative review may be accepted and acted upon if the 
participant can demonstrate a physical inability to timely file the 
request for administrative review.


<R05>
Sec. 400.96  Judicial review.

    (a) With respect to adverse determinations:
    (1) A participant must exhaust administrative remedies before 
seeking judicial review of an adverse decision. This requires the 
participant to appeal an Agency adverse decision to NAD in accordance 
with 7 CFR part 11 prior to seeking judicial review of the adverse 
decision.
    (2) If the adverse decision involves a matter determined by the 
Agency to be not appealable, the appellant must request a determination 
of non-appealability from the Director of NAD, and appeal the adverse 
decision to NAD if the Director determines that it is appealable, prior 
to seeking judicial review.
    (3) A participant with a contract of insurance reinsured by the 
Agency may bring suit against the Agency if the suit involves an adverse 
action in a United States district court after exhaustion of 
administrative remedies as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section. Nothing in this section can be construed to create privity of 
contract between the Agency and a participant.
    (b) With respect to determinations regarding good farming practices, 
participants are not required to exhaust their administrative remedies 
before bringing suit against FCIC in a United States district court. Any 
determination by the Agency, or reviewing authority, regarding good 
farming practices shall not be reversed or modified as the result of 
judicial review unless the determination is found to be arbitrary or 
capricious.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 400.129  Salary offset.

    (a) Debt collection by salary offset is feasible if: the cost to the 
Government of collection by salary offset does not exceed the amount of 
the debt; there are no legal restrictions to the debt, such as the 
debtor being under the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court or the 
expiration of a statute of limitations; or, other such legal 
restrictions. The Debt Collection Act permits collections of debts by 
offset for claims that have not been outstanding for more than 10 years.
    (b) The salary offset provisions contained herein provide procedures 
which must be followed before FCIC may request another Federal agency to 
offset any amount from the debtor's salary. Decisions made under the 
provisions of this section are not appealable under the provisions of 
the Appeal Regulations in part 400, subpart J of this title.
    (c) These regulations will not apply to any case where collection of 
a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for by another statue as 
noted by the Comptroller General in 64 Comp. Gen. 142 (1984), including 
5 U.S.C. 5512(a), 5 U.S.C. 5513, 5 U.S.C. 5522(a) (1), 5 U.S.C. 5705 (1) 
and (2), and 5 U.S.C. 5724(f).
    (d) Salary offset may be used by FCIC to collect debts which arise 
from delinquent FCIC premium payments or delinquent repayment plans and 
other debts arising from, but not limited to, such sources as program 
theft, embezzlement, fraud, salary overpayments, underwithholding of any 
amounts due and payable for life and health insurance, advance travel 
payments, overpaid indemnities, and any amount owed by present or former 
employees from loss of federal funds through negligence and other 
matters. The debt does not have to be reduced to judgment and does not 
have to be covered by a security instrument.
    (e) FCIC may use salary offset against one of its employees who is 
indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency. Salary 
offset will not be initiated until after other servicing options 
available to the requesting agency have been utilized, and due process 
has been afforded to the FCIC employee. When salary offset is utilized, 
payment for the debt will be deducted from the employee's salary and 
sent directly to the creditor agency. Not more than fifteen percent 
(15%) of the employee's disposable salary can be offset in any one pay 
period, unless the employee agrees in writing to the deduction of a 
larger amount.
    (f) When FCIC is owed a debt by an employee of another agency, the 
other agency shall not initiate the requested offset until FCIC provides 
the agency with a written certification that the debtor owes FCIC a debt 
(including the amount and basis of the debt and the due date of the 
payment), and that FCIC has complied with Department regulations. If a 
repayment schedule is elected by the employee, interest will be charged 
in accordance with Departmental Regulation 2520-1, Interest Rate on 
Delinquent Debts; USDA Debt Collection Regulations in 7 CFR part 3; and 
4 CFR 102.13.
    (g) For the purposes of this section, the Manager, FCIC, or the 
Manager's designee, is delegated authority to:
    (1) Certify to the debtor's employing agency that the debt exists 
and the amount of the debt or delinquent balance;
    (2) Certify that, with respect to debt collection, the procedures 
and regulations of FCIC and the Department have been complied with; and
    (3) Request that salary offset be initiated by the debtor's 
employing agency.

Administrative Law Judge of USDA, or a hearing official not under the 
control of USDA, concerning the determination of the debt, the amount of

statute or regulations governing the program for which collection is 
being made;

716, or 5 U.S.C 8346(b)), or may request waiver in the case of general 
debts and if waiver is available under any statutory provision 
pertaining to the particular debt being collected. The employee may

debt by submitting a claim to the Comptroller General in accordance with 
General Accounting Officer procedure.
    (n) That amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later 
waived or found not to be owed to the United States will be promptly 
refunded to the employee, unless there are applicable contractual or 
statutory provisions to the contrary; and
    (o) The name and address of an official of FCIC to whom the employee 
should direct any communication with respect to the debt.

agreement, instead of offset, for good cause such as, if the employee 
establishes that offset would result in undue financial hardship, or 
would be against equity and good conscience.

Sec. 400.141  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax Refund Offset.

    Under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3720A, the (IRS) may be requested 
to collect a legally enforceable debt owing to any Federal agency by 
offset against a taxpayer's Federal income tax refund. This section 
provides policies and procedures to implement IRS tax refund offsets in 
accordance with the provisions set forth in Sec. 301.6402-6T of 26 CFR 
chapter I.
    (a) Any person who is indebted to the Federal Crop Insurance 
Corporation (FCIC) is entitled to the extent of FCIC's administrative 
due process including review and appeal of the debt under the Appeal 
Regulations in 7 CFR part 400, subpart J.
    (b) If, after such administrative due process is exhausted, the debt 
is still outstanding with no other means of collection, the debtor will 
be notified by letter of FCIC's intention to refer such debt to the IRS 
for collection by tax refund offset. The notification letter will inform 
the debtor that their account is delinquent and that IRS will be 
requested to reduce the amount of any tax refund check due the debtor by 
the amount of the deliquency. The debtor will be given 60 days in which 
to write to the Manager, FCIC, providing written evidence that the debt 
is not legally enforceable. FCIC will refer the debt to IRS for 
collection by offset after the 60-day period if no response is received 
from the debtor. Decisions made under the provisions of this section are 
not appealable under the provisions of the Appeal Regulations in 7 CFR 
part 400, subpart J.
    (c) If the debtor has requested a review, and has provided written 
evidence that the debt is not legally enforceable, the Manager, with the 
assistance of the Office of General Counsel, USDA, will review the 
debtor's reasons for believing that the debt is not legally enforceable. 
The debtor will then be notified of the results of the review.
    (d) FCIC will notify IRS of those accounts against which offset 
action is to be taken.
    (e) If, during the period of review, the debtor pays the debt in 
full, the collection of the debt by tax refund offset procedure will be 
halted. Changes in debtor status that eliminate the debtor from IRS 
offset will be reported to IRS by FCIC and the debtor's refund will not 
be offset.
    (f) Amounts offset for delinquent debt which are later found to be 
not owed to FCIC, will be promptly refunded.
    (g) Debtors will not be subject to IRS offset for any of the 
following reasons:
    (1) Debtors who are discharged in bankruptcy or who are under the 
jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court;
    (2) Debtors who are employed by the Federal Government;
    (3) Debtors whose cases are in suspense because of actions pending 
by or taken by FCIC;
    (4) Debtors who have not provided a Social Security Number (SSN) and 
no SSN can be obtained;
    (5) Debtors whose indebtedness is less than $25;
    (6) Debtors whose account is more than ten (10) years delinquent; 
except in the case of a judgment debt; or
    (7) Debtors whose account has not been first reported to a consumer 
credit reporting agency.

    For purposes of this section, a past-due, legally enforceable debt 
which may be referred by FCIC to IRS for offset is a debt which:
    (a) Except in the case of a judgement debt, has been delinquent for 
at least three months but has not been delinquent for more than 10 years 
at the time the offset is made;
    (b) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (c) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) 
by reason

[[Page 29]]

of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2), or cannot be collected by administrative offset 
under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the referring agency against amounts payable 
to the debtor by the referring agency;
    (d) With respect to which the agency has given the employee at least 
60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due 
or legally enforceable, has considered evidence presented by such 
employee, and has determined that an amount of such debt is past-due and 
legally enforceable;
    (e) Has been disclosed by FCIC to a consumer reporting agency as 
authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), in the case of a debt to be referred to 
IRS after June 30, 1986;
    (f) With respect to which that FCIC has notified, or has made a 
reasonable attempt to notify, the employee that:
    (1) The debt is past due; and
    (2) Unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, will be referred to IRS 
for offset against any overpayment of tax; and
    (3) Which is at least $25.00.

Sec. 400.301  Basis, purpose, and applicability.

    The regulations contained in this subpart are issued pursuant to the 
Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), to 
prescribe the procedures for nonstandard determinations and the 
assignment of assigned yields or premium rates in conformance with the 
intent of section 508 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1508). These regulations are 
applicable to all policies of insurance insured or reinsured by the 
Corporation under the Act and on those policies where the insurance 
coverage or indemnities are based on determinations applicable to the 
individual insured. These regulations will not be applicable to any 
policy where the amount of coverage or indemnities are based on the 
experience of the area.

[62 FR 22876, Apr. 28, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 400.302  Definitions.

    Act--means Federal Crop Insurance Act as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et 
seq.).
    Actively engaged in farming means a person who, in return for a 
share of profits and losses, makes a contribution to the production of 
an insurable crop in the form of capital, equipment, land, personal 
labor, or personal management.
    Actual Yield--means total harvested production of a crop divided by 
the number of acres on which the crop was planted. For insured acres, 
actual yield is the total production to count as defined in the 
insurance policy, divided by insured acres.
    Assigned yield--means units of crop production per acre 
administratively assigned by the Corporation for the purpose of 
determining insurance coverage.
    Corporation--means the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.
    Cumulative earned premium rate--is the total premium earned for all 
years in the base period, divided by the total liability for all years 
in the base period with the result expressed as a percentage.
    Cumulative loss ratio--means the ratio of total indemnities to total 
earned premiums during the base period expressed as a decimal.
    Earned premium means premium earned (both the amount subsidized and 
the amount paid by the producer, but excluding any amount of the subsidy 
attributed to the operating and administrative expenses of the insurance 
provider) for a crop under a policy insured or reinsured by the 
Corporation.
    Earned premium rate--means premium earned divided by liability and 
expressed as a percentage.
    Entity--means a person as defined in this subpart other than an 
individual.
    Indemnified loss means a loss applicable for the policy for any year 
during the NCS base period for which the total indemnity exceeds the 
total earned premium. If the person has insurance for the crop in more 
than one county for any crop year, indemnities and premiums will be 
accumulated for all counties for each crop year to determine an 
indemnified loss.
    Insurance experience means earned premiums, indemnities paid (but 
not including replant payments), and other data for the crop (after 
applicable adjustments), resulting from all of the insured's crop 
insurance policies insured or reinsured by the Corporation for one or 
more crop years and will include all information from all counties in 
which the person was insured.
    Loss ratio--means the ratio of indemnity to earned premium expressed 
as a decimal.
    NCS means nonstandard classification system.
    NCS base period means the 10 consecutive crop years (as defined in 
the crop policy) ending 2 crop years prior to the crop year in which the 
NCS classification becomes effective for all crops, except those 
specified on the Special Provisions. For these excepted crops, the

[[Page 38]]

NCS base period means the 10 consecutive crop years ending 3 crop years 
prior to the crop year in which the NCS classification becomes 
effective. For example: An NCS classification effective for the 1996 
crop year against a producer of citrus production in Arizona, 
California, and Texas, or sugarcane would have a NCS base period that 
includes the 1984 through 1993 crop years. An NCS classification 
effective for the 1996 crop year against a producer of all other crops 
would have a NCS base period that includes the 1985 through 1994 crop 
years.
    Person--means an individual, partnership, association, corporation, 
estate, trust, or other legal entity, and whenever applicable, a State 
or a political subdivision, or agency of a state.
    Substantial beneficial interest--means an interest of 10 percent or 
more. In determining whether such an interest equals at least 10 
percent, all interests which are owned directly or indirectly through 
such means as ownership of shares in a corporation which owns the 
interest will be taken into consideration.

<R05>
Sec. 400.303  Initial selection criteria.

    (a) Nonstandard classification procedures in this subpart initially 
apply when all of the following insurance experience criteria (including 
any applicable adjustment in Sec. 400.303(d)) for the crop have been 
met:
    (1) Three (3) or more indemnified losses during the NCS base period;
    (2) Cumulative indemnities in the NCS base period that exceed 
cumulative premiums during the same period by at least $500;
    (3) The result of dividing the number of indemnified losses during 
the NCS base period by the number of years premium is earned for that 
period equals .30 or greater; and
    (4) Either of the following apply:
    (i) The natural logarithm of the cumulative earned premium rate 
multiplied by the square root of the cumulative loss ratio equals 2.00 
or greater; or
    (ii) Five (5) or more indemnified losses have occurred during the 
NCS base period and the cumulative loss ratio equals or exceeds 1.50.
    (b) The minimum standards provided in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and 
(4) of this section may be increased in a specific county if that 
county's overall insurance experience for the crop is substantially 
different from the insurance experience for which the criteria was 
determined. The increased standard will apply until the conditions 
requiring the increase no longer apply. Any change in the standards will 
be contained in the Special Provisions for the crop.
    (c) Selection criteria may be applied on the basis of insurance 
experience of a person, insured acreage, or the combination of both.
    (1) Insurance experience of a person will include:
    (i) Insurance experience of the person;
    (ii) Insurance experience of other insured entitites in which the 
person had substantial beneficial interest if the person was actively 
engaged in farming of the insured crop by virtue of the person's 
interest in those insured entities;
    (iii) Insurance experience of a spouse and minor children if the 
person is an individual and the spouse and minor children are considered 
the same as the individual under Sec. 400.306.
    (2) Insurance experience of insured acreage includes all insurance 
experience during the base period resulting from the production of the 
insured crop on the acreage.
    (3) Where insurance experience is based on a combination of person 
and insured acreage, the insurance experience will include the 
experience of the person as defined in paragraph (b) of this section (1) 
only on the specific insured acreage during the base period.
    (d) Insurance experience for the crop will be adjusted, by county 
and crop year, to discount the effect of indemnities caused by 
widespread adverse growing conditions. Adjustments are determined as 
follows:
    (1) Determine the average yield for the county using the annual 
county crop yields for the previous 20 crop years, unless such data is 
not available;

[[Page 39]]

    (2) Determine the normal variability in the average yield for the 
county, expressed as the standard deviation;
    (3) Subtract the result of Sec. 400.303(d)(2) from 
Sec. 400.303(d)(1);
    (4) Divide the annual crop yield for the county for each crop year 
in the NCS base period by the result of Sec. 400.303(d)(3), the result 
of which may not exceed 1.0;
    (5) Subtract the result of Sec. 400.303(d)(4) for each crop year 
from 1.0;
    (6) Multiply the result of Sec. 400.303(d)(5) by the liability for 
the crop year; and
    (7) Subtract the result of Sec. 400.303(d)(6) from any indemnity for 
that crop year.
    (e) FCIC may substitute the crop yields of a comparable crop in 
determining Sec. 400.303(d) (1) and (2), or may adjust the average yield 
or the measurement of normal variability for the county crop, or any 
combination thereof, to account for trends or unusual variations in 
production of the county crop or if the availability of yield and loss 
data for the county crop is limited. Information about how these 
determinations are made is available by submitting a request to the FCIC 
Regional Service Office for the producer's area. Alternate methods of 
determining the effects of adverse growing conditions on insurance 
experience may be implemented by FCIC if allowed in the Special 
Provisions.

<R05>
Sec. 400.304  Nonstandard Classification determinations.

    (a) Nonstandard Classification determinations can affect a change in 
assigned yields, premium rates, or both from those otherwise prescribed 
by the insurance actuarial tables.
    (b) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of 
insured acreage (or of a person on specific insured acreage) will be 
based on the simple average of available actual yields from the insured 
acreage during the base period.
    (c) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of a 
person without regard to any specific insured acreage will be determined 
by an assigned yield factor calculated by multiplying excess loss cost 
ratio by loss frequency and subtracting that product from 1.00 where:
    (1) Excess loss cost ratio is total indemnities divided by total 
liabilities for all years of insurance experience in the base period and 
the result of which is then reduced by the cumulative earned premium 
rate, expressed as a decimal, and
    (2) Loss frequency is the number of crop years in which an indemnity 
was paid divided by the number of crop years in which premiums were 
earned during the base period.
    (d) Changes of premium rates will be made to reflect premium rates 
that would have resulted in insurance experience during the base period 
with a loss ratio of 1.00 but:
    (1) A higher loss ratio than 1.00 may be used for premium rate 
determinations provided that the higher loss ratio is applied uniformly 
in a county; and
    (2) If a Nonstandard Classification change has been made to current 
assigned yields, insurance experience during the base period will be 
adjusted to reflect the affects of changed assigned yields before 
changes of premium rates are calculated based on that experience.
    (e) Once selection criteria have been met in any year, Nonstandard 
Classification adjustments will be made from year to year until no 
further changes are necessary in assigned yields or premium rates under 
the conditions set forth in Sec. 400.304(f). In determining whether 
further changes are necessary, the eligibility criteria will be 
recomputed each subsequent year using the premium rates and yields which 
would have been applicable had this part not been in effect.
    (f) Nonstandard Classification changes will not be made that:
    (1) Increase assigned yields or decrease premium rates from those 
otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables, or
    (2) Result in less than a 10 percent decrease in assigned yields or 
less than a 10 percent increase in premium rates from those otherwise 
assigned by the actuarial tables.

[[Page 40]]


<R05>
Sec. 400.305  Assignment of Nonstandard Classifications.

    (a) Assignment of a Nonstandard Classification of assigned yields, 
assigned yield factors, or premium rates shall be made on forms approved 
by the Corporation and included in the actuarial tables for the county.
    (b) Nonstandard classification assignment will be made each year, 
for the year identified on the assignment forms, and are not subject to 
change under the provisions of this subpart by the Corporation for that 
year when included in the actuarial tables for the county, except as a 
result of a request for reconsideration as provided in section 400.309, 
or as the result of appeals under 7 CFR part 11.
    (c) A nonstandard classification may be assigned to identified 
insurable acreage; a person; or to a combination of person and 
identified acreage for a crop or crop practice, type, variety, or crop 
option or amendment whereby:
    (1) Classifications assigned to identified insurable acreage apply 
to all acres of the insured crop grown on the identified acreage;
    (2) Classifications assigned to a person apply to all insurable 
acres of the insured crop on which the person and any entity in which 
the person has substantial beneficial interest is actively engaged in 
farming; and
    (3) Classifications assigned to a combination of a person and 
identified insurable acreage will only apply to those acres of the 
insured crop grown on the identified acreage on which the named person 
is actively engaged in producing such crop.

<R05>
Sec. 400.306  Spouses and minor children.

    (a) The spouse and minor children of an individual are considered to 
be the same as the individual for purposes of this subpart except that:
    (1) The spouse who was actively engaged in farming in a separate 
farming operation prior to their marriage will be a separate person with 
respect to that separate farming operation so long as that operation 
remains separate and distinct from any farming operation conducted by 
the other spouse;
    (2) A minor child who is actively engaged in farming in a separate 
farming operation will be a separate person with respect to that 
separate farming operation if:
    (i) The parent or other entity in which the parent has a substantial 
beneficial interest does not have any interest in the minor's separate 
farming operation or in any production from such operation;
    (ii) The minor has established and maintains a separate household 
from the parent;
    (iii) The minor personally carries out the farming activities with 
respect to the minor's farming operation; and
    (iv) The minor establishes separate accounting and recordkeeping for 
the minor's farming operation.
    (b) An individual shall be considered to be a minor until the age of 
18 is reached. Court proceedings conferring majority on an individual 
under 18 years of age will not change such individual's status as a 
minor.


<R05>
Sec. 400.307  Discontinuance of participation.

    If the person has discontinued participation in the crop insurance 
program, the person will still be included on the NCS list in the county 
until the person has discontinued participation as a policyholder or a 
person with a substantial beneficial interest in a policyholder for at 
least 10 consecutive crop years. The most recent nonstandard 
classification assigned will be continued from year to year until 
participation has been renewed for at least one crop year and at least 
three years of insurance experience have occurred in the current base 
period. A nonstandard classification will no longer be applicable to the 
person or the person on identified acreage if the Corporation determines 
the person is deceased.

an established insurable interest at the time the classified person is 
notified by the Corporation; or
    (2) Prior to the Classified person's establishing an insurable 
interest of another person that will be affected by the classification.


<R05>
Sec. 400.309  Requests for reconsideration.

    (a) Any person to be assigned a nonstandard classification under 
this subpart will be notified of and allowed not less that 30 days from 
the date notice is received to request reconsideration before the 
nonstandard classification becomes effective. The request will be 
considered to have been made when received, in writing, by the 
Corporation.
    (b) Upon receipt of a timely request for reconsideration from the

not be considered a crop of economic significance if the expected 
liability under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is equal to 
or less than the administrative fee required for the crop.
    Expected market price. (price election) The price per unit of 
production (or other basis as determined by FCIC) anticipated during the 
period the insured crop normally is marketed by producers. This price 
will be set by FCIC before the sales closing date for the crop. The

if such price typically includes remuneration for significant amounts of 
post-production expenses such as conditioning, culling, sorting, 
packing, etc.

Government Corporation within USDA.
    FSA. The Farm Service Agency, an agency of the United States

Service Agency specified by the Secretary. Limited and additional 
coverage will only be offered through approved insurance providers 
unless there is not a sufficient number of approved insurance providers 
that offer such insurance within a service area.
    (c) A person must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection for 
the crop on all insurable acreage in the county in which the person has 
a share on or before the sales closing date designated by FCIC for the 
crop in the county in order to satisfy the linkage requirements unless 
the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop 
loss assistance in connection with the crop.
    (d) For limited and additional coverage, in areas where insurance is 
not available for a particular agricultural commodity that is insurable 
elsewhere, FCIC may enter into a written agreement with a person to 
insure the commodity, provided that the person has actuarially sound 
data relating to the production of the commodity that is acceptable to 
FCIC and that such written agreement is specifically allowed by the crop 
insurance regulations applicable to the crop.
    (e) Failure to comply with all provisions of the policy constitutes 
a breach of contract and may result in ineligibility for certain other 
farm program benefits for that crop year and any benefit already 
received must be refunded. If a producer breaches the insurance 
contract, the execution of a waiver of eligibility for emergency crop 
loss assistance will not be effective for the crop year in which the 
breech occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 400.653  Determining crops of economic significance.

    To be eligible for certain other program benefits under Sec. 400.655 
the following conditions will apply with respect to crops of economic 
significance if the producer does not execute a waiver of any 
eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the 
crop.
    (a) If a producer planted a crop of economic significance in the 
preceding crop year, and does not intend to plant the same crop in the 
present crop year, the producer does not have to obtain insurance 
coverage or execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss 
assistance in connection with the crop in the present crop year to 
comply with the linkage requirements. However, if the producer later 
decides to plant that crop, the producer will be unable to obtain 
insurance after the sales closing date and must execute a waiver of any 
eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the 
crop to be eligible for benefits as specified in Sec. 400.655. Failure 
to execute such a waiver will require the producer to refund any 
benefits already received under a program specified in Sec. 400.655.
    (b) The producer is initially responsible to determine the crops of 
economic significance in the county. The insurance provider may assist 
the producer in making these initial determinations. However, these 
determinations will not be binding on the insurance provider. To 
determine the percentage value of each crop:
    (1) Multiply the acres planted to the crop times the producer's 
share, times the approved yield, and times the price;
    (2) Add the values of all crops grown by the producer (in the 
county); and
    (3) Divide the value of the specific crop by the result of paragraph 
(b)(2).
    (c) The producer may use the type of price, such as the current 
local market price, futures price, established price, highest amount of 
insurance, etc., for the price when calculating the value of each crop, 
provided that the producer

[[Page 50]]

uses the same type of price for all crops in the county.
    (d) The producer may be required to justify the calculation and 
provide adequate records to enable the insurance provider to verify 
whether a crop is of economic significance.

<R05>
Sec. 400.654  Application and acreage report.

    (a) To participate in catastrophic risk protection, limited, or 
additional coverage plans of insurance, a producer must submit an 
application for insurance on or before the applicable sales closing 
date.
    (b) In order to remain eligible for certain farm programs, as 
specified in Sec. 400.655, a producer must obtain at least catastrophic 
risk protection on all crops of economic significance, if catastrophic 
risk protection is available in the county, unless the producer executes 
a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in 
connection with the crop.
    (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. 400.654(a) that 
applications for insurance be submitted on or before the applicable 
sales closing date, FCIC may permit a producer to insure crops other 
than those specified on the application under the following conditions:
    (1) The producer must be unable to plant the intended crop or it is 
not practical to replant a failed crop before the final planting date. 
FCIC will take into consideration marketing windows when determining 
whether it was not practical to replant.
    (2) Conditions must exist to warrant allowing a producer to insure 
crops other than the intended crop.
    (3) The producer must submit an application for the substitute crop 
on or before the acreage reporting date for the substitute crop and pay 
any applicable administrative fee. A producer may not substitute a crop 
that the producer planted in the preceding crop year unless that crop 
was listed on a timely filed application for the current crop year.
    (4) If the producer plants a substitute crop that is a crop of 
economic significance, the producer must obtain CAT coverage, if 
available, to comply with the linkage requirements specified in 
Sec. 400.655. The producer may not substitute a crop under this 
provision if the producer has signed or intends to sign a waiver for 
emergency crop loss assistance for the crop year.
    (5) The substitute crop must be planted on or before the final 
planting date or within the late planting period, if applicable, for the 
substitute crop.
    (6) Under no circumstances may a producer submit an application for 
limited or additional coverage after the sales closing date for the 
substitute crop.
    (d) For all coverages, including catastrophic risk protection, 
limited, and additional coverages, the producer must file a signed 
acreage report on or before the acreage reporting date. Any person may 
sign any document relative to crop insurance coverage on behalf of any 
other person covered by such a policy, provided that the person has a 
properly executed power of attorney or other legally sufficient document 
authorizing such person to sign.
    (e) Under catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with 
an insurable interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the 
acreage reporting date and provides a signed acreage report on their own 
behalf an operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons 
with an insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All 
persons with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the 
operator purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information 
contained in that acreage report.

<R05>
Sec. 400.655  Eligibility for other program benefits.

    The producer must obtain at least catastrophic coverage for each 
crop of economic significance in the county in which the producer has an 
insurable share, if insurance is available in the county for the crop, 
unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency 
crop loss assistance in connection with the crop, to be eligible for:
    (a) Benefits under the Agricultural Market Transition Act;

[[Page 51]]

    (b) Loans or any other USDA provided farm credit, including: 
guaranteed and direct farm ownership loans, operating loans, and 
emergency loans under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act 
provided after October 13, 1994; and
    (c) Benefits under the Conservation Reserve Program derived from any 
new or amended application or contract executed after October 13, 1994.

<R05>
Sec. 400.680  Determination and notification of ineligibility.

    (a) The insurance provider must send a written notice of the debt to 
the person, including the time frame in which the debt must be paid, and 
provide the person with a meaningful opportunity to contest the amount 
or existence of the debt. After the insurance provider has evaluated the 
person's response, if any, and determined that the debt is owed and 
delinquent, the insurance provider should submit the documentation 
establishing the existence and amount of the debt to FCIC, including any 
response by the person.
    (b) If an insurance provider or any other authorized person has 
evidence that a person meets any other criteria set forth in 
Sec. 400.679, they must submit the evidence to FCIC.
    (c) After FCIC verifies that the person has met one or more of the 
criteria stated in Sec. 400.679, FCIC will issue a Notice of 
Ineligibility and mail such notice to the person's last known address 
and to the insurance provider.
    (d) The Notice of Ineligibility will state the criteria upon which 
the determination of ineligibility has been based, a brief statement of 
the facts to support the determination, the time period of 
ineligibility, and the persons right to an appeal of the ineligibility 
determination.

person receiving such a notice may appeal the determination of 
ineligibility to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR 
part 11.
    (f) If the person appeals the determination of ineligibility to the 
National Appeals Division, the insurance provider will be notified and 
provided with an opportunity to participate in the proceeding if 
permitted by 7 CFR part 11.


<R05>
Sec. 400.681  Effect of ineligibility.

    (a) The period of ineligibility will be effective:
    (1) For ineligibility as a result of a delinquent debt, the date the 
debt has been determined to be delinquent until the debt has been paid 
in full, discharged in bankruptcy, or the person has executed a 
scheduled installment payment agreement;
    (2) For ineligibility as a result of a violation of the controlled 
substance provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, at the beginning 
of the crop year in which the producer was convicted and the four 
subsequent consecutive crop years; and
    (3) For ineligibility as a result of a disqualification under 
section 506(n) of the Act, the date that the Administrative Law Judge 
signs the order disqualifying the person until the period specified in 
the order of disqualification has expired.
    (b) Once the person has been determined to be ineligible:
    (1) All policies in which the ineligible person is the sole insured 
will be void for the period specified in Sec. 400.681(a);
    (2) If the ineligible person is a general partnership, all partners 
will be individually ineligible and any policy in which a partner has a 
100 percent interest will be void for the period specified in 
Sec. 400.681(a). The partnership and all partners will be removed from 
any policy in which they have a substantial beneficial interest, and the 
policyholder share under the policies will be reduced commensurate with 
the ineligible person's share;
    (3) If the applicant or policyholder is a corporation, partnership, 
or other business entity, and an ineligible person has a substantial 
beneficial interest in the applicant or policyholder, the application 
may be accepted or existing policies remain in effect, although the 
ineligible person will be removed from the policies and the policyholder 
share under the policies will be reduced commensurate with the 
ineligible person's share;
    (4) If the applicant or policyholder is a corporation, partnership, 
or other business entity that was created to

[[Page 54]]

conceal the interest of a person in the farming operation or to evade 
the ineligibility determination of a person with a substantial 
beneficial interest in the applicant or policyholder, the corporation, 
partnership or other business entity will be disregarded, the individual 
shareholders or partners will be personally responsible, and any 
shareholder or partner that is ineligible will be removed from the 
policy and the policyholder share under the policies will be reduced 
commensurate with the ineligible person's share;
    (5) Any indemnities or payments made on a voided policy, or on the 
portion of the policy reduced because of ineligibility, will be declared 
overpayments and must be repaid; and
    (6) If the policy is voided, all producer paid premiums may be 
refunded, or if an ineligible person is removed from a policy, the 
portion of the producer paid premium commensurate with the ineligible 
person's share may be refunded, less a reasonable amount for expense and 
handling in accordance with 7 CFR 400.47.
    (c) The spouse and minor children of an individual are considered to 
be the same as the individual for purposes of this subpart except that:
    (1) The spouse who was actively engaged in farming in a separate 
farming operation will be a separate person with respect to that 
separate farming operation so long as that operation remains separate 
and distinct from any farming operation conducted by the other spouse 
(Transfers of interest in a farming operation from one spouse to another 
will not be considered as a separate farming operation.);
    (2) A minor child who is actively engaged in farming in a separate 
farming operation will be a separate person with respect to that 
separate farming operation if:
    (i) The parent or other entity in which the parent has a substantial 
beneficial interest does not have any interest in the minor's separate 
farming operation or in any production from such operation;
    (ii) The minor has established and maintains a separate household 
from the parent;
    (iii) The minor personally carries out the farming activities with 
respect to the minor's farming operation; and
    (iv) The minor establishes separate accounting and record keeping 
for the minor's farming operation.


<R05>
Sec. 400.682  Criteria for reinstatement of eligibility.

    A person who has been determined ineligible may have eligibility 
reinstated as follows:
    (a) A delinquent debt owed on a crop insurance policy insured or 
reinsured by FCIC or any delinquent debt due FCIC. Eligibility may be 
reinstated after the debt is paid in full or discharged in bankruptcy, 
or the person has executed a scheduled installment payment agreement 
accepted by FCIC or the insurance provider. Eligibility may be 
reinstated as of the date the debt is paid, the date the agreement is 
accepted, or the date the debt is discharged in bankruptcy.
    (b) Violations of the controlled substance provisions of the Food 
Security Act of 1985, as amended. Eligibility may be reinstated after 
the period of ineligibility stated in Sec. 400.681 has expired.
    (c) Disqualification under section 506(n) of the Act. Eligibility 
may be reinstated when the period of disqualification determined in the 
administrative proceedings has expired and payment of all penalties and 
overpayments have been completed.
    (d) Timing of reinstatement of eligibility. After eligibility has 
been reinstated, the person must complete a new application for crop 
insurance coverage on or before the applicable sales closing date. If 
the date of reinstatement of eligibility occurs after the applicable 
sales closing date for the crop year, the person may not participate 
until the following crop year. If the National Appeals Division 
determines that the person should not have been placed on the Ineligible 
Tracking System, reinstatement will be effective at the beginning of the 
crop year for which the producer was listed on the Ineligible Tracking 
System and the person will be entitled to all applicable benefits under 
the policy.

<R05>
Sec. 400.683  Administration and maintenance.

    (a) Ineligible producer data will be maintained in a system of 
records in accordance with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a.
    (1) The Ineligible Tracking System is a record of all persons who 
have been determined to be ineligible for participation in any program 
pursuant to this subpart. This system contains identifying information 
of the ineligible person including, but not limited to, name, address, 
telephone number, SSN or EIN, reason for ineligibility, and time period 
for ineligibility.
    (2) Information in the Ineligible Tracking System may be used by 
Federal agencies, FCIC employees, contractors, and reinsured companies 
and their personnel who require such information in the performance of 
their duties in connection with any program administered under the Act. 
The information may be furnished to other users including, but not 
limited to, FCIC contracted agencies; credit reporting agencies and 
collection agencies; in response to judicial orders in the course of 
litigation; and other users as may be appropriate or required by law or 
regulation. The individual information will be made available in the 
form of various reports and notices produced from the Ineligible 
Tracking System, based on valid requests.
    (3) Supporting documentation regarding the determination of 
ineligibility and reinstatement of eligibility will be maintained by 
FCIC and FSA, or its contractors, reinsured companies, and Federal and 
State agencies. This documentation will be maintained consistent with 
the electronic information contained within the Ineligible Tracking 
System.
    (b) Information may be entered into the Ineligible Tracking System 
by FCIC or FSA personnel.
    (c) All persons applying for or renewing crop insurance contracts 
issued or reinsured by FCIC will be subject to validation of their 
eligibility status against the Ineligible Tracking System. Applications 
or benefits approved and accepted are considered approved or accepted 
subject to review of eligibility status in accordance with this subpart.

    (1) Review the submission for completeness to determine if all 
necessary and appropriate documentation is included in accordance with

    (2) Review the submission to determine whether the documentation is 
of a level of quality to conduct a meaningful review by the Board;
    (3) If the submission is determined to be complete and the 
documentation of sufficient quality to permit a meaningful review, the 
submission will be considered to have been submitted to the Board for 
approval or disapproval. The date that FCIC determines that the 
submission is complete, as notified to the applicant, will be the date 
that the time frame for approval or disapproval by the Board begins;
    (4) Return to the applicant any submission lacking any of the 
information required in Sec. 400.705, or with documentation that is of 
insufficient quality to permit a meaningful review (such submission will 
not be considered

[[Page 61]]

as provided to the Board for the purpose of commencing the period by 
which the submission must be approved or disapproved by the Board. If 
the submission is resubmitted, it will be considered a new submission.);
    (b) When FCIC determines that the submission is complete and the 
documentation of sufficient quality to permit a meaningful review, it 
will forward the submission to the Board for consideration for approval 
or disapproval.
    (c) During the consideration process, the Board will:
    (1) For all new submissions or significant changes to previously 
approved submissions, contract with five independent persons with 
underwriting or actuarial experience to review the submission:
    (i) Of the five reviewers, no more than one will be employed by the 
Federal Government, and none may be employed by any approved insurance 
provider or their representatives; and
    (ii) The reviewers will each provide their assessment of whether the 
submission protects the interests of agricultural producers and 
taxpayers, is actuarially appropriate, follows appropriate insurance 
principles, meets the requirements of the Act, does not contain 
excessive risks, follows sound, reasonable, and appropriate underwriting 
principles, as well as other items the Board may deem necessary;
    (2) For all submissions:
    (i) Request review by FCIC to determine whether the submission 
protects the interests of agricultural producers and taxpayers, is 
actuarially appropriate, follows appropriate insurance principles, meets 
the requirements of the Act, does not contain excessive risks, is 
consistent with USDA's public policy goals, does not increase or shift 
risk to any other FCIC reinsured policy, can be administered and 
delivered efficiently and effectively, and meets the standards pursuant 
to Sec. 400.712 for reimbursement of research and development costs and 
maintenance costs, if requested, and determine whether the requested 
amount of government reinsurance, risk subsidy, and administrative and 
operating subsidies is reasonable and appropriate for the type of 
coverage provided by the policy submission; and

    (3) Render a decision to approve or give notice of an intent to 
disapprove within 90 days after the date the submission is considered 
submitted to the Board in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this

    (d) All comments and evaluations will be forwarded to the Board by a 
date determined to allow the Board adequate time for review.

    (1) The interests of producers are not protected;
    (2) The premium rates are not actuarially appropriate;
    (3) The submission does not conform to sound insurance and 
underwriting principles;
    (4) The risks associated with the submission are excessive; or
    (5) There is insufficient time before the submission would become 
effective under section 508(h) of the Act for the Board to make an 
informed decision with respect to whether the interests of producers are 
protected, the premium rates are actuarially appropriate, or the risks 
associated with the submission are excessive.
    (g) If the Board intends to disapprove the submission, the applicant 
will be notified in writing at least 30 days prior to the Board taking 
such action. The Board will provide the applicant with a written 
explanation for the intent to disapprove the submission.
    (h) An applicant may request, at any time, a time delay before the 
Board provides a notice of intent to disapprove the submission. The 
Board is

[[Page 62]]

not required to agree to such an extension.
    (1) The applicant understands that any requested time delay will not 
be limited in the length time or the number of delays. However, delays 
may make implementation of the submission for the targeted crop year 
impractical or impossible.

approve or disapprove the submission is not in effect during any time 
delay requested by the applicant.
    (3) The Board and the applicant must agree to a time period in which 
the Board must make its decision to approve or disapprove after the 
expiration of any requested time delay.
    (i) The applicant may withdraw a submission at any time by written

submission.
    (j) Prior to any Board action taken or after the Board has provided 
formal notice of its intent to disapprove all or part of a submission:
    (1) Modification can occur in writing or orally prior to the Board 
providing notice of its intent to disapprove all or part of a 
submission.
    (2) After formal notice of intent to disapprove all or part of a

written to the Board that the submission will be modified not later than 
30 days after the Board provided such notice. Except as provided in 
paragraph (j)(5) of this section, the applicant must also include the 
date that the modification will be provided to the Board.
    (3) If the modification is in direct response to reviewer comments, 
the Board may act on the modification immediately or seek further review 
within the 30 day time period allowed.
    (4) The Board will approve or disapprove a modified submission not 
later than 30 days after receiving a modified submission from the 
applicant, unless the applicant and the Board agree to a time delay. If 
a time delay is agreed upon the time period during which the Board must 
act on the modified submission will not be in effect during the delay.
    (5) The Board will disapprove a modified submission if:
    (i) All causes for disapproval stated by the Board in its 
notification of its intent to disapprove the submission are not 
satisfactorily addressed;
    (ii) Insufficient time is available for review of the modified 
submission to determine whether all causes for disapproval have been 
satisfactorily addressed; or
    (iii) If modification is so substantial that the Board determines 
that additional independent review is required and a time delay can not 
be agreed to allow for such review.
    (k) When the applicant is notified of the Board's intent to 
disapprove and the submission is not revised or withdrawn, the Board 
will provide written notification to the applicant that the submission 
has been disapproved no less than 30 days after the date that the notice 
of intent to disapprove was provided to the applicant.
    (l) If the Board fails to take action on a new submission within the 
prescribed 90 day period in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or within 
the time period in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section 
after receiving the revised submission, such submission will be deemed 
approved by the Board for the initial reinsurance year designated for

    (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the 
applicant is solely liable for any mistakes, errors, or flaws in the 
submitted policy, plan of insurance, their related materials, or the 
rates of premium that have been approved by the Board unless the policy

Sec. 400.712(k)(2), the applicant remains liable for any mistakes, 
errors, or flaws that occurred prior to the transfer of the policy or 
plan of insurance;
    (4) If the mistake, error, or flaw in the policy, plan of insurance, 
their related materials, or the rates of premium is discovered not less 
than 45 days prior to the cancellation or termination date for the 
policy or plan of insurance, the applicant may request in writing that 
FCIC withdraw the approved policy, plan of insurance, or rates of 
premium:
    (i) Such request must state the discovered mistake, error, or flaw 
in the policy, plan of insurance, or rates of premium, and the expected 
impact on the program; and
    (ii) For all timely received requests for withdrawal, no liability 
will attach to such policies, plans of insurance, or rates of premium

the policy, plan of insurance, their related materials, or the rates of 
premium and no cause of action will exist against FCIC as a result of

subpart;
    (3) If at any time prior to the cancellation or termination date, 
FCIC discovers that there is a mistake, error, or flaw in the policy, 
plan of insurance, their related materials, or the rates of premium that 
results in over or under insurance, FCIC will deny reinsurance to such 
policy or plan of insurance:
    (4) If reinsurance is denied under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
the approved insurance provider will have the option of:
    (i) Selling and servicing the policy or plan of insurance at its own 
risk and without any subsidy; or
    (ii) Canceling the policy or plan of insurance in accordance with 
its terms; and
    (5) If the applicant transfers the policy or plan of insurance to 
FCIC in accordance with Sec. 400.712 (k)(2), FCIC will assume the 
liability for any mistakes, errors, or flaws that occur after the policy 
or plan insurance as been transferred and FCIC is in control of 
maintenance.


<R05>
Sec. 400.710  Preemption and premium taxation.

    A policy or plan of insurance that is approved by the Board for FCIC 
reinsurance is preempted from state and local taxation.


<R05>
Sec. 400.711  Right of review, modification, and the withdrawal of reinsurance.

    At any time after approval, the Board may review any policy, plan of 
insurance, related materials, and rates of premium approved under this 
subpart and request additional information to determine whether the 
policy, plan of insurance, related materials, and rates of premium 
comply with statutory or regulatory changes or court orders, are still 
actuarially appropriate, and protect program integrity and the interests 
of producers. The Board will notify the applicant of any problem or 
issue that may arise and allow the applicant an opportunity to make any 
needed change. The Board may deny reinsurance for the applicable policy, 
plan of insurance or rate of premium if:
    (a) The applicant fails to perform their responsibilities under 
Sec. 400.709; or
    (b) If the applicant does not satisfactorily provide materials or 
resolve any issue so that necessary changes can be made prior to the 
earliest contract change date.


<R05>
Sec. 400.712  Research and development reimbursement, maintenance reimbursement, and user fees.

    (a) Submissions approved by the Board for reinsurance under section 
508(h) of the Act may be eligible for a one time payment of research and 
development costs and maintenance costs for up to four reinsurance 
years, as determined by the Board after the date

[[Page 65]]

such costs have been approved by the Board. Reimbursements made under 
this section will be considered as payment in full for research, 
development, and maintenance, as applicable, for any policy or plan of 
insurance and any property rights to the policy or plan of insurance.
    (b) For submissions submitted to the Board for reinsurance after 
publication of this subpart, an estimate of a request for reimbursement 
of research and development costs and maintenance costs, as applicable, 
must be included with the original submission to the Board in accordance 
with this section. These estimates will only be used by FCIC for the 
purpose of tracking potential expenditures and will not provided a basis 
for making any reimbursements under this section. Documentation of 
actual costs allowed under this section will be used to determine any 
reimbursement.
    (c) For a submission approved by the Board, or submitted to the 
Board, prior to publication of this subpart, a request for reimbursement 
for research and development costs and estimated maintenance costs must 
be received within 60 days following publication of this subpart or 
approval of the submission by the Board. This request should be sent to 
the Deputy Administrator, Research and Development (or any successor), 
Risk Management Agency, 6501 Beacon Drive, Stop 0812, Kansas City, MO 
64133-4676, and also provide one identical copy of each submission to 
the Administrator, Risk Management Agency, 1400 Independence Ave., Stop 
0801, Room 3053 South Building, Washington, D.C. 20250-0801.
    (d) To be eligible for any reimbursement under this section, FCIC 
must determine that a submission is marketable.
    (e) To be considered for reimbursement in any fiscal year, complete 
and final requests for research and development costs and maintenance 
costs, as applicable, must be received by FCIC not later than August 1. 
For 2001 fiscal year only, FCIC may consider reimbursement for research 
and development costs on approved submissions for any request received 
by September 1, 2001. Given the limitation on funds, regardless of when 
the request is received, no payment will be made prior to September 15 
of the applicable fiscal year.
    (f) There are limited funds available on an annual fiscal year basis 
as contained in the Act. Therefore, requests for reimbursement will not 
be considered in the order in which they are received. Consistent with 
paragraphs (g), (h), (i), (j), and (l) of this section, if all 
applicants' requests for reimbursement of research and development costs 
and maintenance costs in any fiscal year:
    (1) Do not exceed the maximum amount authorized by law, the 
applicants may receive the full amount of reimbursement authorized under 
these subsections.
    (2) Exceed the amount authorized by law, each applicant's 
reimbursement will be determined by dividing the total amount of each 
individual applicants' reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (g), 
(h), (i), (j), and (l) by the total amount of the aggregate of all 
applicants' reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (g), (h), (i), 
(j), and (l) for that year and multiplying the result by the amount of 
reimbursement authorized under the Act.
    (g) The amount of reimbursement for research and development costs 
and maintenance costs, as applicable, will be determined based on the 
amount of reimbursement authorized under paragraph (f) of this section, 
adjusted for the complexity of the policy, plan of insurance, or rates 
of premium, as determined by FCIC, and the size of the area in which the 
policy, plan of insurance, or rates of premium may be offered.
    (1) Policies or plans of insurance that offer new and innovative 
coverages that are not currently available will be eligible for a higher 
reimbursement than policies or plans of insurance that are, or have 
components that are, based on existing policies or plans of insurance.
    (2) Policies or plans of insurance that offer new premium rating or 
market price methodologies will be eligible for a higher reimbursement 
than policies or plans of insurance that use existing premium rating or 
market price methodologies.
    (3) Policies or plans of insurance that cover new commodities that 
are not

[[Page 66]]

otherwise covered by crop insurance or that offer innovative coverage 
and original policy language will be eligible for a higher reimbursement 
than policies or plans of insurance for commodities for which insurance 
is currently available.
    (4) Policies or plans of insurance that may be offered for sale 
nationwide or in large geographical regions will be eligible for higher 
reimbursement than those that are applicable to only a few counties or 
states or a small geographical region.
    (5) Any reimbursement under this subpart will be scored as follows:
    (i) Complexity scores:
    (A) Basic or Common Provisions:
    (1) Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05
    (2) Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of 
insurance: 0.10

    (B) Crop Provisions and Special Provisions:
    (1) Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05
    (2) Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of 
insurance: 0.10

    (D) Rates of Premium:
    (1) Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05
    (2) Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of 
insurance: 0.10
    (3) Original (See paragraph (g)(3) of this section): 0.20
    (E) Underwriting:
    (1) Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05
    (2) Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of 
insurance: 0.10
    (3) Original (See paragraph (g)(3) of this section): 0.20
    (ii) Geographic scope scores:
    (A) Potential national availability: 0.10
    (B) Potential regional, state or county availability: 0.05
    (6) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, those policies 
or plans of insurance that receive a summed total score for both 
complexity and geographic scope that is:
    (i) Equal to or greater than 0.6 may receive the full amount of 
reimbursement approved by the Board under paragraphs (h), (i) or (j) of 
this section;
    (ii) Greater than 0.25 but lower than 0.60 will receive a 
reimbursement that is not greater than 75 percent of the full amount of 
reimbursement approved by the Board under paragraphs (h), (i) or (j) of 
this section; and
    (iii) Equal to or less than 0.25 will receive a reimbursement that 
is not greater than 50 percent of the full amount of reimbursement 
approved by the Board under paragraphs (h), (i) or (j) of this section.
    (h) For those submissions that were approved by the Board prior to 
the date of publication of this subpart, reimbursement for research and 
development costs will be determined in accordance with paragraph (i) of 
this section or by multiplying the average number of policies earning 
premium each crop year since inception of the policy or plan of 
insurance by $7.00 and multiplying the result by the complexity and 
scope score from paragraph (g) of this section.
    (i) For those submissions submitted to the Board prior to the date 
of publication of this subpart but not yet approved, or submitted to the 
Board for approval after the date of publication of this part, research 
and development costs must be supported by itemized statements and 
supporting documentation (copies of contracts, billing statements, time 
sheets, travel vouchers, accounting ledgers, etc.). Actual costs 
submitted will be examined for reasonableness and may be adjusted at the 
sole discretion of the Board.
    (1) Allowable research and development expense items (directly 
related to research and development of the submission only) may include 
the following;
    (i) Straight-time hourly wage, exclusive of bonuses, overtime pay, 
or shift differentials (One line per employee, include job title, total 
hours, and total dollars. Compensation amounts will be

statements, accounting records, etc.);
    (iv) Professional fees (include the job title, straight-time hourly 
wage, total hours, and total dollars);
    (v) Travel and transportation (One line per event, include the job 
title, destination, purpose of travel, lodging cost, mileage, air or 
other identified transportation costs, food and miscellaneous expenses, 
other costs, and the total cost);
    (vi) Software and computer programming developed specifically to 
determine appropriate rates, prices, or coverage amounts (Identify the 
item, include the purpose, and provide receipts or contract or straight-
time hourly wage, hours, and total cost. Software developed to calculate 
premiums or losses, or development of software to send or receive data 
between the producer, agent, approved insurance provider or RMA or such 
other similar software may not be included as an allowable cost.);
    (vii) Miscellaneous expenses such as postage, telephone, express 
mail, and printing (Identify the item, cost per unit, number of items,

    (2) The following expenses are specifically not eligible for 
research and development cost reimbursement:

statutory law effecting the policy; and
    (xiv) Maintenance costs associated with the submission.
    (j) Requests for reimbursement of maintenance costs for submissions 
approved after publication of this subpart must be supported by itemized 
statements and supporting documentary evidence for each reinsurance year 
in the maintenance period. For submissions approved prior to publication 
of this subpart, the applicant may provide itemized statements and 
supporting documentary evidence or may request to receive not more than 
15 percent of the amount of reimbursement for research and development 
costs, as determined in accordance with Sec. 400.712, for the first 
reinsurance year in the maintenance period. For all subsequent 
reinsurance years, itemized and supporting documentary evidence must be 
provided. Actual costs submitted will be examined for reasonableness and 
may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the Board.
    (1) Maintenance costs for the following activities may be 
reimbursed:
    (i) Expansion of the original submission to cover additional 
commodities;
    (ii) Expansion of the original submission into additional counties 
or states;
    (iii) Reasonable and required modifications to the policy and any 
related materials;
    (iv) Adjustment to premium rates and commodity prices as necessary 
or required; and
    (v) Other costs associated with maintaining the policy, as 
determined by the Board.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (k) Not later than six months prior to the end of the last 
reinsurance year in which a maintenance reimbursement will be paid, as 
approved by the Board, the applicant must notify FCIC regarding its 
election of the treatment of the policy or plan of insurance for 
subsequent reinsurance years.

[[Page 68]]

    (1) The applicant must notify FCIC whether it intends to:
    (i) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance and charge 
a user fee, as approved by the Board, to approved insurance providers 
for all policies earning premium to cover maintenance expenses. It is 
the sole responsibility of the applicant to collect such fees from the 
approved insurance providers and any indebtedness for such fees must be 
resolved by the applicant and approved insurance provider. Applicants 
may request that FCIC provide the number of policies sold by each 
approved insurance provider. Such information will be provided not later 
than 90 days after such request is made or not later than 90 days after 
the requisite information has been provided to FCIC by the approved 
insurance provider, which ever is later; or
    (ii) Transfer responsibility for maintenance to FCIC.
    (2) If the applicant elects to:
    (i) Transfer the policy or plan of insurance to FCIC, FCIC may, at 
its sole discretion, elect to withdraw the availability of the policy or 
plan of insurance or continue to maintain the policy or plan of 
insurance; or
    (ii) Continue to maintain the policy or plan of insurance, at the 
time of the election, the applicant must submit a request for approval 
of the user fee by the Board.
    (3) Requests for approval of the user fee must be accompanied by 
written documentation to support that the amount requested will only 
cover maintenance costs.
    (4) The Board will approve the amount of user fee that is payable to 
the applicant by approved insurance providers unless the Board 
determines that the user fee charged:
    (i) Is unreasonable in relation to the maintenance costs associated 
with the policy or plan of insurance; or
    (ii) Unnecessarily inhibits the use of the policy or plan of 
insurance by other approved insurance providers.
    (5) Reasonableness of the user fees will be determined by the Board 
based on a comparison with the amount of reimbursement for maintenance 
previously received, the number of policies, the number of approved 
insurance providers, and the expected total amount of user fees to be 
received in any reinsurance year.
    (6) A user fee unnecessarily inhibits the use of a policy or plan of 
insurance if it is so high that other approved insurance providers are 
unable to pay such fees because of the volume of business currently 
underwritten by the approved insurance provider.
    (7) The user fee charged to each approved insurance provider will be 
considered payment in full for the use of such policy, plan of insurance 
or rate of premium for the reinsurance year in which payment is made.
    (l) The Board may consider information from the Equal Access to 
Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Occupational 
Employment Statistics Survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Employment 
Cost Index, and any other information determined applicable by the 
Board, in making a determination whether to approve a submission for 
reimbursement of research, development, or maintenance costs under this 
section or the amount of reimbursement.
    (m) For purposes of this section, rights to, or obligations of, 
research and development reimbursement, maintenance cost reimbursement, 
or user fees cannot be transferred from any individual or entity unless 
specifically approved in writing by the Board.

Sec. 400.713  Non-Reinsured supplemental (NRS) policy.

    (a) The reinsured company must submit three copies of the new or 
revised NRS policy and related materials to the Deputy Administrator, 
Research and Development (or successor), Risk Management Agency, 6501 
Beacon Drive, Stop 0812, Kansas City, MO 64133-4676 for review, approval 
or disapproval at least 90 days prior to the first sales closing date 
applicable to the policy reinsured by FCIC.
    (b) FCIC will approve the NRS policy if it does not increase or 
shift risk to the underlying policy or plan of insurance reinsured by 
FCIC, affect any rights of the insured with respect to the underlying 
reinsured policy or plan of insurance, or cause disruption in the 
marketplace for products reinsured by FCIC. Marketplace disruption 
includes

[[Page 69]]

adversely affecting sales or administration of the underlying reinsured 
policy, undermining producers' confidence in the Federal crop insurance 
program, decreasing the producer's willingness or ability to use 
Federally reinsured risk management products, or harming public 
perception of the Federal crop insurance program.
    (c) Failure to timely submit the NRS policy to FCIC will result in 
the denial of reinsurance and subsidy for all policies reinsured by FCIC 
for which the insured has obtained the NRS policy.

Sec. 402.1  General statement.

    The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended by the Federal Crop 
Insurance Reform Act of 1994, requires the Federal Crop Insurance 
Corporation to implement a catastrophic risk protection plan of 
insurance that provides a basic level of insurance coverage to protect 
producers in the event of a catastrophic crop loss due to loss of yield 
or prevented planting, if provided by the Corporation, provided the crop 
loss or prevented planting is due to an insured cause of loss specified 
in the crop insurance policy. This Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement is a continuous endorsement that is effective in conjunction 
with a crop insurance policy for the insured crop. Catastrophic risk 
protection coverage will be offered through approved insurance providers 
if there are a sufficient number available to service the area. If there 
are an insufficient number available, as determined by the Secretary, 
local offices of the Farm Service Agency will provide catastrophic risk 
protection coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 402.2  Applicability.

    This Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is applicable to each 
crop for which catastrophic risk protection coverage is available and 
for which the producer elects such coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 402.3  OMB control numbers.

    The information collection activity associated with this rule has

                            3. Unit Division

    (a) This section is in lieu of the unit provisions specified in the 
applicable crop policy.
    (b) For catastrophic risk protection coverage, a unit will be all 
insurable acreage of the insured crop in the county on the date coverage 
begins for the crop year:
    (1) In which you have one hundred percent (100%) crop share; or
    (2) Which is owned by one person and operated by another person on a 
share basis.

(Example: If, in addition to the land you own, you rent land from five 
landlords, three on a crop share basis and two on a cash basis, you 
would be entitled to four units; one for each crop share lease and one 
that combines the two cash leases and the land you own.)

    (c) Further division of the units described in paragraph (b) above 
is not allowed under this Endorsement.

  4. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other policy 
document, for the 1995 through 1998 crop years, catastrophic coverage 
will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of your approved 
yield indemnified at sixty percent (60%) of the expected market price, 
or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC.
    (b) Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other policy 
document, for the 1999 and subsequent crop years, catastrophic coverage 
will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of your approved 
yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the expected market 
price, or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC.
    (c) If the crop policy denominates coverage in dollars per acre or 
other measure, or any other alternative method of coverage, such 
coverage will be converted to the amount of

[[Page 72]]

coverage that would be payable at fifty percent (50%) of your approved 
yield indemnified at sixty percent (60%) of the expected market price 
for the 1995 through 1998 crop years and fifty percent (50%) of your 
approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the expected 
market price for the 1999 and subsequent crop years.
    (d) You may elect catastrophic coverage for any crop insured or 
reinsured by FCIC on either an individual yield and loss basis or an 
area yield and loss basis, if both options are offered as set out in the 
Actuarial Table or the Special Provisions.
    (e) To be eligible for an indemnity under this endorsement you must 
have suffered at least a 50 percent loss in yield.

                          5. Report of Acreage

    (a) The report of crop acreage that you file in accordance with the 
crop policy must be signed on or before the acreage reporting date. For 
catastrophic risk protection, unless the other person with an insurable 
interest in the crop objects in writing prior to the acreage reporting 
date and provides a signed acreage report on their own behalf, the 
operator may sign the acreage report for all other persons with an 
insurable interest in the crop without a power of attorney. All persons 
with an insurable interest in the crop, and for whom the operator 
purports to sign and represent, are bound by the information contained 
in that acreage report.
    (b) For the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity only, 
your share will not exceed your insurable interest at the earlier of the 
time of loss or the beginning of harvest. Unless the accepted 
application clearly indicates that insurance is requested for a 
partnership or joint venture, insurance will only cover the crop share 
of the person completing the application. The share will not extend to 
any other person having an interest in the crop except as may otherwise 
be specifically allowed in this endorsement. Any acreage or interest 
reported by or for your spouse, child or any member of your household 
may be considered your share. A lease containing provisions for both a 
minimum payment (such as a specified amount of cash, bushels, pounds, 
etc.) and a crop share will be considered a crop share lease. A lease 
containing provisions for either a minimum payment (such as a specified 
amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.,) or a crop share will be 
considered a cash lease. Land rented for cash, a fixed commodity 
payment, or any consideration other than a share in the insured crop on 
such land will be considered as owned by the lessee.

                6. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees

    (a) Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other policy 
document, you will not be responsible to pay a premium, nor will the 
policy be terminated because the premium has not been paid. FCIC will 
pay a premium subsidy equal to the premium established for the coverage 
provided under this endorsement.
    (b) In return for catastrophic risk protection coverage, you must 
pay an administrative fee to the insurance provider within 30 days after 
you have been billed by us, unless otherwise specified in 7 CFR part 400 
(You will be billed by the date stated in the Special Provisions);
    (1) The administrative fee owed is $100 for each crop in the county.
    (2) Payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you 
file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting 
date for the crop (if you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be 
subject to criminal and administrative sanctions).
    (c) The administrative fee provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section do not apply if you meet the definition of a limited resource 
farmer (see section 1). If you qualify as a limited resource farmer and 
desire to be exempted from paying the administrative fee you must sign 
the waiver at the time of application (on or before the sales closing 
date.)
    (d) When a crop policy has provisions to allow you the option to 
separately insure individual crop types or varieties, you must pay a 
separate administrative fee in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section for each type or variety you elect to separately insure.
    (e) If the administrative fee is not paid when due, you, and all 
persons with an insurable interest in the crop under the same contract, 
may be ineligible for certain other USDA program benefits as set out in 
section 12, and all such benefits already received for the crop year 
must be refunded.

                             7. Insured Crop

    The crop insured is specified in the applicable crop policy, 
however:
    (a) Notwithstanding any other policy provision requiring the same 
insurance coverage on all insurable acreage of the crop in the county, 
if you purchase additional coverage for a crop, you may separately 
insure acreage under catastrophic coverage that has been designated as 
``high risk'' land by FCIC, provided that you execute a High Risk Land 
Exclusion Option and obtain a catastrophic risk protection policy with 
the same approved insurance provider, if available, on or before the 
applicable sales closing date. If catastrophic coverage is not available 
from the same insurance provider, you may obtain the catastrophic risk 
protection policy for the high risk land from another approved insurance 
provider or FSA, if available. You will be required to pay a separate 
administrative fee for both the additional coverage policy and the 
catastrophic coverage policy.

[[Page 73]]

    (b) A tobacco producer may insure one hundred percent (100%) of the 
tobacco crop that is identified by a tobacco marketing card issued by 
FSA for a specific producer and Farm Serial Number under one CAT policy, 
provided the producer and other persons each have a share in the crop, 
all the shareholders agree in writing to such arrangement, and none of 
the persons hold any other interest in another tobacco crop for which 
they are required to obtain at least catastrophic coverage. If the 
tobacco crop is insured under one policy:
    (1) The linkage requirements will be satisfied for each shareholder 
of the crop; and
    (2) The producer insuring the crop will:
    (i) Make application for insurance and provide the name and social 
security number, or employer identification number, of each person with 
a share in the tobacco crop;
    (ii) File the acreage report showing a one-hundred percent (100%) 
share in the crop (all insurable acreage covered by such marketing card 
will be considered as one unit);
    (iii) Be responsible to pay the one administrative fee for all the 
producers within the county;
    (iv) Fulfill all requirements under the crop insurance contract; and
    (v) Receive any indemnity payment under his or her social security 
number or employer identification number and distribute the indemnity 
payments to the other persons sharing in the crop.
    (c) A landowner will be allowed to obtain catastrophic coverage to 
satisfy linkage requirements for all other landowners who hold an 
undivided interest in the insurable acreage, provided:
    (1) All the landowners must agree in writing to such arrangement and 
have their social security number or employer identification number 
listed on the application, without regard to the actual amount of their 
interest in the insured acreage;
    (2) All landowners must have an undivided interest in the insurable 
acreage;
    (3) None of the landowners may hold any share in other acreage for 
which they are required to obtain at least catastrophic coverage;
    (4) The total cumulative liability under the Catastrophic Risk 
Protection Endorsement for all landowners must be $2,500 or less;
    (5) The landowner insuring the crop will:
    (i) Make application for insurance and provide the name and social 
security number or employer identification number of each person with an 
undivided interest in the insurable acreage;
    (ii) Be responsible to pay the one administrative fee for all the 
producers within the county;
    (iii) Fulfill all requirements under the insurance contract; and
    (iv) Receive any indemnity payment under the landowner's social 
security number, or when applicable, employer identification number, and 
distribute the indemnity payments to the other persons sharing in the 
crop.

                          8. Replanting Payment

    Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance 
document, no replant payment will be paid whether or not replanting of 
the crop is required under the policy.

                         9. Claim for Indemnity

    (a) If two or more insured crop types, varieties, or classes are 
insured within the same unit, and multiple price elections are 
applicable, the dollar amount of insurance and the dollar amount of 
production to be counted will be determined separately for each type, 
variety, class, etc., that have separate price elections and then 
totaled to determine the total liability or dollar amount of production 
to be counted for the unit.
    (b) If you are eligible to receive an indemnity under this 
endorsement and benefits compensating you for the same loss under any 
other USDA program, you must elect the program from which you wish to 
receive benefits. Only one payment or program benefit is allowed. 
However, if other USDA program benefits are not available until after 
you filed a claim for indemnity, you may refund the total amount of the 
indemnity and receive the other program benefit. Notwithstanding the 
first sentence of this subsection, farm ownership, operating, and 
emergency loans may be obtained from the USDA in addition to an 
indemnity under this endorsement.

                        10. Concealment or Fraud

    Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop insurance 
document, your CAT policy may be voided by us on all crops without 
waiving any of our rights, including the right to collect any amounts 
due:
    (a) If at any time you conceal or misrepresent any material fact or 
commit fraud relating to this or any other contract issued under the 
authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Act with any insurance provider; 
and
    (b) The voidance will be effective as of the beginning of the crop 
year during which such act or omission occurred. After the policy has 
been voided, you must make a new application to obtain catastrophic risk 
protection coverage for any subsequent crop year. If your policy is 
voided under this section, any waiver of eligibility for emergency crop 
loss assistance in connection with the crop will not be effective for 
the crop for the year in which the voidance occurred.

[[Page 74]]

                        11. Exclusion of Coverage

    (a) Options or endorsements that extend the coverage available under 
any crop policy offered by FCIC will not be available under this 
endorsement, except the Late Planting Agreement Option. Written 
agreements are not available for any crop insured under this 
endorsement.
    (b) Notwithstanding any provision contained in any other crop 
policy, hail and fire coverage and high-risk land may not be excluded 
under catastrophic risk protection.

             12. Eligibility for Other USDA Program Benefits

    (a) Even if it was a crop of economic significance for the previous 
crop year, if you do not intend to plant the crop in the current crop 
year, you do not have to obtain crop insurance or execute a waiver of 
your eligibility for any emergency crop loss assistance in connection 
with the crop to remain eligible for the USDA program benefits specified 
in subsection (e). However, if, after the sales closing date, you plant 
that crop, you will be unable to obtain insurance for that crop and you 
must execute a waiver of your eligibility for emergency crop loss 
assistance in connection with the crop to remain eligible for the USDA 
program benefits specified in section 12(e). Failure to execute such a 
waiver will require you to refund any benefits already received under a 
program specified in section 12(e).
    (b) You are initially responsible to determine the crops of economic 
significance in the county. The insurance provider may assist you in 
making these initial determinations. However, these determinations will 
not be binding on the insurance provider. To determine the percentage 
value of each crop:
    (1) Multiply the acres planted to the crop, times your share, times 
the approved yield, and times the price;
    (2) Add the values of all crops grown by the producer in the county; 
and
    (3) Divide the value of the specific crop by the result of section 
12(b)(2).
    (c) You may use the type of price such as the current local market 
price, futures price, established price, highest amount of insurance, 
etc., for the price when calculating the value of each crop, provided 
that you use the same type of price for all crops in the county.
    (d) You may be required to justify the calculation and provide 
adequate records to enable the insurance provider to verify whether a 
crop is of economic significance.
    (e) You must obtain at least catastrophic coverage for each crop of 
economic significance in the county in which you have an insurable 
share, if insurance is available in the county for the crop, unless you 
execute a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance 
in connection with the crop to be eligible for:
    (1) Benefits under the Agricultural Market Transition Act;
    (2) Loans or any other USDA provided farm credit, including: 
guaranteed and direct farm ownership loans, operating loans, and 
emergency loans under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act 
provided after October 13, 1994; and
    (3) Benefits under the Conservation Reserve Program derived from any 
new or amended application or contracts executed after October 13, 1994.
    (f) Failure to comply with all provisions of the policy constitutes 
a breach of contract and may result in ineligibility for certain other 
farm program benefits for that crop year and any benefit already 
received must be refunded. If you breach the insurance contract, the 
execution of a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss 
assistance will not be effective for the crop year in which the breach 
occurs.

<R05>
Sec. 407.1  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part are applicable only to those crops and 
crop

[[Page 75]]

years for which a Crop Provision is contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 407.2  Availability of Federal crop insurance.

    (a) Insurance shall be offered under the provisions of this part on 
the insured crop in counties within the limits prescribed by and in 
accordance with the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, (7 
U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) (the Act). The crops and counties shall be 
designated by the Manager of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation 
(FCIC) from those approved by the Board of Directors of FCIC.
    (b) The insurance will be offered through companies reinsured by 
FCIC under the same terms and conditions as the contract contained in 
this part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by 
FCIC. Additionally, the contract contained in this part may be offered 
directly to producers through agents of the United States Department of 
Agriculture. Those contracts are specifically identified as being 
offered by FCIC.
    (c) No person may have in force more than one insurance policy 
issued or reinsured by FCIC on the same crop for the same crop year, in 
the same county, unless specifically approved in writing by FCIC.
    (d) If a person has more than one contract under the Act outstanding 
on the same crop for the same crop year, in the same county, that have 
not been properly approved by FCIC, all such contracts shall be voided 
for that crop year and the person will be liable for the premium on all 
contracts, unless the person can show to the satisfaction of FCIC that 
the multiple contracts of insurance were inadvertent and without the 
fault of the person.
    (e) If the unapproved multiple contracts of insurance are shown to 
be inadvertent, and without the fault of the insured, the contract with 
the earliest application will be valid and all other contracts on that 
crop in the county for that crop year will be canceled. No liability for 
indemnity or premium will attach to the contracts so canceled.
    (f) The person must repay all amounts received in violation of this 
section with interest at the rate contained in the contract (see 
Sec. 407.8, paragraph 21).
    (g) A person whose contract with FCIC or with a company reinsured by 
FCIC under the Act has been terminated because of violation of the terms 
of the contract is not eligible to obtain crop insurance under the Act 
with FCIC or with a company reinsured by FCIC unless the person can show 
that the termination was improper and should not result in subsequent 
ineligibility.
    (h) All applicants for insurance under the Act must advise the 
insurance provider, in writing at the time of application, of any 
previous applications for insurance or contracts of insurance under the 
Act within the last 5 years and the present status of any such 
applications or insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 407.3  Premium rates, amounts of protection, and coverage levels.

    (a) The Manager of FCIC shall establish premium rates, amounts of 
protection, and coverage levels for the insured crop that will be 
included in the actuarial documents on file in the insurance provider's 
office. Premium rates, amounts of protection, and coverage levels may be 
changed from year to year.
    (b) At the time the application for insurance is made, the person 
must elect an amount of protection and a coverage level from among those 
contained in the actuarial documents for the crop year.


<R05>
Sec. 407.4  OMB control numbers.

    The information collection activity associated with this rule has 
been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
under control number 0563-0053.


<R05>
Sec. 407.5  Creditors.

    An interest of a person in an insured crop existing by virtue of a 
lien, mortgage, garnishment, levy, execution, bankruptcy, involuntary 
transfer or other similar interest shall not entitle the holder of the 
interest to any benefit under the contract.

[[Page 76]]


<R05>
Sec. 407.6  Good faith reliance on misrepresentation.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the crop insurance 
contract, an insured shall be granted relief to the extent of the 
insured's detrimental reliance or the extent of the policy benefits, 
whichever is less, under the following conditions:
    (1) The person has entered into a contract of crop insurance under 
this part;
    (2) A representative of FCIC made a misrepresentation or other 
erroneous action or advice;
    (3) Such error concerned provisions of the insurance contract not 
contained in the Group Risk Plan of Insurance Basic Provisions, the Crop 
Provisions, the Federal Crop Insurance Act, or the regulations contained 
in this chapter;
    (4) As a result of the error, the insured:
    (i) Is indebted for additional premiums; or
    (ii) Has suffered a loss to a crop which is not insured or for which 
the person is not entitled to an indemnity because of failure to comply 
with the terms of the insurance contract, but which the person believed 
to be insured, or believed the terms of the insurance contract to have 
been complied with or waived; and
    (5) The Manager finds that:
    (i) A representative of FCIC made such misrepresentation or took 
other erroneous action or gave erroneous advice;
    (ii) The person reasonably and in good faith relied on such 
misrepresentation, erroneous action or advice to the person's detriment; 
and
    (iii) To require the payment of the additional premiums or to deny 
such person's entitlement to the indemnity would not be fair and 
equitable.
    (b) For FCIC Policies only, requests for relief under this section 
must be submitted to FCIC in writing. FCIC's reviewing officers must 
refer such application for relief to the Manager of FCIC for 
determination as to whether to grant relief. FCIC's reviewing officers 
do not have authority to grant relief under this section.
    (c) For Reinsured Policies only, requests for relief under this 
section must be submitted to the reinsured company in writing. The 
reinsured companies shall use arbitration, in accordance with the rules 
of the American Arbitration Association, under contracts for insurance 
issued by them under the Act to grant relief under the same terms and 
conditions as contained in this section or may establish procedures to 
administratively handle relief in accordance with this section. Granting 
relief under this section does not absolve the reinsured company from 
liability to FCIC for unauthorized acts of its agents.


<R05>
Sec. 407.7  The contract.

    The insurance contract shall become effective upon the acceptance by 
FCIC or the reinsured company of a complete, duly executed application 
for insurance on a form prescribed or approved by FCIC. The contract 
shall consist of the accepted application, Group Risk Plan of Insurance 
Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, Actuarial Table, 
and any amendments, endorsements, or options thereto. Changes made in 
the contract shall not affect its continuity from year to year. Except 
as may be allowed under Sec. 407.6, and at the sole discretion of the 
Corporation, no indemnity shall be paid unless the person complies with 
all terms and conditions of the contract. The forms required under this 
part and by the contract are available at the office of the insurance 
provider, or the local FSA office, if applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 407.8  The application and policy.

    (a) Application for insurance, on a form prescribed or approved by 
FCIC, must be made by any person who wishes to participate in the 
program in order to cover such person's share in the insured crop as 
landlord, owner-operator, tenant, or other crop ownership interest. No 
other person's interest in the crop may be insured under the 
application. The application must be submitted to the insurance provider 
on or before the applicable sales closing date on file in the insurance 
provider's local office.
    (b) FCIC or the reinsured company may reject or no longer accept 
applications upon the FCIC's determination that the insurance risk is 
excessive. The Manager of the Corporation is authorized in any crop year 
to extend the

[[Page 77]]

sales closing date for submitting applications for fall planted crops, 
unless prohibited by law, upon determining that the probability and 
severity of claims will not increase because of the extension, by 
placing the extended date on file in the insurance provider's office and 
publishing a notice in the Federal Register. If adverse conditions 
should develop during the extended period, the Corporation will require 
the insurance provider to immediately discontinue acceptance of 
applications.
    (c) Since this Group Risk Plan differs significantly from 
traditional Multiple Peril Crop Insurance, persons who purchase the 
Group Risk Plan and their crop insurance agents will be required to 
execute an ``Acknowledgment of Differences'' that explains that the 
terms and conditions of the Group Risk Plan are different from 
traditional crop insurance in that:
    (1) The Group Risk Plan indemnity payment, if any, will be made 
after the Group Risk Plan premium is received;
    (2) A person may have a low yield on his or her individual farm and 
not receive a payment under Group Risk Plan; and
    (3) A person may not have any loss of production and still collect 
under the policy if a loss of production is general in the area.
    (4) By executing the ``Acknowledgment of Differences,'' the insured 
certifies that:
    (i) He or she understands the terms of the Group Risk Plan;
    (ii) An MPCI policy may be available in the county; and
    (iii) Both a Group Risk Plan and a MPCI Plan cannot be purchased on 
the same crop by the same insured in the same county.


<R05>
Sec. 407.9  Group risk plan common policy.

    The provisions of the Group Risk Plan Common Policy for the 2001 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:

    [FCIC policies]

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                      Group Risk Plan Common Policy

    [Reinsured policies]
(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
(This is a continuous policy. Refer to Section 18.)

    [FCIC policies]
    This insurance policy establishes a risk management program 
developed by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), an agency of 
the United States Government, under the authority of the Federal Crop 
Insurance Act (Act), as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.). All terms of 
the policy and rights and responsibilities of the parties hereto are 
subject to the Act and all regulations under the Act published in 7 CFR 
chapter IV. The provisions of this policy may not be waived or varied in 
any way by the crop insurance representative, or any other 
representative or employee of FCIC, the Risk Management Agency (RMA) or 
the Farm Service Agency (FSA). In the event that the company cannot pay 
a loss, the claim will be settled in accordance with the provisions of 
the policy and paid by FCIC. No state guarantee fund will be liable to 
pay the loss.
    Throughout this policy, ``you'' and ``your'' refer to the person 
shown on the accepted application and ``we,'' ``us,'' and ``our'' refer 
to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. Unless the context indicates 
otherwise, the use of the plural form of a word includes the singular 
use and the singular form of the word includes the plural.
    [Reinsured policies]
    This insurance policy establishes a risk management program created 
by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), an agency of the 
United States Government, under the authority of the Federal Crop 
Insurance Act (Act), as amended (7 U. S. C. 1501 et seq.).
    This insurance policy is reinsured by FCIC under the provisions of 
the Act. All terms of the policy and rights and responsibilities of the 
parties are subject to the Act and all regulations under the Act 
published in 7 CFR chapter IV, and may not be waived or varied in any 
way by the crop insurance representative, any other representative or 
employee of the company, any representative or employee of FCIC, the 
Risk Management Agency, or the Farm Service Agency (FSA). All provisions 
of State and local law in conflict with the provisions of this policy as 
published in 7 CFR part 407 are preempted and the provisions of such 
part will control.
    Throughout this policy, ``you'' and ``your'' refer to the person 
shown on the accepted application and ``we,'' ``us,'' and ``our'' refer 
to the reinsured company issuing this policy. Unless the context 
indicates otherwise, the use of the plural form of a word includes the 
singular use and the singular form of the word includes the plural.
    [Both policies]
    The Group Risk Plan of Insurance (GRP) is designed as a risk 
management tool to insure against widespread loss of production of the 
insured crop in a county. It is primarily intended for use by those 
producers whose

[[Page 78]]

farm yields tend to follow the average county yield. It is possible for 
you to have a low yield on the acreage that you insure and still not 
receive a payment under this plan.
    For additional coverage you may select any percent coverage level 
shown on the actuarial documents. Multiplying your coverage level 
percent by the expected county yield shown on the actuarial documents 
gives your trigger yield. If the payment yield that FCIC publishes for 
the insured crop year falls below your trigger yield, you will receive a 
payment.
    On or before the sales closing date, you may select any dollar 
amount of protection between 60 and 100 percent (except for Catastrophic 
Risk Protection (CAT) which is 55 percent) of the maximum protection per 
acre shown on the actuarial documents. This protection will be provided 
for each acre of the crop planted by the acreage reporting date and 
shown on your acreage report (unless otherwise provided in the crop 
provisions) in which you have a share.
    In accordance with the Act, FCIC will pay a portion of your premium, 
as published in the actuarial documents. The premium rates, practices, 
types, maximum protection per acre, and maximum subsidy per acre are 
also shown on the actuarial documents.
    FCIC will issue the payment yield in the calendar year following the 
crop year insured. This yield will be the official estimated yield 
published by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). You 
will be paid if the payment yield falls below your trigger yield. The 
amount of your payment per net insured acre will be calculated by 
subtracting the payment yield from the trigger yield, dividing that 
quantity by the trigger yield, and multiplying that result by your 
protection per acre for each net acre that you have insured.
    To be eligible to participate in the Group Risk Plan of Insurance 
for any crop in any county, and to receive an indemnity thereunder, you 
must have an insurable interest in an insured crop that is planted in 
the county shown on the approved application. The crop must be planted 
for harvest and be reported to us by the acreage reporting date. You may 
only purchase coverage under the Group Risk Plan of Insurance on your 
net acres of the insured crop.
    The insurance contract shall become effective upon the acceptance by 
us of a duly executed application for insurance on our form. Acceptance 
occurs when we issue a Summary of Protection to you. The policy shall 
consist of the accepted application, Group Risk Plan of Insurance Common 
Policy Basic Provisions, Crop Provisions, Special Provisions, actuarial 
documents, and any amendments, endorsements, or options.

                           Agreement To Insure

    In return for your payment of the premium and your compliance with 
all applicable provisions, we agree to provide risk protection as stated

order of priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) the Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Group Risk Plan Basic Provisions, with (1) 
controlling (2), etc.

application, as specified in the applicable Crop Provisions, and must be 
grown on insurable acres.

                    3. Insured and Insurable Acreage

    (a) The insurable acreage is all of the acreage of the insured crop 
for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial documents and in 
which you have a share and which is in the county listed in your 
accepted application. The dollar amount of protection per acre, amount 
of premium, and indemnity will be calculated separately for each county, 
type, and practice.
    (b) Only the acreage seeded to the insured crop on or before the 
acreage reporting date (unless otherwise provided in the Crop 
Provisions) and physically located in the county listed on your accepted 
application will be insured. Crops grown on acreage physically located 
in another county must be reported and insured separately.

[[Page 80]]

    (c) We will not insure any crop grown on any acreage where the crop 
was destroyed or put to another use during the insurance period for the 
purpose of conforming with, or obtaining a payment under, any other 
program administered by the USDA.
    (d) We will not insure any acreage where you have failed to follow 
good farming practices for the insured crop.

                          4. Policy Protection

    (a) For catastrophic risk protection GRP policies, the dollar amount 
of protection per acre will be 55 percent of the maximum protection per 
acre specified on the actuarial documents for each insured crop, 
practice, and type. For additional coverage GRP policies, you may select 
any dollar amount of protection from 60 percent through 100 percent of 
the maximum protection per acre shown on the actuarial documents for the 
crop, practice, and type.
    (b) The dollar amount of protection per acre, multiplied by your net 
insured acreage, is your policy protection for each insured crop, 
practice, and type specified in the actuarial documents.
    (c) All yields are based on NASS determinations, and such 
determinations for the county will be conclusively presumed to be 
accurate.

                           5. Coverage Levels

    (a) For catastrophic risk protection GRP policies, the coverage 
level is shown on the actuarial documents for each insured crop, 
practice, and type. For additional coverage GRP policies, you may select 
any percentage of coverage shown on the actuarial documents for the 
crop, practice, and type.
    (b) Your coverage level multiplied by the expected county yield 
shown on the actuarial documents is your trigger yield. If the payment 
yield published by FCIC for the insured crop, practice, and type for the 
insured crop year falls below your trigger yield, you will receive an 
indemnity payment.
    (c) You may change the coverage level or amount of protection for 
each insured crop on or before the sales closing date. Changes must be 
in writing and received by us by the sales closing date.

                      6. Payment Calculation Factor

    Your payment calculation factor will be ((your trigger yield-payment 
yield) / your trigger yield) for the purposes of calculating an 
indemnity payment.

                     7. Report of Acreage and Share

    (a) You must report on our form all acreage for each insured crop in 
which you have a share (insurable and not insured) by practice and type 
specified in the actuarial documents in each county listed on your 
accepted application. This report must be submitted each year on or 
before the acreage reporting date for the insured crop contained in the 
actuarial documents. If you do not submit an acreage report by the 
acreage reporting date, we will determine your acreage and share or deny 
liability on the policy.
    (b) We will not insure any acreage of the insured crop planted after 
the acreage reporting date, unless otherwise provided in the Crop 
Provisions.
    (c) Your premium will be based on the greater of the acreage 
reported on the acreage report or the acreage determined by us to be 
accurate.
    (d) The payment of an indemnity will be based on your insurable 
acreage on the acreage reporting date.
    (e) If you misrepresent or omit any information, we will revise the 
premium or liability or both for each insured crop in the county, by 
type and practice, to the amount we determine to be correct.
    (f) You may insure only your share of the crop, which includes any 
share of your spouse and dependent children unless it is demonstrated to 
our satisfaction, prior to the sales closing date, that you and your 
spouse maintain completely separate farming operations and that each 
spouse is the operator of his or her own separate operation. Any 
commingling of any part of the operations will cause shares of you and 
your spouse to be combined.

                8. Administrative Fees and Annual Premium

    (a) If you obtain a catastrophic risk protection GRP policy, you 
will pay an administrative fee, unless otherwise specified in 7 CFR part 
400:
    (1) Of $100 per crop per county;
    (2) Payable to the insurance provider on the billing date for the 
crop.
    (b) If you obtain an additional coverage GRP policy, you will pay an 
administrative fee:
    (1) Of $30 per crop per county;
    (2) Payable to the insurance provider on the billing date for the 
crop.
    (c) Limited resource farmers as defined in 7 CFR 457.8 may apply for 
a waiver of administrative fees.
    (d) For additional coverage GRP policies, your premium is determined 
by multiplying your policy protection by the premium rate per hundred 
dollars of protection for your coverage level contained in the actuarial 
documents, by 0.01, and subtracting the applicable subsidy.
    (e) For catastrophic risk protection and additional coverage GRP 
policies, payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you 
file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting 
date for the crop (if you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be 
subject to criminal and administrative sanctions).

[[Page 81]]

    (f) The annual premium is earned and payable at the time the insured 
crop is planted. For each insured crop, you will be billed for premium 
and the administrative fee by the billing date specified in the Special 
Provisions. Premium, administrative fee, and any other amount owed us is 
due on the billing date and interest will accrue if the premium, 
administrative fee, or any other amount owed is not received by us 
before the first day of the month following the premium billing date.
    (g) The premium, administrative fee, and any other amount due, plus 
any accrued interest, will be considered delinquent if it is not paid on 
or before the termination date specified in the Crop Provisions. This 
may affect your eligibility for benefits under other USDA programs. A 
debt for any crop insured with us under the authority of the Act will be 
deducted from any indemnity due you for this or any other crop insured 
with us.
    (h) Failure to pay the premium and any administrative fee due, plus 
any accrued interest and penalties, by the termination date will make 
you ineligible for any crop insurance under the Act for subsequent crop 
years until the sales closing date after the date the debt, including 
interest and penalties, is paid or satisfactory arrangements acceptable 
to us for such payment are made.

                          9. Written Agreements

    Terms of this policy which are specifically designated for the use 
of written agreements may be altered by written agreement in accordance 
with the following:
    (a) You must apply in writing for each written agreement no later 
than the sales closing date;
    (b) The application for written agreement must contain all variable 
terms of the contract between you and us that will be in effect if the 
written agreement is not approved;
    (c) If approved by us, the written agreement will include all 
variable terms of the contract, including, but not limited to, crop type 
or variety, the protection per acre, premium rate, and price election; 
and
    (d) Each written agreement will only be valid for one year. If the 
written agreement is not specifically renewed the following year, 
insurance coverage for subsequent crop years will be in accordance with 
the printed policy.

             10. Access to Insured Crop and Record Retention

    We may examine the insured crop and any records relating to the crop 
and this insurance at any location where such crop or such records may 
be found or maintained, as often as we reasonably require. Records 
relating to the planting of the insured crop and your net acres must be 
retained for three years after the end of the crop year or three years 
after the date of payment of the final indemnity, whichever is later. We 
may extend the record retention period beyond three years by notifying 
you of such extension in writing. Failure to maintain such records will, 
at our option, result in cancellation of the policy or a determination 
that no indemnity is due.

             11. Transfer of Coverage and Right to Indemnity

    If you transfer any part of your share during the crop year, you may 
transfer your coverage rights, if the transferee is eligible for crop 
insurance. We will not be liable for any more than the liability 
determined in accordance with your policy that existed before the 
transfer occurred. The transfer of coverage rights must be on our form 
and will not be effective until approved by us in writing. Both you and 
the transferee are jointly and severally liable for payment of the 
premium. The transferee has all rights and responsibilities under this 
policy consistent with the transferee's interest.

                       12. Assignment of Indemnity

    You may assign to another person your right to an indemnity for the 
crop year. The assignment must be on our form and will not be effective 
until approved in writing by us.

                           13. Other Insurance

    You may not obtain any other crop insurance issued under the 
authority of the Act on your share of the insured crop. If we determine 
that more than one policy on your share is intentional, you may be 
subject to the sanctions authorized under this policy, the Act, or any 
other applicable statute. If we determine that the violation was not 
intentional, the policy with the earliest date of application will be in 
force and all other policies will be void. Nothing in this paragraph 
prevents you from obtaining other insurance not issued under the Act.

                       14. Legal Action Against Us

    (a) You may not bring legal action against us unless you have 
complied with all of the policy provisions.
    (b) If you do take legal action against us, you must do so within 12 
months of the date of denial of a claim. Suit must be brought in 
accordance with the provisions of 7 U.S.C. 1508(j).
    (c) Your right to recover damages (compensatory, punitive, or 
other), attorney's fees, or other charges is limited or excluded by this 
contract or by Federal Regulations.
    [FCIC policy]

[[Page 82]]

            15. Restrictions, Limitations, and Amounts Due Us

    (a) We may restrict the amount of acreage we will insure to the 
amount allowed under any acreage limitation program established by USDA.
    (b) Violation of Federal statutes including, but not limited to, the 
Act; the controlled substance provisions of the Food Security Act of 
1985; the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990; and 
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and any regulation 
promulgated thereunder, will result in cancellation, termination, or 
voidance of your crop insurance contract. We will recover any and all 
monies paid to you or received by you during your period of 
ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less an amount for 
expenses and handling not to exceed 20 percent of the premium paid or to 
be paid by you.
    (c) Our maximum liability under this policy will be limited to the 
policy protection specified in section 4 of this policy. Under no 
circumstances will we be liable for the payment of damages 
(compensatory, punitive, or other), attorney's fees, or other charges in 
connection with any claim for indemnity, whether we approve or 
disapprove such indemnity.
    (d) We will pay simple interest computed on the net indemnity 
ultimately found to be due by us or determined by a final judgment of a 
court of competent jurisdiction or a final administrative determination 
from, and including, the 61st day after the date we receive the NASS 
county yield estimates for the insured crop year. Interest will be paid 
only if the reason for our failure to timely pay is not due to your 
failure to provide information or other material necessary for the 
computation or payment of the indemnity. The interest rate will be that 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611 et seq.), and published in 
the Federal Register.
    (e) Any amount illegally or erroneously paid to you or that is owed 
to us but is delinquent may be recovered by us through offset by 
deducting it from any loan or payment due you under any Act of Congress 
or program administered by any United States Government Agency, or by 
other collection action.
    (f) Interest will accrue at the rate not to exceed 1.25 percent 
simple interest per calendar month, or any part thereof, on any unpaid 
premium or administrative fee balance. For the purpose of premium and 
administrative fee amounts due us, interest will begin to accrue on the 
first day of the month following the premium billing date specified in 
the Special Provisions.
    (g) For the purpose of any other amounts due us, such as repayment 
of indemnities found not to have been earned:
    (1) Interest will start to accrue on the date that notice is issued 
to you for the collection of the unearned amount;
    (2) Amounts found due under this paragraph will not be charged 
interest if payment is made in full within 30 days of issuance of the 
notice by us;
    (3) The amount will be considered delinquent if not paid within 30 
days of the date the notice is issued by us;
    (4) Penalties and interest will be charged in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR part 102; and
    (5) The penalty for accounts more than 90 days delinquent is an 
additional 6 percent per annum.
    (h) Interest on any amount due us found to have been received by you 
because of fraud, misrepresentation, or presentation by you of a false 
claim will start on the date you received the amount with the additional 
6 percent penalty beginning on the 31st day after the notice of amount 
due is issued to you. This interest is in addition to any other amount 
found to be due under any other Federal criminal or civil statute.
    (i) If we determine that it is necessary to contract with a 
collection agency, refer the debt to governmental collection centers, 
the Department of Treasury Offset Program, or to employ an attorney to 
assist in collection, you agree to pay all of the expenses of 
collection.
    (j) All amounts paid by you will be applied first to expenses of 
collection if any, second to reduction of any penalties which may have 
been assessed, then to reduction of accrued interest, and finally, to 
reduction of the principal balance.
    [Reinsured policy]

            15. Restrictions, Limitations, and Amounts Due Us

    (a) We may restrict the amount of acreage we will insure to the 
amount allowed under any acreage limitation program established by USDA.
    (b) Violation of Federal statutes including, but not limited to, the 
Act; the controlled substance provisions of the Food Security Act of 
1985; the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990; and 
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and any regulation 
promulgated thereunder, will result in cancellation, termination, or 
voidance of your crop insurance contract. We will recover any and all 
monies paid to you or received by you during your period of 
ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less a reasonable 
amount for expenses and handling not to exceed 20 percent of the premium 
paid or to be paid by you.
    (c) Our maximum liability under this policy will be limited to the 
policy protection

[[Page 83]]

specified in section 4 of this policy. Under no circumstances will we be 
liable for the payment of damages (compensatory, punitive, or other), 
attorney's fees, or other charges in connection with any claim for 
indemnity, whether we approve or disapprove such indemnity.
    (d) Interest will accrue at the rate not to exceed 1.25 percent 
simple interest per calendar month, or any part thereof, on any unpaid 
premium or administrative fee balance. For the purpose of premium and 
administrative fee amounts due us, interest will begin to accrue on the 
first day of the month following the premium billing date specified in 
the Special Provisions.
    (e) For the purpose of any amounts due us, such as repayment of 
indemnities found not to have been earned, interest will start to accrue 
on the date that notice is issued to you for the collection of the 
unearned amount. Amounts found due under this paragraph will not be 
charged interest if payment in full is made within 30 days of issuance 
of notice by us. The amount will be considered delinquent if not paid in 
full within 30 days of the date the notice is issued by us.
    (f) All amounts paid will be applied first to expenses of collection 
(see subsection (g) of this section) if any, second to reduction of 
accrued interest, and then to reduction of the principal balance.
    (g) If we determine that it is necessary to contract with a 
collection agency or to employ an attorney to assist in collection, you 
agree to pay all of the expenses of collection.
    (h) A portion of the amount paid to you to which you were not 
entitled may be collected through administrative offset from payments 
you receive from United States government agencies in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. chapter 37.
    [FCIC policy]

                           16. Determinations

    All determinations required by the policy will be made by us. If you 
disagree with our determinations, you may obtain reconsideration or you 
may appeal our determinations in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.
    [Reinsured policy]

                           16. Determinations

    (a) If you and we fail to agree on any factual determination, the 
disagreement will be resolved in accordance with the rules of the 
American Arbitration Association. Failure to agree with any factual 
determination made by FCIC must be resolved through the FCIC appeal 
provisions published at 7 CFR part 11.
    (b) No award determined by arbitration or appeal can exceed the 
amount of liability established or which should have been established 
under this policy.
    [Both policies]

                        17. Holidays and Weekends

    If any date specified in this program falls on Saturday, Sunday, or 
a legal Federal holiday, that date will be extended to the next business 
day.

            18. Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination

    (a) This is a continuous policy and will remain in effect for each 
crop year following the acceptance of the original application until 
canceled by you in accordance with the terms of the policy or terminated 
by operation of the terms of the policy or by us.
    (b) Your application for insurance must contain all the information 
required by us to insure the crop. Applications that do not contain all 
social security numbers and employer identification numbers, as 
applicable (except as stated herein), coverage level, price election, 
crop, type, variety, or class, plan of insurance, and any other material 
information required to insure the crop, are not acceptable. If a person 
with a substantial beneficial interest in the insured crop refuses to 
provide a social security number or employer identification number, the 
amount of coverage available under the policy will be reduced 
proportionately by that person's share of the crop.
    (c) After acceptance of the application, you may not cancel this 
policy for the initial crop year. Thereafter, the policy will continue 
in force for each succeeding crop year unless canceled or terminated as 
provided below.
    (d) Either you or we may cancel this policy after the initial crop 
year by providing written notice to the other on or before the 
cancellation date shown in the Crop Provisions.
    (e) If any amount due, including premium, is not paid on or before 
the termination date for the crop on which an amount is due:
    (1) For a policy with the unpaid premium, the policy will terminate 
effective on the termination date immediately subsequent to the billing 
date for the crop year;
    (2) For a policy with other amounts due, the policy will terminate 
effective on the termination date immediately after the account becomes 
delinquent;
    (3) Ineligibility will be effective as of the date that the policy 
was terminated for the crop for which you failed to pay an amount owed 
and for all other insured crops with coincidental termination dates;
    (4) All other policies that are issued by us under the authority of 
the Act will also terminate as of the next termination date contained in 
the applicable policy;
    (5) If you are ineligible, you may not obtain any crop insurance 
under the Act until payment is made, you execute an agreement to repay 
the debt and make the payments in accordance with the agreement, or you 
file a

[[Page 84]]

petition to have your debts discharged in bankruptcy;
    (6) If you execute an agreement to repay the debt and fail to timely 
make any scheduled payment, you will be ineligible for crop insurance 
effective on the date the payment was due until the debt is paid in full 
or you file a petition to discharge the debt in bankruptcy and 
subsequently obtain discharge of the amounts due. Dismissal of the 
bankruptcy petition before discharge will void all policies in effect 
retroactive to the date you were originally determined ineligible to 
participate;
    (7) Once the policy is terminated, the policy cannot be reinstated 
for the current crop year unless the termination was in error;
    (8) After you again become eligible for crop insurance, if you want 
to obtain coverage for your crops, you must reapply on or before the 
sales closing date for the crop (since applications for crop insurance 
cannot be accepted after the sales closing date, if you make any payment 
after the sales closing date, you cannot apply for insurance until the 
next crop year); and
    (9) If we deduct the amount due us from an indemnity, the date of 
payment for the purpose of this section will be the date you sign the 
properly executed claim for indemnity.
    (10) For example, if crop A, with a termination date of October 31, 
1997, and crop B, with a termination date of March 15, 1998, are insured 
and you do not pay the premium for crop A by the termination date, you 
are ineligible for crop insurance as of October 31, 1997, and crop A's 
policy is terminated on that date. Crop B's policy is terminated as of 
March 15, 1998. If you enter an agreement to repay the debt on April 25, 
1998, you can apply for insurance for crop A by the October 31, 1998, 
sales closing date and crop B by the March 15, 1999, sales closing date. 
If you fail to make a scheduled payment on November 1, 1998, you will be 
ineligible for crop insurance effective on November 1, 1998, and you 
will not be eligible unless the debt is paid in full or you file a 
petition to have the debt discharged in bankruptcy and subsequently 
receive discharge.
    (f) If you die, disappear, or are judicially declared incompetent, 
or if you are an entity other than an individual and such entity is 
dissolved, the policy will terminate as of the date of death, judicial 
declaration, or dissolution. If such event occurs after coverage begins 
for any crop year, the policy will continue in force through the crop 
year and terminate at the end of the insurance period and any indemnity 
will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially 
entitled to the indemnity. The premium will be deducted from the 
indemnity or collected from the estate. Death of a partner in a 
partnership will dissolve the partnership unless the partnership 
agreement provides otherwise. If two or more persons having a joint 
interest are insured jointly, death of one of the persons will dissolve 
the joint entity.
    (g) We may terminate your policy if no premium is earned for 3 
consecutive years.
    (h) The cancellation and termination dates are contained in the Crop 
Provisions.

                          19. Contract Changes

    (a) We may change any terms and conditions of this policy from year 
to year.
    (b) Any changes in policy provisions, expected county yields, 
maximum amounts of protection, premium rates, and program dates will be 
provided by us to your local crop insurance provider not later than the 
contract change date contained in the Crop Provisions. You may view the 
documents or request copies from your local crop insurance provider.
    (c) You will be notified, in writing, of changes to the Basic 
Provisions, Crop Provisions, and Special Provisions of this policy not 
later than 30 days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop. 
Acceptance of changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of 
notice from you to change or cancel your insurance coverage.

             20. Eligibility for Other Farm Program Benefits

    To remain eligible for benefits under the Agriculture Marketing 
Transition Act, the conservation reserve program, or certain farm loans, 
you are required to obtain at least the catastrophic level of coverage 
for either GRP or any other plan of insurance that is available in the 
county, for all crops of economic significance, or execute a waiver of 
your rights to any emergency crop assistance on or before the sales 
closing date for the crop.

                 An Example To Demonstrate How GRP Works

    Producer A buys 90 percent coverage and selects $160 protection per 
acre. Producer B buys 75 percent coverage and selects $185 protection 
per acre. Both producers have 100 percent share and both plant 200 acres 
of a crop in the county. The expected county yield is 45 bushels per 
acre. The premium rate for 90 percent coverage is $6.14 per hundred 
dollars of protection and the premium rate for 75 percent coverage is 
$3.30 per hundred dollars of protection.
    A's trigger yield is 40.5 bushels per acre (90% x 45), and the total 
premium due is $1,965 ($160 x $6.14 x 200 acres x 0.01). Of that amount, 
FCIC pays $614 (200 acres x the maximum subsidy of $3.07 per acre). A's 
policy protection is $32,000 ($160 x 200 acres).
    B's trigger yield is 33.8 bushels per acre (75% of 45), and the 
total premium due is $1,221 ($185 x $3.30 x 200 acres x 0.01). Of that 
amount, FCIC pays $442 (200 acres x the subsidy amount of $2.21 per 
acre). B's policy protection is $37,000 ( $185 x 200 acres).


[[Page 85]]


Scenario 1 (likely)
    FCIC issues a payment yield of 46 bushels per acre. This is above 
both producers' trigger yields, so no indemnity payment is made, even if 
one or both have individual yields that are below the trigger yield.
Scenario 2 (less likely)
    FCIC issues a payment yield of 38 bushels per acre. A's payment 
calculation factor is 0.062 ((40.5 - 38) / 40.5). This number multiplied 
by the policy protection yields an indemnity payment of $1,984 (.062 x 
$32,000). B's trigger yield is less than the payment yield, so no 
indemnity payment is made.
Scenario 3 (least likely)
    FCIC issues a payment yield of 22 bushels per acre. A's payment 
calculation factor is 0.457 ((40.5 - 22) / 40.5). The payment is $14,624 
(0.457 x $32,000). B's payment calculation factor is 0.349 ((33.8 - 22) 
/ 33.8), and the final indemnity payment is $12,913 (0.349 x $37,000).

succeeding crop years are as follows:

                             1. Definitions

    NASS yield. The yield calculated by dividing the NASS estimate of 
soybean production in the county, by the NASS estimate of the acres of 
soybeans in the county, as specified in the actuarial documents. The 
actuarial documents will specify whether the harvested or planted 
acreage is used to calculate the yield used to establish the expected 
county yield and calculate indemnities.
    Planted acreage. Land in which the soybean seed has been placed by a 
machine appropriate for the insured crop and planting method, at the 
correct depth, into a seedbed that has been properly prepared for the 
planting method and production practice. Land on which seed is initially 
spread onto the soil surface by any method and which subsequently is 
mechanically incorporated into the soil in a timely manner and at the 
proper depth, will also be considered planted.

                             2. Crop Insured

    The insured crop will be all soybeans:
    (a) Grown on insurable acreage in the county or counties listed in 
the accepted application;
    (b) Properly planted and reported by the acreage reporting date;
    (c) Planted with the intent to be harvested as soybeans; and
    (d) Not planted into an established grass or legume or interplanted 
with another crop.

                               3. Payment

    (a) A payment will be made only if the payment yield for the insured 
crop year is less than your trigger yield.
    (b) Payment yields will be determined prior to April 16 following 
the crop year.
    (c) We will issue any payment to you prior to the May 16 immediately 
following our determination of the payment yield.

[[Page 90]]

    (d) The payment is equal to the payment calculation factor 
multiplied by your policy protection for each insured crop practice and 
type specified on the actuarial documents.
    (e) The payment will not be recalculated even though the NASS yield 
may be subsequently revised.

Sec. 412.1  General statement.

    This part is issued in accordance with the regulations of the 
Secretary of Agriculture published at 7 CFR 1.1-1.23, and appendix A, 
implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). The 
Secretary's regulations, as implemented by this part, and the Risk 
Management Agency (RMA) govern availability of records of the Federal 
Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) as administration of the crop 
insurance program for FCIC.


<R05>
Sec. 412.2  Public inspection and copying.

    (a) Members of the public may request access to the information 
specified in Sec. 412.2(d) for inspection and copying.
    (b) To obtain access to specified information, the public should 
submit a written request, in accordance with 7 CFR 1.6, to the Appeals, 
Litigation and Legal Liaison Staff, Risk Management Agency, United 
States Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW, STOP 
0807, room 6618-S, Washington, DC 20250-0807, from 9:00 a.m.--4:00 pm., 
EDT Monday through Friday, except holidays.
    (c) When the information requested is not located at the office of 
the Appeals, Litigation and Legal Liaison Staff, the Appeals, Litigation 
and Legal Liaison Staff will direct the request to the appropriate 
office where the information can be obtained. The requester will be 
informed that the request has been forwarded to the appropriate office.
    (d) FCIC will make available for inspection and copying, unless 
otherwise exempt from publication under sections 552(a)(2)(C) and 
552(b):
    (1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions and 
orders made in the adjudication of cases; and
    (2) Those statements of policy and interpretations that have been

providing identifying information for the public as to any material 
issued, adopted, or promulgated by the Agency since July 4, 1967, and 
required by section 552(a)(2). Pursuant to the Freedom of Information 
Act provisions, RMA and FCIC have determined that in view of the small 
number of public requests for such index, publication of such an index 
would be unnecessary and impracticable. Copies of the index will be 
available upon request in person or by mail at the address stated in 
Sec. 412.2(b).

<R05>
Sec. 457.1  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part are applicable only to crops for which a 
crop provision is published as a section to 7 CFR part 457 and then only 
for the crops and crop year designated by the application section.


<R05>
Sec. 457.2  Availability of Federal crop insurance.

    (a) Insurance shall be offered under the provisions of this section 
on the insured crop in counties within the limits prescribed by and in 
accordance with the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as 
amended (the Act). The crops and counties shall be designated by the 
Manager of the Corporation from those approved by the Board of Directors 
of the Corporation.
    (b) The insurance is offered through companies reinsured by the 
Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) that offer contracts 
containing the same terms and conditions as the contract set out in this 
part. These contracts are clearly identified as being reinsured by FCIC. 
FCIC may offer the contract for the catastrophic level of coverage 
contained in this part and part 402 directly to the insured through 
local offices of the Department of Agriculture only if the Secretary 
determines that the availability of local agents is not adequate. Those 
contracts are specifically identified as being offered by FCIC.
    (c) Except as specified in the Crop Provisions, the Catastrophic 
Risk Protection Endorsement (part 402 of this chapter) and part 400, 
subpart T of this chapter, no person may have in force more than one 
contract on the same crop for the same crop year in the same county.
    (d) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, if a 
person has more than one contract under the Act that provides coverage 
for the same loss on the same crop for the same crop year in the same 
county, all such contracts shall be voided for that crop year and the 
person will be liable for the premium on all contracts, unless the 
person can show to the satisfaction of the Corporation that the multiple 
contracts of insurance were inadvertent and without the fault of the 
person. If the multiple contracts of insurance are shown to be 
inadvertent and without the fault of the person, the contract with the 
earliest signature date on the application will be valid and all other 
contracts on that crop in the county for that crop year will be 
canceled. No liability for indemnity or premium will attach to the 
contracts so canceled.
    (e) The person must repay all amounts received in violation of this 
section with interest at the rate contained in the contract (see 
Sec. 457.8, paragraph 24).
    (f) An insured whose contract with the Corporation or with a company 
reinsured by the Corporation under the Act has been terminated because 
of violation of the terms of the contract is not eligible to obtain 
multiple peril crop insurance under the Act with the Corporation or with 
a company reinsured by the Corporation unless the insured can show that 
the default in the prior contract was cured prior to the sales closing 
date of the contract applied for or unless the insured can show that the 
termination was improper and should not result in subsequent 
ineligibility.
    (g) All applicants for insurance under the Act must advise the 
agent, in writing, at the time of application, of any previous 
applications for insurance or policies of insurance under the Act and

[[Page 94]]

the present status of any such applications or insurance.

[56 FR 1351, Jan. 14, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 58262, Nov. 1, 1993; 62

<R05>
Sec. 457.3  Premium rates, production guarantees or amounts of insurance, coverage levels, and prices at which indemnities shall be computed.

    (a) The Manager shall establish premium rates, production guarantees 
or amounts of insurance, coverage levels, and prices at which 
indemnities shall be computed for the insured crop which will be 
included in the actuarial table on file in the applicable agents' office 
for the county and which may be changed from year to year.
    (b) At the time the application for insurance is made, the applicant 
will elect an amount of insurance or a coverage level and price from 
among those contained in the actuarial table for the crop year.


<R05>
Sec. 457.4  OMB control numbers.

    The information collection requirements contained in these 
regulations have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been 
assigned OMB number 0563-0053.

[62 FR 65154, Dec. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 457.5  Creditors.

    An interest of a person in an insured crop existing by virtue of a 
lien, mortgage, garnishment, levy, execution, bankruptcy, involuntary 
transfer or other similar interest shall not entitle the holder of the 
interest to any benefit under the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 457.6  Good faith reliance on misrepresentation.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of the crop insurance contract, 
whenever:
    (a) A person entering into a contract of crop insurance under these 
regulations who, as a result of a misrepresentation or other erroneous 
action or advice by an agent or employee of the Corporation:
    (1) Is indebted to the Corporation for additional premiums; or
    (2) Has suffered a loss to a crop which is not insured or for which 
the insured is not entitled to an indemnity because of failure to comply 
with the terms of the insurance contract, but which the insured believed 
to be insured, or believed the terms of the insurance contract to have 
been complied with or waived; and
    (b) The Board of Directors of the Corporation, or the Manager in 
cases involving not more than $100,000.00, finds that:
    (1) An agent or employee of the Corporation did in fact make such 
misrepresentation or take other erroneous action or give erroneous 
advice;
    (2) Said insured relied thereon in good faith; and
    (3) To require the payment of the additional premiums or to deny 
such insured's entitlement to the indemnity would not be fair and 
equitable, such insured shall be granted relief the same as if otherwise 
entitled thereto. Requests for relief under this section must be 
submitted to the Corporation in writing. The Corporation reviewing 
officers must, upon application by the person claiming relief under this 
section, refer such application to the appropriate official of the 
Corporation for determination as to whether to grant relief under this 
section. Corporation reviewing officers do not have authority to grant 
relief under this section.
    (c) The reinsured companies may use arbitration panels established 
under contracts for reinsurance issued by them under the FCIC Act to 
grant relief under the same terms and conditions as contained in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section or, may establish procedures to 
administratively handle relief in accordance with such terms and 
conditions.

[56 FR 1351, Jan. 14, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 58262, Nov. 1, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 457.7  The contract.

    The insurance contract shall become effective upon the acceptance by 
the Corporation or the reinsured company of a duly executed application 
for insurance on a form prescribed by the Corporation. The contract 
shall consist of the accepted Application, the Basic Provisions, the 
Crop Provisions, the

[[Page 95]]

Special Provisions, the county Actuarial Table, and any amendments or 
options thereto. Changes made in the contract shall not affect its 
continuity from year to year. No indemnity shall be paid unless the 
insured complies with all terms and conditions of the contract. The 
forms referred to in the contract are available at the offices of the 
crop insurance agent.


<R05>
Sec. 457.8  The application and policy.

    (a) Application for insurance on a form prescribed by the 
Corporation, or approved by the Corporation, must be made by any person 
who wishes to participate in the program, to cover such person's share 
in the insured crop as landlord, owner-operator, crop ownership 
interest, or tenant. No other person's interest in the crop may be 
insured under an application unless that person's interest is clearly 
shown on the application and unless that other person's interest is 
insured in accordance with the procedures of the Corporation. The 
application must be submitted to the Corporation or the reinsured 
company through the crop insurance agent and must be submitted on or 
before the applicable sales closing date on file.
    (b) FCIC or the reinsured company may reject or discontinue the 
acceptance of applications in any country or of any individual 
application upon FCIC's determination that the insurance risk is 
excessive.

in any way by the crop insurance agent or any other agent or employee of 
FCIC.
    Throughout this policy, ``you'' and ``your'' refer to the named 
insured shown on the accepted application and ``we,'' ``us,'' and

    Abandon. Failure to continue to care for the crop, providing care so 
insignificant as to provide no benefit to the crop, or failure to 
harvest in a timely manner, unless an insured cause of loss prevents you 
from properly caring for or harvesting the crop or causes damage to it 
to the extent that most producers of the crop on acreage with similar 
characteristics in the area would not normally further care for or 
harvest it.
    Acreage report. A report required by paragraph 6 of these Basic 
Provisions that contains, in addition to other required information, 
your report of your share of all acreage of an insured crop in the 
county, whether insurable or not insurable.

by us before insurance coverage will commence. This form must be 
completed and filed in your agent's office not later than the sales 
closing date of the initial insurance year for each crop for which 
insurance coverage is requested. If cancellation or termination of 
insurance coverage occurs for any reason, including but not limited to 
indebtedness, suspension, debarment, disqualification, cancellation by 
you or us or violation of the controlled substance provisions of the 
Food Security Act of 1985, a new application must be filed for the crop. 
Insurance coverage will not be provided if you are ineligible under the 
contract or under any Federal statute or regulation.

share basis. (Example: If, in addition to the land you own, you rent 
land from five landlords, three on a crop share basis and two on a cash 
basis, you would be entitled to four units; one for each crop share 
lease and one that combines the two cash leases and the land you own.) 
Land which would otherwise be one unit may, in certain instances, be 
divided according to guidelines contained in section 34 of these Basic 
Provisions and in the applicable Crop Provisions.

indemnities found not to have been earned, which are not paid within 30 
days of our mailing or other delivery of notification to you of the 
amount due.
    Earliest planting date. The earliest date established for planting

amount of insurance, and are those recognized by the Cooperative State 
Research, Education, and Extension Service as compatible with agronomic 
and weather conditions in the county.
    Insured. The named person as shown on the application accepted by 
us. This term does not extend to any other person having a share or 
interest in the crop (for example, a partnership, landlord, or any other 
person) unless specifically indicated on the accepted application.
    Insured crop. The crop for which coverage is available under these 
Basic Provisions and the applicable Crop Provisions as shown on the

water needed to produce at least the yield used to establish the 
irrigated production guarantee or amount of insurance on the irrigated 
acreage planted to the insured crop.
    Late planted. Acreage initially planted to the insured crop after 
the final planting date.
    Late planting period. The period that begins the day after the final 
planting date for the insured crop and ends 25 days after the final 
planting date, unless otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or 
Special Provisions.
    Limited resource farmer. A producer or operator of a farm:
    (a) With an annual gross income of $20,000 or less derived from all 
sources, including income from a spouse or other members of the 
household, for each of the prior two years; or
    (b) With less than 25 acres aggregated for all crops, where a 
majority of the producer's gross income is derived from such farm or 
farms, but the producer's gross income from farming operations does not 
exceed $20,000.
    Loss, notice of. The notice required to be given by you not later 
than 72 hours after certain occurrences or 15 days after the end of the 
insurance period, whichever is earlier (see section 14).

careful person would use under similar circumstances.
    Non-contiguous. Any two or more tracts of land whose boundaries do 
not touch at any

[[Page 98]]

point, except that land separated only by a public or private right-of-
way, waterway, or an irrigation canal will be considered as contiguous.
    Person. An individual, partnership, association, corporation,

application, these Basic Provisions, the Crop Provisions, the Special 
Provisions, other applicable endorsements or options, the actuarial 
documents for the insured crop, the Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable, and the applicable regulations published in 
7 CFR chapter IV.
    Practical to replant. Our determination, after loss or damage to the 
insured crop, based on all factors, including, but not limited to 
moisture availability, marketing window, condition of the field, and 
time to crop maturity, that replanting the insured crop will allow the 
crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant after 
the end of the late planting period, or the final planting date if no 
late planting period is applicable, unless replanting is generally 
occurring in the area. Unavailability of seed or plants will not be 
considered a valid reason for failure to replant.
    Premium billing date. The earliest date upon which you will be 
billed for insurance coverage based on your acreage report. The premium 
billing date is contained in the Special Provisions.
    Prevented planting. Failure to plant the insured crop with proper 
equipment by the final planting date designated in the Special 
Provisions for the insured crop in the county. You may also be eligible 
for a prevented planting payment if you failed to plant the insured crop 
with the proper equipment within the late planting period. You must have 
been prevented from planting the insured crop due to an insured cause of 
loss that is general in the surrounding area and that prevents other 
producers from planting acreage with similar characteristics.

an addendum thereto, to be used for computing the value per pound, 
bushel, ton, carton, or other applicable unit of measure for the

tons, cartons, or other applicable units of measure determined by 
multiplying the approved yield per acre by the coverage level percentage 
you elect.
    Production report. A written record showing your annual production 
and used by us to determine your yield for insurance purposes (see 
section 3). The report contains yield information for previous years, 
including planted acreage and harvested production. This report must be 
supported by written verifiable records from a warehouseman or buyer of 
the insured crop or by measurement of farm-stored production, or by 
other records of production approved by us on an individual case basis.
    Replanting. Performing the cultural practices necessary to prepare 
the land to replace the seed or plants of the damaged or destroyed 
insured crop and then replacing the seed or plants of the same crop in 
the insured acreage with the expectation of producing at least the yield 
used to determine the production guarantee.
    Representative sample. Portions of the insured crop that must remain 
in the field for examination and review by our loss adjuster when making 
a crop appraisal, as specified in the Crop Provisions. In certain 
instances we may allow you to harvest the crop and require only that 
samples of the crop residue be left in the field.
    Sales closing date. A date contained in the Special Provisions by 
which an application must be filed. The last date by which you may 
change your crop insurance coverage for a crop year.
    Section. (for the purposes of unit structure) A unit of measure 
under a rectangular survey system describing a tract of land usually one 
mile square and usually containing approximately 640 acres.
    Share. Your percentage of interest in the insured crop as an owner, 
operator, or tenant at the time insurance attaches. However, only for 
the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity, your share will not 
exceed your share at the earlier of the time of loss or the beginning of 
harvest.
    Special Provisions. The part of the policy that contains specific 
provisions of insurance for each insured crop that may vary by 
geographic area.
    State. The state shown on your accepted application.
    Substantial beneficial interest. An interest held by any person of 
at least 10 percent in the applicant or insured.
    Summary of coverage. Our statement to you, based upon your acreage 
report, specifying the insured crop and the guarantee or amount of 
insurance coverage provided by unit.
    Tenant. A person who rents land from another person for a share of 
the crop or a

[[Page 99]]

share of the proceeds of the crop (see the definition of ``share'' 
above).
    Termination date. The calendar date contained in the Crop Provisions 
upon which your insurance ceases to be in effect because of nonpayment 
of any amount due us under the policy, including premium.
    Timely planted. Planted on or before the final planting date 
designated in the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county.
    USDA. United States Department of Agriculture.
    Void. When the policy is considered not to have existed for a crop 
year as a result of concealment, fraud or misrepresentation (see section 
27).
    Whole farm unit. All insurable acreage of the insured crops in the 
county in which you have a share on the date coverage begins for each 
crop for the crop year.
    Written agreement. A document that alters designated terms of a 
policy as authorized under these Basic Provisions, the Crop Provisions, 
or the Special Provisions for the insured crop (see section 18).

            2. Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination

    (a) This is a continuous policy and will remain in effect for each 
crop year following the acceptance of the original application until 
canceled by you in accordance with the terms of the policy or terminated 
by operation of the terms of the policy or by us.
    (b) Your application for insurance must contain all the information 
required by us to insure the crop. Applications that do not contain all 
social security numbers and employer identification numbers, as 
applicable, (except as stated herein) coverage level, price election, 
crop, type, variety, or class, plan of insurance, and any other material 
information required to insure the crop, are not acceptable. If a person 
with a substantial beneficial interest in the insured crop refuses to 
provide a social security number or employer identification number and 
that person is:
    (1) Not on the non-standard classification system list, the amount 
of coverage available under the policy will be reduced proportionately 
by that person's share of the crop; or
    (2) On the non-standard classification system list, the insurance 
will not be available to that person and any entity in which the person 
has a substantial beneficial interest.
    (c) After acceptance of the application, you may not cancel this 
policy for the initial crop year. Thereafter, the policy will continue 
in force for each succeeding crop year unless canceled or terminated as 
provided below.
    (d) Either you or we may cancel this policy after the initial crop 
year by providing written notice to the other on or before the 
cancellation date shown in the Crop Provisions.
    (e) If any amount due, including administrative fees or premium, is 
not paid or an acceptable arrangement for payment is not made on or 
before the termination date for the crop on which the amount is due, you 
will be determined to be ineligible to participate in any crop insurance 
program authorized under the Act in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, 
subpart U.
    (1) For a policy with unpaid administrative fees or premium, the 
policy will terminate effective on the termination date immediately 
subsequent to the billing date for the crop year;
    (2) For a policy with other amounts due, the policy will terminate 
effective on the termination date immediately after the account becomes 
delinquent;
    (3) Ineligibility will be effective as of the date that the policy 
was terminated for the crop for which you failed to pay an amount owed 
and for all other insured crops with coincidental termination dates;
    (4) All other policies that are issued by us under the authority of 
the Act will also terminate as of the next termination date contained in 
the applicable policy;
    (5) If you are ineligible, you may not obtain any crop insurance 
under the Act until payment is made, you execute an agreement to repay 
the debt and make the payments in accordance with the agreement, or you 
file a petition to have your debts discharged in bankruptcy;
    (6) If you execute an agreement to repay the debt and fail to timely 
make any scheduled payment, you will be ineligible for crop insurance 
effective on the date the payment was due until the debt is paid in full 
or you file a petition to discharge the debt in bankruptcy and 
subsequently obtain discharge of the amounts due. Dismissal of the 
bankruptcy petition before discharge will void all policies in effect 
retroactive to the date you were originally determined ineligible to 
participate;
    (7) Once the policy is terminated, the policy cannot be reinstated 
for the current crop year unless the termination was in error;
    (8) After you again become eligible for crop insurance, if you want 
to obtain coverage for your crops, you must reapply on or before the 
sales closing date for the crop (Since applications for crop insurance 
cannot be accepted after the sales closing date, if you make any payment 
after the sales closing date, you cannot apply for insurance until the 
next crop year); and
    (9) If we deduct the amount due us from an indemnity, the date of 
payment for the purpose of this section will be the date you sign the 
properly executed claim for indemnity.
    (10) For example, if crop A, with a termination date of October 31, 
1997, and crop B, with a termination date of March 15, 1998,

[[Page 100]]

are insured and you do not pay the premium for crop A by the termination 
date, you are ineligible for crop insurance as of October 31, 1997, and 
crop A's policy is terminated on that date. Crop B's policy is 
terminated as of March 15, 1998. If you enter an agreement to repay the 
debt on April 25, 1998, you can apply for insurance for crop A by the 
October 31, 1998, sales closing date and crop B by the March 15, 1999, 
sales closing date. If you fail to make a scheduled payment on November 
1, 1998, you will be ineligible for crop insurance effective on November 
1, 1998, and you will not be eligible unless the debt is paid in full or 
you file a petition to have the debt discharged in bankruptcy and 
subsequently receive discharge.
    (f) If you die, disappear, or are judicially declared incompetent, 
or if you are an entity other than an individual and such entity is 
dissolved, the policy will terminate as of the date of death, judicial 
declaration, or dissolution. If such event occurs after coverage begins 
for any crop year, the policy will continue in force through the crop 
year and terminate at the end of the insurance period and any indemnity 
will be paid to the person or persons determined to be beneficially 
entitled to the indemnity. The premium will be deducted from the 
indemnity or collected from the estate. Death of a partner in a 
partnership will dissolve the partnership unless the partnership 
agreement provides otherwise. If two or more persons having a joint 
interest are insured jointly, death of one of the persons will dissolve 
the joint entity.
    (g) We may terminate your policy if no premium is earned for 3 
consecutive years.
    (h) The cancellation and termination dates are contained in the Crop 
Provisions.
    (i) When obtaining catastrophic, or additional coverage, you must 
provide information regarding crop insurance coverage on any crop 
previously obtained at any other local FSA office or from an approved 
insurance provider, including the date such insurance was obtained and 
the amount of the administrative fee.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) For each crop year, the production guarantee or amount of 
insurance, coverage level, and price at which an indemnity will be 
determined for each unit will be those used to calculate your summary of 
coverage. The information necessary to determine those factors will be 
contained in the Special Provisions or in the actuarial documents.
    (b) You may select only one coverage level from among those offered 
by us for each insured crop. You may change the coverage level, price 
election, or amount of insurance for the following crop year by giving 
written notice to us not later than the sales closing date for the 
insured crop. Since the price election or amount of insurance may change 
each year, if you do not select a new price election or amount of 
insurance on or before the sales closing date, we will assign a price 
election or amount of insurance which bears the same relationship to the 
price election schedule as the price election or amount of insurance 
that was in effect for the preceding year. (For example: If you selected 
100 percent of the market price for the previous crop year and you do 
not select a new price election for the current crop year, we will 
assign 100 percent of the market price for the current crop year.)
    (c) You must report production to us for the previous crop year by 
the earlier of the acreage reporting date or 45 days after the 
cancellation date unless otherwise stated in the Special Provisions:
    (1) If you do not provide the required production report, we will 
assign a yield for the previous crop year. The yield assigned by us will 
not be more than 75 percent of the yield used by us to determine your 
coverage for the previous crop year. The production report or assigned 
yield will be used to compute your approved yield for the purpose of 
determining your coverage for the current crop year.
    (2) If you have filed a claim for any crop year, the documents 
signed by you which state the amount of production used to complete the 
claim for indemnity will be the production report for that year unless 
otherwise specified by FCIC.
    (3) Production and acreage for the prior crop year must be reported 
for each proposed optional unit by the production reporting date. If you 
do not provide the information stated above, the optional units will be 
combined into the basic unit.
    (d) We may revise your production guarantee for any unit, and revise 
any indemnity paid based on that production guarantee, if we find that 
your production report under paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) Is not supported by written verifiable records in accordance 
with the definition of production report; or
    (2) Fails to accurately report actual production, acreage, or other 
material information.
    (e) In addition to the price election or amount of insurance 
available on the contract change date, we may provide an additional 
price election or amount of insurance no later than 15 days prior to the 
sales closing date. You must select the additional price election or 
amount of insurance on or before the sales closing date for the insured 
crop. These additional price elections or amounts of insurance will not 
be less than those available on the contract change date. If you elect 
the additional price election or amount of insurance any claim 
settlement and amount of premium will be based on this amount.

[[Page 101]]

    (f) You must obtain the same level of coverage (catastrophic risk 
protection, or additional) for all acreage of the crop in the county 
unless one of the following applies:
    (1) The applicable Crop Provisions allow you the option to 
separately insure individual crop types or varieties. In this case, each 
individual type or variety insured by you will be subject to separate 
administrative fees. For example, if two grape varieties in California 
are insured under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement and two 
varieties are insured under an additional coverage policy, a separate 
administrative fee will be charged for each of the four varieties. 
Although insurance may be elected by type or variety in these instances, 
failure to insure a type or variety that is of economic significance may 
result in the denial of other farm program benefits unless you execute a 
waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in 
connection with the crop.
    (2) If you have additional coverage for the crop in the county and 
the acreage has been designated as ``high risk'' by FCIC, you will be 
able to obtain a High Risk Land Exclusion Option for the high risk land 
under the additional coverage policy and insure the high risk acreage 
under a separate Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, provided that 
the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is obtained from the same 
insurance provider from which the additional coverage was obtained.
    (g) Hail and fire coverage may be excluded from the covered causes 
of loss for a crop policy only if additional coverage is selected.
    (h) Any person may sign any document relative to crop insurance 
coverage on behalf of any other person covered by such a policy, 
provided that the person has a properly executed power of attorney or 
such other legally sufficient document authorizing such person to sign.

                           4. Contract Changes

    (a) We may change the terms of your coverage under this policy from 
year to year.
    (b) Any changes in policy provisions, price elections, amounts of 
insurance, premium rates, and program dates will be provided by us to 
your crop insurance agent not later than the contract change date 
contained in the Crop Provisions, except that price elections may be 
offered after the contract change date in accordance with section 3. You 
may view the documents or request copies from your crop insurance agent.
    (c) You will be notified, in writing, of changes to the Basic 
Provisions, Crop Provisions, and Special Provisions not later than 30 
days prior to the cancellation date for the insured crop. Acceptance of 
changes will be conclusively presumed in the absence of notice from you 
to change or cancel your insurance coverage.

                            5. Liberalization

    If we adopt any revision that broadens the coverage under this 
policy subsequent to the contract change date without additional 
premium, the broadened coverage will apply.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    (a) An annual acreage report must be submitted to us on our form for 
each insured crop in the county on or before the acreage reporting date 
contained in the Special Provisions, except as follows:
    (1) If you insure multiple crops with us that have final planting 
dates on or after August 15 but before December 31, you must submit an 
acreage report for all such crops on or before the latest applicable 
acreage reporting date for such crops; and
    (2) If you insure multiple crops with us that have final planting 
dates on or after December 31 but before August 15, you must submit an 
acreage report for all such crops on or before the latest applicable 
acreage reporting date for such crops.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions in sections 6(a) (1) and (2):
    (i) If the Special Provisions designate separate planting periods 
for a crop, you must submit an acreage report for each planting period 
on or before the acreage reporting date contained in the Special 
Provisions for the planting period; and
    (ii) If planting of the insured crop continues after the final 
planting date or you are prevented from planting during the late 
planting period, the acreage reporting date will be the later of:
    (A) The acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions;
    (B) The date determined in accordance with sections (a)(1) or (2); 
or
    (C) Five (5) days after the end of the late planting period for the 
insured crop, if applicable.
    (b) If you do not have a share in an insured crop in the county for 
the crop year, you must submit an acreage report, on or before the 
acreage reporting date, so indicating.
    (c) Your acreage report must include the following information, if 
applicable:
    (1) All acreage of the crop in the county (insurable and not 
insurable) in which you have a share;
    (2) Your share at the time coverage begins;
    (3) The practice;
    (4) The type; and
    (5) The date the insured crop was planted.
    (d) Because incorrect reporting on the acreage report may have the 
effect of changing your premium and any indemnity that may be due, you 
may not revise this report after the acreage reporting date without our 
consent.
    (e) We may elect to determine all premiums and indemnities based on 
the information you submit on the acreage report or

[[Page 102]]

upon the factual circumstances we determine to have existed, subject to 
the provisions contained in section 6(g).
    (f) If you do not submit an acreage report by the acreage reporting 
date, or if you fail to report all units, we may elect to determine by 
unit the insurable crop acreage, share, type and practice, or to deny 
liability on such units. If we deny liability for the unreported units, 
your share of any production from the unreported units will be 
allocated, for loss purposes only, as production to count to the 
reported units in proportion to the liability on each reported unit. 
However, such production will not be allocated to prevented planting 
acreage or otherwise affect any prevented planting payment.
    (g) If the information reported by you on the acreage report for 
share, acreage, practice, type or other material information is 
inconsistent with the information that is determined to actually exist 
for a unit and results in:
    (1) A lower liability than the actual liability determined, the 
production guarantee or amount of insurance on the unit will be reduced 
to an amount that is consistent with the reported information. In the 
event that insurable acreage is under-reported for any unit, all 
production or value from insurable acreage in that unit will be 
considered production or value to count in determining the indemnity; 
and
    (2) A higher liability than the actual liability determined, the 
information contained in the acreage report will be revised to be 
consistent with the correct information. If we discover that you have 
incorrectly reported any information on the acreage report for any crop 
year, you may be required to provide documentation in subsequent crop 
years that substantiates your report of acreage for those crop years, 
including, but not limited to, an acreage measurement service at your 
own expense.
    (h) Errors in reporting units may be corrected by us at the time of 
adjusting a loss to reduce our liability and to conform to applicable 
unit division guidelines.

                7. Annual Premium and Administrative Fees

    (a) The annual premium is earned and payable at the time coverage 
begins. You will be billed for premium due not earlier than the premium 
billing date specified in the Special Provisions. The premium due, plus 
any accrued interest, will be considered delinquent if it is not paid on 
or before the termination date specified in the Crop Provisions.
    (b) Any amount you owe us related to any crop insured with us under 
the authority of the Act will be deducted from any prevented planting 
payment or indemnity due you for any crop insured with us under the 
authority of the Act.
    (c) The annual premium amount is determined, as applicable, by 
either:
    (1) Multiplying the production guarantee per acre times the price 
election, times the premium rate, times the insured acreage, times your 
share at the time coverage begins, and times any premium adjustment 
percentages that may apply; or
    (2) Multiplying the amount of insurance per acre times the premium 
rate, times the insured acreage, times your share at the time coverage 
begins, and times any premium adjustment percentages that may apply.
    (d) The premium will be computed using the price election or amount 
of insurance you elect or that we assign in accordance with section 
3(b).
    (e) In addition to the premium charged:
    (1) You, unless otherwise authorized in 7 CFR part 400, must pay an 
administrative fee each crop year of $30 per crop per county for all 
levels of coverage in excess of catastrophic risk protection.
    (2) The administrative fee must be paid no later than the time that 
premium is due.
    (3) Payment of an administrative fee will not be required if you 
file a bona fide zero acreage report on or before the acreage reporting 
date for the crop. If you falsely file a zero acreage report you may be 
subject to criminal and administrative sanctions.
    (4) The administrative fee will be waived if you request it and you 
qualify as a limited resource farmer.
    (5)-(6) [Reserved]
    (7) Failure to pay the administrative fees when due may make you 
ineligible for certain other USDA benefits.

                             8. Insured Crop

    (a) The insured crop will be that shown on your accepted application 
and as specified in the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions and must 
be grown on insurable acreage.
    (b) A crop which will NOT be insured will include, but will not be 
limited to, any crop:
    (1) If the farming practices carried out are not in accordance with 
the farming practices for which the premium rates, production guarantees 
or amounts of insurance have been established, unless insurance is 
allowed by a written agreement;
    (2) Of a type, class or variety established as not adapted to the 
area or excluded by the policy provisions;
    (3) That is a volunteer crop;
    (4) That is a second crop following the same crop (insured or not 
insured) harvested in the same crop year unless specifically permitted 
by the Crop Provisions or the Special Provisions;
    (5) That is planted for the development or production of hybrid seed 
or for experimental purposes, unless permitted by the Crop Provisions or 
by written agreement to insure such crop; or
    (6) That is used solely for wildlife protection or management. If 
the lease states that

[[Page 103]]

specific acreage must remain unharvested, only that acreage is 
uninsurable. If the lease specifies that a percentage of the crop must 
be left unharvested, your share will be reduced by such percentage.

                          9. Insurable Acreage

    (a) Acreage planted to the insured crop in which you have a share is 
insurable except acreage:
    (1) That has not been planted and harvested within one of the 3 
previous crop years, unless:
    (i) Such acreage was not planted:
    (A) To comply with any other USDA program;
    (B) Because of crop rotation, (e.g., corn, soybean, alfalfa; and the 
alfalfa remained for 4 years before the acreage was planted to corn 
again);
    (C) Due to an insurable cause of loss that prevented planting; or
    (D) Because a perennial tree, vine, or bush crop was grown on the 
acreage;
    (ii) Such acreage was planted but was not harvested due to an 
insurable cause of loss; or
    (iii) The Crop Provisions or a written agreement specifically allow 
insurance for such acreage;
    (2) That has been strip-mined, unless otherwise approved by written 
agreement, or unless an agricultural commodity other than a cover, hay, 
or forage crop (except corn silage), has been harvested from the acreage 
for at least five crop years after the strip-mined land was reclaimed;
    (3) On which the insured crop is damaged and it is practical to 
replant the insured crop, but the insured crop is not replanted;
    (4) That is interplanted, unless allowed by the Crop Provisions;
    (5) That is otherwise restricted by the Crop Provisions or Special 
Provisions; or
    (6) That is planted in any manner other than as specified in the 
policy provisions for the crop unless a written agreement to such 
planting exists.
    (b) If insurance is provided for an irrigated practice, you must 
report as irrigated only that acreage for which you have adequate 
facilities and adequate water, or the reasonable expectation of 
receiving adequate water at the time coverage begins, to carry out a 
good irrigation practice. If you knew or had reason to know that your 
water may be reduced before coverage begins, no reasonable expectation 
exists.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions in section 8(b)(1), if acreage is 
irrigated and we do not provide a premium rate for an irrigated 
practice, you may either report and insure the irrigated acreage as 
``non-irrigated,'' or report the irrigated acreage as not insured.
    (d) We may restrict the amount of acreage that we will insure to the 
amount allowed under any acreage limitation program established by the 
United States Department of Agriculture if we notify you of that 
restriction prior to the sales closing date.

                           10. Share Insured.

    (a) Insurance will attach only to the share of the person completing 
the application and will not extend to any other person having a share 
in the crop unless the application clearly states that:
    (1) The insurance is requested for an entity such as a partnership 
or a joint venture; or
    (2) You as landlord will insure your tenant's share, or you as 
tenant will insure your landlord's share. In this event, you must 
provide evidence of the other party's approval (lease, power of 
attorney, etc.). Such evidence will be retained by us. You also must 
clearly set forth the percentage shares of each person on the acreage 
report.
    (b) We may consider any acreage or interest reported by or for your 
spouse, child or any member of your household to be included in your 
share.
    (c) Acreage rented for a percentage of the crop, or a lease 
containing provisions for both a minimum payment (such as a specified 
amount of cash, bushels, pounds, etc.,) and a crop share will be 
considered a crop share lease.
    (d) Acreage rented for cash, or a lease containing provisions for 
either a minimum payment or a crop share (such as a 50/50 share or 
$100.00 per acre, whichever is greater) will be considered a cash lease.

                          11. Insurance Period

    (a) Except for prevented planting coverage (see section 17), 
coverage begins on each unit or part of a unit at the later of:
    (1) The date we accept your application (For the purposes of this 
paragraph, the date of acceptance is the date that you submit a properly 
executed application in accordance with section 2);
    (2) The date the insured crop is planted; or
    (3) The calendar date contained in the Crop Provisions for the 
beginning of the insurance period.
    (b) Coverage ends at the earliest of:
    (1) Total destruction of the insured crop on the unit;
    (2) Harvest of the unit;
    (3) Final adjustment of a loss on a unit;
    (4) The calendar date contained in the Crop Provisions for the end 
of the insurance period;
    (5) Abandonment of the crop on the unit; or
    (6) As otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions.

                           12. Causes of Loss.

    The insurance provided is against only unavoidable loss of 
production directly caused by specific causes of loss contained in the

[[Page 104]]

Crop Provisions. All other causes of loss, including but not limited to 
the following, are NOT covered:
    (a) Negligence, mismanagement, or wrongdoing by you, any member of 
your family or household, your tenants, or employees;
    (b) Failure to follow recognized good farming practices for the 
insured crop;
    (c) Water contained by any governmental, public, or private dam or 
reservoir project;
    (d) Failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities; or
    (e) Failure to carry out a good irrigation practice for the insured 
crop, if applicable.

                         13. Replanting Payment.

    (a) If allowed by the Crop Provisions, a replanting payment may be 
made on an insured crop replanted after we have given consent and the 
acreage replanted is at least the lesser of 20 acres or 20 percent of 
the insured planted acreage for the unit (as determined on the final 
planting date or within the late planting period if a late planting 
period is applicable).
    (b) No replanting payment will be made on acreage:
    (1) On which our appraisal establishes that production will exceed 
the level set by the Crop Provisions;
    (2) Initially planted prior to the earliest planting date 
established by the Special Provisions; or
    (3) On which one replanting payment has already been allowed for the 
crop year.
    (c) The replanting payment per acre will be your actual cost for 
replanting, but will not exceed the amount determined in accordance with 
the Crop Provisions.
    (d) No replanting payment will be paid if we determine it is not 
practical to replant.

                14. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

                              Your Duties--

    (a) In case of damage to any insured crop you must:
    (1) Protect the crop from further damage by providing sufficient 
care;
    (2) Give us notice within 72 hours of your initial discovery of 
damage (but not later than 15 days after the end of the insurance 
period), by unit, for each insured crop (we may accept a notice of loss 
provided later than 72 hours after your initial discovery if we still 
have the ability to accurately adjust the loss);
    (3) Leave representative samples intact for each field of the 
damaged unit as may be required by the Crop Provisions; and
    (4) Cooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the 
claim, and, as often as we reasonably require:
    (i) Show us the damaged crop;
    (ii) Allow us to remove samples of the insured crop; and
    (iii) Provide us with records and documents we request and permit us 
to make copies.
    (b) You must obtain consent from us before, and notify us after you:
    (1) Destroy any of the insured crop that is not harvested;
    (2) Put the insured crop to an alternative use;
    (3) Put the acreage to another use; or
    (4) Abandon any portion of the insured crop. We will not give 
consent for any of the actions in sections 14(b) (1) through (4) if it 
is practical to replant the crop or until we have made an appraisal of 
the potential production of the crop.
    (c) In addition to complying with all other notice requirements, you 
must submit a claim for indemnity declaring the amount of your loss not 
later than 60 days after the end of the insurance period. This claim 
must include all the information we require to settle the claim.
    (d) Upon our request, you must:
    (1) Provide a complete harvesting and marketing record of each 
insured crop by unit including separate records showing the same 
information for production from any acreage not insured; and
    (2) Submit to examination under oath.
    (e) You must establish the total production or value received for 
the insured crop on the unit, that any loss of production or value 
occurred during the insurance period, and that the loss of production or 
value was directly caused by one or more of the insured causes specified 
in the Crop Provisions.
    (f) All notices required in this section that must be received by us 
within 72 hours may be made by telephone or in person to your crop 
insurance agent but must be confirmed in writing within 15 days.

                              Our Duties--

    (a) If you have complied with all the policy provisions, we will pay 
your loss within 30 days after:
    (1) We reach agreement with you;
    (2) Completion of arbitration or appeal proceedings; or
    (3) The entry of a final judgment by a court of competent 
jurisdiction.
    (b) In the event we are unable to pay your loss within 30 days, we 
will give you notice of our intentions within the 30-day period.
    (c) We may defer the adjustment of a loss until the amount of loss 
can be accurately determined. We will not pay for additional damage 
resulting from your failure to provide sufficient care for the crop 
during the deferral period.
    (d) We recognize and apply the loss adjustment procedures 
established or approved by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.

[[Page 105]]

           15. Production Included in Determining Indemnities.

    (a) The total production to be counted for a unit will include all 
production determined in accordance with the policy.
    (b) The amount of production of any unharvested insured crop may be 
determined on the basis of our field appraisals conducted after the end 
of the insurance period.
    (c) If you elect to exclude hail and fire as insured causes of loss 
and the insured crop is damaged by hail or fire, appraisals will be made 
as described in the applicable Form FCI-78 ``Request To Exclude Hail and 
Fire'' or a form containing the same terms approved by the Federal Crop 
Insurance Corporation.
    (d) The amount of an indemnity that may be determined under the 
applicable provisions of your crop policy may be reduced by an amount, 
determined in accordance with the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, 
to reflect out-of-pocket expenses that were not incurred by you as a 
result of not planting, caring for, or harvesting the crop. Indemnities 
paid for acreage prevented from being planted will be based on a reduced 
guarantee as provided for in the crop policy and will not be further 
reduced to reflect expenses not incurred.
    (e) Appraised production will be used to calculate your claim if you 
will not be harvesting the acreage. To determine your indemnity based on 
appraised production, you must agree to notify us if you harvest the 
crop and advise us of the production. If the acreage will be harvested, 
harvested production will be used to determine any indemnity due, unless 
otherwise specified in the policy.

                            16. Late Planting

    Unless limited by the Crop Provisions, insurance will be provided 
for acreage planted to the insured crop after the final planting date in 
accordance with the following:
    (a) The production guarantee or amount of insurance for each acre 
planted to the insured crop during the late planting period will be 
reduced by 1 percent per day for each day planted after the final 
planting date.
    (b) Acreage planted after the late planting period (or after the 
final planting date for crops that do not have a late planting period) 
may be insured as follows:
    (1) The production guarantee or amount of insurance for each acre 
planted as specified in this subsection will be determined by 
multiplying the production guarantee or amount of insurance that is 
provided for acreage of the insured crop that is timely planted by the 
prevented planting coverage level percentage you elected, or that is 
contained in the Crop Provisions if you did not elect a prevented 
planting coverage level percentage;
    (2) Planting on such acreage must have been prevented by the final 
planting date (or during the late planting period, if applicable) by an 
insurable cause occurring within the insurance period for prevented 
planting coverage; and
    (3) All production from acreage as specified in this section will be 
included as production to count for the unit.
    (c) The premium amount for insurable acreage specified in this 
section will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the 
amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our 
subsidy) for such acreage exceeds the liability, coverage for those 
acres will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will 
be paid).
    (d) Any acreage on which an insured cause of loss is a material 
factor in preventing completion of planting, as specified in the 
definition of ``planted acreage'' (e.g., seed is broadcast on the soil 
surface but cannot be incorporated) will be considered as acreage 
planted after the final planting date and the production guarantee will 
be calculated in accordance with section 16(b)(1).

                         17. Prevented Planting

    (a) Unless limited by the policy provisions, a prevented planting 
payment may be made to you for eligible acreage if:
    (1) You were prevented from planting the insured crop by an insured 
cause that occurs:
    (i) On or after the sales closing date contained in the Special 
Provisions for the insured crop in the county for the crop year the 
application for insurance is accepted; or
    (ii) For any subsequent crop year, on or after the sales closing 
date for the previous crop year for the insured crop in the county, 
provided insurance has been in force continuously since that date. 
Cancellation for the purpose of transferring the policy to a different 
insurance provider for the subsequent crop year will not be considered a 
break in continuity for the purpose of the preceding sentence;
    (2) You include any acreage of the insured crop that was prevented 
from being planted on your acreage report; and
    (3) You did not plant the insured crop during or after the late 
planting period. If such acreage was planted to the insured crop during 
or after the late planting period, it is covered under the late planting 
provisions.
    (b) The actuarial documents may contain additional levels of 
prevented planting coverage that you may purchase for the insured crop:
    (1) Such purchase must be made on or before the sales closing date.
    (2) If you do not purchase one of those additional levels by the 
sales closing date, you will receive the prevented planting coverage 
specified in the Crop Provisions.

[[Page 106]]

    (3) If you have a Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for any 
crop, the additional levels of prevented planting coverage will not be 
available for that crop.
    (4) You may not increase your elected or assigned prevented planting 
coverage level for any crop year if a cause of loss that will or could 
prevent planting is evident prior to the time you wish to change your 
prevented planting coverage level.
    (c) The premium amount for acreage that is prevented from being 
planted will be the same as that for timely planted acreage. If the 
amount of premium you are required to pay (gross premium less our 
subsidy) for acreage that is prevented from being planted exceeds the 
liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres will not be provided 
(no premium will be due and no indemnity will be paid for such acreage).
    (d) Drought or failure of the irrigation water supply will be 
considered to be an insurable cause of loss for the purposes of 
prevented planting only if on the final planting date (or within the 
late planting period if you elect to try to plant the crop):
    (1) For non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being 
planted has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed and 
progress toward crop maturity due to a prolonged period of dry weather. 
Prolonged precipitation deficiencies must be verifiable using 
information collected by sources whose business it is to record and 
study the weather, including, but not limited to, local weather 
reporting stations of the National Weather Service; or
    (2) For irrigated acreage, there is not a reasonable probability of 
having adequate water to carry out an irrigated practice.
    (e) The maximum number of acres that may be eligible for a prevented 
planting payment for any crop will be determined as follows:
    (1) The total number of acres eligible for prevented planting 
coverage for all crops cannot exceed the number of acres of cropland in 
your farming operation for the crop year, unless you are eligible for 
prevented planting coverage on double cropped acreage in accordance with 
section 17(f) (4) or (5). The eligible acres for each insured crop will 
be determined in accordance with the following table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               additional land or    17(e)(1)(i)(A).
                               that acreage will
                               be released from
                               any USDA program

                               harvest of a crop.
                               Such acreage must

    (2) Any eligible acreage determined in accordance with the table 
contained in section 17(e)(1) will be reduced by subtracting the number 
of acres of the crop (insured and uninsured) that are timely and late 
planted, including acreage specified in section 16(b).
    (f) Regardless of the number of eligible acres determined in section 
17(e), prevented planting coverage will not be provided for any acreage:
    (1) That does not constitute at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the 
insurable crop acreage in the unit, whichever is less. Any prevented 
planting acreage within a field that contains planted acreage will be 
considered to be acreage of the same crop, type, and practice that is 
planted in the field unless the acreage that was prevented from being 
planted constitutes at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the total 
insurable acreage in the field and you produced both crops, crop types, 
or followed both practices in the same field in the same crop year 
within any of the 4 most recent crop years;
    (2) For which the actuarial documents do not designate a premium 
rate unless a written agreement designates such premium rate;
    (3) Used for conservation purposes or intended to be left unplanted 
under any program administered by the USDA;
    (4) On which the insured crop is prevented from being planted, if 
you or any other person receives a prevented planting payment for any 
crop for the same acreage in the same crop year (excluding share 
arrangements), unless you have coverage greater than the Catastrophic 
Risk Protection Plan of Insurance and have records of acreage and 
production that are used to determine your approved yield that show the 
acreage was double-cropped in each of the last 4 years in which the 
insured crop was grown on the acreage;
    (5) On which the insured crop is prevented from being planted, if 
any crop from which any benefit is derived under any program 
administered by the USDA is planted and fails, or if any crop is 
harvested, hayed or grazed on the same acreage in the same crop year 
(other than a cover crop which may be hayed or grazed after the final 
planting date for the insured crop), unless you have coverage greater 
than that applicable to the Catastrophic Risk Protection Plan of 
Insurance and have records of acreage and production that are used to 
determine your approved yield that show the acreage was double-cropped 
in each of the last 4 years in which the insured crop was grown on the 
acreage (If one of the crops being double-cropped is not insurable, 
other verifiable records of it being planted may be used);
    (6) Of a crop that is prevented from being planted if a cash lease 
payment is also received for use of the same acreage in the same crop 
year (not applicable if acreage is leased for haying or grazing only) 
(If you state that you will not be cash renting the acreage and claim a 
prevented planting payment on the acreage, you could be subject to civil 
and criminal sanctions if you cash rent the acreage and do not return 
the prevented planting payment for it);
    (7) For which planting history or conservation plans indicate that 
the acreage would have remained fallow for crop rotation purposes;
    (8) That exceeds the number of acres eligible for a prevented 
planting payment;
    (9) That exceeds the number of eligible acres physically available 
for planting;
    (10) For which you cannot provide proof that you had the inputs 
available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of at least 
producing the yield used to determine the production guarantee or amount 
of insurance (Evidence that you have previously planted the crop on the 
unit will be considered adequate proof unless your planting practices or 
rotational requirements show that the acreage would have remained fallow 
or been planted to another crop);
    (11) Based on an irrigated practice production guarantee or amount 
of insurance unless adequate irrigation facilities were in place to 
carry out an irrigated practice on the acreage prior to the insured 
cause of loss that prevented you from planting. Acreage with an 
irrigated practice production guarantee will be limited to the number of 
acres allowed for that practice under sections 17(e) and (f); or
    (12) Based on a crop type that you did not plant, or did not receive 
a prevented planting insurance guarantee for, in at least one of the 
four most recent crop years. Types for which separate price elections, 
amounts of insurance, or production guarantees are available must be 
included in your APH database in at least one of the four most recent 
crop years, or crops that do not require yield certification (crops for 
which the insurance guarantee is not based on APH) must be reported on 
your acreage report in at least one of the four most recent crop years 
except as allowed in section 17(e)(1)(i)(B). We will limit prevented 
planting payments based on a specific crop type to the number of acres 
allowed for that crop type as specified in sections 17(e) and (f).
    (g) If you purchased an additional coverage policy for a crop, and 
you executed a High Risk Land Exclusion Option that separately insures 
acreage which has been designated as ``high-risk'' land by FCIC under a 
Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement for that crop, the maximum 
number of acres eligible for a prevented planting payment will be 
limited for each policy as specified in sections 17(e) and (f).
    (h) If you are prevented from planting a crop for which you do not 
have an adequate base of eligible prevented planting acreage,

[[Page 108]]

as determined in accordance with section 17(e)(1), your prevented 
planting production guarantee or amount of insurance, premium, and 
prevented planting payment will be based on the crops insured for the 
current crop year, for which you have remaining eligible prevented 
planting acreage. The crops used for this purpose will be those that 
result in a prevented planting payment most similar to the prevented 
planting payment that would have been made for the crop that was 
prevented from being planted.
    (1) For example, assume you were prevented from planting 200 acres 
of corn and have 100 acres eligible for a corn prevented planting 
guarantee that would result in a payment of $40 per acre. You also had 
50 acres of potato eligibility that would result in a $100 per acre 
payment, 90 acres of grain sorghum eligibility that would result in a 
$30 per acre payment, and 100 acres of soybean eligibility that would 
result in a $25 per acre payment. Your prevented planting coverage for 
the 200 acres would be based on 100 acres of corn ($40 per acre), 90 
acres of grain sorghum ($30 per acre), and 10 acres of soybeans ($25 per 
acre).
    (2) Prevented planting coverage will be allowed as specified in this 
section (17(h)) only if the crop that was prevented from being planted 
meets all policy provisions, except for having an adequate base of 
eligible prevented planting acreage. Payment may be made based on crops 
other than those that were prevented from being planted even though 
other policy provisions, including but not limited to, processor 
contract and rotation requirements, have not been met for the crop on 
which payment is being based.
    (i) The prevented planting payment for any eligible acreage within a 
unit will be determined by:
    (1) Multiplying the liability per acre for timely planted acreage of 
the insured crop (the amount of insurance per acre or the production 
guarantee per acre multiplied by the price election for the crop, or 
type if applicable) by the prevented planting coverage level percentage 
you elected, or that is contained in the Crop Provisions if you did not 
elect a prevented planting coverage level percentage;
    (2) Multiplying the result of section 17(i)(1) by the number of 
eligible prevented planting acres in the unit; and
    (3) Multiplying the result of section 17(i)(2) by your share.

                         18. Written Agreements

    Terms of this policy which are specifically designated for the use 
of written agreements may be altered by written agreement in accordance 
with the following:
    (a) You must apply in writing for each written agreement no later 
than the sales closing date, except as provided in section 18(e);
    (b) The application for a written agreement must contain all 
variable terms of the contract between you and us that will be in effect 
if the written agreement is not approved;
    (c) If approved, the written agreement will include all variable 
terms of the contract, including, but not limited to, crop type or 
variety, the guarantee, premium rate, and price election;
    (d) Each written agreement will only be valid for one crop year (If 
a written agreement is not specifically renewed the following year, 
insurance coverage for subsequent crop years will be in accordance with 
the printed policy); and
    (e) An application for a written agreement submitted after the sales 
closing date may be approved if you demonstrate your physical inability 
to apply prior to the sales closing date, or it is submitted in 
accordance with any regulation which may be promulgated under 7 CFR part 
400, and after inspection of the acreage by us, if required, it is 
determined that no loss has occurred and the crop is insurable in 
accordance with the policy and written agreement provisions.

                          19. Crops as Payment

    You must not abandon any crop to us. We will not accept any crop as 
compensation for payments due us.

                            For FCIC policies

                               20. Appeals

    All determinations required by the policy will be made by us. If you 
disagree with our determinations, you may obtain reconsideration of or 
appeal those determinations in accordance with appeal provisions 
published at 7 CFR part 11.

                         For reinsured policies

                             20. Arbitration

    (a) If you and we fail to agree on any factual determination, the 
disagreement will be resolved in accordance with the rules of the 
American Arbitration Association. Failure to agree with any factual 
determination made by FCIC must be resolved through the FCIC appeal 
provisions published at 7 CFR part 11.
    (b) No award determined by arbitration or appeal can exceed the 
amount of liability established or which should have been established 
under the policy.

      21. Access to Insured Crop and Records, and Record Retention

    (a) We reserve the right to examine the insured crop as often as we 
reasonably require.
    (b) For three years after the end of the crop year, you must retain, 
and provide upon

[[Page 109]]

our request, complete records of the harvesting, storage, shipment, 
sale, or other disposition of all the insured crop produced on each 
unit. This requirement also applies to the records used to establish the 
basis for the production report for each unit. You must also provide 
upon our request, separate records showing the same information for 
production from any acreage not insured. We may extend the record 
retention period beyond three years by notifying you of such extension 
in writing. Your failure to keep and maintain such records will, at our 
option, result in:
    (1) Cancellation of the policy;
    (2) Assignment of production to the units by us;
    (3) Combination of the optional units; or
    (4) A determination that no indemnity is due.
    (c) Any person designated by us will, at any time during the record 
retention period, have access:
    (1) To any records relating to this insurance at any location where 
such records may be found or maintained; and
    (2) To the farm.
    (d) By applying for insurance under the authority of the Act or by 
continuing insurance for which you previously applied, you authorize us, 
or any person acting for us, to obtain records relating to the insured 
crop from any person who may have custody of those records including, 
but not limited to, FSA offices, banks, warehouses, gins, cooperatives, 
marketing associations, and accountants. You must assist us in obtaining 
all records which we request from third parties.

                           22. Other Insurance

    (a) Other Like Insurance. You must not obtain any other crop 
insurance issued under the authority of the Act on your share of the 
insured crop. If we determine that more than one policy on your share is 
intentional, you may be subject to the sanctions authorized under this 
policy, the Act, or any other applicable statute. If we determine that 
the violation was not intentional, the policy with the earliest date of 
application will be in force and all other policies will be void. 
Nothing in this paragraph prevents you from obtaining other insurance 
not issued under the Act.
    (b) Other Insurance Against Fire. If you have other insurance, 
whether valid or not, against damage to the insured crop by fire during 
the insurance period, and you have not excluded coverage for fire from 
this policy, we will be liable for loss due to fire only for the smaller 
of:
    (1) The amount of indemnity determined pursuant to this policy 
without regard to such other insurance; or
    (2) The amount by which the loss from fire is determined to exceed 
the indemnity paid or payable under such other insurance.
    (c) For the purpose of subsection (b) of this section the amount of 
loss from fire will be the difference between the fair market value of 
the production of the insured crop on the unit involved before the fire 
and after the fire, as determined from appraisals made by us.

                   23. Conformity to Food Security Act

    Although your violation of a number of federal statutes, including 
the Act, may cause cancellation, termination, or voidance of your 
insurance contract, you should be specifically aware that your policy 
will be canceled if you are determined to be ineligible to receive 
benefits under the Act due to violation of the controlled substance 
provisions (title XVII) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-
198) and the regulations promulgated under the Act by USDA. Your 
insurance policy will be canceled if you are determined, by the 
appropriate Agency, to be in violation of these provisions. We will 
recover any and all monies paid to you or received by you during your 
period of ineligibility, and your premium will be refunded, less a 
reasonable amount for expenses and handling not to exceed 20 percent of 
the premium paid or to be paid by you.

                            For FCIC policies

                           24. Amounts Due Us

    (a) Any amount illegally or erroneously paid to you or that is owed 
to us but is delinquent may be recovered by us through offset by 
deducting it from any loan or payment due you under any Act of Congress 
or program administered by any United States Government Agency, or by 
other collection action.
    (b) Interest will accrue at the rate of 1.25 percent simple interest 
per calendar month, or any part thereof, on any unpaid premium amount 
due us. With respect to any premiums owed, interest will start to accrue 
on the first day of the month following the premium billing date 
specified in the Special Provisions.
    (c) For the purpose of any other amounts due us, such as repayment 
of indemnities found not to have been earned:
    (1) Interest will start on the date that notice is issued to you for 
the collection of the unearned amount;
    (2) Amounts found due under this paragraph will not be charged 
interest if payment is made within 30 days of issuance of the notice by 
us;
    (3) The amount will be considered delinquent if not paid within 30 
days of the date the notice is issued by us;

[[Page 110]]

    (4) Penalties and interest will be charged in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR part 102; and
    (5) The penalty for accounts more than 90 days delinquent is an 
additional 6 percent per annum.
    (d) Interest on any amount due us found to have been received by you 
because of fraud, misrepresentation or presentation by you of a false 
claim will start on the date you received the amount with the additional 
6 percent penalty beginning on the 31st day after the notice of amount 
due is issued to you. This interest is in addition to any other amount 
found to be due under any other federal criminal or civil statute.
    If we determine that it is necessary to contract with a collection 
agency, refer the debt to government collection centers, the Department 
of Treasury Offset Program, or to employ an attorney to assist in 
collection, you agree to pay all the expenses of collection.
    (f) All amounts paid will be applied first to expenses of collection 
if any, second to the reduction of any penalties which may have been 
assessed, then to reduction of accrued interest, and finally to 
reduction of the principal balance.

                         For reinsured policies

                           24. Amounts Due Us

    (a) Interest will accrue at the rate of 1.25 percent simple interest 
per calendar month, or any portion thereof, on any unpaid amount due us. 
For the purpose of premium amounts due us, the interest will start to 
accrue on the first day of the month following the premium billing date 
specified in the Special Provisions.
    (b) For the purpose of any other amounts due us, such as repayment 
of indemnities found not to have been earned, interest will start to 
accrue on the date that notice is issued to you for the collection of 
the unearned amount. Amounts found due under this paragraph will not be 
charged interest if payment is made within 30 days of issuance of the 
notice by us. The amount will be considered delinquent if not paid 
within 30 days of the date the notice is issued by us.
    (c) All amounts paid will be applied first to expenses of collection 
(see subsection (d) of this section) if any, second to the reduction of 
accrued interest, and then to the reduction of the principal balance.
    (d) If we determine that it is necessary to contract with a 
collection agency or to employ an attorney to assist in collection, you 
agree to pay all of the expenses of collection.
    (e) Amounts owed to us by you may be collected in part through 
administrative offset from payments you receive from United States 
government agencies in accordance with 31 U.S.C. chapter 37.

                       25. Legal Action Against Us

    (a) You may not bring legal action against us unless you have 
complied with all of the policy provisions.
    (b) If you do take legal action against us, you must do so within 12 
months of the date of denial of the claim. Suit must be brought in 
accordance with the provisions of 7 U.S.C. 1508(j).
    (c) Your right to recover damages (compensatory, punitive, or 
other), attorney's fees, or other charges is limited or excluded by this 
contract or by Federal Regulations.

                  26. Payment and Interest Limitations

    (a) Under no circumstances will we be liable for the payment of 
damages (compensatory, punitive, or other), attorney's fees, or other 
charges in connection with any claim for indemnity, whether we approve 
or disapprove such claim.
    (b) We will pay simple interest computed on the net indemnity 
ultimately found to be due by us or by a final judgment of a court of 
competent jurisdiction, from and including the 61st day after the date 
you sign, date, and submit to us the properly completed claim on our 
form. Interest will be paid only if the reason for our failure to timely 
pay is NOT due to your failure to provide information or other material 
necessary for the computation or payment of the indemnity. The interest 
rate will be that established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 
section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) and 
published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and 
July 1 of each year, and may vary with each publication.

               27. Concealment, Misrepresentation or Fraud

    (a) If you have falsely or fraudulently concealed the fact that you 
are ineligible to receive benefits under the Act or if you or anyone 
assisting you has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material 
fact relating to this policy:
    (1) This policy will be voided; and
    (2) You may be subject to remedial sanctions in accordance with 7 
CFR part 400, subpart R.
    (b) Even though the policy is void, you may still be required to pay 
20 percent of the premium due under the policy to offset costs incurred 
by us in the service of this policy. If previously paid, the balance of 
the premium will be returned.
    (c) Voidance of this policy will result in you having to reimburse 
all indemnities paid for the crop year in which the voidance was 
effective.
    (d) Voidance will be effective on the first day of the insurance 
period for the crop year in which the act occurred and will not affect 
the policy for subsequent crop years unless a

[[Page 111]]

violation of this section also occurred in such crop years.

             28. Transfer of Coverage and Right to Indemnity

    If you transfer any part of your share during the crop year, you may 
transfer your coverage rights, if the transferee is eligible for crop 
insurance. We will not be liable for any more than the liability 
determined in accordance with your policy that existed before the 
transfer occurred. The transfer of coverage rights must be on our form 
and will not be effective until approved by us in writing. Both you and 
the transferee are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the 
premium and administrative fees. The transferee has all rights and 
responsibilities under this policy consistent with the transferee's 
interest.

                       29. Assignment of Indemnity

    You may assign to another party your right to an indemnity for the 
crop year. The assignment must be on our form and will not be effective 
until approved in writing by us. The assignee will have the right to 
submit all loss notices and forms as required by the policy. If you have 
suffered a loss from an insurable cause and fail to file a claim for 
indemnity within 60 days after the end of the insurance period, the 
assignee may submit the claim for indemnity not later than 15 days after 
the 60-day period has expired. We will honor the terms of the assignment 
only if we can accurately determine the amount of the claim. However, no 
action will lie against us for failure to do so.

          30. Subrogation (Recovery of Loss From a Third Party)

    Since you may be able to recover all or a part of your loss from 
someone other than us, you must do all you can to preserve this right. 
If we pay you for your loss, your right to recovery will, at our option, 
belong to us. If we recover more than we paid you plus our expenses, the 
excess will be paid to you.

              31. Applicability of State and Local Statutes

    If the provisions of this policy conflict with statutes of the State 
or locality in which this policy is issued, the policy provisions will 
prevail. State and local laws and regulations in conflict with federal 
statutes, this policy, and the applicable regulations do not apply to 
this policy.

                        32. Descriptive Headings

    The descriptive headings of the various policy provisions are 
formulated for convenience only and are not intended to affect the 
construction or meaning of any of the policy provisions.

                               33. Notices

    (a) All notices required to be given by you must be in writing and 
received by your crop insurance agent within the designated time unless 
otherwise provided by the notice requirement. Notices required to be 
given immediately may be by telephone or in person and confirmed in 
writing. Time of the notice will be determined by the time of our 
receipt of the written notice. If the date by which you are required to 
submit a report or notice falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal 
holiday, or if your agent's office is, for any reason, not open for 
business on the date you are required to submit such notice or report, 
such notice or report must be submitted on the next business day.
    (b) All notices and communications required to be sent by us to you 
will be mailed to the address contained in your records located with 
your crop insurance agent. Notice sent to such address will be 
conclusively presumed to have been received by you. You should advise us 
immediately of any change of address.

                            34. Unit Division

    (a) You may elect an enterprise unit or a whole farm unit if the 
Special Provisions allow such unit structure, subject to the following:
    (1) You must make such election on or before the earliest sales 
closing date for the insured crops and report such unit structure to us 
in writing. Your unit selection will remain in effect from year to year 
unless you notify us in writing by the earliest sales closing date for 
the crop year for which you wish to change this election. These units 
may not be further divided except as specified herein;
    (2) For enterprise units:
    (i) You must report the acreage for each optional or basic unit on 
your acreage report that comprises the enterprise unit;
    (ii) These basic units or optional units that comprise the 
enterprise unit must each have insurable acreage of the same crop in the 
crop year insured;
    (iii) You must comply with all reporting requirements for the 
enterprise unit (You must maintain any required production records on a 
basic or optional unit basis if you wish to change your unit structure 
for any subsequent crop year);
    (iv) The qualifying basic units or optional units may not be 
combined into an enterprise unit on any basis other than as described 
herein;
    (v) If you do not comply with the reporting provisions for the 
enterprise unit, your yield for the enterprise unit will be determined 
in accordance with section 3(c)(1); and
    (vi) If you do not qualify for an enterprise unit when the acreage 
is reported, we will assign the basic unit structure.

[[Page 112]]

    (3) For a whole farm unit:
    (i) You must report on your acreage report the acreage for each 
optional or basic unit for each crop produced in the county that 
comprises the whole farm unit; and
    (ii) Although you may insure all of your crops under a whole farm 
unit, you will be required to pay separate applicable administrative 
fees for each crop included in the whole farm unit.
    (b) Unless limited by the Crop Provisions or Special Provisions, a 
basic unit as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions may be 
divided into optional units if, for each optional unit, you meet the 
following:
    (1) You must plant the crop in a manner that results in a clear and 
discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each 
optional unit;
    (2) All optional units you select for the crop year are identified 
on the acreage report for that crop year (Units will be determined when 
the acreage is reported but may be adjusted or combined to reflect the 
actual unit structure when adjusting a loss. No further unit division 
may be made after the acreage reporting date for any reason);
    (3) You have records, that are acceptable to us, of planted acreage 
and the production from each optional unit for at least the last crop 
year used to determine your production guarantee;
    (4) You have records of marketed or stored production from each 
optional unit maintained in such a manner that permits us to verify the 
production from each optional unit, or the production from each optional 
unit is kept separate until loss adjustment is completed by us; and
    (c) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following, 
unless otherwise specified in the Crop Provisions or allowed by written 
agreement:
    (1) Optional units may be established if each optional unit is 
located in a separate section. In the absence of sections, we may 
consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure 
such as Spanish grants, as the equivalents of sections for unit 
purposes. In areas which have not been surveyed using sections, section 
equivalents or in areas where boundaries are not readily discernible, 
each optional unit must be located in a separate FSA farm serial number; 
and
    (2) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by 
section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number, optional units 
may be based on irrigated and non-irrigated acreage. To qualify as 
separate irrigated and non-irrigated optional units, the non-irrigated 
acreage may not continue into the irrigated acreage in the same rows or 
planting pattern. The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point 
at which the irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water needed 
to produce the yield on which the guarantee is based, except the corners 
of a field in which a center-pivot irrigation system is used may be 
considered as irrigated acreage if the corners of a field in which a 
center-pivot irrigation system is used do not qualify as a separate non-
irrigated optional unit. In this case, production from both practices 
will be used to determine your approved yield.
    (d) Optional units are not available for crops insured under a 
Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.
    (e) If you do not comply fully with the provisions in this section, 
we will combine all optional units that are not in compliance with these 
provisions into the basic unit from which they were formed. We will 
combine the optional units at any time we discover that you have failed 
to comply with these provisions. If failure to comply with these 
provisions is determined by us to be inadvertent, and the optional units 
are combined into a basic unit, that portion of the additional premium 
paid for the optional units that have been combined will be refunded to 
you for the units combined.
    35. Multiple Benefits
    (a) If you are eligible to receive an indemnity under anadditional 
coverage plan of insurance and are also eligible to receive benefits for 
the same loss under any other USDA program, you may receive benefits 
under both programs, unless specifically limited by the crop insurance 
contract or by law.
    (b) The total amount received from all such sources may not exceed 
the amount of your actual loss. The total amount of the actual loss is 
the difference between the fair market value of the insured commodity 
before and after the loss, based on your production records and the 
highest price election or amount of insurance available for the crop.
    (c) FSA will determine and pay the additional amount due you for any 
applicable USDA program after first considering the amount of any crop 
insurance indemnity.
    36. Substitution of Yields.
    You may elect to exclude actual yields used to calculate the APH 
yield that are less than 60 percent of the applicable transitional yield 
(T-yield), as defined in 7 CFR 400.52. Each excluded actual yield will 
be replaced with a yield equal to 60 percent of the applicable T-yield 
for the county. The replacement yields will be used in the same manner 
as actual yields for the purpose of calculating the APH yield. Premium 
rates for approved yields that are adjusted under this section will be 
based on the producer's yield prior to replacing the actual yields or 
such other

[[Page 113]]

basis as determined appropriate by FCIC.

    Notwithstanding the cancellation date stated in the policy, if there 
are insufficient funds appropriated by the Congress to deliver the crop 
insurance program, the policy will automatically terminate without 
liability.

[59 FR 45972, Sept. 6, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 457.10-457.100  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 457.101  Small grains crop insurance.

    The small grains crop insurance provisions for the 2003 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                      Small Grains Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Adequate stand--A population of live plants per unit of acreage 
which will produce at least the yield used to establish your production 
guarantee.
    Harvest--Combining or threshing the insured crop for grain or 
cutting for hay or silage on any acreage. A crop which is swathed prior 
to combining is not considered harvested.
    Initially planted--The first occurrence of planting the insured crop 
on insurable acreage for the crop year.
    Latest final planting date--
    (1) The final planting date for spring-planted acreage in all 
counties for which the Special Provisions designate a final planting 
date for spring-planted acreage only;
    (2) The final planting date for fall-planted acreage in all counties 
for which the Special Provisions designate a final planting date for 
fall-planted acreage only; or
    (3) The final planting date for spring-planted acreage in all 
counties for which the Special Provisions designate final planting dates 
for both spring-planted and fall-planted acreage.
    Local market price--The cash grain price per bushel for the U.S. No. 
2 grade of the insured crop offered by buyers in the area in which you 
normally market the insured crop. The local market price will reflect 
the maximum limits of quality deficiencies allowable for the U.S. No. 2 
grade of the insured crop. Factors not associated with grading under the 
Official United States Standards for Grain, including but not limited to 
protein, oil or moisture content, or milling quality will not be 
considered.
    Nurse crop (companion crop)--A crop planted into the same acreage as 
another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and which is 
planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is 
grown.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, except for flax, land on which seed is initially 
spread onto the soil surface by any method and subsequently is 
mechanically incorporated into the soil in a timely manner and at the 
proper depth will be considered planted. Flax seed must initially be 
planted in rows to be considered planted, unless otherwise provided by 
the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
    Prevented planting--In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic 
Provisions, failure to plant the insured crop with proper equipment by 
the latest final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for 
the insured crop in the county or by the end of the late planting 
period. You must have been prevented from planting the insured crop due 
to an insured cause of loss that also prevented most producers from 
planting on acreage with similar characteristics in the surrounding 
area.
    Sales closing date--In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic 
Provisions, a date contained in the Special Provisions by which an 
application must be filed and by which you may change your crop 
insurance coverage for a crop year. If the Special Provisions provide a 
sales closing date for both winter and spring types of the insured crop 
and you plant any insurable acreage of the winter type, you may not 
change your crop insurance coverage after the sales closing date for the 
winter type.
    Small grains-- Wheat, barley, oats, rye, and flax.
    Swathed-- Severance of the stem and grain head from the ground 
without removal of the seed from the head and placing into a windrow.

                            2. Unit Division

    In addition to the requirements of section 34(b) of the Basic 
Provisions, for wheat only, in addition to, or instead of, establishing 
optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number 
and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices, optional units may

[[Page 114]]

be established if each optional unit contains only initially planted 
winter wheat or only initially planted spring wheat. Optional units may 
be established in this manner only in counties having both winter and 
spring type final planting dates as designated in the Special 
Provisions.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements under section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) you may select only one price election 
for each crop insured under this policy in the county.

                           4. Contract Changes

    The contract change date is December 31 preceding the cancellation 
date for counties with an April 15 cancellation date and June 30 
preceding the cancellation date for all other counties (see the 
provisions under section 4. (Contract changes) in the Basic Provisions 
Sec. 457.8).

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             6. Insured Crop

    (a) The crop insured will be each small grain you elect to insure, 
that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which premium 
rates are provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That is planted for harvest as grain (a grain mixture in which 
barley or oats is the predominate grain may also be insured if allowed 
by the Barley or Oat Special Provisions, or if we agree in writing to 
insure such mixture. The crop insured will be the grain which is 
predominate in the mixture. The production from such mixture will be 
considered as the predominate grain on a weight basis);
    (3) That is not:
    (i) Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in paragraph 
6.(a)(2);
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or
    (iii) Planted as a nurse crop, unless planted as a nurse crop for 
new forage seeding, but only if seeded at a normal rate and intended for 
harvest as grain.
    (4) We may agree, in writing, to insure a crop prohibited under 
paragraph 6.(a)(3) if you so request. Your request to insure such crop 
must be in writing, and submitted to your agent not later than 15 days 
after the acreage reporting date.
    (b) If you anticipate destroying any acreage prior to harvest you:
    (1) May report all planted acreage when you report your acreage for 
the crop year and specify any acreage to be destroyed as uninsurable 
acreage. (By doing so, no coverage will be considered to have attached 
on the specified acreage and no premium will be due for such acreage. If 
you do not destroy such acreage, you will be subject to the under-
reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions); or
    (2) If the actuarial documents provide a reduced premium rate for 
acreage destroyed by a date designated in the Special Provisions, you 
may report all planted acreage as insurable when you report your acreage 
for the crop year. Premium will be due on all the acreage. Your premium 
amount will be reduced by the amount shown on the Actuarial Documents 
for any acreage you destroy prior to a date designated in the Special 
Provisions if you do not claim an indemnity on such acreage. In 
accordance with subsection 14.(b) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
you must obtain our consent before and give us notice after you destroy 
any of the insured crop so your acreage report can be revised to make 
you eligible for this reduction in premium.
    (c) In counties for which the Wheat Special Provisions designate 
both fall and spring final planting dates, you may elect a winter 
coverage endorsement for wheat. This endorsement provides two options 
for alternative coverage for wheat that is damaged between the fall 
final planting date and the spring final planting date. Coverage under 
the endorsement will be effective only if you designate the coverage 
option you elect by executing the endorsement by the sales closing date 
for winter wheat in the county.

                           7. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the requirements under section 11 (Insurance Period) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), and subject to any provisions 
provided by the Wheat crop insurance winter coverage endorsement 
(Sec. 457.102) if you have elected such endorsement, the insurance 
period is as follows:
    (a) Insurance attaches on each unit or part thereof on the later of 
the date we accept your application or the date the insured crop is 
planted.

[[Page 116]]

    (1) For oats, rye and flax, the following limitations apply:
    (i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date 
designated in the Special Provisions for the insured crop except as 
allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the 
Basic Provisions.
    (ii) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that producers in the surrounding area 
would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that it is not practical to replant.
    (2) For barley and wheat, the following limitations apply:
    (i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date 
designated in the Special Provisions for the type (winter or spring) 
except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 
of the Basic Provisions.
    (ii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a fall final 
planting date, any acreage of winter barley or wheat damaged before such 
final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would 
normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter 
type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not 
practical.
    (iii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both fall and spring 
final planting dates, winter barley or wheat planted on or before the 
final planting date which is damaged:
    (A) Before the fall planting final planting date, to the extent that 
growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must 
be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that 
replanting is not practical.
    (B) On or after the fall final planting date, but before the spring 
final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would 
normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to an 
appropriate variety of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting 
is not practical.
    If you have elected coverage under one of the available wheat winter 
coverage options available in the county, the insurance period for wheat 
will be in accordance with the selected options.
    (iv) Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring final 
planting date, any acreage of spring barley or wheat damaged before such 
final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would 
normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring 
type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not 
practical.
    (v) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final 
planting date, any acreage of fall planted barley or wheat is not 
insured unless you request such coverage and we agree in writing that 
the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield 
used to determine your production guarantee. Insurance will then attach 
to acreage having an adequate stand on the earlier of the spring final 
planting date or the date we agree to accept the acreage for insurance. 
If such fall planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on 
the acreage report as an uninsured fall planted crop.
    (b) Insurance ends on each unit at the earliest of:
    (1) Total destruction of the insured crop on the unit;
    (2) Harvest of the unit;
    (3) Final adjustment of a loss on the unit;
    (4) September 25 following planting in Alaska, or October 31 of the 
calendar year in which the crop is normally harvested in all other 
states; or
    (5) Abandonment of the crop on the unit.

                            8. Causes of Loss

    In addition to the provisions under section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions, any loss covered by this policy must occur within 
the insurance period.
    The specific causes of loss for small grains are:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or 
improper application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or 
improper application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply.

                         9. Replanting Payments

    (a) A replant payment for wheat only is allowed as follows:
    (1) You comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments 
contained under section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic Provisions 
and in any winter coverage endorsement for which you are eligible and 
which you have elected;
    (2) The wheat must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the 
extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of 
the production guarantee for the acreage;
    (3) The acreage must have been initially planted to spring wheat in 
those counties with only a spring final planting date;
    (4) The damage must occur after the fall final planting date in 
those counties where both a fall and spring final planting date are 
designated;
    (5) Replanting must take place not later than 25 days after the 
spring final planting date; and
    (6) The replant wheat must be seeded at a rate that is normal for 
initially planted

[[Page 117]]

wheat (if new seed is planted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially 
damaged stand of wheat, the acreage will not be eligible for a 
replanting payment).
    (b) No replanting payment will be made for acreage initially planted 
to winter wheat in any county for which the Special Provisions contain 
only a fall final planting date.
    (c) In accordance with subsection 13.(c) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will 
be the lesser of 20 percent (20%) of the production guarantee or 3 
bushels, multiplied by your price election multiplied by your share.
    (d) When wheat is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for 
an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the 
amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be 
reduced.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), if you initially discover damage to any insured crop 
within 15 days of, or during harvest, you must leave representative 
samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be 
at least 10 feet wide and the entire length of each field in the unit, 
and must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our 
inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is 
completed.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us 
for any:
    (1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which 
acceptable records of production were not provided; or for any
    (2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such 
units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each 
unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
    (2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
    (3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
    (4) Multiplying this result by your share.
    (c) The total production (bushels) to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) Which is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
subsection 11.(d));
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to 
another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care for, if you and we 
agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the 
insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to 
another use or abandon the crop. If:
    (A) Agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached, 
you may elect to continue to care for the crop, or we will give you 
consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, 
and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in 
locations acceptable to us. The amount of production to count for such 
acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the 
samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave 
the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for 
the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the 
acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count.
    (B) You elect to continue to care for the crop, we will determine 
the amount of production to count for the acreage using the harvested 
production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop 
is not harvested.
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Mature wheat, barley, oat, and rye production may be adjusted 
for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. Flax production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies only.
    (1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each .1 percentage 
point of moisture in excess of:
    (i) 13.5 percent for wheat;
    (ii) 14.5 percent for barley;
    (iii) 14.0 percent for oats;
    (iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, 
which may be determined by our loss adjustor), the samples are analyzed 
by:
    (A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or

[[Page 118]]

    (C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed 
by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture 
content.
    (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United 
States Standards for Grain, result in:
    (A) Wheat not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades 
U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight, total damaged kernels 
(excluding heat damage), shrunken or broken kernels, or defects 
(excluding foreign material and heat damage), or grading garlicky, light 
smutty, smutty or ergoty;
    (B) Barley not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades 
U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight, percentage of sound barley, 
damaged kernels, thin barley, or black barley, or grading smutty, 
garlicky, or ergoty;
    (C) Oats not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grade 
U.S. sample grade) because of test weight or percentage of sound oats, 
or grading smutty, garlicky, or ergoty;
    (D) Rye not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 3 (grades 
U.S. No. 4 or worse) because of test weight, percent damaged kernels or 
thin rye, or grading smutty, garlicky, or ergoty;
    (E) Flaxseed not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 2 
(grades U.S. sample grade) due to damaged kernels; or
    (ii) Substances or conditions are present, including mycotoxins, 
that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public 
health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or 
animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop 
provisions;
    (ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net 
price for the damaged grain that is less than the local market price of 
U.S. No. 2 production;
    (iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us; and
    (iv) The samples are analyzed by a grain grader licensed under the 
authority of the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States 
Warehouse Act with regard to deficiencies in quality, or by a laboratory 
approved by us with regard to substances or conditions injurious to 
human or animal health. Test weight for quality adjustment purposes may 
be determined by one loss adjustor.
    (4) Production of small grains that is eligible for quality 
adjustment, as specified in paragraphs 11.(d) (2) and (3), will be 
reduced as follows:
    (i) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the 
local market price will be the prices on the earlier of the date such 
quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for 
the unit. The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the 
market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used 
to establish the net price of the damaged production will be limited to 
those which are usual, customary, and reasonable. Any reduction in price 
due to the following factors will not be accepted:
    (A) Moisture content;
    (B) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
    (C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with 
normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the grain; except, if the 
price of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may 
reduce the price of the production after it has been conditioned by the 
cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production 
before conditioning. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. 
If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local 
market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required 
to deliver the production to those buyers.
    (ii) The value of the damaged or conditioned production will be 
divided by the local market price to determine the quality adjustment 
factor.
    (iii) The number of bushels remaining after any reduction due to 
excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross bushels (if 
appropriate)) of the damaged or conditioned production will then be 
multiplied by the quality adjustment factor to determine the net 
production to count.
    (e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop 
may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

                            12. Late Planting

    A late planting period is not applicable to fall-planted wheat. Any 
winter wheat that is planted after the fall final planting date in 
counties for which the Special Provisions also contain a final planting 
date for spring wheat will not be insured. Any winter wheat that is 
planted after the fall final planting date in counties for which the 
Special Provisions contain only a fall final planting date

[[Page 119]]

will not be insured unless you were prevented from planting the winter 
wheat by the fall final planting date. Such acreage will be insurable, 
and the production guarantee and premium for the acreage will be 
determined in accordance with sections 16 (b) and (c) of the Basic 
Provisions.

                         13. Prevented Planting

    (a) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the 
Basic Provisions, in counties for which the Special Provisions designate 
a spring final planting date, your prevented planting production 
guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted 
acreage of the insured crop.
    (b) Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

Sec. 457.102  Wheat crop insurance winter coverage endorsement.

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

            Wheat Crop Insurance Winter Coverage Endorsement

                   (This is a Continuous Endorsement)

    (a) In return for payment of the additional premium designated in 
the Actuarial Table, this endorsement is attached to and made part of 
your Small Grains Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions 
described herein.
    (b) This endorsement is available only in counties for which the 
Special Provisions designate both a fall final planting date and a 
spring final planting date.
    (c) This endorsement modifies the provisions of sections 7 and 11 of 
the Small Grains Crop Insurance policy (Sec. 457.101).
    (1) You must have a Small Grains Crop Insurance policy in force and 
elect to insure wheat under that policy.
    (2) You may select either Option A or Option B. Failure to select 
either Option A or Option B means that you have rejected both Options 
and this endorsement would be void.
    (3) Insurance Period. Coverage under this endorsement begins on the 
later of the date we accept your application for coverage or on the fall 
final planting date designated in the Special Provisions. Coverage ends 
on the spring final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.
    (4) The provisions under section 14 of the Common Crop Insurance 
Policy (Sec. 457.8) are amended to require that all notices of damage 
must be provided to us by the spring final planting date designated in 
the Special Provisions.

           Option A (30 Percent Coverage and Acreage Release)

    Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period 
(see section 3, above), and at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the 
acreage in the unit, whichever is less, does not have an adequate stand 
to produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the 
acreage, you may take any one of the following actions:
    (a) Destroy the remaining crop on such acreage. By doing so, you 
agree to accept an amount of production to count against the unit 
production guarantee equal to 70 percent of the production guarantee for 
the damaged acreage, or an appraisal determined in accordance with 
paragraph 11.(c)(1) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions 
(Sec. 457.101) if such an appraisal results in a greater amount of 
production. This amount will be considered production to count in 
determining any final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle 
your claim as described in the provisions under section 11. (Settlement 
of Claim) of the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (Sec. 457.101). 
You may use such acreage for any purpose, including planting and 
separately insuring any other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage 
for the production of spring wheat, you must:
    (1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and 
discernible break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and 
any remaining winter wheat; and
    (2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner 
which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat production 
separately from any winter wheat production.
    In the event you are unable to provide records of production that 
are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will be considered to be 
a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the 
spring wheat acreage as a separate optional unit, any premium amount for 
such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us.
    (b) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage 
will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy 
(Sec. 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (Sec. 457.101), 
and this Option.
    (c) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is 
practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms 
of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions

[[Page 120]]

(Sec. 457.101). By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of 
the Common Crop Insurance Policy (Sec. 457.8), the Small Grains Crop 
Insurance Provisions (Sec. 457.101), and this Option, and the production 
guarantee for winter wheat will remain in effect.

               Option B (With Full Winter Damage Coverage)

    Whenever any winter wheat is damaged during the insurance period and 
at least 20 acres or 20 percent of the acreage in the unit, whichever is 
less, does not have an adequate stand to produce at least 90 percent of 
the production guarantee for the acreage, you may, at your option, take 
one of the following actions:
    (a) Continue to care for the damaged crop. By doing so, coverage 
will continue under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy 
(Sec. 457.8), the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (Sec. 457.101), 
and this Option.
    (b) Replant the acreage to an appropriate variety of wheat, if it is 
practical, and receive a replanting payment in accordance with the terms 
of section 9. (Replanting Payments) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions 
(Sec. 457.101). By doing so, coverage will continue under the terms of 
the Common Crop Insurance Policy (Sec. 457.8), the Small Grains Crop 
Insurance Provisions (Sec. 457.101), and this Option, and the production 
guarantee for winter wheat will remain in effect.
    (c) Accept our appraisal of the crop on the damaged acreage as 
production to count against the production guarantee for the damaged 
acreage, destroy the remaining crop on such acreage, and be eligible for 
any indemnity due under the terms of the Common Crop Insurance Policy 
(Sec. 457.8) and the Small Grains Crop Provisions (Sec. 457.101). The 
appraisal will be considered production to count in determining any 
final indemnity on the unit and will be used to settle your claim as 
described in the provisions of section 11. (Settlement of Claim) of the 
Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (Sec. 457.101). You may use such 
acreage for any purpose, including planting and separately insuring any 
other crop. If you elect to utilize such acreage for the production of 
spring wheat, you must:
    (1) Plant the spring wheat in a manner which results in a clear and 
discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundary between it and 
any remaining winter wheat; and
    (2) Store or market the production from such acreage in a manner 
which permits us to verify the amount of spring wheat production 
separately from any winter wheat production.
    In the event you are unable to provide records of production that 
are acceptable to us, the spring wheat acreage will be considered to be 
a part of the original winter wheat unit. If you elected to insure the 
spring wheat acreage as a separate optional unit, any premium amount for 
such acreage will be considered earned and payable to us.

skip-row cotton acreage will not be used if the land between the rows of 
cotton is planted to any other spring planted crop.
    Production guarantee--The number of pounds determined by multiplying 
the approved yield per acre by any applicable yield conversion factor 
for non-irrigated skip-row planting patterns, and multiplying the result 
by the coverage level percentage you elect.
    Skip-row--A planting pattern that:
    (1) Consists of alternating rows of cotton and fallow land or land 
planted to another crop the previous fall; and
    (2) Qualifies as a skip-row planting pattern as defined by the Farm 
Service Agency (FSA) or a successor agency.

(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the cotton lint, in the 
county for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share; and
    (b) That is not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (1) Colored cotton lint;
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume;
    (3) Interplanted with another spring planted crop;
    (4) Grown on acreage from which a hay crop was harvested in the same 
calendar year unless the acreage is irrigated; or

heading and less than fifty percent (50%) of the small grain plants 
reach the heading stage.

                          6. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) The acreage insured will be only the land occupied by the rows 
of cotton when a skip row planting pattern is utilized; and
    (b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that a majority of the producers in the 
area would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted 
unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.

                           7. Insurance Period

    (a) In lieu of section 11(b)(2) of the Basic Provisions, insurance

    (a) In addition to your duties under section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of

[[Page 122]]

the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), in the event of damage or loss:
    (1) The cotton stalks must remain intact for our inspection; and
    (2) If you initially discover damage to the insured crop within 15 
days of harvest, or during harvest, you must leave representative 
samples of the unharvested crop in the field for our inspection. The 
samples must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of 
each field in the unit.
    (b) The stalks must not be destroyed, and required samples must not 
be harvested, until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days after 
harvest of the balance of the unit is completed and written notice of 
probable loss given to us.

                         10. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide records of production:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
    (2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
    (3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
    (4) Multiplying this result by your share.
    (c) The total production (pounds) to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage;
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
    (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are 
acceptable to us; or
    (E) On which the cotton stalks are destroyed, in violation of 
section 9;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of white 
cotton may be adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance with 
subsection 10(d)); and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to 
another use or you wish to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we 
agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the 
insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to 
another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of 
production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give 
you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production of appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including 
any mature cotton retrieved from the ground.
    (d) Mature white cotton may be adjusted for quality when production 
has been damaged by insured causes. Such production to count will be 
reduced if the price quotation for cotton of like quality (price 
quotation ``A'') for the applicable growth area is less than seventy-
five percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.'' Price quotation ``B'' is 
defined as the price quotation for the applicable growth area for cotton 
of the color and leaf grade, staple length, and micronaire reading 
designated in the Special Provisions for this purpose. Price quotations 
``A'' and ``B'' will be the price quotations contained in the Daily Spot 
Cotton Quotations published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service 
on the date the last bale from the unit is classed. If the date the last 
bale classed is not available, the price quotations will be determined 
on the date the last bale from the unit is delivered to the warehouse, 
as shown on the producer's account summary obtained from the gin. If 
eligible for adjustment, the amount of production to be counted will be 
determined by multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the 
factor derived from dividing price quotation ``A'' by seventy-five 
percent (75%) of price quotation ``B.''
    (e) Colored cotton lint will not be eligible for quality adjustment.

                         11. Prevented Planting

    (a) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the 
Basic Provisions, your prevented planting production guarantee will be 
based on your approved yield without adjustment for skip-row planting 
patterns.
    (b) Your prevented planting coverage will be 50 percent of your 
production guarantee

[[Page 123]]

for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or additional levels of 
coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, and pay an 
additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage to 
a level specified in the actuarial documents.

(price quotation ``A'') for the applicable growth area is less than 75 
percent of price quotation ``B.'' Price quotation ``B'' is defined as 
the price quotation for the applicable growth area for ELS cotton of the 
grade, staple length, and micronaire reading designated in the Special 
Provisions for this purpose. Price quotations ``A'' and ``B'' will be 
the price quotations contained in the Daily Spot Cotton Quotations 
published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service on the date the 
last bale from the unit is classed. If the date the last bale is classed 
is not available, the price quotations will be determined when the last 
bale from the unit is delivered to the warehouse, as shown on the 
producers account summary obtained from the gin. If eligible for quality 
adjustment, the amount of production to be counted will be determined by 
multiplying the number of pounds of such production by the factor 
derived from dividing price quotation ``A'' by 75 percent of price 
quotation ``B.''
    (e) For ELS cotton to be eligible for quality adjustment as shown in 
subsection 10(d), ginning must have been completed at a gin using roller 
equipment.
    (f) Any AUP cotton harvested or appraised from the acreage 
originally planted to ELS cotton in the same growing season will be 
reduced by the factor obtained by dividing the price per pound of the 
AUP cotton by the price quotation for the ELS cotton of the grade, 
staple length, and micronaire reading designated in the Special 
Provisions for this purpose. The prices used for the AUP and ELS cotton 
will be the price quotations contained in the Daily Spot Cotton 
Quotations published by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service on the 
date the last bale from the unit is classed. If the date the last bale 
is classed is not available, the price quotations will be determined 
when the last bale from the unit is delivered to the warehouse, as shown 
on the producer's account summary obtained from the gin. If either price 
quotation is unavailable for the dates stated above, the price 
quotations for the nearest prior date for which price quotations for 
both the AUP and ELS cotton are available will be used. If prices are 
not yet available for the insured crop year, the previous season's 
average prices will be used.

                            11. Late Planting

    A late planting period is not applicable to ELS cotton. Any ELS 
cotton that is planted after the final planting date will not be insured 
unless you were prevented from planting it by the final planting date. 
Such acreage will be insurable, and the production guarantee and premium 
for the acreage will be determined in accordance with section 16 of the 
Basic Provisions.

                         12. Prevented Planting

    (a) In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the 
Basic Provisions, your prevented planting production guarantee will be 
based on your approved yield without adjustment for skip-row planting 
patterns.
    (b) Your prevented planting coverage will be 50 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

the crop must bear the same relationship to the maximum amount of 
insurance available for each variety and population density of the crop 
as specified in the Actuarial documents. For example, if you elect 100 
percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a variety within a 
population density for the crop, you must select 100 percent of the 
maximum amount of insurance for that variety for all population 
densities for the crop. The amount of insurance for each variety and 
population density must be multiplied by any applicable factor contained 
in section 3(b)(2).
    (2) The amount of insurance per acre will be the product obtained by 
multiplying the reference maximum dollar amount of insurance that is 
shown in the actuarial documents for the applicable population density 
by the percentage for the level of coverage you select and by:
    (i) Thirty-three percent (0.33) for the year of set out, the year 
following dehorning, or the year following grafting of a set out tree. 
(Insurance will be limited to this amount until trees that are set out 
are one year of age or older on the first day of the crop year);
    (ii) Sixty percent (0.60) for the first growing season after being 
set out, the second year following dehorning, or the second year 
following grafting of a set out tree;
    (iii) Eighty percent (0.80) for the second growing season after 
being set out, the third year following dehorning, or the third year 
following grafting of a set out tree; or
    (iv) Ninety percent (0.90) for the third growing season after being 
set out, the fourth year following dehorning, or the fourth year 
following grafting of a set out tree.
    (3) The amount of insurance per acre for each population density, or 
factor as appropriate, will be multiplied by the applicable number of 
insured acres. These results will then be added together to determine 
the amount of insurance for the unit.
    (4) The amount of insurance will be reduced proportionately for any 
unit on which the stand is less than 90 percent, based on the original 
planting pattern. For example, if the amount of insurance you selected 
is

[[Page 127]]

$2,000 and the remaining stand is 85 percent of the original stand, the 
amount of insurance on which the premium and any indemnity will be based 
is $1,700 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.85).
    (5) If any insurable acreage of trees is set out after the first day 
of the crop year, and you elect to insure such acreage during that crop 
year, you must report the acreage, practice, crop, number of trees, date 
set out is completed, and your share to us within 72 hours after set out 
is completed for the unit.
    (6) Production reporting requirements contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), are not applicable.
    (7) You must report, by the sales closing date contained in the 
Special Provisions, by type if applicable:
    (i) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the amount of insurance, and the number of 
affected acres;
    (ii) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;
    (iii) The date of original set out and the planting pattern;
    (iv) The date of replacement or dehorning, if more than 10 percent 
of the trees on any unit have been replaced or dehorned in the previous 
5 years; and
    (v) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed:
    (A) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
    (B) The planting pattern; and
    (C) Any other information that we request in order to establish your 
amount of insurance.
    We will reduce the amount of insurance as necessary, based on our 
estimate of the effect of interplanting a perennial crop; removal of 
trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance on the 
potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any 
circumstance that may reduce the potential for the insured crop, we will 
reduce your amount of insurance as necessary at any time we become aware 
of the circumstance.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are November 20.

                            6. Annual Premium

    In addition to the provisions of section 5 (Annual Premium) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), for the 1998 crop year, the premium 
amount otherwise payable for the 1998 crop year will be increased by 46 
percent as a result of the additional six months of coverage for that 
crop year.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all of each citrus 
tree crop designated in the Special Provisions in the county for which a 
premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents and that you elect 
to insure:
    (1) In which you have an ownership share;
    (2) That is adapted to the area;
    (3) That is set out for the purpose of growing fruit to be harvested 
for the commercial production of fresh fruit or for juice;
    (4) That is irrigated; and
    (5) That have the potential to produce at least 70 percent of the 
county average yield for the crop and age, unless a written agreement is 
approved to insure the trees with lesser potential.
    (b) In addition to section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), we do not insure any citrus trees:
    (1) During the crop year the application for insurance is filed, 
unless we inspect the acreage and consider it acceptable; or
    (2) That have been grafted onto existing root stock or nursery stock 
within the one-year period prior to the date insurance attaches.
    (c) We may exclude from insurance or limit the amount of insurance 
on any acreage that was not insured the previous year.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, citrus trees interplanted with another 
perennial crop are insurable, unless we inspect the acreage and 
determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your 
policy.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) The insurance period is as follows:
    (1) For the 1998 crop year only, coverage will begin on June 1, 
1997, and will end on November 20, 1998.
    (2) For all subsequent crop years, coverage begins on November 21 of 
the calendar year prior to the year the insured crop normally

[[Page 128]]

blooms, except that for the year of application, if your application is 
received after November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will 
attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is 
received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 
10 day period and determine that it does not meet the requirements for 
insurability contained in your policy. You must provide any information 
that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the grove.
    (3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is November 20.
    (b) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (c) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of citrus trees on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to and no 
premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year 
unless:
    (1) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (2) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (3) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (a) Excess precipitation;
    (b) Excess wind;
    (c) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;
    (d) Freeze;
    (e) Hail;
    (f) Tornado; or
    (g) Failure of the irrigation water supply if caused by an insured 
peril or drought that occurs during the insurance period.

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), in case of 
damage or probable loss, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any 
unit, you must allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning, 
dehorning, or removal of any damaged trees.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) In the event of damage covered by this policy, we will settle 
your claim on a unit basis by:
    (1) Determining the actual percent of damage for the unit in 
accordance with sections 12 (b), (c), and (d);
    (2) Subtracting your deductible from the percent of damage for the 
unit (this result must be greater than zero to receive an indemnity);
    (3) Dividing the result of section 12(a)(2) by your coverage level 
percentage;
    (4) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(3) by the amount of 
insurance per acre determined in accordance with section 3(b)(2);
    (5) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(4) by the number of 
insured acres; and
    (6) Multiplying the result of section 12(a)(5) by your share.
    (b) The percent of damage for any tree will be determined as 
follows:
    (1) For damage occurring during the year of set out (trees that have 
not been set out for at least one year at the time insurance attaches):
    (i) One-hundred percent (100%) whenever there is no live wood above 
the bud union;
    (ii) Ninety percent (90%) whenever there is less than 12 inches of 
live wood above the bud union; or
    (iii) The tree will be considered undamaged whenever there is more 
than 12 inches of live wood above the bud union; or
    (2) For damage occurring in any year following the year of set out:
    (i) The percentage of damage will be determined by dividing the 
number of scaffold limbs damaged in an area from the trunk to a length 
equal to one-fourth (\1/4\) the height of the tree, by the total number 
of scaffold limbs before damage occurred. Whenever this percentage 
exceeds 80 percent, the tree will be considered as 100 percent damaged.
    (ii) The percent of damage for the unit will be determined by 
computing the average of the determinations made for the individual 
trees. If this percent of damage exceeds 80 percent, the unit will be 
considered 100 percent damaged.
    (c) The percent of damage on the unit will be reduced by the 
percentage of damage due to uninsured causes.

                     13. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

    (3) Any tangerines that normally would not meet the 210 pack size (2 
and 4/16 inch minimum diameter) under United States Standards by the end 
of the insurance period for tangerines.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will be divided into additional basic units by each citrus crop 
designated in the Special Provisions.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.
    (c)Instead of establishing optional units by section, section 
equivalent, or FSA farm serial number, optional units may be established 
if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one coverage level for each Florida citrus 
fruit type shown in section 1 of these crop provisions or designated in 
the Special Provisions, that you elect to insure. If different amounts 
of insurance are available for citrus fruit within a type, you must 
select the same coverage level for each citrus fruit. For example, if 
you choose the 75 percent coverage level for a specific citrus fruit 
within a type, you must also choose the 75 percent coverage level for 
all other citrus fruit within that type.
    (b) In lieu of the production reporting date contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), potential production 
for each unit will be determined during loss adjustment.
    (c) By the sales closing date contained in the Special Provisions, 
for the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another 
citrus fruit crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage is 
changed, you must report the following:
    (1) The age of the interplanted trees and type if applicable;
    (2) The planting pattern; and
    (3) Any other information we request in order to establish your 
amount of insurance.
    (d) We will reduce acreage or the amount of insurance or both, as 
necessary, based on

[[Page 130]]

our estimate of the effect of the interplanted citrus fruit trees on the 
insured citrus fruit crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance 
that may reduce the acreage or amount of insurance, we will reduce the 
acreage or amount of insurance or both as necessary any time we become 
aware of the circumstance.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is March 15 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation date 
is April 30 preceding the crop year. The termination date is April 30 of 
the crop year.

                             6. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all acreage of each 
citrus fruit type that you elect to insure, in which you have a share, 
that is grown in the county shown on the application, and for which a 
premium rate is quoted in the actuarial documents.
    (b) In addition to the citrus fruit not insurable in section 8 
(Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we do not insure 
any citrus fruit:
    (1) That cannot be expected to mature each crop year within the 
normal maturity period for the type;
    (2) Produced by trees that have not reached the fifth growing season 
after being set out, unless otherwise provided in the Special Provisions 
or by a written agreement to insure such citrus fruit;
    (3) Of ``Meyer Lemons'' and oranges commonly known as ``Sour 
Oranges'' or ``Clementines''; or
    (4) Of the Robinson tangerine variety, for any crop year in which 
you have elected to exclude such tangerines from insurance. (You must 
elect this exclusion prior to the crop year for which the exclusion is 
to be effective, except that for the first crop year you must elect this 
exclusion by the later of April 30 or the time you submit the 
application for insurance.)
    (c) Upon our approval, prior to the date insurance attaches, you may 
elect to insure or exclude from insurance any insurable acreage that has 
a potential production of less than 100 boxes per acre. If you:
    (1) Elect to insure such acreage, we will consider the potential 
production to be 100 boxes per acre when determining the amount of loss; 
or
    (2) Elect to exclude such acreage, we will disregard the acreage for 
all purposes related to this contract.
    (d) In addition to the provisions in section 6 (Report of Acreage) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if you fail to notify us of your 
election to insure or exclude acreage, and the potential production from 
such acreage is 100 or more boxes per acre, we will determine the 
percent of damage on all of the insurable acreage for the unit, but will 
not allow the percent of damage for the unit to be increased by 
including such acreage.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, citrus fruit interplanted with another 
citrus fruit crop is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and 
determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your 
policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on May 1 of each crop year, except that for the 
year of application if your application is received by us after April 
21, but prior to May 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your 
properly completed application, acreage, and production reports are 
received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 
10 day period and determine that it does not meet the requirements for 
insurability contained in your policy. You must provide any information 
that we require for the crop to determine the condition of the grove to 
be insured.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is:
    (i) January 31 for tangerines and navel oranges;
    (ii) April 30 for lemons, limes, tangelos, early and mid-season 
oranges; and
    (iii) June 30 for late oranges, grapefruit, Temple, and Murcott 
Honey Oranges.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop 
year, and if after inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, then 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of citrus fruit on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop 
year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, no premium 
will be due

[[Page 131]]

and no indemnity paid for, such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;
    (2) Freeze;
    (3) Hail;
    (4) Hurricane; or
    (5) Tornado.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Any damage to the blossoms or trees; or
    (2) Inability to market the citrus fruit for any reason other than 
actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this 
section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable 
to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                         10. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Calculating the amount of insurance for the unit by multiplying 
the number of acres by the respective dollar amount of insurance per 
acre for the citrus fruit and multiplying that result by your share;
    (2) Calculating the average percent of damage to the respective 
citrus fruit, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent (0.1%). The 
percent of damage will be the ratio of the number of boxes of citrus 
fruit considered damaged from an insured cause divided by the undamaged 
potential production. Citrus fruit will be considered undamaged 
potential production if it is:
    (i) Marketed or could be marketed as fresh fruit;
    (ii) Harvested prior to inspection by us; or
    (iii) Harvested within 7 days after a freeze;
    (3) Subtracting the coverage level percentage from 100 percent;
    (i) Subtracting this result from the result of section (10)(b)(2); 
and
    (ii) If the result section (10)(b)(3)(i) is positive, dividing this 
result by the coverage level percentage;
    (4) Multiplying the result of section (10)(b)(3)(ii) by the amount 
of insurance for the unit for the respective citrus fruit.
    (For example, if the average percent of damage is 70 percent and the 
coverage level is 75 percent (the deductible is 25 percent), the amount 
payable is 60 percent times the amount of insurance (70% damage - 25 % 
level deductible) = 45% (45% / 75%) 60% adjusted damage times the amount 
of insurance); and
    (5) Totaling all such results of section (10)(b)(4) to determine the 
amount payable for the unit.
    (c) Citrus fruit of Types IV, V, and VII that are seriously damaged 
by freeze, as determined by a fresh-fruit cut of a representative sample 
of fruit in the unit in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 
State of Florida Citrus Fruit laws, and that are not or could not be 
marketed as fresh fruit, will be considered damaged to the following 
extent:
    (1) If less than 16 percent of the fruit in a sample shows serious 
freeze damage, the fruit will be considered undamaged; or
    (2) If 16 percent or more of the fruit in a sample shows serious 
freeze damage, the fruit will be considered 50 percent damaged, except 
that:
    (i) For tangerines of Type IV, damage in excess of 50 percent will 
be the actual percent of damaged fruit; and
    (ii) Citrus of Types IV (except tangerines), V, and VII, if it is 
determined that the juice loss in the fruit exceeds 50 percent, such 
percent will be considered the percent of damage.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10(c) of these crop 
provisions as to citrus fruit of Types IV, V, and VII, in any unit that 
is mechanically separated using the specific-gravity (floatation) method 
into undamaged and freeze-damaged fruit, the amount of damage will be 
the actual percent of freeze-damaged fruit not to exceed 50 percent and 
will not be affected by subsequent fresh-fruit marketing. However, the 
50 percent limitation on mechanically-separated, freeze-damaged fruit 
will not apply to tangerines of citrus fruit Type IV.
    (e) Any citrus fruit of Types I, II, III, and VI damaged by freeze, 
but that can be processed into products for human consumption, will be 
considered as marketable for juice. The percent of damage will be 
determined by

[[Page 132]]

relating the juice content of the damaged fruit to:
    (1) The average juice content of the fruit produced on the unit for 
the three previous crop years based on your records, if they are 
acceptable to us; or
    (2) The following juice content, if acceptable records are not 
furnished:
    (i) Type I--52 pounds of juice per box
    (ii) Type II--54 pounds of juice per box
    (iii) Type III--45 pounds of juice per box
    (iv) Type VI--43 pounds of juice per box
    (f) Any citrus fruit on the ground that is not collected and 
marketed will be considered as 100 percent damaged if the damage was due 
to an insured cause.
    (g) Any citrus fruit that is unmarketable either as fresh fruit or 
as juice because it is immature, unwholesome, decomposed, adulterated, 
or otherwise unfit for human consumption due to an insured cause will be 
considered as 100 percent damaged.
    (h) Citrus fruit of Types IV, V, and VII that are unmarketable as 
fresh fruit due to serious damage from hail as defined in the applicable 
United States Standards for Grades of Florida fruit will be considered 
totally lost.

                     11. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                     Sunflower Seed Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Harvest--Combining or threshing the sunflowers for seed.
     Local market price--The cash seed price per pound for oil type 
sunflower seed grading U.S. No. 2, or non-oil type sunflower seed with a 
test weight of at least 22 pounds per bushel and less than five percent 
(5%) kernel damage, offered by buyers in the area in which you normally 
market the sunflower seed. The local market price for oil type sunflower 
seed will reflect the maximum limits of quality deficiencies allowable 
for the U.S. No. 2 grade of sunflower seed. Factors not associated with 
grading of sunflower seed under the Official United States Standards for 
Grain including, but not limited to, oil or moisture content will not be 
considered.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, sunflower seed must initially be planted ini rows far 
enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation, unless otherwise provided 
by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.

  2. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price election for all 
the sunflower seed in the county insured under this policy. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Special Provisions 
provide different price elections by type, you may select one price 
election for each sunflower seed type designated in the Special 
Provisions.

                           3. Contract Changes

    The contract change date is November 30 (December 17 for the 1998 
crop year only) preceding the cancellation date (see the provisions of 
Section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic Provisions).

                  4. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
the cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

                             5. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the oil and non-oil type 
sunflower seed in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the 
actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is planted for harvest as sunflower seed; and
    (c) That is not (unless a written agreement allows otherwise):
    (1) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume.

                          6. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) We will not insure any acreage which does not meet the rotation 
requirements shown in the Special Provisions; and
    (b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that a majority of producers in the area 
would not normally further care for the crop,

[[Page 133]]

must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.

                           7. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar date for the end of 
the insurance period is November 30, immediately following planting.

                            8. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss which occur within the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) If applicable, failure of the irrigation water supply due to an 
unavoidable cause of loss occurring after the beginning of planting.

                         9. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a 
replanting payment for sunflower seed is allowed if the sunflowers are 
damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining 
stand will not produce at least ninety percent of the production 
guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of twenty percent (20%) of the production guarantee or 175 
(pounds of seed), multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your 
insured share or the share determined in accordance with section 9(c), 
if applicable.
    (c) When more than one person insures the same crop on a share 
basis, a replanting payment based on the total shares insured by us may 
be made to the insured person who incurs the total cost of replanting. 
Payment will be made in this manner only if an agreement exists between 
the insured persons which:
    (1) Requires one person to incur the entire cost of replanting; or
    (2) Gives the right to all replanting payments to one person.
    (d) When sunflower seed is replanted using a practice that is 
uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be 
reduced by the amount of the replanting payment which is attributable to 
your share. The premium amount will not be reduced.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the 
representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet 
wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples 
must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection 
or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide records of production:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage of each type of sunflower seed 
by the production guarantee for the applicable type;
    (2) Multiplying each result by the price election for the applicable 
type;
    (3) Adding these values;
    (4) Multiplying the production to count of each type of sunflower 
seed by the price election for that type;
    (5) Adding these dollar values;
    (6) Subtracting the result of step (5) from the result of step (3); 
and
    (7) Multiplying the result by your share.
    (c) The total production (pounds) to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
subsection 11(d)); and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to 
another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care for, if you and we 
agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the 
insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to 
another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of 
production is not reached:

[[Page 134]]

    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us, (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count.); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Mature sunflower seed production may be adjusted for excess 
moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, 
it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.
    (1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 
percentage point of moisture in excess of ten percent (10%). We may 
obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
    (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) Deficiencies in quality result in:
    (A) Oil type sunflower seed not meeting the grade requirements for 
U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. sample grade) because of test weight, kernel 
damage (excluding heat damage), or a musty, sour or commercially 
objectionable foreign odor; or
    (B) Non-oil type sunflower seed having a test weight below 22 pounds 
per bushel or kernel damage (excluding heat damage) in excess of five 
percent (5%) or a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign 
odor; or
    (ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the 
Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the 
United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions, resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop 
provisions and within the insurance period ;
    (ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us;
    (iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, 
which may be determined by our loss adjustor), the samples are analyzed 
by:
    (A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or
    (C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed 
by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    (4) Sunflower seed production that is eligible for quality 
adjustment, as specified in paragraphs 11(d) (2) and (3), will be 
reduced:
    (i) In accordance with quality adjustment factor provisions 
contained in the Special Provisions; or
    (ii) As follows, if quality adjustment factor provisions are not 
contained in the Special Provisions:
    (A) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the 
local market price will be determined on the earlier of the date such 
quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for 
the unit. The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the 
market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used 
to establish the net price of the damaged production will be limited to 
those which are usual, customary, and reasonable. The price will not be 
reduced for:
    (1) Moisture content;
    (2) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
    (3) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with 
normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the sunflower seed; 
except, if the price of the damaged production can be increased by 
conditioning, we may reduce the price of the production after it has 
been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the 
value of the production before conditioning. (We may obtain prices from 
any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or more buyers 
located outside your local market area, we will reduce such prices by 
the additional costs required to deliver the sunflower seed to those 
buyers.);
    (B) The value of the damaged or conditioned production will be 
divided by the local market price to determine the quality adjustment 
factor; and
    (C) The number of pounds remaining after any reduction due to 
excessive moisture (the

[[Page 135]]

moisture-adjusted gross pounds (if appropriate)) of the damaged or 
conditioned production will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment 
factor to determine the net production to count.
    (e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop 
may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

                         12. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase you prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

    Crop year. In Imperial, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Siskiyou counties, 
California and all other States, the period within which the sugar beets 
are normally grown, which is designated by the calendar year in which 
the sugar beets are normally harvested. In all other California 
counties, the period from planting until the applicable date for the end 
of the insurance period which is designated by:
    (a) The calendar year in which planted if planted on or before July 
15; or
    (b) The following calendar year if planted after July 15.
    Harvest. Topping and lifting of sugar beets in the field.
    Initially planted. The first occurrence that land is considered as 
planted acreage for the crop year.
    Local market price. The price per pound for raw sugar offered by 
buyers in the area in which you normally market the sugar beets.
    Planted acreage.--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, sugar beets must initially be planted in rows, unless 
otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by 
written agreement.
    Practical to replant. In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or 
damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited 
to moisture availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, 
and marketing window, that replanting the insured crop will allow the 
crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant if 
production from the replanted acreage cannot be delivered under the 
terms of the processor contract, or 30 days after the initial planting 
date for all counties where a late planting period is not applicable, 
unless replanting is generally occurring in the area.
    Processor. Any business enterprise regularly engaged in processing 
sugar beets for sugar that possesses all licenses and permits for 
processing sugar beets required by the State in which it operates, and 
that possesses facilities, or has contractual access to such facilities, 
with enough equipment to accept and process the contracted sugar beets 
within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.
    Production guarantee (per acre):
    (a) First stage production guarantee--The final stage production 
guarantee multiplied by 60 percent.
    (b) Final stage production guarantee--The number of tons determined 
by multiplying the approved yield per acre by the coverage level 
percentage you elect.
    Raw sugar. Sugar that has not been extracted from the sugar beet.
    Standardized ton. A ton of sugar beets containing the percentage of 
raw sugar specified in the Special Provisions.
    Sugar beet processor contract. A written contract between the 
producer and the processor, containing at a minimum:
    (1) The producer's commitment to plant and grow sugar beets, and to 
deliver the sugar beet production to the processor;
    (2) The processor's commitment to purchase the production stated in 
the contract; and

[[Page 136]]

    (3) A price or formula for a price based on third party data that 
will be paid to the producer for the production stated in the contract.
    Thinning. The process of removing, either by machine or hand, a 
portion of the sugar beet plants to attain a desired plant population.
    Ton. Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.

                            2. Unit Division

    In addition to the requirements of section 34 of the Basic 
Provisions, basic units may be divided into optional units only if you 
have a sugar beet processor contract that requires the processor to 
accept all production from a number of acres specified in the sugar beet 
processor contract. Acreage insured to fulfil a a sugar beet contract 
which provides that the processor will accept a designated amount of 
production or a combination of acreage and production will not be 
eligible for optional units.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price 
election for all the sugar beets in the county insured under this 
policy.
    (b) The production guarantees are progressive by stages, and 
increase at specified intervals to the final stage. The stages are:
    (1) First stage, with a guarantee of 60 percent (60%) of the final 
stage production guarantee, extends from planting until:
    (i) July 1 in Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Siskiyou counties, 
California and all other States except Arizona; and
    (ii) The earlier of thinning or 90 days after planting in Arizona 
and all other California counties.
    (2) Final stage, with a guarantee of 100 percent (100%) of the final 
stage production guarantee, applies to all insured sugar beets that 
complete the first stage.
    (c) The production guarantee will be expressed in standardized tons.
    (d) Any acreage of sugar beets damaged in the first stage to the 
extent that growers in the area would not normally further care for the 
sugar beets will be deemed to have been destroyed, even though you may 
continue to care for it. The production guarantee for such acreage will 
not exceed the first stage production guarantee.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with the provisions of section 4 (Contract Changes) of 
the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is April 30 preceding the 
cancellation date for counties with a July 15 or August 31 cancellation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            6. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium computation method contained in section 7 
(Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the annual 
premium amount is computed by multiplying the final stage production 
guarantee by the price election, the premium rate, the insured acreage, 
your share at the time of planting, and any applicable premium 
adjustment factors contained in the Actuarial Table.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the sugar beets in 
the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial 
documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are planted for harvest as sugar beets;
    (3) That are grown under a sugar beet processor contract executed 
before the acreage reporting date and are not excluded from the 
processor contract at any time during the crop year; and
    (4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop;
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or
    (iii) Planted prior to submitting a properly completed application.
    (b) Sugar beet growers who are also processors may establish an 
insurable interest if they meet the following requirements:
    (1) The processor must meet the definition of a ``processor'' in 
section 1 of these crop provisions and have a valid insurable interest 
in the sugar beet crop;

[[Page 137]]

    (2) The Board of Directors or officers of the processor must have 
duly promulgated a resolution that sets forth essentially the same terms 
as a sugar beet processor contract. Such resolution will be considered a 
sugar beet processing contract under the terms of the sugar beet crop 
insurance policy;
    (3) The sales records of the processor showing the amount of sugar 
produced the previous year must be supplied to us to confirm the 
processor has produced and sold sugar in the past; and
    (4) Our inspection of the processing facilities determines that they 
conform to the definition of processor contained in section 1 of these 
crop provisions.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) We will not insure any acreage planted to sugar beets:
    (1) The preceding crop year, unless otherwise specified in the 
Special Provisions for the county;
    (2) In any crop year following the discovery of rhizomania on the 
acreage, unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written 
agreement; or
    (3) That does not meet the rotation requirements shown in the 
Special Provisions;
    (b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, (or within 30 days of initial planting for those counties 
without a final planting date) to the extent that growers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that replanting is not practical.

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar date for the 
end of the insurance period is:
    (1) July 15 in Arizona and in Imperial County, California;
    (2) The last day of the 12th month after the insured crop was 
initially planted in all California counties except Imperial, Lassen, 
Modoc, Shasta and Siskiyou;
    (3) October 31 in Lassen, Modoc, Shasta and Siskiyou Counties, 
California, and in Klamath County, Oregon;
    (4) November 25 in Ohio;
    (5) December 31 in New Mexico and Texas; and
    (6) November 15 in all other States and counties.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), regarding the end of the insurance 
period, the insurance period ends for all units when the production 
delivered to the processor equals the amount of production stated in the 
sugar beet processor contract.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.

                         11. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the crop is 
damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining 
stand will not produce at least 90 percent (90%) of the final stage 
production guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of 10 percent (10%) of the final stage production guarantee 
or one ton, multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your 
insured share.
    (c) When sugar beets are replanted using a practice that is 
uninsurable for an original planting, our liability on the unit will be 
reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will 
not be reduced.

                12. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) Representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 
10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The 
samples must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our 
inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is 
completed; and
    (b) You must provide a copy of your sugar beet processor contract or 
corporate resolution if you are the processor.

                         13. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:

[[Page 138]]

    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Subtracting the total production to count from the result in 
paragraph (b)(1);
    (3) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(2) by your price 
election; and
    (4) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(3) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in standardized tons) from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records that 
are acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (unharvested production that is 
appraised prior to the earliest delivery date that the processor accepts 
harvested production will not be eligible for a conversion to 
standardized tons in accordance with section 13 (d) and (e));
    (iv) Only appraised production in excess of the difference between 
the first and final stage production guarantee for acreage that does not 
qualify for the final stage guarantee will be counted, except that all 
production from acreage subject to section 13(c)(1) (i) and (ii) will be 
counted; and
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Harvested production or unharvested production that is appraised 
after the earliest delivery date that the processor accepts harvested 
production and that meets the minimum acceptable standards contained in 
the sugar beet processor contract or corporate resolution will be 
converted to standardized tons by:
    (1) Dividing the average percentage of raw sugar in such sugar beets 
by the raw sugar content percentage shown in the Special Provisions; and
    (2) Multiplying the result (rounded to three places) by the number 
of tons of such sugar beets.
    The average percentage of raw sugar will be determined from tests 
performed by the processor at the time of delivery. If individual tests 
of raw sugar content are not made at the time of delivery, the average 
percent of raw sugar may be based on the results of previous tests 
performed by the processor during the crop year if it is determined that 
such results are representative of the total production. If not 
representative, the average percent of raw sugar will equal the raw 
sugar content percent shown in the Special Provisions.
    (e) Harvested production or unharvested production that is appraised 
after the earliest delivery date that the processor accepts harvested 
production and that does not meet the minimum acceptable standards 
contained in the sugar beet processor contract due to an insured peril 
will be converted to standardized tons by:
    (1) Dividing the gross dollar value of all of the damaged sugar 
beets on the unit (including the value of cooperative stock, patronage 
refunds, etc.) by the local market price per pound on the earlier of the 
date such production is sold or the date of final inspection for the 
unit;
    (2) Dividing that result by 2,000; and
    (3) Dividing that result by the county average raw sugar factor 
contained in the Special Provisions for this purpose.
    For example, assume that the total dollar value of the damaged sugar 
beets is $6,000.00; the local market price is $0.10; and the county 
average raw sugar factor is 0.15. The amount of production to count 
would be calculated as follows: (($6,000.00 / $0.10) / 2,000) / 0.15 = 
200 tons.

                     14. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late planting provisions contained in section 16 of the Basic 
Provisions are not applicable in California counties with a July 15, 
cancellation date.

                         15. Prevented Planting

    (a) The prevented planting provision contained in sectino 17 of the 
Basic Provisions are not applicable in Califronia counties with a July 
15, cancellation date.
    (b) Except in those counties indicated in section 15(a), your 
prevented planting coverage will be 45 percent of your production 
guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or additional 
levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, and pay 
an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage 
to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will be divided into additional basic units by each fig type designated 
in the Special Provisions.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be 
established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous 
land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements under section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions, you may select only one price election for each fig type 
designated in the Special Provisions and insured in the county under 
this policy.
    (b) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time you request the increase.
    (c) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type if applicable:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern;
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed, the age of the crop that is interplanted with the figs, and 
type if applicable, and the planting pattern; and
    (5) Any other information that we request in order to establish your 
approved yield. We will reduce the yield used to establish your 
production guarantee as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect 
of the following: Interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; 
change in practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of 
the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may 
reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production 
guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.

[[Page 140]]

                           4. Contract Changes

    The contract change date is October 31 preceding the cancellation 
date (see the provisions under section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8)).

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    The cancellation and termination dates are February 28.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    By applying for fig crop insurance, you authorize us to have access 
to and to determine or verify your production and acreage from records 
maintained by the California Fig Advisory Board and the fig packer.

                             7. Insured Crop

    The crop insured will be all the commercially grown dried figs that 
are grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which a premium 
rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown for harvest as dried figs;
    (c) That are irrigated;
    (d) That have reached the seventh growing season after being set 
out; and
    (e) For which acceptable production records for at least the 
previous crop year are provided;
    (f) That are not figs:
    (1) Grown on acreage with less than 90 percent of a stand based on 
the original planting pattern unless we agree, in writing, to insure 
such figs;
    (2) Which we inspect and consider not acceptable;
    (3) Grown for the crop year the application is filed unless 
inspected and accepted by us; or
    (4) Grown on acreage acquired for the crop year unless such acreage 
has been inspected and accepted by us.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions, that 
prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, figs 
interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect 
the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements 
contained in your policy.

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) Coverage begins on March 1, except that for the year of 
application, if your application is received after February 19 but prior 
to March 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your properly 
completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect 
the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it does not meet 
insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we 
require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is October 31 or the date harvest of the figs (by type) should 
have started on any acreage that will not be harvested (Exceptions, if 
any, for specific counties or varieties or varietal group are contained 
in the Special Provisions).
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (c) If your fig policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, 
in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for 
that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates 
whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached 
for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will 
be due for such crop year.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In addition to the provisions under section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), any loss covered by this policy 
must occur within the insurance period. The specific causes of loss for 
figs are:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Earthquake;
    (3) Fire;
    (4) Volcanic eruption;
    (5) Wildlife; or
    (6) Failure of the irrigation water supply.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against contained 
in section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we 
will not insure against:
    (1) Any loss of production due to fire, where weeds and other forms 
of undergrowth have not been controlled or tree pruning debris has not 
been removed from the grove; or
    (2) The inability to market the fruit as a direct result of 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any entity to accept production.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us 
for any:
    (1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which 
acceptable records of production were not provided; or

[[Page 141]]

    (2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such 
units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each 
unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
    (2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
    (3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
    (4) Multiplying this result by your share.
    (c) The total production (pounds) to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include all harvested and appraised marketable 
figs.
    (1) Figs, which due to insurable causes, grade manufacturing grade 
will be adjusted by:
    (i) Dividing the value per pound of the manufacturing grade 
production by the highest price election available for the insured type; 
and
    (ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1) by the number of 
pounds of such manufacturing grade production.
    (2) Figs, which due to insurable causes, grade substandard and are 
delivered to the substandard pool will not be considered production to 
count, provided all the insured's substandard production is inspected by 
us and we give written consent to such delivery prior to delivery. If we 
do not give written consent prior to the delivery to the substandard 
pool, all production will be counted as undamaged marketable production. 
Substandard production for which we give written consent to you prior to 
delivery to the substandard pool, which is not delivered to the 
substandard pool, and is sold by you, will be considered production to 
count and adjusted as follows:
    (i) Dividing the value per pound received for such substandard 
production by the highest price election available for the insured type; 
and
    (ii) Multiplying the result (not to exceed 1) by the number of 
pounds of such substandard production.
    (3) Appraised production to be counted will include:
    (i) Potential production lost due to uninsured causes and failure to 
follow recognized good fig farming practices;
    (ii) Not less than the production guarantee for the figs on any 
acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned without our consent;
    (B) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
    (c) If the figs are destroyed by you without our consent; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are 
acceptable to us;
    (iii) Unharvested production which would be marketable if harvested; 
and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you want to 
abandon and no longer care for if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end if you abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised 
amount of production is not reached:
    (A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a 
subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine 
actual production. You must notify us within three days of the date 
harvest should have started if the crop is not harvested; or
    (B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop. We will 
determine the amount of production to count for the acreage using the 
harvested production or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

                          Pear Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Direct marketing. Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper, or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, and permitting the general public to enter the field for the 
purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Harvest. The picking of mature pears from the trees or the 
collecting of marketable pears from the ground.

    Ton. Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.
    Varietal group. Types of pears with similar characteristics that are 
grouped for insurance purposes as specified in the Special Provisions.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) Provisions in the Basic Provision that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.
    (b) Instead of establishing optional units by section, section 
equivalents, or FSA farm serial number optional units may be established 
if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous.
    (c) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by 
section, section equivalents, FSA farm serial number, or on non-
contiguous land, optional units may be established by varietal group 
when provided for in the Special Provisions. The requirements of section 
34(a)(1) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable for this method of 
unit division.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the pears in the 
county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide 
different price elections by varietal group, in which case you may 
select one price election for each varietal group designated in the 
Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each varietal 
group must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price 
offered by us for each varietal group. For example, if you choose one 
hundred percent (100%) of the maximum price election for one varietal 
group, you must also choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum 
price election for all other varietal groups.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for 
Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by 
varietal group:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such 
acreage is changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield. We will reduce the yield used to establish your 
production guarantee as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect 
of the following: interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; 
change in practices or any other circumstance on the yield potential of 
the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may 
reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production 
guarantee as necessary at any time that we become aware of the 
circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is October 31 
preceding the cancellation date for states with a January 31 
cancellation date and August 31 preceding the cancellation date for all 
other states.

California.............................  January 31.
All other states.......................  November 20.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the pears in the county for 
which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are of varieties adapted to the area;
    (c) That are grown on trees that have produced an average of at 
least five (5) tons of pears per acre in at least one of the four 
previous crop years unless the Special Provisions or a written agreement 
establishes a lower production level; and
    (d) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us.

[[Page 143]]

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, pears interplanted with another 
perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine 
that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins:
    (i) In California, on February 1 of each crop year, except that for 
the year of application, if your application is received after January 
22 but prior to February 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after 
your properly completed application is received in our local office, 
unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine 
that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any 
information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition 
of the orchard; or
    (ii) In all other states, on November 21 of each crop year, except 
that for the year of application, if your application is received after 
November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th 
day after your properly completed application is received in our local 
office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and 
determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must 
provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the 
condition of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is:
    (i) September 15 for Bartlett (green and red) and Star Crimson 
(Crimson Red) varietal groups; or
    (ii) October 15 for all other varietal groups.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable interest on any insurable 
acreage of pears on or before the acreage reporting date of any crop 
year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no 
premium will be due, and no indemnity paid, for such acreage for that 
crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (d) If your pear policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, 
in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for 
that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates 
whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached 
for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will 
be due for such crop year.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Earthquake;
    (4) Volcanic eruption; or
    (5) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available.
    (2) Failure of the fruit to color properly; or
    (3) Inability to market the pears for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of

[[Page 144]]

the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the following will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have 
started if the crop will not be harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal 
that will be used to determine your production to count for production 
that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, 
we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any 
acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your 
production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will 
be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre 
if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
    (c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you previously 
gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), so that we may inspect the damaged production. You must 
not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until after we have given you 
written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this 
section, and such failure results in our inability to inspect the 
damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and 
included as production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each varietal group if 
applicable, by its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying the results of section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each varietal group, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each varietal 
group, if applicable, by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting this result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the 
requirements contained in section 10;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count; and
    (2) For all states except California, all harvested and appraised 
marketable pear production from the insurable acreage.
    (3) For California, all harvested and appraised production that:
    (i) Meets the standards for first grade canning as defined by the 
California Pear Advisory Board or for U.S. Number 1 as defined by the 
United States Standards for Grades of Summer and Fall Pears, or Pears 
for Processing, or for U.S. Extra Number 1 or U.S. Number 1 as defined 
by the United States Standards for Grades of Winter Pears;
    (ii) Is accepted by a processor for canning or packing; or
    (iii) Is marketable for any purpose. However, if the pears are 
damaged by an insured cause, the production to count will be reduced by 
the greater of the following amounts:
    (A) The excess over ten percent (10%) of pears that are size 180 or 
smaller for varieties other than Forelle, Seckel or Winter Nelis; or
    (B) The result of dividing the value per ton of such pears by the 
highest price election for the insured varietal group, subtracting this 
result from 1.000, and multiplying this difference (if positive) by the 
number of tons of such pears.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

[[Page 145]]

                 13. Pear Quality Adjustment Endorsement

    (a) This endorsement applies to any crop year: Provided,
    (1) The insured pears are located in a State other than California 
and the actuarial documents designate a premium rate for this 
endorsement;
    (2) You have not elected to insure your pears under the Catastrophic 
Risk Protection (CAT) Endorsement;
    (3) You elected it on your application or other form approved by us, 
and did so on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year 
for which you wish it to be effective. By doing so, you agreed to pay 
the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents for this 
optional coverage; and
    (4) You or we did not cancel it in writing on or before the 
cancellation date. Your election of CAT coverage for any crop year after 
this endorsement is effective will be considered as notice of 
cancellation by you.
    (b) If the pear production is damaged by hail and if eleven percent 
(11%) or more of the harvested and appraised production does not grade 
at least U.S. No. 2 in accordance with applicable United States 
Standards for Grades of Summer and Fall Pears, United States Standards 
for Grades of Winter Pears, or United States Standards for Grades of 
Pears for Processing, as applicable, due solely to hail, the amount of 
production to count will be reduced as follows:
    (1) By two percent (2%) for each full one percent (1%) in excess of 
ten percent (10%), when eleven percent (11%) through sixty percent (60%) 
of the pears fail the grade standard; or
    (2) By one hundred percent (100%) when more than sixty percent (60%) 
of the pears fail the grade standard.
    The difference between the reduced production determined in section 
13(b) and the total production will be considered as cull production.
    (c) Pears that are knocked to the ground by wind or that are frozen 
and cannot be packed or marketed as fresh pears will be considered one 
hundred percent (100%) cull production.
    (d) Marketable production that grades less than U.S. No. 2 due to 
causes not covered by this endorsement will not be reduced.
    (e) Fifteen percent (15%) of all production considered as cull 
production in accordance with section 13 (b) and (c) will be production 
to count.

Sec. 457.112  Hybrid sorghum seed crop insurance provisions.

    The Hybrid Sorghum Seed Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1998 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC policies:

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

                   Hybrid Sorghum Seed Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows:
    (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, if applicable; (2) 
the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop Provisions; and (4) the Basic 
Provisions, (Sec. 457.8) with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Adjusted yield. An amount determined by multiplying the county yield 
by the coverage level factor.
    Amount of insurance per acre. A dollar amount determined by 
multiplying the adjusted yield by the price election you select and 
subtracting any minimum guaranteed payment, not to exceed the total 
compensation specified in the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract. If 
your hybrid sorghum seed processor contract contains a minimum 
guaranteed payment that is stated in bushels, we will convert that value 
to dollars by multiplying it by the price election you selected.
    Approved yield. In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic 
Provisions, an amount FCIC determines to be representative of the yield 
that the female parent plants are expected to produce when grown under a 
specific production practice. FCIC will establish the approved yield 
based upon records provided by the seed company and other information it 
deems appropriate.
    Bushel. Fifty-six pounds avoirdupois of the insured crop.
    Certified seed test. A warm germination test performed on clean seed 
according to specifications of the ``Rules for Testing Seeds'' of the 
Association of Official Seed Analysts.
    Commercial hybrid sorghum seed. The offspring produced by crossing a 
male and female parent plant, each having a different genetic character. 
This offspring is the product intended for use by an agricultural 
producer to produce a commercial field sorghum crop for grain or forage.

[[Page 146]]

    County yield. An amount contained in the actuarial documents that is 
established by FCIC to represent the yield that a producer of hybrid 
sorghum seed would be expected to produce if the acreage had been 
planted to commercial field sorghum.
    Coverage level factor. A factor contained in the Special Provisions 
to adjust the county yield for commercial field sorghum to reflect the 
higher value of hybrid sorghum seed.
    Dollar value per bushel. An amount that determines the value of any 
seed production to count. It is determined by dividing the amount of 
insurance per acre by the result of multiplying the approved yield by 
the coverage level percentage, expressed as a decimal.
    Female parent plants. Sorghum plants that are grown for the purpose 
of producing commercial hybrid sorghum seed and are male sterile.
    Field run. Commercial hybrid sorghum seed production before it has 
been processed or screened.
    Good farming practices. In addition to the definition contained in 
the Basic Provisions, good farming practices include those practices 
required by the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract.
    Harvest. Combining, threshing or picking of the female parent plants 
to obtain commercial hybrid sorghum seed.
    Hybrid sorghum seed processor contract. An agreement executed in 
writing between the hybrid sorghum seed crop producer and a seed company 
containing, at a minimum:
    (a) The producer's promise to plant and grow male and female parent 
plants, and to deliver all commercial hybrid sorghum seed produced from 
such plants to the seed company;
    (b) The seed company's promise to purchase the commercial hybrid 
sorghum seed produced by the producer; and
    (c) Either a fixed price per unit of measure (bushels, 
hundredweight, etc.) of the commercial hybrid sorghum seed or a formula 
to determine the value of such seed. Any formula for establishing the 
value must be based on data provided by a public third party that 
establishes or provides pricing information to the general public, based 
on prices paid in the open market (e.g., commodity futures exchanges), 
to be acceptable for the purpose of this policy.
    Inadequate germination. Germination of less than 80 percent of the 
commercial hybrid sorghum seed as determined by using a certified seed 
test.
    Insurable interest. Your share of the financial loss that occurs in 
the event seed production is damaged by a cause of loss specified in 
section 10.
    Local market price. The cash price offered by buyers for any 
production from the female parent plants that is not considered 
commercial hybrid sorghum seed under the terms of this policy.
    Male parent plants. Sorghum plants grown for the purpose of 
pollinating female parent plants.
    Minimum guaranteed payment. A minimum amount (usually stated in 
dollars or bushels) specified in your hybrid sorghum seed processor 
contract that will be paid or credited to you by the seed company 
regardless of the quantity of seed produced.
    Non-seed production. Production that does not qualify as seed 
production because of inadequate germination.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, the insured crop must be planted in rows wide enough 
to permit mechanical cultivation, unless provided by the Special 
Provisions or by written agreement.
    Planting pattern. The arrangement of the rows of the male and female 
parent plants in a field. An example of a planting pattern is four 
consecutive rows of female parent plants followed by two consecutive 
rows of male parent plants.
    Practical to replant. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, practical to replant applies to either the female or 
male parent plant. It will not be considered practical to replant unless 
production from the replanted acreage can be delivered under the terms 
of the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract, or the seed company 
agrees that it will accept the production from the replanted acreage.
    Prevented planting. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, prevented planting applies to the female and male 
parent plants. The male parent plants must be planted in accordance with 
the requirements of the hybrid sorghum seed processor contract to be 
considered planted.
    Sample. For the purpose of the certified seed test, at least 3 
pounds of randomly selected field run sorghum seed for each type or 
variety of commercial hybrid sorghum seed grown on the unit.
    Seed company. A business enterprise that possesses all licenses for 
marketing commercial hybrid sorghum seed required by the state in which 
it is domiciled or operates, and which possesses facilities with enough 
storage and drying capacity to accept and process the insured crop 
within a reasonable amount of time after harvest. If the seed company is 
the insured, it must also be a corporation.
    Seed production. All seed produced by female parent plants with a 
germination rate of at least 80 percent as determined by a certified 
seed test.
    Type. Grain sorghum, forage sorghum, or sorghum sudan parent plants.
    Variety. The name, number or code assigned to a specific genetic 
cross by the seed

[[Page 147]]

company or the Special Provisions for the insured crop in the county.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) For any processor contract that stipulates the amount of 
production to be delivered:
    (1) In lieu of the definition of ``basic unit'' contained in the 
Basic Provisions, a basic unit will consist of all acreage planted to 
the insured crop in the county that will be used to fulfill a hybrid 
sorghum seed processor contract;
    (2) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production 
contracted with each processor contract;
    (3) In accordance with section 12, all production from any basic 
unit in excess of the amount under contract will be included as 
production to count if such production is applied to any other basic 
unit for which the contracted amount has not been fulfilled; and
    (4) Optional units will not be established.
    (b) For any processor contract that stipulates a number of acres to 
be planted, the provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional 
units by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the hybrid 
sorghum seed in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by type or variety, in 
which case you may elect one price election for each hybrid sorghum seed 
type or variety designated in the Special Provisions. The price election 
you choose for each type or variety must have the same percentage 
relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type or 
variety. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price 
election for one specific type or variety, you must also choose 100 
percent of the maximum price election for all other types or varieties.
    (b) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of 
the Basic Provisions are not applicable to this contract.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must:
    (a) Report by type and variety, the location and insurable acreage 
of the insured crop;
    (b) Report any acreage that is uninsured, including that portion of 
the total acreage occupied by male parent plants; and
    (c) Certify that you have a hybrid sorghum seed processor contract 
and report the amount, if any, of any minimum guaranteed payment.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the female parent plants in the county for which a 
premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are grown under a hybrid sorghum seed processor contract 
executed before the acreage reporting date;
    (3) That are planted for harvest as commercial hybrid sorghum seed 
in accordance with the requirements of the hybrid sorghum seed processor 
contract and the production management practices of the seed company; 
and
    (4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Planted with a mixture of female and male parent seed in the 
same row;
    (ii) Planted for any purpose other than for commercial hybrid 
sorghum seed;
    (iii) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (iv) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) An instrument in the form of a ``lease'' under which you retain 
control of the acreage on which the insured crop is grown and that 
provides for delivery of the crop under substantially the same terms as 
a hybrid sorghum seed processor contract will be treated as a contract 
under which you have an insurable interest in the crop.
    (c) A commercial hybrid sorghum seed producer who is also a 
commercial hybrid sorghum seed company may be able to insure the hybrid 
sorghum seed crop if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The seed company has an insurable interest in the hybrid sorghum 
seed crop;
    (2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors of the 
seed company has executed and adopted a corporate resolution containing 
the same terms as an acceptable hybrid sorghum seed processor contract. 
This corporate resolution will be considered a contract under the terms 
of this policy;
    (3) Sales records for at least the previous years' seed production 
must be provided to confirm that the seed company has produced and sold 
seed. If such records are not available, the crop may be insured under 
the

[[Page 148]]

Coarse Grains Crop Provisions with a written agreement; and
    (4) Our inspection reveals that the storage and drying facilities 
satisfy the definition of a seed company.
    (d) Any of the insured crop that is under contract with different 
seed companies may be insured under separate policies with different 
insurance providers provided all acreage of the insured crop in the 
county is insured. If you elect to insure the insured crop with 
different insurance providers, you agree to pay separate administrative 
fees for each insurance policy.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, 
we will not insure any acreage of the insured crop:
    (a) Planted and occupied exclusively by male parent plants;
    (b) Not in compliance with the rotation requirements contained in 
the Special Provisions or, if applicable, required by the hybrid sorghum 
seed processor contract; or
    (c) If either the female or male parent plants are damaged before 
the final planting date and we determine that insured crop is practical 
to replant but it is not replanted.

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance attaches upon completion of planting of:
    (1) The female parent plant seed on or before the final planting 
date designated in the Special Provisions, except as allowed in section 
16 of the Basic Provisions; and
    (2) The male parent plant seed.
    (b) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the 
November 30 immediately following planting.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in section 10(a) (1) through (7) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due 
to:
    (1) The use of unadapted, incompatible, or genetically deficient 
male or female parent plant seed;
    (2) Frost or freeze after the date set by the Special Provisions;
    (3) Failure to follow the requirements stated in the hybrid sorghum 
seed processor contract and production management practices of the seed 
company;
    (4) Inadequate germination, even if resulting from an insured cause 
of loss, unless you have provided adequate notice as required by section 
11(b)(1); or
    (5) Failure to plant the male parent plant seed at a time or in a 
manner sufficient to assure adequate pollination of the female parent 
plants, unless you are prevented from planting the male parent plant 
seed by an insured cause of loss.

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must leave representative samples of at least one 
complete planting pattern of the male and female parent plant rows that 
extend the entire length of each field in the unit. If you are going to 
destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be harvested, the 
samples must not be destroyed until after our inspection.
    (b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) You must give us notice of probable loss at least 15 days before 
the beginning of harvest if you anticipate inadequate germination on any 
unit; and
    (2) You must provide a completed copy of your hybrid sorghum seed 
processor contract unless we have determined it has already been 
provided by the seed company, and the seed company certifies that such 
contract is used for all its producers without any waivers or 
amendments.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) You will not receive an indemnity payment on a unit if the seed 
company refuses to provide us with records we require to determine the 
dollar value per bushel of production for each variety.

[[Page 149]]

    (c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective amount of 
insurance per acre, by type and variety if applicable;
    (2) Totaling the results of section 12(c)(1) if there are more than 
one type or variety;
    (3) Multiplying the total seed production to count (see section 
12(d)) for each type and variety of commercial hybrid sorghum seed by 
the applicable dollar value per bushel for that type or variety;
    (4) Multiplying the total non-seed production to count (see section 
12(e)) for each type and variety by the applicable local market price 
determined on the earlier of the date the non-seed production is sold or 
the date of final inspection;
    (5) Totaling the results of sections 12(c)(3) and 12(c)(4) by type 
and variety;
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 12(c)(5) from the result of 
section 12(c)(1) if there is only one type or variety, or subtracting 
the result of 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(2) if there are 
more than one type or variety; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(c)(6) by your share.
For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development 
of type ``A'' hybrid sorghum seed in the unit, with an amount of 
insurance per acre guarantee of $361 (county yield of 170 bushels times 
a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times 
a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed 
payment of zero). Your seed production was 1,400 bushels and the dollar 
value per bushel was $3.47. Your non-seed production was 100 bushels 
with a local market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be 
calculated as follows:
    (1) 50 acres x $361 = $18,050 amount of insurance guarantee;
    (3) 1,400 bushels x $3.47 = $4,858 value of seed production;
    (4) 100 bushels of non-seed x $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production;
    (5) $4,858 + $200 = $5,058;
    (6) $18,050 - $5,058 = $12,992; and
    (7) $12,992 x 100 percent share = $12,992 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the 
development of type ``B'' hybrid sorghum seed in the unit, with an 
amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $340 (county yield of 160 
bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent 
coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the 
minimum guaranteed payment of zero). You harvested 1,200 bushels and the 
dollar value per bushel for the harvested amount was $4.63. You also 
harvested 200 bushels of non-seed with a market value of $2.00 per 
bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 50 acres x $361 = $18,050 amount of insurance guarantee for type 
``A'' and 50 acres x $340 = $17,000 amount of insurance guarantee for 
type ``B'';
    (2) $18,050 + $17,000 = $35,050 amount of insurance guarantee;
    (3) 1,400 bushels x $3.47 = $4,858 value of seed production for type 
``A'' and 1,200 bushels x $4.63 = $5,556 value of seed production for 
type ``B'';
    (4) 100 bushels of non-seedx$2.00 = $200 of non-seed production for 
type ``A'' and 200 bushels of non-seed x $2.00 = $400 of non-seed 
production for type ``B''
    (5) $4,858 + $200 + $5,556 + $400 = $11,014 value of production to 
count;
    (6) $35,050 - $11,014 = $24,036; and
    (7) $24,036 x 100 percent share = $24,036 indemnity payment.
    (d) Production to be counted as seed production will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Mature unharvested production with a germination rate of at 
least 80 percent of the commercial hybrid sorghum seed as determined by 
a certified seed test. Any such production may be adjusted in accordance 
with section 12(f);
    (iv) Immature appraised production;
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or

[[Page 150]]

    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) Harvested production that you deliver as commercial hybrid 
sorghum seed to the seed company stated in your hybrid sorghum seed 
processor contract, regardless of quality, unless the production has 
inadequate germination.
    (e) Production to be counted as non-seed production will include all 
harvested or mature appraised production that does not qualify as seed 
production to count as specified in section 12(d). Any such production 
may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f).
    (f) For the purpose of determining the quantity of mature 
production:
    (1) Commercial hybrid sorghum seed production will be:
    (i) Increased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture 
below 13.0 percent; or
    (ii) Decreased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of 
moisture in excess of 13.0 percent.
    (2) When records of commercial hybrid sorghum seed production 
provided by the seed company have been adjusted to a basis of 13.0 
percent moisture and 56 pound avoirdupois bushels, section 12(f)(1) 
above will not apply to harvested production. In such cases, records of 
the seed company will be used to determine the amount of production to 
count, provided that the moisture and weight of such production are 
calculated on the same basis as that used to determine the approved 
yield.

                         13. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your amount 
of insurance for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, 
and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting 
coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

<R05>
Sec. 457.113  Coarse grains crop insurance provisions.

    The coarse grains crop insurance provisions for the 2003 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                      Coarse Grains Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Coarse grains-- Corn, grain sorghum, and soybeans.
    Grain sorghum-- The crop defined as sorghum under the United States 
Grain Standards Act.
    Harvest-- Combining, threshing, or picking the insured crop for 
grain, or cutting for hay, silage, or fodder.
    Local market price-- The cash grain price per bushel for the U.S. 
No. 2 yellow corn, U.S. No. 2 grain sorghum, or U.S. No. 1 soybeans, 
offered by buyers in the area in which you normally market the insured 
crop. The local market price will reflect the maximum limits of quality 
deficiencies allowable for the U.S. No. 2 grade for yellow corn and 
grain sorghum, or U.S. No. 1 grade for soybeans. Factors not associated 
with grading under the Official United States Standards for Grain, 
including but not limited to protein and oil, will not be considered.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, coarse grains must initially be planted in rows (corn 
must be planted in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical 
cultivation), unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, 
actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
    Production guarantee(per acre)--In lieu of the definition contained 
in the Basic Provisions, the number of bushels (tons for corn insured a 
silage) determined by multiplying the approved actual production history 
(APH) yield per acre, calculated in accordance with 7 CFR part 400, 
subpart G, by the coverage level percentage you elect.
    Silage-- A product that results from severing the plant from the 
land and chopping it for the purpose of livestock feed.
    Ton-- Two thousand (2000) pounds avoirdupois.

  2. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) you may select:
    (1) For grain sorghum and soybeans, only one price election for each 
crop in the county insured under this policy; and
    (2) For corn, only one price election for all the corn in the county 
insured as grain under this policy, and only one price election for all 
the corn in the county insured as silage under this policy. The price 
elections you choose for grain and silage must have the same percentage 
relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for grain

[[Page 151]]

and silage. For example, if you choose one hundred percent (100%) of the 
maximum grain price election and you also insure corn on a silage basis, 
you must choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum silage price 
election.
    (b) For corn only, if you harvest the crop in a manner other than 
the manner you reported (for example, you reported grain but harvested 
as silage) and you did not select a price election for the type 
harvested, we will assign a price election for the type harvested that 
bears the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election you 
selected for the type reported (for example, if you selected a grain 
price election in the amount of eighty percent (80%) of the maximum 
price election for grain and you did not select a silage price election, 
we will assign a silage price election in the amount of eighty percent 
(80%) of the maximum price election for silage specified in the Special 
Provisions if you harvest for silage). This assigned price election will 
be used only to determine the dollar value of production to count for 
indemnity purposes and will not be used to determine the amount of 
insurance or premium.

                           3. Contract Changes

    The contract change date is November 30 (December 17 for the 1998

                             5. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be each coarse grain crop 
you elect to insure for which premium rates are provided by the 
actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That is adapted to the area based on days to maturity and is 
compatible with agronomic and weather conditions in the area; and
    (3) That is not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in paragraph 
5(b)(1); or
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) For corn only, in addition to the provisions of subsection 5(a), 
the corn crop insured will be all corn that is:
    (1) Planted for harvest either as grain or as silage (see subsection 
5(c)). A mixture of corn and sorghum (grain or forage-type) will be 
insured as corn silage if the sorghum does not constitute more than 
twenty percent (20%) of the plants;
    (2) Yellow dent or white corn, including mixed yellow and white, 
waxy or high-lysine corn, and excluding:
    (i) High-amylose, high-oil, high-protein, flint, flour, Indian, or 
blue corn, or a variety genetically adapted to provide forage for 
wildlife or any other open pollinated corn, unless a written agreement 
allows insurance of such excluded crops.
    (ii) A variety of corn adapted for silage use only when the corn is 
reported for insurance as grain.
    (c) For corn only, if the actuarial documents for the county provide 
a premium rate for:

[[Page 152]]

    (1) Both grain and silage, all insurable acreage will be insured as 
the type or types reported by you on or before the acreage reporting 
date;
    (2) Grain but not silage, all insurable acreage will be insured as 
grain unless a written agreement allows insurance on all or a portion of 
the insurable acreage as silage; or
    (3) Silage but not grain, all insurable corn acreage will be insured 
as silage unless a written agreement allows insurance on all or a 
portion of the insurable acreage as grain.
    (d) For grain sorghum only, in addition to the provisions of 
subsection 5(a), the grain sorghum crop insured will be all of the grain 
sorghum in the county:
    (1) That is planted for harvest as grain;
    (2) That is a combine-type hybrid grain sorghum (grown from hybrid 
seed); and
    (3) That is not a dual-purpose type of grain sorghum (a type used 
for both grain and forage), unless a written agreement allows insurance 
of such grain sorghum.
    (e) For soybeans only, in addition to the provisions of subsection 
5(a), the soybean crop insured will be all of the soybeans in the county 
that are planted for harvest as beans.

                          6. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, 
any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, 
to the extent that a majority of producers in the area would not 
normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agreee 
that it is not practical to replant.

                           7. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions under section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar date for the 
end of the insurance period is the date immediately following planting 
as follows:

(a) For corn insured as grain:

   states.
(d) For soybeans: All states..................  December 10.
 

                            8. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss which occur within the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if applicable, due to an 
unavoidable cause of loss occurring within the insurance period.

                         9. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, 
replanting payments for coarse grains are allowed if the coarse grains 
are damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the 
remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production 
guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of twenty percent (20%) of the production guarantee or the 
number of bushels (tons for corn insured as silage) set out herein, 
multiplied by your price election multiplied by your insured share or 
the share determined under 9(c), if applicable. The number of bushels or 
tons are 8 bushels for corn grain; 1 ton for corn silage; 7 bushels for 
grain sorghum; and 3 bushels for soybeans.
    (c) When more than one person insures the same crop on a share 
basis, a replanting payment based on the total shares insured by us may 
be made to the insured person who incurs the total cost of replanting. 
Payment will be made in this manner only if an agreement exists between 
the insured persons which:
    (1) Requires one person to incur the entire cost of replanting; or
    (2) Gives the right to all replanting payments to one person.

[[Page 153]]

    (d) When the insured crop is replanted using a practice that is 
uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be 
reduced by the amount of the replanting payment which is attributable to 
your share. The premium amount will not be reduced.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if you 
initially discover damage to any insured crop within 15 days of or 
during harvest, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested 
crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 feet wide and 
extend the entire length of each field in the unit, and must not be 
harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days 
after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.
    (b) For any corn unit that has separate dates for the end of the 
insurance period (grain and silage):
    (1) In lieu of paragraph 14.(a)(2) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), if damage occurs:
    (i) Before the earliest end of insurance period date (grain or 
silage), you must give us notice within 72 hours of your initial 
discovery of damage (but not later than 15 days after that earliest end 
of insurance period date); or
    (ii) If damage does not occur before the earliest end of insurance 
period date (grain or silage), but occurs before the latest end of 
insurance period date (grain or silage), you must give notice within 72 
hours of your initial discovery of damage (but not later than 15 days 
after that latest end of insurance period date).
    (2) In lieu of subsection 14.(c) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), in addition to complying with all other notice 
requirements, you must submit a claim for indemnity declaring the amount 
of your loss not later than 60 days after the latest date for the end of 
insurance period for the unit. This claim must include all the 
information we require to settle the claim.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide records of production:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit:
    (1) For grain sorghum and soybeans by:
    (i) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
    (ii) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
    (iii) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
    (iv) Multiplying this result by your share.
    (2) For corn by:
    (i) Multiplying the insured acreage of each type (grain/silage) by 
the production guarantee for the applicable type;
    (ii) Multiplying each result by the price election for the 
applicable type;
    (iii) Adding these values;
    (iv) Multiplying the production to count of each type (see 
subsection 11(d)) by the price election for that type (see the 
provisions under section 2 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and 
Prices for Determining Indemnities));
    (v) Adding these dollar values;
    (vi) Subtracting the result of step (v) from the result of step 
(iii); and
    (vii) Multiplying the result by your share.
    (c) The total production in bushels (tons for corn silage) (see 
subsection 11(d)) to count from all insurable acreage on the unit will 
include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
subsection 11(e)); and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to 
another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care for, if you and we 
agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement the 
insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to 
another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of 
production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop we may give 
you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will

[[Page 154]]

be used to determine the amount of production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) The production to count for corn will be in bushels for grain 
and in tons for silage as follows:
    (1) For harvested acreage, according to the method of harvest; and
    (2) For unharvested acreage, according to the information contained 
on your acreage report;

except as otherwise provided in paragraph 11(c)(1).
    (e) Mature coarse grain production (excluding corn insured or 
harvested as silage) may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality 
deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable it will be made prior 
to any adjustment for quality. Corn insured or harvested as silage will 
be adjusted for excess moisture and quality only as specified in 
subsection 11(f).
    (1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 
percentage point of moisture in excess of:
    (i) Fifteen percent (15%) for corn (If moisture exceeds 30 percent 
(30%), production will be reduced 0.2 percent for each 0.1 percentage 
point above 30 percent (30%));
    (ii) Fourteen percent (14%) for grain sorghum; and
    (iii) Thirteen percent (13%) for soybeans.
    We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture 
content.
    (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United 
States Standards for Grain, result in:
    (A) Corn not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades 
U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight or kernel damage (excluding 
heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable 
foreign odor;
    (B) Grain sorghum not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 
(grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage 
(excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially 
objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor), or meets the special 
grade requirements for smutty grain sorghum; or
    (C) Soybeans not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 
(grades U.S. Sample grade) because of test weight or kernel damage 
(excluding heat damage) or having a musty, sour, or commercially 
objectionable foreign odor (except garlic odor), or which meet the 
special grade requirements for garlicky soybeans; or
    (ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the 
Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the 
United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop 
provisions;
    (ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us;
    (iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, 
which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed 
by:
    (A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or
    (C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed 
by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    (4) Coarse grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, 
as specified in paragraphs 11.(e) (2) and (3), will be reduced by the 
quality adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions.
    (f) For corn insured or harvested as silage:
    (1) Whenever our appraisal of grain content is less than 4.5 bushels 
of grain per ton of silage, the silage production will be reduced by 1 
percentage point for each 0.1(1/10) of a bushel less than 4.5 bushels 
per ton (If we cannot make a grain appraisal before harvest and you do 
not leave a representative unharvested sample, in accordance with the 
policy no reduction for grain-deficient silage will be made.); and
    (2) If the normal silage harvesting period has ended, or for any 
acreage harvested as silage or appraised as silage after September 30 of 
the crop year we may increase the silage production to count to 65 
percent (65%) moisture equivalent to reflect the normal moisture content 
of silage harvested during the normal silage harvesting period.
    (g) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop 
may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

                         12. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted aceage. if you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Amount of insurance--The result of multiplying the highest monthly 
market value reported on the nursery plant inventory summary (including 
inventory reported by you and accepted by us on a revised nursery plant 
inventory summary) by .9, multiplied by the percentage for the coverage 
level you elect.
    Brownout--A reduction in electric power that affects the unit.
    Crop year--The 12 month period beginning October 1 and extending 
through September 30 of the next calendar year, designated by the year 
in which it ends. (The 1996 crop year begins October 1, 1995, and ends 
September 30, 1996).
    Crop year loss deductible--The value calculated by multiplying the 
highest monthly market value reported on the nursery plant inventory 
summary by .9 and subtracting from this product the amount of insurance.
    Field market value A--Ninety percent (90%) of the wholesale market 
value for the insured plants in the unit immediately prior to the 
occurrence of the loss.
    Field market value B--Ninety percent (90%) of the wholesale market 
value remaining for the insurable plants in the unit immediately 
following the occurrence of the loss as determined by our appraisal 
conducted as soon as reasonably possible after the loss is reported.
    Irrigated practice--In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic 
Provisions, a method of producing a crop by which water is artificially 
applied during the growing season by appropriate systems and at the 
proper times, with the intention of providing the quanity of water 
needed to maintain the amount of insurance on the nursery plant 
inventory.
    Largest dimension--The distance measured at the top of the standard 
nursery container from one side directly across to the opposite at the 
widest point.
    Monthly loss deductible--The smaller of: (1) The highest monthly 
market value reported on the nursery plant inventory summary multiplied 
by .9; or (2) field market value A; multiplied by the number derived by 
subtracting the coverage level percent from one hundred percent (100%), 
not to exceed the crop year loss deductible.
    Monthly market value--The dollar amount determined by multiplying 
the quantity of each insurable plant by its wholesale market value for 
that month, less the maximum discount (stated in dollar terms) granted 
to any buyer, and totalling the resulting values for all insurable 
plants in the unit.
    Nursery--A business enterprise that produces ornamental plants in 
standard nursery containers for the wholesale market.
    Nursery eligible plant listing--A listing contained in the Actuarial 
Table that specifies the plants eligible for insurance and any mandatory 
or recommended storage required for such plants in each hardiness zone 
defined by the United States Department of Agriculture.
    Nursery plant inventory summary--A report that specifies the 
numbers, growing locations, and wholesale prices of plants included in 
the nursery inventory.
    Standard nursery containers--Rigid containers not less than three 
(3) inches across the largest dimension at the top of the container, and 
which are appropriate in size and with proper drainage holes for the 
plant contained. Grow bags, trays, cellpacks, and burlap are not 
standard nursery containers under these crop provisions.
    Stock plants--Plants used for reproduction, for growing cuttings, 
for air layering or for propagating.
    Wholesale market value--The total dollar valuation of the insurable 
plants actually contained within the unit at any time. The values used 
will be based on your wholesale price list if properly supported by your 
records, less the maximum discount (stated in dollar terms) granted to 
any buyer.

                            2. Unit Division

    In lieu of the definition of ``basic unit'' and section 34 of the 
Basic Provisions, a unit consists of all growing locations in the county 
within a five mile radius of the named insured locations designated on 
your nursery

[[Page 156]]

plant inventory summary. Any growing location more than five miles from 
any other growing location, but within the county, may be designated as 
a separate basic unit or be included in the closest unit listed on your 
nursery plant inventory summary.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) are not applicable to 
the Nursery Crop Provisions.

                           4. Contract Changes

    The contract change date is June 30 preceding the crop year (see the 
provisions of section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8)).

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 ( Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are September 30 preceding the crop year.

                   6. Nursery Plant Inventory Summary

    (a) Section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8) is not applicable to the Nursery Crop Provisions.
    (b) You must submit a nursery plant inventory summary to us on or 
before September 30 preceding the crop year.
    (c) The nursery plant inventory summary is a projection of the 
expected inventory for the following 12 months. This summary must 
include, by unit and by month for each type of plant in the inventory, 
the:
    (1) Container sizes, as measured at the largest dimension at the top 
of the container;
    (2) Number of plants;
    (3) Wholesale price for each month of the crop year; and
    (4) Your share.
    If your inventory usually changes within a specific month, report 
the largest inventory that you expect to have for that month.
    (d) Your annual nursery plant inventory summary will be used to 
determine your premium and the amount of insurance for each unit. If you 
do not submit the summary by the reporting date, we may elect to 
determine the nursery plant inventory for each unit or we may deny 
liability on any unit. Errors in reporting units may be corrected by us 
at the time of loss adjustment.
    (e) Your wholesale price list may be examined to determine whether 
the prices listed are reasonable. If the prices are determined to be 
unreasonable, the previous acceptable wholesale price list will be used 
or we may establish the wholesale price for each type of plant.
    (f) With our consent, you may revise your reported nursery plant 
inventory summary to correct or change the value of the insurable 
inventory if the amount of the revision is at least ten percent (10%) of 
the highest monthly market value reported on the nursery plant inventory 
summary or $25,000, whichever is smaller, or if a new plant species is 
being added that was not originally reported on your nursery plant 
inventory summary or was approved by written agreement. If you wish to 
revise the nursery plant inventory summary, you must notify us in 
writing at least 14 days before a change in inventory value. We must 
inspect and accept the nursery before insurance attaches on any proposed 
increase in inventory if:
    (1) The storage facilities have changed in any way since our 
previous inspection; or
    (2) The revision includes plants that have specific over-wintering 
storage requirements and that were not previously reported on your 
nursery plant inventory summary.
    (g) You may not revise your nursery plant inventory summary after 
the sales closing date to add plants not listed on the Nursery Eligible 
Plant Listing unless a request for a written agreement to add such 
plants has been submitted by the sales closing date.
    (h) Insurable plants that are not reported on your nursery plant 
inventory summary will not be insured, but the value of such plants 
after a loss will be included as production to count. Such unreported 
inventory may reduce the amount of any indemnity payable to you.
    (i) You must designate separately any plant inventory that is not 
insurable.

                            7. Annual Premium

    We will determine your premium as follows:
    (a) The annual premium for each unit will be calculated by:
    (1) Determing the total value of each plant type and container size 
designated on your nursery plant inventory summary for each month by 
multiplying the number of plants by the price for that type and 
container size shown on your accepted wholesale price list for that 
month, less the maximum discount (stated in dollar terms) granted to any 
buyer, and totalling the resulting values for each separate 
classification shown on the actuarial table;
    (2) Adding the total values of all plant types and container sizes 
(determined in (1) above) for each month separately to determine the 
monthly market values. Then compare the resulting twelve (12) monthly 
market values to determine the highest monthly market value for the crop 
year;
    (3) Taking the total value of each plant type and container size 
obtained in (1) above for the month having the highest monthly

[[Page 157]]

market value for the crop year (determined in (2) above) for each 
classification specified in the actuarial table and multiplying these 
values by .9, then multiplying the results by the percentage coverage 
level you have elected;
    (4) Multiplying each product obtained in (3) above by the 
appropriate premium rate listed on the actuarial table;
    (5) Adding the products obtained in (4) above; and
    (6) Multiplying the total obtained in (5) above by your share.
    (b) The annual premium will be earned in full when insurance 
attaches. It is due and payable as follows:
    (1) Forty percent (40%) on the later of September 30 preceding each 
crop year or the date we accept the inventory for insurance;
    (2) Thirty percent (30%) on January 1 of the crop year; and
    (3) Thirty percent (30%) on April 1 of the crop year.
    (c) Additional premium earned from an increase in the nursery plant 
inventory summary is due and payable when the revised nursery plant 
inventory summary is approved by us.
    (d) Premium will not be reduced due to a decrease in the nursery 
plant inventory summary, unless such decrease results from the deletion 
of uninsurable inventory from the summary that was erroneously reported 
as insurable.

                            8. Insured Plants

    In lieu of the provisions of section 8 (Insured Crop) and section 9 
(Insurable Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the insured 
nursery plant inventory will be all nursery plants in the county 
reported by you or determined by us for which an application is 
accepted, a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents, and 
that:
    (a) Are grown under an irrigated practice for which you have 
adequate facilities and water at the time coverage begins in order to 
carry out a good irrigation practice;
    (b) Are classified as woody, herbaceous, or foliage landscape 
plants;
    (c) Do not include plants that produce edible berries, fruits, or 
nuts;
    (d) Are grown in standard nursery containers;
    (e) Are grown in an appropriate growing medium;
    (f) Are inspected by us and determined to be acceptable;
    (g) Are listed on the Nursery Eligible Plant Listing unless a 
written agreement provides otherwise;
    (h) Are not stock plants;
    (i) Are grown in accordance with the production practices for which 
premium rates have been established; and
    (j) Meet the ``mandatory'' or ``recommended'' storage requirements, 
unless you have applied for and received the Frost/ Freeze, and Cold 
Damage Exclusion Option for those nursery plants.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), coverage begins on each unit or part of a 
unit the later of October 1 or the date we accept the inventory for 
insurance, provided you have complied with the terms of paragraph 
7.(b)(1). Coverage will not attach for plant inventory added due to a 
revised nursery plant inventory summary until any additional premium is 
paid in full. Insurance ends for each unit at the earliest of:
    (a) The date all plant inventory within the unit is sold or 
otherwise removed unless that inventory is replaced and additional 
earned premium is paid (If a portion of the plants are sold or otherwise 
removed from inventory, and are not replaced, insurance only ends on 
that part of the unit.);
    (b) The date of final adjustment of a loss on the unit when the 
total indemnities paid for the unit equal the amount of insurance for 
that unit; or
    (c) September 30 of the crop year.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided for 
unavoidable damage caused only by the following causes of loss which 
occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, except as specified in (b)(4);
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption;
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, due to an unavoidable 
cause of loss occurring within the insurance period; or
    (9) Frost or freeze if there is a failure or breakdown of frost/
freeze protection equipment or facilities and the failure or breakdown 
is directly caused by an insurable cause of loss, provided the insured 
nursery plants are damaged by freezing temperatures within 72 hours 
after the failure of such equipment or facilities and you establish that 
repair or replacement was not possible between the time of failure or 
breakdown and the time the freezing temperatures occurred.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we do not insure against 
any loss caused by:

[[Page 158]]

    (1) Brownout;
    (2) Failure of the power supply unless such failure is due to an 
insurable cause of loss;
    (3) The inability to market the nursery plants as a direct result of 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;
    (4) Fire, where weeds and other forms of undergrowth in the vicinity 
of the building and on your property have not been controlled; or
    (5) Collapse or failure of buildings or structures.

                11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to your duties contained under section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must:
    (a) Obtain our written consent prior to:
    (1) Destroying, selling or otherwise disposing of any plant 
inventory that is damaged; or
    (2) Changing or discontinuing your normal growing practices with 
respect to care and maintenance of the insured plant inventory.
    (b) Upon our request, provide complete copies of your nursery plant 
inventory wholesale price list for the 12 month period immediately 
preceding the loss and your marketing records including plant shipping 
invoices for the same period.
    (c) Submit a claim for indemnity to us on our form, not later than 
60 days after the earliest of:
    (1) The date of your loss; or
    (2) The end of the insurance period.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) The indemnity will be the amount calculated by us for each unit 
as follows:
    (1) Subtracting field market value B from the lesser of:
    (i) Field market value A; or
    (ii) The highest monthly market value for the unit reported on the 
nursery plant inventory summary multiplied by .9;
    (2) Subtracting the monthly loss deductible (not to exceed the 
remaining crop year loss deductible) from the product obtained in (1) 
above; and
    (3) Multiplying the result by your share.
    (b) Individual insured losses occurring on the same unit during the 
crop year may be accumulated if each loss is reported and valued by us 
to satisfy the crop year loss deductible. Paragraph 12.(a)(2) will not 
apply to any subsequent individual loss determinations when the total 
amount of accumulated monthly loss deductibles is equal to or greater 
than the crop year loss deductible. Total indemnities for a unit will 
not exceed the amount of insurance for the unit.
    (c) The value of any insured plant inventory may be determined on 
the basis of our appraisals conducted after the end of the insurance 
period.

                     13. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

  2. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price 
election for all the sugarcane in the county insured under this policy.
    (b) Instead of reporting your sugarcane production for the previous 
crop year as required by subsection 3.(c) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), there is a lag period of one year and you are required to 
report production from two crop years previously, e.g., 1994 crop year 
production must be reported by the required date for the 1996 crop year.

                          3. Contract Changes.

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
the contract change date is June 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  4. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
the cancellation and termination dates are September 30.

                            5. Insured Crop.

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the sugarcane in the county 
for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That is grown for processing for sugar or for seed; and
    (3) That is not interplanted with another crop, unless allowed by a 
written agreement.
    (b) In addition to the crop listed as not insured in section 8(b) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure any sugarcane:
    (1) That was damaged the previous crop year to the extent the 
sugarcane is unable to produce the yield used to establish the 
production guarantee for the unit for the current crop year; or
    (2) That exceeds the age limitations (by variety, if applicable) 
contained in the Special Provisions , unless we agree in writing to 
insure such acreage. An agreement in writing will not be provided 
unless, after an appraisal, we determine that the crop is able to 
produce at least the yield used to establish the production guarantee 
for the unit for the current crop year.

                          6. Insurable Acreage.

    Section 9(a)(3) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), is not 
applicable to the Sugarcane Crop Insurance Provisions.

                          7. Insurance Period.

    (a) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance attaches:

[[Page 160]]

    (1) On the later of the day we accept your application or at the 
time of planting for plant cane;
    (2) On the first day following harvest of the previous crop for 
stubble cane except as contained in sections 7(a)(3) and (4);
    (3) On the later of April 15 or 30 days following harvest of the 
previous crop for stubble cane damaged during the previous crop year in 
all states (except Louisiana); and
    (4) On the later of April 30 or 30 days following harvest of the 
previous crop for stubble cane damaged during the previous crop year in 
Louisiana.
    (b) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar date for the end of the insurance 
period is:
    (1) January 31 in Louisiana; and
    (2) April 30 in all other states.

                            8. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if applicable, due to an 
unavoidable cause of loss occurring within the insurance period.

 9. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss or Cutting the Sugarcane for 
                                  Seed

    (a) In addition to your duties under section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), in the event of damage or loss:
    (1) All sugarcane stubble must remain intact for our inspection; and
    (2) You must give us notice at least 15 days before you begin 
cutting any sugarcane for seed. Your notice must include the unit number 
and the number of acres you intend to harvest as seed. Failure to give 
us timely notice will cause the acreage cut for seed to be considered as 
put to another use without consent. The production to count for such 
acreage will not be less than the production guarantee.
    (3) You must request an appraisal if any time during the crop year 
sugarcane acreage cut for seed will not produce at least the production 
guarantee so we can determine the production to count. If you do not 
request an appraisal, the production to count for such acreage will be 
the production guarantee.
    (b) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if you 
initially discover damage to any insured crop within 15 days of, or 
during harvest, you must leave representative samples of the unharvested 
crop for our inspection. The representative samples of the unharvested 
crop must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each 
field in the unit. The stubble must not be destroyed and the required 
samples must not be harvested until the earlier of our inspection or 15 
days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.

                         10. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide records of production:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
    (2) Subtracting from this the total production to count;
    (3) Multiplying the remainder by your price election; and
    (4) Multiplying this result by your share.
    Example 1: Assume you have a 100 percent share in a unit of 100 
acres of sugarcane, an approved yield of 6,000 pounds of raw sugar per 
acre, a coverage election of 65 percent, and a price election of $0.12 a 
pound. The production guarantee would be 3,900 pounds of raw sugar per 
acre (6,000 x 65%). Further assume that you are only able to harvest 
200,000 pounds of raw sugar because the unit was damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 3,900 pound production guarantee = 390,000 pound 
production guarantee;
    (2) 390,000 pound production guarantee-200,000 pounds harvested 
production = 190,000 pound production loss;
    (3) 190,000 pound production loss x $0.12 price election = $22,800 
loss; and
    (4) $22,800 loss x 100 percent share = $22,800 indemnity payment.
    Example 2: Assume the same set of facts. Also, assume that you cut 
20 acres of this unit for seed without giving notice that you were 
cutting this acreage for seed and that you are only able to harvest 
200,000 pounds from the remaining 80 acres. Your indemnity would be 
calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 3,900 pound production guarantee = 390,000 pound 
production guarantee;

[[Page 161]]

    (2) 390,000 pound production guarantee-278,000 (200,000 pounds 
harvested production + 78,000 pounds production for putting acreage to 
another use without consent, (20 acres x 3,900 pound production 
guarantee per acre)) = 112,000 pound production loss;
    (3) 112,000 pound production loss x $0.12 price election = $13,440 
loss; and
    (4) $13,440 loss x 100 percent share = $13,440 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production (pounds of sugar) to count from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
    (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are 
acceptable to us; or
    (E) On which the sugarcane stubble is destroyed within 15 days after 
harvest is completed without our consent;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production;
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage harvested for seed (see 
section 9(a)(3));
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to 
another use or you wish to abandon and no longer care for, if you and we 
agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the 
insurance period for that acreage will end if you put the acreage to 
another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of 
production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us. (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count.); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from insurable acreage. Final records 
of sugar production will be used to determine the amount of production 
to count. Preliminary mill estimates will not be used.
    (d) Harvested sugarcane may be adjusted for low quality if it is 
damaged by one or more freezes occurring within the insurance period to 
the extent that it cannot be processed for sugar by the boiling house 
operation. The amount of production to count for such sugarcane will be 
determined by dividing the dollar value of the damaged production by the 
local market price per pound for raw sugar. The prices used for this 
adjustment will be determined on the earlier of the date such quality-
adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the 
unit.

                     11. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

exceeds the minimum required number of plants per square foot as shown 
in the Special Provisions.
    Air-dry forage--Forage that has dried in windrows by natural means 
to less than 13 percent moisture before being put into stacks or bales.
    Crop year--The period from the date insurance attaches until harvest 
is normally completed, which is designated by the calendar year in which 
the majority of the forage is normally harvested.
    Cutting. The severance of the forage plant from its roots.
    Direct marketing. Sale of the forage crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
shipper, buyer, or broker. An example of direct marketing is selling 
directly to other producers.

[[Page 162]]

    Fall planted. A forage crop seeded after June 30.
    Forage--Planted perennial alfalfa, perennial red clover, perennial 
grasses, or a mixture thereof, or other species as shown in the

of establishment may be available under the forage seeding policy. 
Insurance under this policy does not attach until after the year of 
establishment. The year of establishment is determined by the date of 
seeding. The year of establishment for spring planted forage is 
designated by the calendar year in which seeding occurred. The year of 
establishment for fall planted forage is designated by the calendar year 
after the year in which the crop was planted.

  2. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
         overage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may only select one price election for all the forage in the 
county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide 
different price elections by type, in which case you may select one 
price election for each forage type designated in the Special 
Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the 
same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each 
type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price 
election for a specific type, you must also choose 100 percent of the 
maximum price election for all other types.
    (b) You must report the total production harvested from insurable 
acreage for all cuttings for each unit by the production reporting date.
    (c) Separate guarantees will be determined by forage type, as 
applicable.

                           3. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is June 30 preceding

                            8. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss specifically excluded in 
section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage of 
loss of production that occurs after removal from the windrow.

                9. Duties in the event of Damage or Loss.

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the following will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have 
started if the insured crop will not be harvested;
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing unless you have records 
verifying that the forage was direct marketed. Failure to give timely 
notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in 
an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the 
production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability 
to make the required appraisal;
    (c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you previously 
gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions so 
that we may inspect the damaged production. You must not destroy the 
damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If 
you fail to meet the requirements of this section, and such failure 
results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all such 
production will be considered undamaged and will be included as 
production to count; and
    (d) You must notify us at least 5 days before grazing of insured 
forage begins so we can conduct an appraisal to determine production to 
count. Failure to give timely notice that the acreage will be grazed 
will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less 
than the production guarantee per acre.

                         10. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, by its respective 
production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election you selected;
    (3) Totaling the results of each crop type in section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if 
applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective price election you 
selected;
    (5) Totaling the results of each crop type in section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.

                                Example 1

    Assume you have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type A forage in 
the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price

[[Page 164]]

election of $65.00 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only able to 
harvest 50.0 tons. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    1. 100 acres type A x 3 tons = 300 ton guarantee;
    2 & 3. 300 tons x $65 price election = $19,500 total value 
guarantee;
    4 & 5. 50 tons production to count x $65 price election = $3,250 
total value of production to count;
    6. $19,500 value guarantee--$3,250 = $16,250 loss; and
    7. $16,250 x 100 percent share = $16,250 indemnity payment.

                                Example 2

    Assume you also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type B 
forage in the same unit, with a guarantee of 1.0 ton per acre and a 
price election of $50.00 per ton. Due to adverse weather you were only 
able to harvest 5.0 tons. Your total indemnity for forage production for 
both types A and B in the same unit would be calculated as follows:
    1. 100 acres x 3 tons = 300 ton guarantee for type A; and 100 acres 
x 1 ton = 100 ton guarantee for type B;
    2. 300 ton guarantee x $65 price election = $19,500 total value of 
the guarantee for type A; and 100 ton guarantee x $50 price election = 
$5,000 total value of the guarantee for type B;
    3. $19,500 + $5,000 = $24,500 total value of the guarantee;
    4. 50 tons x $65 price election = $3,250 total value of production 
to count for type A; and 5 tons x $50 price election = $250 total value 
of production to count for type B;
    5. $3,250 + $250 = $ 3,500 total value of production to count for 
types A and B;
    6. $24,500--$3,500 = $21,000 loss; and
    7. $21,000 loss x 100 percent share = $21,000 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production;
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached 
and:
    (A) You do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give 
you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) You elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) When forage is harvested as other than air-dry forage, the 
production to count will be adjusted to the equivalent of air-dry 
forage.
    (e) Any harvested production from plants growing in the forage will 
be counted as forage on a weight basis.
    (f) In addition to the provisions of section 15 (Production Included 
in Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we may 
determine the amount of production of any unharvested forage on the 
basis of our field appraisals conducted after the normal time for each 
cutting for the area.

                     11. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

Sec. 457.118  Malting barley crop insurance.

    The malting barley crop insurance provisions for the 1996 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

Small Grains Crop Insurance Malting Barley Price and Quality Endorsement

(This is a continuous endorsement. Refer to section 2 of the Common Crop 
Insurance Policy.)
    In return for your payment of premium for the coverage contained 
herein, this endorsement will be attached to and made part of the Common 
Crop Insurance Policy (Sec. 457.8) and Small Grains Crop Provisions 
(Sec. 457.101),

[[Page 165]]

subject to the terms and conditions described herein.
    1. You must have the Common Crop Insurance Policy (Sec. 457.8) and 
the Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions (Sec. 457.101) in force to 
elect to insure malting barley under this endorsement.
    2. You must select either Option A or Option B on or before the 
sales closing date. Failure to select either Option A or Option B, or if 
you elect Option B but fail to have a malting barley contract in effect 
by the acreage reporting date, will result in no coverage under this 
endorsement for the applicable crop year. If you elect coverage under 
Option A, and subsequently enter into a malting barley contract, your 
coverage will continue under the terms of Option A. Your selection 
(Option A or B) will continue from year to year unless you cancel or 
change your selection on or before the sales closing date.
    3. You must select either an additional value price election or a 
percentage of the maximum additional value price election on or before 
the sales closing date. The percentage of the maximum additional value 
price election you select does not have to be the same as that selected 
under the Small Grains Crop Provisions for feed barley. In the event 
that you choose a percentage of the maximum additional value price 
election, we will multiply that percentage by the maximum additional 
value price election specified in Option A or B to determine the 
additional value price election that pertains to your contract.
    4. The additional premium amount for this coverage will be 
determined by multiplying your malting barley production guarantee per 
acre by your selected additional value price election, times the premium 
rate stated in the Actuarial Table, times the acreage planted to 
approved malting barley varieties, times your share at the time coverage 
begins.
    5. In addition to the reporting requirements contained in section 6 
of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (Sec. 457.8), you must provide the 
information required by the Option you select.
    6. In lieu of the provisions regarding units and unit division in 
the Common Crop Insurance Policy (Sec. 457.8) and the Small Grains Crop 
Provisions (Sec. 457.101), all barley acreage in the county that is 
planted to malting varieties that is insurable under the Small Grains 
Crop Provisions for feed barley and your selected Option must be insured 
under this endorsement and will be considered as one unit regardless of 
whether such acreage is owned, rented for cash, or rented for a share of 
the crop. The producer's shares in the malting barley acreage to be 
insured under this endorsement must be designated on the acreage report.
    7. In lieu of the provisions in the Common Crop Insurance Policy 
(Sec. 457.8) that requires us to pay your loss within 30 days after we 
reach agreement with you, whenever any production fails one or more of 
the quality criteria specified herein, the claim may not be settled 
until the earlier of:
    (a) The date you sell, feed, donate, or otherwise utilize such 
production for any purpose; or
    (b) May 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar 
year in which the insured malting barley is normally harvested.
    If the production meets all quality criteria contained herein or 
grades U.S. No. 4 or lower in accordance with the grades and grade 
requirements for the subclasses Six-rowed and Two-rowed barley, and for 
the class Barley in accordance with the Official United States Standards 
for Grain, the claim will be settled within 30 days in accordance with 
the Common Crop Insurance Policy (Sec. 457.8).
    8. This endorsement does not provide additional prevented planting 
coverage. Such coverage is only provided in accordance with the 
provisions of the Small Grain Crop Provisions for feed barley.
    9. Production from all acreage insured under this endorsement and 
any production of feed barley varieties must not be commingled prior to 
our making all determinations necessary for the purposes of this 
insurance. Failure to keep production separate may result in denial of 
your claim for indemnity.
    10. Definitions:
    (a) APH. Actual production history as determined in accordance with 
7 CFR part 400, subpart G.
    (b) Approved malting variety. A variety of barley specified as such 
in the Special Provisions.
    (c) Brewery. A facility where malt beverages are commercially 
produced for human consumption.
    (d) Contracted production. A quantity of barley the producer agrees 
to grow and deliver, and the buyer agrees to accept, under the terms of 
the malting barley contract.
    (e) Licensed grain grader. A person authorized by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture to inspect and grade barley under the U.S. 
Standards for malt barley.
    (f) Malting barley contract. An agreement in writing between the 
producer and a brewery or a business enterprise that produces or sells 
malt or processed mash to a brewery, or a business enterprise owned by 
such brewery or business, that contains the amount of contracted 
production, the purchase price, or a method to determine such price, and 
other such terms that establish the obligations of each party to the 
agreement.

[[Page 166]]

    (g) Objective test. A determination made by a qualified person using 
standardized equipment that is widely used in the malting industry, and 
following a procedure approved by the American Society of Brewing 
Chemists when determining percent germination or protein content; 
grading performed by following a procedure approved by the Federal Grain 
Inspection Service when determining quality factors other than percent 
germination or protein content; or by the Food and Drug Administration 
when determining concentrations of mycotoxins or other substances or 
conditions that are identified as being injurious to human or animal 
health.
    (h) Subjective test. A determination made by a person using 
olfactory, visual, touch or feel, masticatory, or other senses unless 
performed by a licensed grain grader; or that uses non-standardized 
equipment; or that does not follow a procedure approved by the American 
Society of Brewing Chemists, the Federal Grain Inspection Service, or 
the Food and Drug Administration.
    (i) Unit. All insurable acreage of approved malting varieties in the 
county on the date coverage begins for the crop year.

 Option A--(Available for Producers of Production Contracted After the 
   Sales Closing Date, Non-Contracted Production, or a Combination of 
                Contracted and Non-Contracted Production)

    This option provides coverage for malting barley production and 
quality losses at a price per bushel greater than that offered under the 
Small Grains Crop Provisions.
    1. To be eligible for coverage under this option, you must provide 
us acceptable records of your sales of malting barley and the number of 
acres planted to malting varieties for at least the four crop years in 
your APH database prior to the crop year immediately preceding the 
current crop year. For example, to determine your production guarantee 
for the 1996 crop year, records must be provided for the 1991 through 
the 1994 crop years, if malting barley varieties were planted in each of 
those crop years. Failure to provide acceptable records or reports as 
required herein will make you ineligible for coverage under this 
endorsement. You must provide these records to us no later than the 
production reporting date specified in the Common Crop Insurance Policy 
(Sec. 457.8).
    2. Your malting barley production guarantee per acre will be the 
lesser of:
    (a) The production guarantee for feed barley for acreage planted to 
approved malting varieties calculated in accordance with the Small 
Grains Crop Provisions and APH regulations; or
    (b) A production guarantee calculated in accordance with APH 
procedures using the malting barley sales and acreage records provided 
by you.
    3. The additional value price per bushel elected cannot exceed the 
maximum price designated in the Special Provisions.
    4. The amount of production to count against your malting barley 
production guarantee will be determined as follows:
    (a) Production to count will include all:
    (1) Appraised production determined in accordance with sections 
11(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions;
    (2) Harvested production and potential unharvested production that 
meets, or would meet if properly handled;
    (i) Tolerances established by the Food and Drug Administration or 
other public health organization of the United States for substances or 
conditions, including mycotoxins, that are identified as being injurious 
to human health; and
    (ii) The following quality standards, as applicable:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Six-rowed malting   Two-rowed malting
                                   barley (percent)    barley (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protein (dry basis).............  14.0 maximum......  14.0 maximum
Plump kernels...................  65.0 minimum......  75.0 minimum
Thin kernels....................  10.0 maximum......  10.0 maximum
Germination.....................  95.0 minimum......  95.0 minimum
Blight damaged..................  4.0 maximum.......  4.0 maximum
Injured by mold.................  5.0 maximum.......  5.0 maximum
Mold damaged....................  0.4 maximum.......  0.4 maximum
Sprout damaged..................  1.0 maximum.......  1.0 maximum
Injured by frost................  5.0 maximum.......  5.0 maximum
Frost damaged...................  0.4 maximum.......  0.4 maximum
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Harvested production that does not meet the quality standards 
contained in section 4(a)(2) of this Option, but is accepted by a buyer 
for malting purposes. For such production, the production to count may 
be reduced or the price used to settle the claim may be adjusted in 
accordance with sections 4 (b), (c), and (d) of this Option.
    (b) The quantity of production that initially fails any quality 
standard contained in section 4(a)(2), but is sold as malting barley 
(except production included in section 4(c)), may be reduced as 
described in this subsection, provided the failure of such production to 
meet these standards is due to insurable causes. The production to count 
of production sold under section 4(a)(3) will be determined by:
    (1) Adding the maximum barley price election under the Small Grains 
Crop Provisions and the maximum additional value price;
    (2) Dividing the price per bushel received for the damaged 
production by the result of paragraph (1); and
    (3) Multiplying the result of paragraph (2) (not to exceed 1.000) by 
the number of bushels of damaged production.
    (c) The production to count for production that initially fails any 
quality standard contained in section 4 (a)(2), sold as malting barley, 
but is conditioned before the sale will not be reduced under section 
4(b). Such production will be considered separately from

[[Page 167]]

all other production to count. (See section 5(d).)
    (d) The additional value price election per bushel used to determine 
the value of the production to count for production that initially fails 
any quality standard contained in section 4(a)(2), but is sold as 
malting barley, may be reduced by the cost incurred for any conditioning 
required to improve the quality of production so that it is marketable 
as malting barley, provided the failure of such production to meet these 
standards is due to insurable causes.
    (e) No reduction in the production to count or the additional value 
price election will be allowed for moisture content, damage due to 
uninsured causes; costs or reduced value associated with drying, 
handling, processing, or quality factors other than those contained in 
section 4(a)(2) of this Option; or any other costs associated with 
normal handling and marketing of malting barely.
    (f) All grade and quality determinations must be based on the 
results of objective tests. No indemnity will be paid for any loss 
established by subjective tests. We may obtain one or more samples of 
the insured crop and have tests performed at an official grain 
inspection location established under the U.S. Grain Standards Act or 
laboratory of our choice to verify the results of any test. In the event 
of a conflict in the test results, our results will determine the amount 
of production to count.
    5. In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (a) Multiplying the insured acreage times your malting barley 
production guarantee per acre;
    (b) Multiplying the result in subsection (a) of this section times 
your additional value price election per bushel;
    (c) Multiplying the number of bushels of production to count 
determined in accordance with sections 4(a) and (b) of this Option times 
your elected additional value price per bushel;
    (d) Multiplying the production to count determined under section 
4(c) of this Option times the additional value price per bushel 
determined in section 4(d) of the Option;
    (e) Adding the results of subsections (c) and (d) of this section;
    (f) Subtracting the result of subsection (e) of this section from 
the result in subsection (b); and
    (g) Multiplying the result of subsection (f) of this section times 
your share.
    6. For example, assume you insure two units of barley under the 
Small Grains Crop Provisions in which you have a 100% share and that are 
planted to approved malting varieties. Assume the following:
    (a) Each unit contains 40 acres;
    (b) You have sold an average of 20 bushels per acre of malting 
barley for each of the last 6 years;
    (c) You have selected the 70 percent coverage level;
    (d) Your production guarantee under the Small Grains Crop Provisions 
and the APH regulations for feed barley is 30 bushels per acre;
    (e) Your total production from all units under the Small Grains Crop 
Provisions is 1,000 bushels, all of which fails to meet the quality 
standards specified by this Option. Two hundred bushels are sold for 
malting purposes after conditioning. Conditioning costs are $0.05 per 
bushel; and
    (f) Your additional value price election is $0.40 per bushel.
    Your malting barley production guarantee is 1120.0 bushels (the 
lesser of 20 or 30x70 percent coverage level x80 acres). The value of 
your production guarantee is $448.00 (1120 bushels x$0.40 per bushel). 
Your production to count is 200 bushels. The value of your production to 
count is $70.00 (200 bushels x$0.35 ($0.40--$0.05)). Your indemnity for 
the malting barley unit is $378.00 (($448.00--$70.00) x100 percent 
share). Any remaining loss is paid under the Small Grains Crop 
Provisions for feed barley.

    Option B--(Available for Producers of Contracted Production Only)

    This option provides coverage for malting barley production and 
quality losses at a price per bushel greater than that offered under the 
Small Grains Crop Provisions provided you have a malting barley 
contract.
    1. If you elect this option you must provide us a copy of your 
malting barley contract on or before the acreage reporting date. All 
terms and conditions of the contract, including the contract price or 
futures contract premium price, must be specified in the contract and be 
effective on or before the acreage reporting date. If you fail to timely 
provide the contract, or any terms are omitted, we may elect to 
determine the relevant information necessary for insurance under this 
Option (B), or deny liability. Only contracted production or acreage is 
covered by this Option (B).
    2. Your malting barley guarantee per acre will be the lesser of:
    (a) The production guarantee for feed barley for acreage planted to 
approved malting barley varieties calculated in accordance with the 
Small Grains Crop Provisions and APH regulations; or
    (b) The number of bushels obtained by:
    (1) Dividing the number of bushels of contracted production by the 
number of acres planted to approved malting varieties in the current 
crop year; and
    (2) Multiplying the result by the percentage for the coverage level 
you elected under the Small Grains Crop Provisions.
    3. The additional value price election per bushel will be the lesser 
of, as applicable:

[[Page 168]]

    (a) The guaranteed sale price per bushel established in the malting 
barley contract (without regard to discounts or incentives that may 
apply) minus the maximum price election for feed barley; or
    (b) The premium price per bushel (without regard to discounts or 
incentives) if the sale price is based on a future market price as 
specified in the malting barley contract.
    Under no circumstances will the additional value price election per 
bushel exceed $2.00 per bushel.
    4. The amount of production to count against your malting barley 
production guarantee will be determined as follows:
    (a) Production to count will include all:
    (1) Appraised production determined in accordance with sections 
11(c)(1) (i) and (ii) of the Small Grains Crop Provisions;
    (2) Harvested production and potential unharvested production that 
meets, or would meet if properly handled, the minimum acceptance 
standards contained in the malting barley contract for protein, plump 
kernels, thin kernels, germination, blight damage, mold injury or 
damage, sprout damage, frost injury or damage, and mycotoxins or other 
substances or conditions identified by the Food and Drug Administration 
or other public health organization of the United States as being 
injurious to human health, or the following quality standards as 
applicable:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Six-rowed malting   Two-rowed malting
                                        barley              barley
                                 ---------------------------------------
                                       (percent)           (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protein (dry basis).............  14.0 maximum......  14.0 maximum
Plump kernels...................  65.0 minimum......  75.0 minimum
Thin kernels....................  10.0 maximum......  10.0 maximum
Germination.....................  95.0 minimum......  95.0 minimum
Blight damaged..................  4.0 maximum.......  4.0 maximum
Injured by mold.................  5.0 maximum.......  5.0 maximum
Mold damaged....................  0.4 maximum.......  0.4 maximum
Sprout damaged..................  1.0 maximum.......  1.0 maximum
Injured by frost................  5.0 maximum.......  5.0 maximum
Frost damaged...................  0.4 maximum.......  0.4 maximum
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Harvested production that does not meet the quality standards 
contained in section 4(a)(2) of this Option, but is accepted by a buyer 
for malting purposes. For such production, the production to count may 
be reduced or the price used to settle the claim may be adjusted in 
accordance with sections 4 (b), (c), and (d) of this Option.
    (b) The quantity of production that initially fails any quality 
standard contained in section 4(a)(2), but is sold as malting barley 
(except production included in section 4(c)), may be reduced as 
described in this subsection, provided the failure of such production to 
meet these standards is due to insurable causes. The production to count 
of production sold under section 4(a)(3) will be determined by:
    (1) Adding the maximum barley price election under the Small Grains 
Crop Provisions and the maximum additional value price;
    (2) Dividing the price per bushel received for the damaged 
production by the result of paragraph (1); and
    (3i) Multiplying the result of paragraph (2) (not to exceed 1.000) 
by the number of bushels of damaged production.
    (c) The production to count for production that initially fails any 
quality standard contained in section 4(a)(2), sold as malting barley, 
but is conditioned before the sale will not be reduced under section 
4(b). Such production will be considered separately from all other 
production to count. (See section 5(d).)
    (d) The additional value price election per bushel used to determine 
the value of the production to count for production that initially fails 
any quality standard contained in section 4(a)(2), but is sold as 
malting barley, may be reduced by the cost incurred for any conditioning 
required to improve the quality of production so that it is marketable 
as malting barley, provided the failure of such production to meet these 
standards is due to insurable causes.
    (e) No reduction in the production to count or the additional value 
price election will be allowed for moisture content, damage due to 
uninsured causes; costs or reduced value associated with drying, 
handling, processing, or quality factors other than those contained in 
section 4(a)(2) of this Option; or any other costs associated with 
normal handling and marketing of malting barely.
    (f) All grade and quality determinations must be based on the 
results of objective tests. No indemnity will be paid for any loss 
established by subjective tests. We may obtain one or more samples of 
the insured crop and have tests performed at an official grain 
inspection location established under the U.S. Grain Standards Act or 
laboratory of our choice to verify the results of any test. In the event 
of a conflict in the test results, our results will determine the amount 
of production to count.
    5. In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (a) Multiplying the insured acreage times your malting barley 
production guarantee per acre;
    (b) Multiplying the result in subsection (a) of this section times 
your additional value price election per bushel;
    (c) Multiplying the number of bushels of production to count 
determined in accordance with sections 4 (a) and (b) of this Option 
times your elected additional value price per bushel;
    (d) Multiplying the production to count determined under section 
4(c) of this Option times the additional value price per bushel 
determined in section 4(d) of the Option;

[[Page 169]]

    (e) Adding the results of subsections (c) and (d) of this section;
    (f) Subtracting the result of subsection (e) of this section from 
the result in subsection (b); and
    (g) Multiplying the result of subsection (f) of this section times 
your share.
    6. For example, assume you insure two units of barley under the 
Small Grains Crop Provisions in which you have a 100% share and that are 
planted to approved malting varieties. Assume the following:
    (a) Each unit contains 40 acres;
    (b) You have a contract for the sale of 2500 bushels of malting 
barley;
    (c) You have selected the 70 percent coverage level;
    (d) Your production guarantee under the Small Grains Crop Provisions 
and the APH regulations for feed barley is 35 bushels per acre;
    (e) Your total production from all units under the Small Grains Crop 
Provisions is 1,000 bushels, all of which fails to meet the quality 
standards specified by this Option. Two hundred bushels are sold for 
malting purposes after conditioning. Conditioning cost $0.05 per bushel; 
and
    (f) Your additional value price election is $0.60 per bushel.
    Your malting barley production guarantee is 1750.0 bushels (the 
lesser of 35 or 21.875 (2500 contracted bushels /80 acresx70 percent 
coverage)x80 acres). The value of your production guarantee is $1050.00 
(1750 bushelsx$0.60 per bushel). Your production to count is 200 
bushels. The value of your production to count is $110.00 (200 
bushelsx$0.55 ($0.60--$0.05)). Your indemnity for the malting barley 
unit is $940.00 (($1050.00-$110.00)x100 percent share). Any remaining 
loss is paid under the Small Grains Crop Provisions for feed barley.

trees for better and more fruitful growth of the citrus fruit.
    Varieties. Subclasses of crops as listed in the Special Provisions.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will be divided into additional basic units by each citrus crop 
designated in the Special Provisions.

[[Page 170]]

    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.
    (c) Instead of establishing optional units by section, section 
equivalent, or FSA farm serial number, optional unit is located on non-
contiguous land.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election and coverage level for 
each citrus fruit crop designated in the Special Provisions that you 
elect to insure. The price election you choose for each crop need not 
bear the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us 
for each crop. For example, if you choose one hundred percent (100%) of 
the maximum price election for early oranges, you may choose seventy-
five percent (75%) of the maximum price election for late oranges. 
However, if separate price elections are available by variety within 
each crop, the price elections you choose within the crop must have the 
same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each 
variety within the crop.
    (b) The production guarantee per acre is progressive by stage and 
increases at specific intervals to the final stage production guarantee. 
The stages and production guarantees per acre are:
    (1) The first stage extends from the date insurance attaches through 
April 30 of the calendar year of normal bloom. The production guarantee 
will be forty percent (40%) of the yield calculated in section 3(e) 
multiplied by your coverage level.
    (2) The second or final stage extends from May 1 of the calendar 
year of normal bloom until the end of the insurance period. The 
production guarantee will be the yield calculated in section 3(e) 
multiplied by your coverage level.
    (c) Any acreage of citrus damaged in the first stage to the extent 
that the majority of producers in the area would not further maintain it 
will be limited to the first stage production guarantee even though you 
may continue to maintain it.
    (d) In addition to the reported production, each crop year you must 
report by type:
    (1) The number of trees damaged, topped, hedged, pruned or removed; 
any change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the 
expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is 
based; and the number of affected acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: 
interplanted perennial crop; removal, topping, hedging, or pruning of 
trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance on the 
yield potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any 
circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will 
reduce your production guarantee as necessary at any time we become 
aware of the circumstance.
    (e) The yield used to compute your production guarantee will be 
determined in accordance with Actual Production History (APH) 
regulations, 7 CFR part 400, subpart G, and applicable policy provisions 
unless damage or changes to the grove or trees, require establishment of 
the yield by another method. In the event of such damage or changes, the 
yield will be based on our appraisal of the potential of the insured 
acreage for the crop year.
    (f) Instead of reporting your citrus production for the previous 
crop year, as required by section 3 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), there is a one year lag period. Each crop year you must 
report your production from two crop years ago, e.g., on the 1998 crop 
year production report, you will provide your 1996 crop year production.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are November 20.

                            6. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium computation method in section 7 (Annual 
Premium) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the annual premium amount 
is computed by multiplying the second stage production guarantee per 
acre by the price election, the premium rate, the insured acreage, your 
share at the time coverage begins, and by any applicable premium 
adjustment percentages contained in the Special Provisions.

[[Page 171]]

                             7. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the acreage in the county of 
each citrus crop designated in the Special Provisions that you elect to 
insure and for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial 
documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are adapted to the area;
    (c) That are irrigated;
    (d) That has produced an average yield of at least three tons per 
acre the previous year, or we have appraised the yield potential of at 
least three tons per acre;
    (e) That is grown in a grove that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us; and
    (f) That is not sold by direct marketing, unless allowed by the 
Special Provisions or by written agreement.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, citrus interplanted with another 
perennial crop is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine 
it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on November 21 of each crop year, except that 
for the year of application, if your application is received after 
November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th 
day after your properly completed application is received in our local 
office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and 
determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must 
provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the 
condition of the grove.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is the second May 31st of the crop year.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the 
crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of citrus on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, 
insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium 
will be due, and no indemnity paid for such acreage for that crop year 
unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Excess rain;
    (2) Excess wind;
    (3) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;
    (4) Freeze;
    (5) Hail;
    (6) Tornado;
    (7) Wildlife; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply if caused by an insured 
peril or drought that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless a cause of loss specified 
in section 10(a):
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available;
    (2) Inability to market the citrus for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the following 
will apply:
    (a) If the Special Provisions permit or a written agreement 
authorizing direct marketing exists, you must notify us at least 15 days 
before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We 
will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production 
to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage 
occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. 
These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by

[[Page 172]]

you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give 
timely notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will 
result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than 
the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our 
inability to make the required appraisal.
    (b) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us before beginning to harvest any damaged production so we may have an 
opportunity to inspect it. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged 
crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail 
to meet the requirements of this section all such production will be 
considered undamaged and included as production to count.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on a unit basis by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each crop, or variety if 
applicable, by its respective production guarantee (see sections 1 and 
3);
    (2) Multiplying the results of section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each crop or variety, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count of each variety, if 
applicable (see section 12(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting this result of section 12(b)(5) from the result of 
section 12(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) From which production is sold by direct marketing, if direct 
marketing is specifically permitted by the Special Provisions or a 
written agreement, and you fail to meet the requirements contained in 
section 11;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to abandon 
or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of 
production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage 
will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim 
only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make 
another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest 
is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we 
will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for 
the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used 
to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Any citrus fruit that is not marketed as fresh fruit and, due to 
insurable causes, does not contain 120 or more gallons of juice per ton, 
will be adjusted by:
    (1) Dividing the gallons of juice per ton obtained from the damaged 
citrus by 120; and
    (2) Multiplying the result by the number of tons of such citrus.
    If individual records of juice content are not available, an average 
juice content from the nearest juice plant will be used, if available. 
If not available, a field appraisal will be made to determine the 
average juice content.
    (e) Where the actuarial documents provide, and you elect, the fresh 
fruit option, citrus fruit that is not marketable as fresh fruit due to 
insurable causes will be adjusted by:
    (1) Dividing the value per ton of the damaged citrus by the price of 
undamaged citrus fruit; and
    (2) Multiplying the result by the number of tons of such citrus 
fruit. The applicable price for undamaged citrus fruit will be the local 
market price the week before damage occurred.
    (f) Any production will be considered marketed or marketable as 
fresh fruit unless, due solely to insured causes, such production was 
not marketed as fresh fruit.
    (g) In the absence of acceptable records of disposition of harvested 
citrus fruit, the disposition and amount of production to count for the 
unit will be the guarantee on the unit.
    (h) Any citrus fruit on the ground that is not harvested will be 
considered totally lost if damaged by an insured cause.

                     13. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, and permitting the general public to enter the field for the 
purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Harvest. The severance of mature citrus from the tree by pulling, 
picking, or any other means, or by collecting marketable fruit from the 
ground.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will also be divided into additional basic units by each citrus crop 
designated in the Special Provisions.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be 
established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous 
land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price 
election and coverage level for each citrus fruit crop designated in the 
Special Provisions that you elect to insure. The price election you 
choose for each crop need not bear the same percentage relationship to 
the maximum price offered by us for each crop. For example, if you 
choose one hundred percent (100%) of the maximum price election for 
sweet oranges, you may choose seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum 
price election for grapefruit. However, if separate price elections are 
available by variety within each crop, the price elections you choose 
for each variety must have the same percentage relationship to the 
maximum price offered by us for each variety within the crop.
    (b) In lieu of reporting your citrus production of marketable fresh 
fruit for the previous crop year, as required by section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), there is a lag period of one year. Each crop 
year, you must report your production from two crop years ago, e.g., on 
the 1998 crop year production report, you will provide your 1996 crop 
year production.
    (c) In addition, you must report, by the production reporting date 
designated in section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and 
Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), by type, if applicable:
    (1) The number of trees damaged, dehorned or removed; any change in 
practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield 
below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based; and the 
number of affected acres;

[[Page 174]]

    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type, if applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: 
interplanted perennial crop; damage; dehorning; removal of trees; change 
in practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the 
insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may 
reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production 
guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding 
the cancellation date.

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the acreage in the county of 
each citrus crop designated in the Special Provisions that you elect to 
insure and for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial 
documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is adapted to the area;
    (c) That is irrigated;
    (d) That is grown in a grove that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us;
    (e) That is not sold by direct marketing, unless allowed by the 
Special Provisions or by written agreement; and
    (f) That has reached at least the sixth growing season after being 
set out. However, we may agree to insure acreage that has not reached 
this age if we inspect and approve a written agreement to insure such 
acreage.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, citrus interplanted with another 
perennial crop is insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine 
it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on November 21 of each crop year, except that 
for the year of application, if your application is received after 
November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th 
day after your properly completed application is received in our local 
office unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and 
determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must 
provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the 
condition of the grove.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is:
    (i) August 31 for Navel oranges and Southern California lemons;
    (ii) November 20 for Valencia oranges; and
    (iii) July 31 for all other citrus crops.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the 
crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of citrus on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, 
insurance will not be considered to have attached to and no premium will 
be due, and no indemnity paid, for such acreage for that crop year 
unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the grove;
    (3) Wildlife;
    (4) Earthquake;

[[Page 175]]

    (5) Volcanic eruption; or
    (6) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather 
conditions:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available;
    (2) Inability to market the citrus for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the following 
will apply:
    (a) If the Special Provisions permit or a written agreement 
authorizing direct marketing exists, you must notify us at least 15 days 
before any production from any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We 
will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production 
to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage 
occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. 
These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be 
used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely 
notice that production will be sold by direct marketing will result in 
an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the 
production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability 
to make the required appraisal.
    (b) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us before beginning to harvest any damaged production so that we may 
have an opportunity to inspect it. You must not sell or dispose of the 
damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If 
you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production 
will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each crop, or variety if 
applicable, by its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying the results of section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each crop, or variety, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each variety, 
if applicable (see section 11(c)), by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting this result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share;
    (c) The total production to count (in cartons) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) From which production is sold by direct marketing, if direct 
marketing is specifically permitted by the Special Provisions or a 
written agreement, and you fail to meet the requirements contained in 
section 10;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production determined to be marketable as fresh 
packed fruit; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count;
    (2) All harvested production marketed as fresh packed fruit from the 
insurable acreage; and
    (3) All citrus that was disposed of or sold without an inspection or 
written consent.
    (d) Any production will be considered marketed or marketable as 
fresh packed fruit unless, due solely to insured causes, such

[[Page 176]]

production was not marketed or marketable as fresh packed fruit.
    (e) Citrus that cannot be marketed as fresh packed fruit due to 
insurable causes will not be considered production to count.
    (f) If we determine that frost protection equipment was not properly 
utilized or not properly reported, the indemnity for the unit will be 
reduced by the percentage of premium reduction allowed for frost 
protection equipment. You must, at our request, provide us records 
showing the start-stop times by date for each period the frost 
protection equipment was used.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

Sec. 457.122  Walnut crop insurance provisions.

    The Walnut Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2001 and succeeding 
crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                         Walnut Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Harvest--Removal of the walnuts from the orchard.
    Interplanted--Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any 
form of alternating or mixed pattern.
    Net delivered weight--Delivered weight (pounds) of dry, hulled, in-
shell walnuts, excluding foreign material.
    Pound--A unit of weight equal to 16 ounces avoirdupois.
    Production guarantee (per acre)--The number of pounds (whole in-
shell walnuts), determined by multiplying the approved APH yield per 
acre by the coverage level percentage you elect.

                            2. Unit Division

    Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be 
established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous 
land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the walnuts in 
the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions 
provide different price elections by variety or varietal group, in which 
case you may select one price election for each walnut variety or 
varietal group designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections 
you choose for each variety or varietal group must have the same 
percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each 
variety or varietal group. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the 
maximum price election for a specific variety or varietal group, you 
must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other 
varieties or varietal groups.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by variety or varietal 
group if applicable:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern;
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed, the age of the crop that is interplanted with the walnuts, 
and type if applicable, and the planting pattern; and
    (5) Any other information that we request in order to establish your 
approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: 
interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in 
practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the 
insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may 
reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production 
guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstances.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred

[[Page 177]]

prior to the time that you request the increase.
    4. Contract Changes
    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change dates are October 31 for California and August 31 preceding the 
cancellation date for all other states.
    5. Cancellation and Termination Dates
    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are January 31 for California and 
November 20 for all other states.

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
the crop insured will be all the commercially grown English Walnuts 
(excluding black walnuts) in the county for which a premium rate is 
provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown on tree varieties that:
    (1) Were commercially available when the trees were set out;
    (2) Are adapted to the area; and
    (3) Are grown on a root stock that is adapted to the area;
    (c) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, are considered 
acceptable by us;
    (d) On acreage where at least 90 percent of the trees have reached 
at least the ninth growing season after being set out, unless we agree 
in writing to insure trees not meeting this requirement; and
    (e) That are in a unit that consists of at least five acres, unless 
we agree in writing to insure a smaller unit.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with 
another crop, walnuts interplanted with another perennial crop are 
insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not 
meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) Coverage begins on February 1 in California and November 21 in 
all other states of each crop year, except that for the year of 
application, if your application is received after January 22 but prior 
to February 1 in California or after November 11 but prior to November 
21 in all states, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your 
properly completed application is received in our local office, unless 
we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it 
does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any 
information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition 
of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is November 15 (Exceptions, if any, for specific counties or 
varieties or varietal group are contained in the Special Provisions).
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (4) If your walnut policy is canceled or terminated for any crop 
year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance 
attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and 
termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered 
to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, 
or indemnity will be due for such crop year.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage 
acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of walnuts on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, 
insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or 
indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against the 
following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and undergrowth have not been controlled or 
pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;

[[Page 178]]

    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against any damage or loss of production due to the inability to market 
the walnuts for any reason other than actual physical damage to the 
walnuts from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, 
we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.

               10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss.

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit:
    (1) You must notify us prior to the beginning of harvest so that we 
may inspect the damaged production;
    (2) You must give notice when knowledge is obtained of any mold 
damage or 15 days prior to harvest so that we may inspect the mold 
damaged production; and
    (3) You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop until we have 
given you written consent to do so.
    (b) If you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such 
production will be considered undamaged and included as production to 
count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each variety or varietal group;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each variety 
or varietal group, if applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective 
price election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of walnuts in the unit, 
with a guarantee of 2,500 pounds per acre and a price election of $0.61 
per pound. You are only able to harvest 200,000 pounds. Your indemnity 
would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 2,500 pounds = 250,000 pound insurance guarantee;
    (2 & 3) 250,000 pounds x $0.61 price election = $152,500 total value 
of insurance guarantee;
    (4 & 5) 200,000 pounds production to count x $0.61 price election = 
$122,000 total value of production to count;
    (6) $152,500 total value guarantee--$122,000 total value of 
production to count = $30,500 loss; and
    (7) $30,500 x 100 percent share = $30,500 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count (whole in-shell pounds) from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (C) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Mature walnut production damaged due to an insurable cause of 
loss which occurs within the insurance period may be adjusted for 
quality based on an inspection by the Dried Fruit Association or during 
our loss adjustment process. Walnut production that has mold damage 
greater than 8 percent,

[[Page 179]]

based on the net delivered weight, will be reduced by the quality 
adjustment factors contained in the Special Provisions. Walnut 
production that exceeds 30 percent mold damage and will not be sold, the 
production to count will be zero.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

(Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the almonds in 
the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions 
provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select 
one price election for each almond type designated in the Special 
Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the 
same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each 
type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price 
election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum 
price election for all other types.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by type if applicable:

circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting patterns;
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed, the age of the crop that is interplanted with the almonds, 
and type if applicable, and the planting pattern; and
    (5) Any other information that we request in order to establish your 
approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: 
interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in 
practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the 
insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may 
reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production 
guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that would or could reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8),

the crop insured will be all the almonds in the county for which a 
premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share unless allowed otherwise by section 
8(b);
    (b) That are grown for harvest as almonds;
    (c) That are irrigated;

acceptable to us; and
    (e) On acreage where at least 90 percent of the trees have reached 
at least the seventh growing season after set out, unless we agree in 
writing to insure trees not meeting this requirement.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with 
another crop, almonds interplanted with another perennial crop are 
insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not 
meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on January 1 of each crop year, except that for 
the year of application, if your application is received after December 
21, but prior to January 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after 
your properly completed application is received in our local office 
unless we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine 
that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any

of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is November 30.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force,

subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (4) If your almond policy is canceled or terminated for any crop 
year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance 
attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and 
termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered 
to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, 
or indemnity will be due for such crop year.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage 
acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of almonds on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, 
insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or 
indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against the 
following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and undergrowth have not been controlled or 
pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Earthquake;
    (6) Volcanic eruption;
    (7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period; or
    (8) Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to the inability to market the 
almonds for any reason other than actual physical damage to the almonds 
from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will 
not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, 
boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.

[[Page 181]]

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if you intend to claim an indemnity on any 
unit, you must notify us prior to the beginning of harvest so that we 
may inspect the damaged production. You must not sell or dispose of the 
damaged crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If 
you fail to meet the requirements of this section, all such production 
will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (l) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for the type;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if 
applicable, (see subsection 11(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result in section 11(b)(5) from the result in 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of almonds in the unit, 
with a guarantee of 1,200 pounds per acre and a price election of $1.70 
per pound. You are only able to harvest 100,000 pounds. Your indemnity 
would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 1,200 pounds = 120,000 pound insurance guarantee;
    (2 & 3) 120,000 pounds x $1.70 price election = $204,000 total value 
of insurance guarantee;
    (4 & 5) 100,000 pounds production to count x $1.70 price election = 
$170,000 total value of production to count;
    (6) $204,000 total of value guarantee--$170,000 total value of 
production to count = $34,000 loss; and
    (7) $34,000 x 100 percent share = $34,000 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count, specified in meat pounds, from 
all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (C) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All harvested meat pounds, including meat pounds damaged due to 
uninsured causes of loss.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

Sec. 457.124  Raisin crop insurance provisions.

    The raisin crop insurance provisions for the 1998 and succeeding 
crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

                         Raisin Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Crop year--In lieu of the definition of ``Crop year'' contained in 
section 1 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar year

[[Page 182]]

in which the raisins are placed on trays for drying.
    Delivered ton--A ton of raisins delivered to a packer, processor, 
buyer or a reconditioner, before any adjustment for U. S. Grade B and 
better maturity standards, and after adjustments for moisture over 16 
percent and substandard raisins over 5 percent.
    RAC--The Raisin Administrative Committee, which operates under an 
order of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
    Raisins--The sun-dried fruit of varieties of grapes designated 
insurable by the actuarial documents. These grapes will be considered 
raisins for the purpose of this policy when laid on trays in the 
vineyard to dry.
    Reference maximum dollar amount--The value per ton established by 
FCIC and shown in the actuarial documents.
    Substandard--Raisins that fail to meet the requirements of U.S. 
Grade C, or layer (cluster) raisins with seeds that fail to meet the 
requirements of U.S. Grade B.
    Table grapes--Grapes grown for commercial sale as fresh fruit on 
acreage where appropriate cultural practices were followed.
    Ton--Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.
    Tonnage report--A report used to annually report, by unit, all the 
tons of raisins produced in the county in which you have a share.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will be divided into additional basic units by grape variety.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be 
established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous 
land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement.

            3. Amounts of Insurance and Production Reporting

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one coverage level percentage for all the 
raisins in the county insured under this policy.
    (b) The amount of insurance for the unit will be determined by 
multiplying the insured tonnage by the reference maximum dollar amount, 
by the coverage level percentage you elect, and by your share.
    (c) Insured tonnage is determined as follows:
    (1) For units not damaged by rain--The delivered tons; or
    (2) For units damaged by rain--By adding the delivered tons to any 
verified loss of production due to rain damage. When production from a 
portion of the acreage within a unit is removed from the vineyard and 
production from the remaining acreage is lost in the vineyard, the 
amount of production lost in the vineyard will be determined based on 
the number of tons of raisins produced on the acreage from which 
production was removed. When no production has been removed from the 
vineyard, the amount of production lost in the vineyard will be 
determined based on an appraisal.
    (3) Insured tonnage will be adjusted as follows:
    (i) The insured tonnage will be reduced 0.12 percent for each 0.10 
percent of moisture in excess of 16.0 percent. For example, 10.0 tons of 
raisins containing 18.0 percent moisture will be reduced to 9.760 tons 
of raisins;
    (ii) Insured tonnage used for dry edible fruit will be reduced by 
0.10 percent for each 0.10 percent of substandard raisins in excess of 
5.0 percent; and
    (iii) When raisins contain moisture in excess of 24.3 percent at the 
time of delivery and are released for a use other than dry edible fruit 
(e.g. distillery material), they will be considered to contain 24.3 
percent moisture.
    (4) If any raisins are delivered, the moisture content will be 
determined at the time of delivery.
    (d) Section 3(c) of the Basic Provisions is not applicable to this 
crop.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is April 30 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are July 31.

                  6. Acreage Report and Tonnage Report

    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You must report by unit, and on our form, the acreage on which 
you intend to produce raisins for the crop year. This acreage report 
must be submitted to us on or before the sales closing date, and contain 
the following information:
    (1) All acreage of the crop (insurable and not insurable) in which 
you will have a share;
    (2) Your anticipated share at the time coverage will begin;
    (3) The variety; and
    (4) The location of each vineyard.

[[Page 183]]

    (b) Acreage of the crop acquired after the acreage was reported, may 
be included on the acreage report if we agree to accept the additional 
acreage. Such additional acreage will not be added to the acreage report 
after you first place raisins from the additional acreage on trays for 
drying. Failure to report any acreage in which you have a share will 
result in denial of liability. If you elect not to produce raisins on 
any part of the acreage included on your acreage report, you must notify 
us in writing on or before September 21, and provide any records we may 
require to verify that raisins were not produced on that acreage.
    (c) If you fail to file an acreage report in a timely manner, or if 
the information reported is incorrect, we may deny liability on any 
unit.
    (d) In addition to the acreage report, you must annually submit a 
tonnage report, on our form, which includes by unit the number of 
delivered tons of raisins, and, if damage has occurred, the amount of 
any tonnage we determined was lost due to rain damage in the vineyard 
for each unit designated in the acreage report.
    (e) The tonnage report must be submitted to us as soon as the 
information is available, but not later than March 1 of the year 
following the crop year. Indemnities may be determined on the basis of 
information you submitted on this report. If you do not submit this 
report by the reporting date, we may, at our option, either determine 
the insured tonnage and share by unit or we may deny liability on any 
unit. This report may be revised only upon our approval. Errors in 
reporting units may be corrected by us at any time we discover the 
error.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium computation method contained in section 7 
(Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the annual 
premium amount is determined by multiplying the amount of insurance for 
the unit at the time insurance attaches by the premium rate and then 
multiplying that result by any applicable premium adjustment factors 
that may apply.

                             8. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the raisins in the 
county of grape varieties for which a premium rate is provided by the 
actuarial documents and in which you have a share.
    (b) In addition to the raisins not insurable under section 8 
(Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we do not insure 
any raisins:
    (1) Laid on trays after September 8 in vineyards with north-south 
rows in Merced or Stanislaus Counties, or after September 20 in all 
other counties;
    (2) From table grape strippings; or
    (3) From vines that received manual, mechanical, or chemical 
treatment to produce table grape sizing.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance attaches on each unit at the 
time the raisins are placed on trays for drying and ends the earlier of:
    (a) October 20;
    (b) The date the raisins are removed from the trays;
    (c) The date the raisins are removed from the vineyard;
    (d) Total destruction of all raisins on a unit;
    (e) Final adjustment of a loss on a unit; or
    (f) Abandonment of the raisins.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
unavoidable loss of production resulting from rain that occurs during 
the insurance period and while the raisins are on trays or in rolls in 
the vineyard for drying.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to inability to market the 
raisins for any reason other than actual physical damage from an 
insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay 
you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, 
or refusal of a person to accept production.

               11. Reconditioning Requirements and Payment

    (a) We may require you to recondition a representative sample of not 
more than 10 tons of damaged raisins to determine if they meet standards 
established by the RAC once reconditioned. If such standards are met, we 
may require you to recondition all the damaged production. If we 
determine that it is possible to recondition any damaged production and, 
if you do not do so, we will value the damaged production at the 
reference maximum dollar amount, except if your damaged production 
undergoes a USDA inspection and is stored by your packer with other 
producer's production to be reconditioned at a later date. If we agree, 
in writing, that it is not practical to recondition the damaged 
production, we will determine the number of tons meeting RAC standards 
that could be obtained if the production were reconditioned.

[[Page 184]]

    (b) If the representative sample of raisins that we require you to 
recondition does not meet RAC standards for marketable raisins after 
reconditioning, the reconditioning payment will be the actual cost you 
incur to recondition the sample, not to exceed an amount that is 
reasonable and customary for such reconditioning, regardless of the 
coverage level selected.
    (c) A reconditioning payment, based on the actual (unadjusted) 
weight of the raisins, will be made if:
    (1) Insured raisin production:
    (i) Is damaged by rain within the insurance period;
    (ii) Is reconditioned by washing with water and then drying;
    (iii) Is insured at a coverage level greater than that applicable to 
the catastrophic risk protection plan of insurance; and either
    (2) The damaged production undergoes an inspection by USDA and is 
found to contain mold, embedded sand, or other rain-caused contamination 
determined by micro-analysis in excess of standards established by the 
RAC, or is found to contain moisture in excess of 18 percent; or
    (3) We give you consent to recondition the damaged production.
    (d) Your request for consent to any wash-and-dry reconditioning must 
identify the acreage on which the production to be reconditioned was 
damaged in order to be eligible for a reconditioning payment.
    (e) The reconditioning payment for raisins that meet RAC standards 
for marketable raisins after reconditioning will be the lesser of your 
actual cost for reconditioning or the amount determined by:
    (1) Multiplying the greater of $125.00 or the reconditioning dollar 
amount per ton contained in the Special Provisions by your coverage 
level;
    (2) Multiplying the result of section 11(e)(1) by the actual number 
of tons of raisins (unadjusted weight) that are wash-and-dry 
reconditioned; and
    (3) Multiplying the result of section 11(e)(2) by your share.
    (f) Only one reconditioning payment will be made for any lot of 
raisins damaged during the crop year. Multiple reconditioning payments 
for the same production will not be made.

                12. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the 
following will apply:
    (1) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must give 
us notice within 72 hours of the time the rain fell on the raisins. We 
may reject any claim for indemnity if such notice is later. You must 
provide us the following information when you give us this notice:
    (i) The grape variety;
    (ii) The location of the vineyard and number of acres; and
    (iii) The number of vines from which the raisins were harvested.
    (2) We will not pay any indemnity unless you:
    (i) Authorize us in writing to obtain all relevant records from any 
raisin packer, raisin reconditioner, the RAC, or any other person who 
may have such records. If you fail to meet the requirements of this 
subsection, all insured production will be considered undamaged and 
valued at the reference maximum dollar value.
    (ii) Upon our request, provide us with records of previous years'' 
production and acreage. This information may be used to establish the 
amount of insured tonnage when insurable damage results in discarded 
production.
    (b) In lieu of the provisions in section 14 (Duties in the Event of 
Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) that require you to 
submit a claim for indemnity not later than 60 days after the end of the 
insurance period, any claim for indemnity must be submitted to us not 
later than March 31 following the date for the end of the insurance 
period.

                         13. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the acreage from which 
raisins were removed for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured tonnage of raisins by the reference 
maximum dollar amount and your coverage level percentage;
    (2) Subtracting from the total in section 13(b)(1) the total value 
of all insured damaged and undamaged raisins; and
    (3) Multiplying the result of section 13(b)(2) by your share.
    (c) For the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity, your 
share will not exceed the lesser of your share at the time insurance 
attaches or at the time of loss.
    (d) Undamaged raisins or raisins damaged solely by uninsured causes 
will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.
    (e) Raisins damaged partially by rain and partially by uninsured 
causes will be valued at the highest prices obtainable, adjusted for any 
reduction in value due to uninsured causes.

[[Page 185]]

    (f) Raisins that are damaged by rain, but that are reconditioned and 
meet RAC standards for raisins, will be valued at the reference maximum 
dollar amount.
    (g) The value to count for any raisins produced on the unit that are 
damaged by rain and not removed from the vineyard will be the larger of 
the appraised salvage value or $35.00 per ton, except that any raisins 
that are damaged and discarded from trays or are lost from trays 
scattered in the vineyard as part of normal handling will not be 
considered to have any value. You must box and deliver any raisins that 
can be removed from the vineyard.
    (h) At our sole option, we may acquire all the rights and title to 
your share of any raisins damaged by rain. In such event, the raisins 
will be valued at zero in determining the amount of loss and we will 
have the right of ingress and egress to the extent necessary to take 
possession, care for, and remove such raisins.
    (i) Raisins destroyed, put to another use without our consent, or 
abandoned will be valued at the reference maximum dollar amount.

                     14. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                   Safflower Crop Insurance Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Harvest. Collecting the safflower seed by combining or threshing.
    Local market price. The cash price per pound for undamaged safflower 
(test weight of 35 pounds per bushel or higher and seed damage less than 
25 percent) offered by buyers.
    Nurse crop (companion crop). A crop planted into the same acreage as 
another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and which is 
planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is 
grown.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, safflowers must initially be planted in rows, unless 
otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by 
written agreement.
    Pound. Sixteen ounces avoirdupois.
    Value per pound. The cash price per pound for damaged safflower 
(test weight below 35 pounds per bushel, seed damage in excess of 25 
percent, or both).

  2. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price election for all 
the safflower in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by type, in which case you 
may select one price election for each safflower type designated in the 
Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must 
have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us 
for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum 
price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the 
maximum price election for all other types.

                           3. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all safflower in the county for 
which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;

[[Page 186]]

    (b) That is planted for harvest as safflower seed;
    (c) That is not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (1) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume.

                          6. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure:
    (a) Safflower planted on land on which safflower, sunflower seed, 
any variety of dry beans, soybeans, mustard, rapeseed, or lentils were 
grown the preceding crop year, unless other rotation requirements are 
specified in the Special Provisions or we agree in writing to insure 
such acreage; or
    (b) Any acreage of safflower damaged before the final planting date, 
to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would normally 
not further care for the crop, unless the crop is replanted or we agree 
that it is not practical to replant.

                           7. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar date for the end of 
the insurance period is October 31 immediately following planting.

                            8. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife, unless proper measures to control wildlife have not 
been taken;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.

                          9. Replanting Payment

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the crop is 
damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining 
stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee 
for the acreage and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or 160 pounds, 
multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your insured share.
    (c) When safflower is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable 
as an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by 
the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be 
reduced.

                10. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the 
representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet 
wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples 
must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection 
or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type if 
applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the results from the total in section 11(b)(5) from 
the results in section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for the acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for

[[Page 187]]

quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with section 
11(d)); and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Mature safflower may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality 
deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made 
prior to any adjustment for quality.
    (1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 
percentage point of moisture in excess of 8 percent. We may obtain 
samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
    (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if such 
production:
    (i) Has a test weight below 35 pounds per bushel;
    (ii) Has seed damage in excess of 25 percent; or
    (iii) Contains substances or conditions that are identified by the 
Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the 
United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop 
provisions and that occurred within the insurance period;
    (ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a value 
per pound that is less than the local market price;
    (iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us;
    (iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, 
which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed 
by:
    (A) A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse 
operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or
    (C) A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    (4) Safflower production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in sections 11(d) (2) and (3), will be reduced as follows:
    (i) In accordance with the quality adjustment factors contained in 
the Special Provisions; or
    (ii) If quality adjustment factors are not contained in the Special 
Provisions:
    (A) By determining the value per pound and the local market price on 
the earlier of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the 
date of final inspection for the unit. Discounts used to establish the 
value per pound will be limited to those which are usual, customary, and 
reasonable. The value per pound will not be reduced for:
    (1) Moisture content;
    (2) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
    (3) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with 
normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of safflower. We may obtain 
values per pound from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain values per 
pound from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, we 
will reduce such values per pound by the additional costs required to 
deliver the production to those buyers.
    (B) Divide the value per pound by the local market price to 
determine the quality adjustment factor; and
    (C) Multiply the adjustment factor by the number of pounds of the 
damaged production remaining after any reduction due to excessive 
moisture to determine the net production to count.
    (e) Any production harvested from other plants growing in the 
insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a 
weight basis.

                         12. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planing coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for

[[Page 188]]

timely planted acreage. If you have limited or aditional levels of 
coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, and pay an 
additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage to 
a level specified in the actuarial documents.

Sec. 457.126  Popcorn cop isurance povisions.

    The Popcorn Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1999 and succeeding 
crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                    Popcorn Crop Insurance Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Base contract price. The price stipulated on the contract executed 
between you and the processor before any adjustments for quality.
    Harvest. Removing the grain or ear from the stalk either by hand or 
by machine.
    Merchantable popcorn. Popcorn that meets the provisions of the 
processor contract.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, popcorn must initially be planted in rows far enough 
apart to permit mechanical cultivation, unless otherwise provided by the 
Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
    Pound. Sixteen (16) ounces avoirdupois.
    Practical to replant. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, it will not be considered practical to replant unless 
production from the replanted acreage can be delivered under the terms 
of the popcorn processor contract, or the processor agrees in writing 
that it will accept the production from the replanted acreage.
    Processor. Any business enterprise regularly engaged in processing 
popcorn that possesses all licenses, permits or approved inspections for 
processing popcorn required by the state in which it operates, and that 
possesses facilities, or has contractual access to such facilities, with 
enough equipment to accept and process the contracted popcorn within a 
reasonable amount of time after harvest.
    Processor contract. A written agreement between the producer and a 
processor, containing at a minimum:
    (a) The producer's commitment to plant and grow popcorn, and to 
deliver the popcorn production to the processor;
    (b) The processor's commitment to purchase all the production stated 
in the processor contract;
    (c) A date, if specified on the processor's contract, by which the 
crop must be harvested to be accepted; and
    (d) A base contract price.
Multiple contracts with the same processor, each of which stipulates a 
specific amount of production to be delivered under the terms of the 
processor contact, will be considered as a single processor contract.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) For processor contracts that stipulate the amount of production 
to be delivered:
    (1) In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, a 
basic unit will consist of all the acreage planted to the insured crop 
in the county that will be used to fulfill contracts with each 
processor;
    (i) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production 
contracted with each processor contract;
    (ii) In accordance with section 13 of these Crop Provisions, all 
production from any basic unit in excess of the amount under contract 
will be included as production to count if such production is applied to 
any other basic unit for which the contracted amount has not been 
fulfilled; and
    (2) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.
    (b) For any processor contract that stipulates only the number of 
acres to be planted, the provisions contained in section 34 of the Basic 
Provisions will apply.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the popcorn 
in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions 
provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select 
one price election for each popcorn type designated in the Special 
Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must have the 
same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each 
type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price 
election for one type,

[[Page 189]]

you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all 
other types.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, 
you must provide a copy of all processor contracts to us on or before 
the acreage reporting date.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the popcorn in the county for which a premium rate 
is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That is planted for harvest as popcorn;
    (3) That is grown under, and in accordance with the requirements of, 
a processor contract executed on or before the acreage reporting date 
and is not excluded from the processor contract at any time during the 
crop year; and
    (4) That is not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, 
under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which 
the popcorn is grown, you have a risk of loss, and the processor 
contract provides for delivery of popcorn under specified conditions and 
at a stipulated base contract price.
    (c) A popcorn producer who is also a processor may be able to 
establish an insurable interest if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The producer must comply with these Crop Provisions;
    (2) The Board of Directors or officers of the processor must, prior 
to the sales closing date, execute and adopt a resolution that contains 
the same terms as an acceptable processor contract. Such resolution will 
be considered a processor contract under this policy; and
    (3) Our inspection reveals that the processing facilities comply 
with the definition of a processor contained in these Crop Provisions.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, 
any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, 
to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would normally 
not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it 
is not practical to replant.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, regarding the end of the insurance period, insurance ceases 
on each unit or part of a unit at the earliest of:
    (a) The date the popcorn:
    (1) Was destroyed;
    (2) Should have been harvested but was not harvested;
    (3) Was abandoned; or
    (4) Was harvested;
    (b) When the processor contract stipulates a specific amount of 
production to be delivered, the date the production accepted by the 
processor equals the contracted amount of production;
    (c) Final adjustment of a loss; or
    (d) December 10 immediately following planting.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a cause of 
loss specified in sections 10(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we do not insure against any loss of production due 
to:

[[Page 190]]

    (1) Damage resulting from frost or freeze after the date designated 
in the Special Provisions; or
    (2) Failure to follow the requirements contained in the processor 
contract.

                         11. Replanting Payment

    (a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a 
replanting payment is allowed if the crop is damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at 
least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage and it is 
practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or 150 pounds, 
multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your insured share.
    (c) When popcorn is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable 
as an original planting, our liability for the unit will be reduced by 
the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be 
reduced.

                12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the representative samples of the unharvested crop must be 
at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the 
unit. The samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our 
inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is 
completed.
    13. Settlement of Claim
    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by 
its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying the result of section 13(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each type, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(2) if there is more than 
one type;
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 13(c)), 
of each type if applicable, by its respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(4) if there is more than 
one type;
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 13(b)(4) from the result in 
section 13(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the result of 
section 13(b)(5) from the result of section 13(b)(3) if there is more 
than one type; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 13(b)(6) by your share.

 
 
 
For example:
You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of Type A popcorn in the unit,
 with a guarantee of 2,500 pounds per acre and a price election of $.12
 per pound. You are only able to harvest 150,000 pounds. Your indemnity
 would be calculated as follows:
1....................  100 acres x 2,500 pounds = 250,000 pound
                        guarantee;
2....................  250,00 pounds x $.12 price election = $30,000
                        value of guarantee;
4....................  150,000 pounds production to count x $.12 price
                        election = $18,000 value of production to count;
6....................  $30,000-$18,000 = $12,000 loss; and
7....................  $12,000 x 100 percent share = $12,000 indemnity
                        payment.
You also have a 100 percent share in 150 acres of type B popcorn in the
 same unit, with a guarantee of 2,250 pounds per acre and a price
 election of $.10 per pound. You are only able to harvest 70,000 pounds.
 Your total indemnity for both popcorn types A and B would be calculated
 as follows:
1....................  100 acres x 2,500 pounds = 250,000 guarantee for
                        type A and 150 acres x 2,250 pounds = 337,500
                        pound guarantee for type B;
2....................  250,000 pound guarantee x $.12 price election =
                        $30,000 value of guarantee for type A and
                        337,500 pound guarantee x $.10 price election =
                        $33,750 value guarantee for type B;
3....................  $30,000 + $33,750 = $63,750 total value
                        guarantee;
4....................  150,000 pounds x $.12 price election = $18,000
                        value of production to count for type A and
                       70,000 pounds x $.10 price election = $7,000
                        value of production to count for type B;
5....................  $18,000 + $7,000 = $25,000 total value of
                        production to count;
6....................  $63,750-$25,000 = $38,750 loss; and
7....................  $38,750 x 100 percent = $38,750 indemnity
                        payment.
 


[[Page 191]]

    (c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records;
    (ii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
section 13(d));
    (iii) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested;
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage in the unit;
    (3) All harvested and appraised production lost or damaged by 
uninsured causes; and
    (4) For processor contracts that stipulate the amount of production 
to be delivered, all harvested popcorn production from any other 
insurable unit that has been used to fulfill your processor contract 
applicable to this unit.
    (5) Any production from yellow or white dent corn will be counted as 
popcorn on a weight basis and any production harvested from plants 
growing in the insured crop may be counted as popcorn production on a 
weight basis.
    (6) Any ear production for which we cannot determine a shelling 
factor will be considered to have an 80 percent shelling factor.
    (d) Mature popcorn may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality 
deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made 
prior to any adjustment for quality.
    (1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 
percentage point for moisture in excess of 15 percent. We may obtain 
samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
    (2) Popcorn production will be eligible for quality adjustment if, 
due to an insurable cause of loss that occurs within the insurance 
period, it is not merchantable popcorn and is rejected by the processor. 
The production will be adjusted by:
    (i) Dividing the value per pound of the damaged popcorn by the base 
contract price per pound for undamaged popcorn; and
    (ii) Multiplying the result by the number of pounds of such popcorn.

                            14. Late Planting

    Late planting provisions in the Basic Provisions are applicable for 
popcorn if you provide written approval from the processor by the 
acreage reporting date that it will accept the production from the late 
planted acres when it is expected to be ready for harvest.

                         15. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

    Guarantee Production Plan of Fresh Market Tomato Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

[[Page 192]]

                             1. Definitions

    Acre--Forty-three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet 
of land when row widths do not exceed six feet, or if row widths exceed 
six feet, the land area on which at least 7,260 linear feet of rows are 
planted.
    Carton--A container that contains 25 pounds of fresh tomatoes unless 
otherwise provided in the Special Provisions.
    Direct marketing--Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, and permitting the general public to enter the field for the 
purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    First fruit set--The date when 30 percent of the plants on the unit 
have produced fruit that has reached a minimum size of one inch in 
diameter.
    Harvest--Picking of marketable tomatoes.
    Mature green tomato--A tomato that:
    (a) Has a heightened gloss due to a waxy skin that cannot be torn by 
scraping;
    (b) Has a well-formed jelly-like substance in the locules;
    (c) Has seeds that are sufficiently hard so they are pushed aside 
and not cut by a sharp knife in slicing; and
    (d) Shows no red color.
    Planting--Transplanting the tomato plants into the field.
    Planting period--The time period designated in the Special 
Provisions during which the tomatoes must be planted to be insured as 
either spring-or fall-planted tomatoes.
    Plant stand--The number of live plants per acre before any damage 
occurs.
    Potential production--The number of cartons per acre of mature green 
or ripe tomatoes that the tomato plants would have produced by the end 
of the insurance period:
    (a) With a classification size of 6x7 (2-8/32 inch minimum diameter) 
or larger for all types except cherry, roma, or plum; or
    (b) Meeting the criteria specified in the Special Provisions for 
cherry, roma, or plum types.
    Practical to replant--In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or 
damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited 
to moisture availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, 
and marketing windows that replanting the insured crop will allow the 
crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. In counties that do not have both spring and fall 
planting periods, it will not be considered practical to replant after 
the final planting date unless replanting is generally occurring in the 
area. In counties that have spring and fall planting periods, it will 
not be considered practical to replant after the final planting date for 
the planting period in which the crop was initially planted.
    Ripe tomato--A tomato that meets the definition of a mature green 
tomato, except the tomato shows some red color and can still be packed 
for fresh market under the agreement or contract with the packer.
    Row width--The distance in feet from the center of one row of plants 
to the center of an adjacent row.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will be divided into additional basic units by planting period, if 
separate planting periods are provided for in the Special Provisions.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the tomatoes in 
the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions 
provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select 
one price election for each tomato type designated in the Special 
Provisions. The price election you choose for each type must have the 
same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each 
type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price 
election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum 
price election for all other types.
    (b) The production guarantees per acre are progressive by stages and 
increase at specified intervals to the final stage production guarantee. 
The stages and production guarantees are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Any acreage of tomatoes damaged to the extent that producers in 
the area generally would not further care for the tomatoes will be 
deemed to have been destroyed even though you continue to care for the 
tomatoes. The production guarantee for such acreage will be the 
guarantee for the stage in which such damage occurs.
    (d) Any production guarantees for cherry, roma, or plum type 
tomatoes will be specified in the Special Provisions.

                           4. Contract Changes

                          6. Report of Acreage

    (a) In addition to the provisions of section 6 (Report of Acreage) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must report the row width.
    (b) If spring and fall planting periods are allowed in the Special 
Provisions you must report all the information required by section 6 
(Report of Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) and these Crop 
Provisions by the acreage reporting date for each planting period.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of provisions contained in the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), for determining premium amounts, the annual premium is 
determined by multiplying the final stage production guarantee by the 
price election, by the premium rate, by the insured acreage, by your 
share at the time coverage begins, and by any applicable premium 
adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions.

                             8. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the tomatoes in the county 
for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are transplanted tomatoes that have been planted for 
harvest as fresh market tomatoes;
    (c) That are planted within the spring or fall planting periods, as 
applicable, specified in the Special Provisions;
    (d) That, on or before the acreage reporting date, are subject to 
any agreement in writing (packing contract) executed between you and a 
packer, whereby the packer agrees to accept and pack the production 
specified in the agreement, unless you control a packing facility or an 
exception exists in the Special Provisions; and
    (e) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions):
    (1) Grown for direct marketing;
    (2) Interplanted with another crop;
    (3) Planted into an established grass or legume; or

                          9. Insurable Acreage

    (a) In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that the majority of growers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that it is not practical to replant. Unavailability of plants 
will not be considered a valid reason for failure to replant.
    (2) We do not insure any acreage of tomatoes:
    (i) Grown by any person if the person had not previously:
    (A) Grown fresh market tomatoes for commercial sales; or
    (B) Participated in the management of a fresh market tomato farming 
operation, in at least one of the three previous years.
    (ii) That does not meet the rotation requirements contained in the

grown within

[[Page 194]]

the previous two years unless the soil was fumigated or nematicide was 
applied before planting the tomatoes, except that this limitation does 
not apply to a first planting in Pennsylvania or if otherwise specified 
in the Special Provisions; or
    (b) In lieu of the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance from 
attaching if a crop has not been planted and harvested in at least one 
of the three previous calendar years, we will insure newly cleared land 
or former pasture land planted to fresh market tomatoes.

                          10. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) Coverage begins on each unit or part of a unit on the later of 
the date you submit your application or when the tomatoes are planted.
    (b) Coverage will end on any insured acreage at the earliest of:
    (1) Total destruction of the tomatoes;
    (2) Discontinuance of harvest;
    (3) The date harvest should have started on any acreage that was not 
harvested;
    (4) 120 days after the date of transplanting or replanting;
    (5) Completion of harvest;
    (6) Final adjustment of a loss; or
    (7) October 15 of the crop year in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, 
North Carolina, and Virginia; October 31 of the crop year in California;

    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production that occurs or becomes evident 
after the tomatoes have been harvested.

                         12. Replanting Payment

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the crop is 
damaged by an insurable cause of loss and the acreage to be replanted 
has sustained a loss in excess of 50 percent of the plant stand.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be:
    (1) Seventy (70) cartons multiplied by your price election, 
multiplied by your insured share for all insured tomatoes except cherry, 
roma or plum types; and

one replanting payment for acreage planted during each planting period 
within the crop year.

                         13. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by 
its respective production guarantee for the stage in which the damage 
occurred;
    (2) Multiplying the results of section 13(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each type, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if 
applicable, (see section 13(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting this result of section 13(b)(5) from the results in 
section 13(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 13(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in cartons) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;

[[Page 195]]

    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Potential production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production of mature green and ripe tomatoes 
remaining after harvest has ended:
    (A) With a classification size of 6 x 7 (2\8/32\ inch minimum 
diameter) or larger and that would grade eighty-five percent (85%) or 
better U.S. No. 1 for types other than cherry, roma, or plum; or
    (B) That grade in accordance with the requirements specified in the 
Special Provisions for cherry, roma or plum types.
    (iv) Potential production on unharvested acreage and potential 
production on acreage when final harvest has not been completed;
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage:
    (i) That is marketed, regardless of grade; and
    (ii) That is unmarketed and:
    (A) That grades eighty-five percent (85%) or better U.S. No. 1 with 
a classification size of 6x7 (2-8/32 inch minimum diameter) or larger 
for all types except cherry, roma, or plum; or
    (B) That grade in accordance with the requirements specified in the 
Special Provisions for cherry, roma, or plum types.
    (d) Only that amount of appraised production that exceeds the 
difference between the final stage guarantee and the stage guarantee 
applicable to the acreage will be production to count.

                     14. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

year is designated by the calendar year in which spring planted sweet 
corn is harvested.
    Direct marketing--Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's

purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Excess rain--An amount of precipitation sufficient to directly 
damage the crop.
    Excess wind--Wind speed strong enough to prevent adequate 
pollination or cause lodging of stalks and prevent a normal harvest.

[[Page 196]]

caused by low air temperatures.
    Harvest--The picking of sweet corn on the unit.
    Marketable sweet corn--Sweet corn that meets the standards for 
grading U.S. No. 1 or better and will withstand normal handling and 
shipping.
    Plant stand--The number of live plants per acre prior to the 
occurrence of an insurable cause of loss.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, for each planting period, sweet corn seed must be 
planted in rows far enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation, 
unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial 
documents, or by written agreement.
    Planting period--The period of time designated in the actuarial 
documents in which fresh market sweet corn must be planted to be 
considered fall, winter, or spring-planted sweet corn.
    Potential production--The number of containers of sweet corn that 
the sweet corn plants will or would have produced per acre by the end of 
the insurance period, assuming normal growing conditions and practices.
    Practical to replant--In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or 
damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited 
to moisture availability, condition of the field, marketing windows, and 
time to crop maturity, that replanting to the insured crop will allow 
the crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of 
the insurance period (inability to obtain seed will not be considered 
when determining if it is practical to replant).
    Sweet corn--A type of corn with kernels containing a high percentage 
of sugar that is adapted for human consumption as a vegetable.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will also be divided into additional basic units by planting period.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.

              3. Amounts of Insurance and Production Stages

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one coverage 
level (and the corresponding amount of insurance designated in the 
actuarial documents for the applicable planting period and practice) for 
all the sweet corn in the county insured under this policy.
    (b) The amount of insurance you choose for each planting period and 
practice must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price 
offered by us for each planting period and practice. For example, if you 
choose 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a specific 
planting period and practice, you must also choose 100 percent of the 
maximum amount of insurance for all other planting periods and 
practices.
    (c) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), do not apply to fresh 
market sweet corn.
    (d) The amounts of insurance are progressive by stages as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Percent of
                       the amount
                           of
        Stage          insurance               Length of time
                        per acre
                        that you
                        selected
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1..................           65  From planting through the beginning
                                    of tasseling (which is when the
                                    tassel becomes visible above the
                                    whorl).
Final...............          100  From tasseling until the acreage is
                                    harvested.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Any acreage of sweet corn damaged in the first stage to the 
extent that the majority of producers in the area would not normally 
further care for it, will be deemed to have been destroyed. The 
indemnity payable for such acreage will be based on the stage the plants 
had achieved when the damage occurred.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must report on or before the 
acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions for each 
planting period, all the acreage of sweet corn in the county insured 
under this policy in which you have a share.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 7 
(Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the annual 
premium amount for each cultural practice (e.g., fall-planted irrigated) 
is determined by multiplying the final stage amount of insurance per 
acre by the premium rate for the cultural practice as established in the 
Actuarial Table, by the insured acreage, by your share at the time 
coverage begins, and by any applicable premium adjustment factors 
contained in the actuarial documents.

                             8. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the sweet corn in the county 
for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is:
    (1) Planted to be harvested and sold as fresh market sweet corn;
    (2) Planted within the planting periods designated in the actuarial 
documents;
    (3) Grown under an irrigated practice, unless otherwise provided in 
the Special Provisions;
    (4) Grown by a person who in at least one of the three previous crop 
years:
    (i) Grew sweet corn for commercial sale; or
    (ii) Participated in managing a sweet corn farming operation;
    (c) That is not:
    (1) Interplanted with another crop;
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume; or
    (3) Grown for direct marketing.

                          9. Insurable Acreage

    (a) In lieu of the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching if 
a crop has not been planted in at least one of the three previous crop 
years, we will insure newly cleared land or former pasture land planted 
to fresh market sweet corn.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) You must replant any acreage of sweet corn damaged during the 
planting period in which initial planting took place whenever less than 
75 percent of the plant stand remains: and
    (i) It is practical to replant: and
    (ii) If, at the time the crop was damaged, the final day of the 
planting period has not passed.
    (2) Whenever sweet corn initially is planted during the fall or 
winter planting periods and the condition specified in section 
9(b)(1)(ii) is not satisfied, you may elect:
    (i) To replant such acreage and collect any replant payment due as 
specified in section 12. The initial planting period coverage will 
continue for such replanted acreage.
    (ii) Not to replant such acreage and receive an indemnity based on 
the stage of growth the plants had attained at the time of damage. 
However, such an election will result in the acreage being uninsurable 
in the subsequent planting period.

                          10. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), coverage begins on each unit or part of a 
unit the later of the date we accept your application, or when the sweet 
corn is planted in each planting period. Coverage ends at the earliest 
of:
    (a) Total destruction of the sweet corn on the unit;
    (b) Abandonment of the sweet corn on the unit;
    (c) The date harvest should have started on the unit on any acreage 
which will not be harvested;
    (d) Final adjustment of a loss on the unit;
    (e) Final harvest; or

[[Page 198]]

    (f) 100 days after the date of planting or replanting.

                           11. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Excess rain;
    (2) Excess wind;
    (3) Fire;
    (4) Freeze;
    (5) Hail;
    (6) Tornado; or
    (7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against any loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless no effective control 
measure exists for such disease or insect infestation; or
    (2) Failure to market the sweet corn, unless such failure is due to 
actual physical damage caused by an insured cause of loss that occurs 
during the insurance period.

                         12. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if, due to an 
insured cause of loss, more than 25 percent of the plant stand will not 
produce sweet corn and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of your actual cost of replanting or the result obtained by 
multiplying the per acre replanting payment amount contained in the 
Special Provisions by your insured share.
    (c) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 (Replanting 
Payment) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), limiting a replanting 
payment to one each crop year, only one replanting payment will be made 
for acreage planted during each planting period within the crop year.

                13. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements contained in section 14 (Duties In 
The Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if 
you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit you also must give us 
notice not later than 72 hours after the earliest of:
    (a) The time you discontinue harvest of any acreage on the unit;
    (b) The date harvest normally would start if any acreage on the unit 
will not be harvested; or
    (c) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period.

                         14. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage in each stage by the amount of 
insurance per acre for the final stage;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 14(b)(1) by the percentage 
for the applicable stage (see section 3(d));
    (3) Total the results of section 14(b)(2);
    (4) Subtracting either of the following values from the result of 
section 14(b)(3):
    (i) For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, the total 
value of production to be counted (see section 14(c)); or
    (ii) For catastrophic risk protection coverage, the result of 
multiplying the total value of production to be counted (see section 
14(c)) times:
    (A) Sixty percent for the 1998 crop year; or
    (B) Fifty-five percent for 1999 and subsequent crop years; and
    (5) Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(4) by your share.
    (c) The total value of production to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for the stage for 
any acreage:
    (i) That is abandoned;
    (ii) Put to another use without our consent;
    (iii) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (iv) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (2) The value of the following appraised production will not be less 
than the dollar amount obtained by multiplying the number of containers 
of appraised sweet corn times the minimum value per container shown in 
the Special Provisions for the planting period:
    (i) Unharvested production (unharvested production that is damaged 
or defective due to insurable causes and is not marketable will not be 
counted as production to count);
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; and
    (iii) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to

[[Page 199]]

another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of 
production is not reached:
    (A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a 
subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine 
actual production (If we require you to continue to care for the crop 
and you do not do so, the original appraisal will be used); or
    (B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop, in which case 
the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested 
production, or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.
    (3) The total value of all harvested production from the insurable 
acreage will be the dollar amount obtained by subtracting the allowable 
cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price received for 
each container of sweet corn (this result may not be less than the 
minimum value shown in the Special Provisions for any container of sweet 
corn), and multiplying this result by the number of containers of sweet 
corn harvested. Harvested mature sweet corn that is damaged or defective 
due to insurable causes and is not marketable, will not be counted as 
production to count.

                     15. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

                        16. Minimum Value Option

    (a) The provisions of this option are continuous and will be 
attached to and made a part of your insurance policy, if:
    (1) You elect the Minimum Value Option on your application, or on a 
form approved by us, on or before the sales closing date for the initial 
crop year in which you wish to insure fresh market sweet corn under this 
option, and pay the additional premium indicated in the actuarial 
documents for this optional coverage; and
    (2) You have not elected coverage under the Catastrophic Risk 
Protection Endorsement.
    (b) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 14(c)(3), the 
total value of harvested production will be determined as follows:
    (1) For sold production, the dollar amount obtained by subtracting 
the allowable cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price 
received for each container of sweet corn (this result may not be less 
than zero for any container of sweet corn), and multiplying this result 
by the number of containers of sweet corn sold; and
    (2) For marketable production that is not sold, the dollar amount 
obtained by multiplying the number of containers of such sweet corn on 
the unit by the minimum value shown in the Special Provisions for the 
planting period (harvested production that is damaged or defective due 
to insurable causes and is not marketable will not be counted as 
production).
    (c) This option may be canceled by either you or us for any 
succeeding crop year by giving written notice on or before the 
cancellation date preceding the crop year for which the cancellation of 
this option is to be effective.

Sec. 457.130  Macadamia tree crop insurance provisions.

    The macadamia tree crop insurance provisions for the 1999 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider).
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                     Macadamia Tree Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Age. The number of complete 12-month periods that have elapsed since 
the month the trees were set out or were grafted, whichever is later. 
Age determination will be made for each unit, or portion thereof, as of 
January 1 of each crop year.
    Crop year. A period beginning with the date insurance attaches to 
the macadamia tree crop extending through December 31 of the same 
calendar year. The crop year is designated by the calendar year in which 
insurance attaches.
    Destroyed. Trees damaged to the extent that we determine 
replacement, including grafts, is required.
    Good farming practices. The cultural practices generally in use in 
the county for the crop to have normal growth and vigor, and are those 
recognized by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension 
Service as compatible with agronomic and weather conditions in the area.
    Graft. The uniting of a macadamia shoot to an established macadamia 
tree rootstock for future production of macadamia nuts.
    Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any 
form of alternating or mixed pattern.

[[Page 200]]

    Irrigated practice. A method by which the normal growth and vigor of 
the insured trees is maintained by artificially applying adequate 
quantities of water during the growing season by appropriate systems and 
at the proper times.
    Rootstock. The root and stem portion of a macadamia tree to which a 
macadamia shoot can be grafted.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) Sections 34(a) (1), (3), and (4) of the Basic Provisions are not 
applicable.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Unless otherwise allowed 
by written agreement, optional units may be established only if each 
optional unit:
    (1) Contains at least 80 acres of insurable age macadamia trees; or
    (2) Is located on non-contiguous land.
    (c) You must have provided records, which can be independently 
verified, of acreage and age of trees for each unit for at least the 
last crop year.

    3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Dollar Amounts for 
                         Determining Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) You may select only one dollar amount of insurance for all the 
macadamia trees in the county in each age group contained in the 
actuarial table that are insured under this policy. The dollar amount of 
insurance you choose for each age group must have the same percentage 
relationship to the maximum dollar amount offered by us for each age 
group. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum dollar 
amount of insurance for one age group, you must also choose 100 percent 
of the maximum dollar amount of insurance for all other age groups.
    (2) If the stand is less than 90 percent, based on the original 
planting pattern, the dollar amount of insurance will be reduced 1 
percent for each percent below 90 percent. For example, if the dollar 
amount of insurance you selected is $2,000 and the stand is 85 percent 
of the original stand, the dollar amount of insurance on which any 
indemnity will be based is $1,900 ($2,000 multiplied by 0.95).
    (3) You must report, by the sales closing date contained in the 
Special Provisions, by type if applicable:
    (i) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the dollar amount of insurance and the 
number of affected acres;
    (ii) The number of trees on insurable and uninsurable acreage;
    (iii) The month and year on which the trees were set out or grafted 
and the planting pattern;
    (iv) For the first year of insurance following replacement, the 
month and year of replacement if more than 10 percent of the trees on 
any unit have been replaced in the previous five crop years; and
    (v) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such 
acreage is changed:
    (A) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
    (B) The planting pattern; and
    (C) Any other information that we request in order to establish your 
dollar amount of insurance.
    We will reduce the dollar amount of insurance as necessary, based on 
our estimate of the effect of interplanted perennial crop, removal of 
trees, damage, change in practices, and any other circumstance that 
adversely affects the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any 
circumstance that may reduce your dollar amount of insurance from 
previous levels, we will reduce your dollar amount of insurance as 
necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (b) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), do not apply to 
macadamia trees.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are December 31.

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all macadamia trees in the county 
for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial table:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown for the production of macadamia nuts;
    (c) For which the rootstock is adapted to the area;
    (d) That are at least one year of age when the insurance period 
begins; and
    (e) That, if the orchard is inspected, is considered acceptable by 
us.

[[Page 201]]

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, macadamia trees interplanted with 
another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and 
determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your 
policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on January 1 of each crop year, except that for 
the year of application, if your application is received after December 
22 but prior to January 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after 
your properly completed application is received in our local office, 
unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine 
that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any 
information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition 
of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is December 31.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of macadamia trees on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no 
premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year 
unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Earthquake;
    (4) Volcanic eruption;
    (5) Wildlife, unless proper measures to control wildlife have not 
been taken; or
    (6) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage due to disease or insect infestation, unless adverse 
weather:
    (1) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (2) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), in case of 
damage or probable loss, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any 
unit, you must allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning or 
removing any damaged trees.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the dollar amount of 
insurance per acre for each age group;
    (2) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(1);
    (3) Multiplying the total dollar amount of insurance obtained in 
section 11(b)(2) by the applicable percent of loss, which is determined 
as follows:
    (i) Subtract the coverage level percent you elected from 100 
percent;
    (ii) Subtract the result obtained in section 11(b)(3)(i) from the 
actual percent of loss;
    (iii) Divide the result in section 11(b)(3)(ii) by the coverage 
level you elected (For example, if you elected the 75 percent coverage 
level and your actual percent of loss was 70 percent, the percent of 
loss specified in section 11(b)(3) would be calculated as follows: 100% 
- 75% = 25%; 70% - 25% = 45%; 45% / 75% = 60%.); and
    (4) Multiply the result in section 11(b)(3) by your share.
    (c) The total amount of loss will include both trees damaged and 
trees destroyed as follows:
    (1) Any orchard with over 80 percent actual damage due to an insured 
cause of loss will be considered to be 100 percent damaged; and
    (2) Any percent of damage by uninsured causes will not be included 
in the percent of loss.

<R05>
Sec. 457.131  Macadamia nut crop insurance provisions.

    The macadamia nut crop insurance provisions for the 2000 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                      Macadamia Nut Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Age. The number of complete 12-month periods that have elapsed since 
the month the trees were set out or were grafted, whichever is later. An 
age determination will be made for each unit, or portion thereof, as of 
January 1 of each crop year.
    Crop year. A period beginning with the date insurance attaches to 
the macadamia nut crop and extending through the normal harvest time. 
The crop year is designated by the calendar year in which the insurance 
period ends.
    Direct marketing. Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, and permitting the general public to enter the orchard for the 
purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Graft. The uniting of a macadamia shoot to an established macadamia 
tree rootstock for future production of macadamia nuts.
    Harvest. Picking of mature macadamia nuts from the ground.
    Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any 
form of alternating or mixed pattern.
    Pound. A unit of weight equal to 16 ounces avoirdupois.
    Production guarantee (per acre). The number of wet, in-shell pounds 
determined by multiplying the approved APH yield per acre by the 
coverage level percentage you elect.
    Rootstock. The root and stem portion of a macadamia tree to which a 
macadamia shoot can be grafted.
    Wet in-shell. The weight of the macadamia nuts as they are removed 
from the orchard with the nut meats in the shells after removal of the 
husk but prior to being dried.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) Section 34(a)(1) of the Basic Provisions is not applicable.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Unless otherwise allowed 
by written agreement, optional units may be established only if each 
optional unit:
    (1) Contains at least 80 acres of bearing macadamia trees; or
    (2) Is located on non-contiguous land.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the macadamia 
nuts in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by type, in which case you 
may select one price election for each macadamia nut type designated in 
the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type 
must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered 
by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the 
maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of 
the maximum price election for all other types.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for 
Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by type 
if applicable:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based and the number of affected acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield.

[[Page 203]]

    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: 
interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in 
practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of the 
insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may 
reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production 
guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (c) The yield used to compute your production guarantee will be 
determined in accordance with Actual Production History (APH) 
regulations, 7 CFR part 400, subpart G, and applicable policy provisions 
unless damage or changes to the orchard or trees require establishment 
of the yield by another method. In the event of such damage or changes, 
the yield will be based on our appraisal of the potential of the insured 
acreage for the crop year.
    (d) Instead of reporting your macadamia nut production for the 
previous crop year, as required by section 3 of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), there is a one year lag period. Each crop year you must 
report your production from two crop years ago, e.g., on the 2001 crop 
year production report, you will provide your 1999 crop year production.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are December 31.

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all macadamia nuts in the county 
for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown on tree varieties that:
    (1) Were commercially available when the trees were set out;
    (2) Are adapted to the area; and
    (3) Are grown on a rootstock that is adapted to the area.
    (c) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us;
    (d) That are grown on trees that have reached at least the fifth 
growing season after being set out or grafted. However, we may agree in 
writing to insure acreage that has not reached this age if it has 
produced at least 200 pounds of (wet, in-shell) macadamia nuts per acre 
in a previous crop year; and
    (e) That are produced from blooms that normally occur during the 
calendar year in which insurance attaches and that are normally 
harvested prior to the end of the insurance period.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, macadamia nuts interplanted with another 
perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine 
that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on January 1 of each crop year, except that for 
the year of application, if your application is received after December 
22 but prior to January 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after 
your properly completed application is received in our local office, 
unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine 
that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any 
information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition 
of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is the second June 30th after insurance attaches.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of macadamia nuts on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no 
premium or indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year 
unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only

[[Page 204]]

against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance 
period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Earthquake;
    (4) Volcanic eruption;
    (5) Wildlife, unless proper measures to control wildlife have not 
been taken; or
    (6) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available;
    (2) Inability to market the macadamia nuts for any reason other than 
actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this 
section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable 
to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the following 
will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have 
started if the crop will not be harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal 
that will be used to determine your production to count for production 
that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, 
we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any 
acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your 
production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will 
be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre 
if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
    (c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest or immediately if 
damage is discovered during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged 
production. You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have 
given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements 
of this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the 
damaged production, we may consider all such production to be undamaged 
and include it as production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by 
its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each type, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if 
applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the results in section 11(b)(5) from the results in 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (wet, in-shell pounds) from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the 
requirements contained in section 10;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count; and

[[Page 205]]

    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Cause 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available; or
    (2) Inability to market the cranberries for any reason other than 
actual physical damage from an insurable cause of loss specified in this

such production will be considered undamaged and included as production 
to count.

                         10. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(1) by the price 
election;
    (3) Multiplying the total production to be counted, (see section 
10(c)) by the price election;
    (4) Subtracting the total in section 10(b)(3) from the total in 
section 10(b)(2); and
    (5) Multiplying the result in section 10(b)(4) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in barrels) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Damaged solely by uninsured causes;
    (C) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records; or
    (D) Destroyed or put to another use without our consent;

[[Page 207]]

    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we will use 
the appraised amount of production or defer the claim if you agree to 
continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when 
you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general to the area 
unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested 
production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal 
made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the 
production to count; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (3) Harvested production which, due to insurable causes, is 
determined not to meet the United States Standards for Fresh Cranberries 
if available, or would not meet those standards if properly handled, or 
does not meet the quality requirements of the receiving handler if the 
United States Standards for Fresh Cranberries, if not available, and 
such harvested production has a value less than 75 percent of the market 
price for cranberries meeting the minimum requirements will be adjusted 
by:
    (i) Dividing the value per barrel of such cranberries by the market 
price per barrel for cranberries meeting the minimum requirements; and
    (ii) Multiplying the result by the number of barrels of such 
cranberries.

                     11. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

Sec. 457.133  Prune crop insurance provisions.

    The Prune Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2001 and succeeding crop 
years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                          Prune Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Direct marketing. Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include: selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, 
farmer's market, and permitting the general public to enter the field 
for the purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Harvest. Picking of mature prunes from the trees or ground either by 
hand or machine.
    Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any 
form of alternating or mixed pattern.
    Market price for standard prunes. The price per ton shown on the 
processor's settlement sheet for each size count of standard prunes.
    Natural condition prunes. The condition of prunes in which they are 
normally delivered from a dehydrator or dry yard.
    Prunes. Any type or variety of plums that is grown in the area for 
the production of prunes and that meets the requirements defined in the 
applicable Federal Marketing Agreement Dried Prune Order.
    Standard prunes. Any natural condition prunes:
    (a) That grade ``C'' or better in accordance with the United States 
Standards for Grades of Fresh Plums and Prunes; or
    (b) That meet or exceed the grading standards in effect for the crop 
year if a Federal Marketing Agreement Dried Prune Order has been 
established for the area in which the insured crop is grown.
    Substandard prunes. Any natural condition prunes failing to meet the 
applicable grading specifications for standard prunes.
    Ton. Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.

                            2. Unit Division

    Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Instead of 
establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm 
serial number optional units may be established if each optional unit is 
located on non-contiguous land.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the prunes in the 
county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide 
different price elections by varietal group, in which case you may 
select

[[Page 208]]

one price election for each prune varietal group designated in the 
Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each varietal 
group must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price 
offered by us for each varietal group. For example, if you choose 100 
percent of the maximum price election for one varietal group, you must 
also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other 
varietal groups.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by varietal group if applicable:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yields below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such 
acreage is changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and varietal group if 
applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of interplanting the 
perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; a change in practices, and any 
other circumstance that may affect the yield potential of the insured 
crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your 
yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee at 
any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is October 31 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are January 31.

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the prunes in the county for which a premium rate is 
provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown for the production of natural condition prunes;
    (c) That are grown on tree varieties that:
    (1) Were commercially available when the trees were set out;
    (2) Are adapted to the area;
    (3) Are grown on rootstock that is adapted to the area; and
    (4) Are irrigated (except where otherwise provided in the Special 
Provisions);
    (d) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us; and
    (e) That are grown on trees that have reached at least the seventh 
growing season after being set out.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that 
prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, prunes 
interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect 
the acreage and determine that it does not meet the insurability 
requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) Coverage begins for each crop year on March 1.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is:
    (i) October 1 for California; or
    (ii) October 15 for Oregon.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of prunes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year and 
if the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, insurance will 
not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will 
be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

[[Page 209]]

    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (d) If your prune policy is canceled or terminated for any crop 
year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance 
attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and 
termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered 
to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, 
or indemnity will be due for such crop year.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and undergrowth have not been controlled or 
pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Wildlife;
    (4) Earthquake;
    (5) Volcanic eruption; or
    (6) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause 
specified in section 9(a)(1) through (5) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of 
production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available; or
    (2) Inability to market the prunes for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the following will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have 
started if the crop will not be harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing or sold as fresh fruit. We 
will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production 
to count for production that is sold by direct marketing or is sold as 
fresh fruit production. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will 
conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable 
records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to 
count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be sold by 
direct marketing or sold as fresh fruit will result in an appraised 
amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee 
per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required 
appraisal.
    (c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if 
damage is discovered during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged 
production.
    (d) You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given 
you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of 
this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the 
damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and 
included as production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each varietal group, if 
applicable, by its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying the result of 11(b)(1) by the respective price 
election for each varietal group, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2) if there is more than 
one varietal group;
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 11(c)), 
of each varietal group if applicable, by its respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4) if there is more than 
one varietal group;
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(4) from the result of 
section 11(b)(2) if there is only one varietal group or subtracting the 
result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3) if there 
is more than one varietal group; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.

[[Page 210]]

                               For Example

    You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of varietal group A prunes 
in the unit, with a guarantee of 2.5 tons per acre and a price election 
of $630.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 10.0 tons. Your 
indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 50 acres x 2.5 tons = 125.0 ton guarantee;
    (2) 125.0 tons x $ 630.00 price election = $78,750.00 value of 
guarantee;
    (4) 10.0 tons x $630.00 price election = $6,300.00 value of 
production to count;
    (6) $78,750.00 - $6,300.00 = $72,450.00 loss; and
    (7) $72,450.00 x 100 percent = $72,450 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of varietal group B 
prunes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 2.0 ton per acre and a 
price election of $550.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 5.0 
tons. Your total indemnity for both varietal groups A and B would be 
calculated as follows:
    (1) 50 acres x 2.5 tons = 125.0 ton guarantee for varietal group A 
and 50.0 acres x 2.0 tons = 100.0 ton guarantee for varietal group B;
    (2) 125.0 ton guarantee x $630.00 price election = $78,750.00 value 
of guarantee for varietal group A and 100.0 ton guarantee x $550.00 
price election = $55,000.00 value guarantee for varietal group B;
    (3) $78,750.00 + $55,000.00 = $133,750.00 total value guarantee;
    (4) 10.0 tons x $630.00 price election = $6,300.00 value of 
production to count for varietal group A and 5.0 tons x $550.00 price 
election = $2,750.00 value of production to count for varietal group B;
    (5) $6,300.00 + $2,750.00 = $9,050.00 total value of production to 
count;
    (6) $133,750.00 - $9,050.00 = $124,700.00 loss; and
    (7) $124,700.00 loss x 100 percent = $124,700 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include all harvested and appraised production 
of natural condition prunes that grade substandard or better and any 
production that is harvested and intended for use as fresh fruit. The 
total production to count will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is sold by direct marketing or sold as fresh fruit if you 
fail to meet the requirements contained in section 10;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you intend to abandon 
or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of 
production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage 
will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim 
only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make 
another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest 
is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we 
will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for 
the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used 
to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Any prune production harvested for fresh fruit will be converted 
to a dried prune weight basis by dividing the total amount (in tons) of 
fresh fruit production by 3.0.
    (e) Any production of substandard prunes resulting from damage by 
insurable causes will be adjusted based on the average size count as 
indicated on the applicable Dried Fruit Association (DFA) Inspection 
Report and Certification Form. Any insurable damage will be adjusted by:
    (1) Dividing the value per ton of such substandard prunes by the 
market price per ton for standard prunes (of the same size count); and
    (2) Multiplying the result by the number of tons of such prunes.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)

    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                    Peanut Crop Insurance Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions, with (1) controlling (2), etc.

[[Page 211]]

                             1. Definitions

    Approved yield. The yield calculated in accordance with 7 CFR part 
400, subpart G, if required by section 3(c) of these provisions.
    Average price per pound:
    (1) The average CCC support price per pound, by type, for 
Segregation I peanuts and Segregation II and III peanuts eligible to be 
valued as quota peanuts; or
    (2) The highest non-quota price election contained in the Special 
Provisions for all Segregation II and III peanuts not eligible to be 
valued as quota peanuts.
    Average support price per pound. The average price per pound for 
each type of quota peanuts announced by the USDA under the peanut price 
support program.
    CCC. Commodity Credit Corporation, a wholly owned government 
corporation within USDA.
    County. In addition to the definition contained in the Basic 
Provisions, ``county'' also includes any land identified by a FSA farm 
serial number for such county but physically located in another county.
    Effective poundage marketing quota. The number of pounds reported on 
the acreage report as eligible for the average support price per pound 
(including transfers of quota peanuts from one farm serial number to 
another farm serial number), not to exceed the Marketing Quota 
established by FSA for the farm serial number.
    Farmers' stock peanuts. Peanuts customarily marketed by producers, 
produced in the United States, and which are not shelled, crushed, 
cleaned, or otherwise changed (except for removal of foreign material, 
loose shelled kernels, and excess moisture) from the condition in which 
peanuts are harvested.
    Green peanuts. Peanuts that are harvested and marketed prior to 
maturity without drying or removal of moisture either by natural or 
artificial means.
    Inspection certificate and sales memorandum. A USDA form that 
records the inspection grading results and marketing record for the net 
weight of peanuts delivered to a buyer.
    Non-quota peanuts. Peanuts other than quota peanuts.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the requirement in the definition in 
the Basic Provisions, peanuts must initially be planted in rows wide 
enough apart to permit mechanical cultivation. Acreage planted in any 
other manner will not be insurable unless otherwise provided by the 
Special Provisions or by written agreement.
    Production guarantee (per acre). In addition to the definition of 
``production guarantee (per acre)'' in the Basic Provisions, the 
production guarantee (per acre) is the number of pounds determined by 
multiplying the yield per acre contained in the actuarial documents or 
the approved yield multiplied by the coverage level percentage you 
elect.
    Quota peanuts. Peanuts that are eligible to be valued at the average 
support price per pound.
    Segregation I, II, or III. Grades designated and defined for peanuts 
by the Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA.
    Value per pound. A price determined by USDA as shown on the USDA 
``Inspection Certificate and Sales Memorandum'' or other value accepted 
by us.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) In lieu of the provisions in section 34 of the Basic Provisions 
that permit optional unit by section, section equivalent, irrigated or 
non-irrigated acreage, each optional unit must be located in a separate 
farm identified by a single FSA Farm Serial Number.
    (b) We may reject or modify any FSA reconstitution for the purpose 
of the unit definition, if we determine the reconstitution was done in 
whole or in part to defeat the purpose of the Federal crop insurance 
program or to gain a disproportionate advantage under this policy.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) The price elections you choose for the quota and non-quota 
peanuts must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price 
election offered by us for quota and non-quota peanuts. For example, if 
you choose 100 percent of the maximum quota peanut price election, you 
must also choose 100 percent of the maximum non-quota election.
    (b) The maximum pounds that may be insured at the quota price 
election are the lesser of :
    (1) The effective poundage marketing quota; or
    (2) The insured acreage multiplied by the production guarantee. If 
the insured acres multiplied by the production guarantee exceeds the 
effective poundage marketing quota, the difference will be insured at 
the non-quota peanut price election.
    (c) You may be required to file an annual production report to us, 
if required by the Special Provisions, to establish an approved yield in 
lieu of the yield published in the actuarial documents. If we require 
you to file an annual production report, you must do so in accordance 
with section 3(c) of the Basic Provisions.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must report the effective poundage marketing quota, if 
any, that is applicable to each basic and optional unit for the current 
crop year.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 
7(c) of the Basic Provisions, the annual premium will be determined by:
    (a) Multiplying the insured effective poundage marketing quota by 
the price election for quota peanuts;
    (b) Multiplying the insured pounds of non-quota peanuts by the price 
election for non-quota peanuts;
    (c) Totaling the results of section 7(a) and 7(b);
    (d) Multiplying the total of section 7(c) by the applicable premium 
rate stated in the actuarial documents;
    (e) Multiplying the result of section 7(d) by your share at the time 
coverage begins; and
    (f) Multiplying the result of section 7(e) by any premium adjustment 
percentages that may apply.

                             8. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the peanuts in the county for which a premium rate 
is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are planted for the purpose of marketing as farmers' stock 
peanuts;
    (c) That are a type of peanut designated in the Special Provisions 
as being insurable; and
    (d) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (1) Planted for the purpose of harvesting as green peanuts;
    (2) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (3) Planted into an established grass or legume.

                          9. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that replanting is not practical.
    (b) We will not insure any acreage:
    (1) On which peanuts are grown using no-till or minimum tillage 
farming methods unless allowed by the Special Provisions or written 
agreement; or
    (2) Which does not meet the rotation requirements, if any, contained 
in the Special Provisions.

                          10. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the 
date immediately following planting as follows:
    (a) November 30 in all states except New Mexico, Oklahoma, and 
Texas; and
    (b) December 31 in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.
    (c) ``Removal of peanuts from the field'' replaces ``harvest'' as an 
event marking the end of the insurance period in section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions.

                           11. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or

[[Page 213]]

    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in section 11(a) through (g) that occurs during the 
insurance period.

                         12. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions:
    (1) A replanting payment is allowed if the crop is damaged by an 
insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not 
produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage 
and it is practical to replant.
    (2) The maximum amount of the replanting payment for the unit will 
be the lesser of :
    (i) Eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre multiplied by the number of 
acres replanted and multiplied by your insured share;
    (ii) The actual cost of replanting per acre multiplied by the number 
of acres replanted and multiplied by your insured share; or
    (iii) Twenty percent (20%) of the production guarantee multiplied by 
your quota price election, multiplied by the number of acres replanted, 
and multiplied by your insured share.
    (b) When peanuts are replanted using a practice that is uninsurable 
as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by 
the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be 
reduced.

                13. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the representative samples of the unharvested crop that we 
may require must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length 
of each field in the unit. If you intend to put the acreage to another 
use or not harvest the crop, the samples must not be harvested or 
destroyed until our inspection.

                         14. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; and
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) When settling your claim, the effective poundage marketing 
quota, if any, for each unit will be limited to the lesser of:
    (1) The amount of the effective poundage marketing quota reported on 
the acreage report;
    (2) The amount of the FSA effective poundage marketing quota; or
    (3) The amount determined at the final settlement of your claim.
    (c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for the unit by the production 
guarantee per acre, by type if applicable;
    (2) Subtracting the insured effective poundage marketing quota from 
the result of section 14(c)(1) to determine the amount of insured non-
quota peanuts;
    (3) Multiplying the insured effective poundage marketing quota and 
the result of section 14(c)(2) by the respective price election by type, 
if applicable, for quota and non-quota peanuts, respectively;
    (4) Totaling the results of section 14(c)(3) (This amount will be 
the same as (3) if there is only one type);
    (5) Multiply the production to count for quota and non-quota peanuts 
(see section 14(d)), for each type if applicable, by the respective 
price elections;
    (6) Totaling the results of section 14(c)(5) (This amount will be 
the same as (5) if there is only one type);
    (7) Subtracting the result of section 14(c)(6) from section 
14(c)(4); and
    (8) Multiplying the result in section 14(b)(7) and section 14(b)(8) 
by your share.
    For example:
    You have 100 percent share in 25 acres of Valencia peanuts in the 
unit, with a 2000 pounds per acre guarantee, an effective poundage 
marketing quota of 40,000 pounds, and a price election of $0.34 per 
pound for quota and $0.15 per pounds for non-quota. You are able to 
harvest 43,000 pounds in which 40,000 pounds are quota segregation I and 
3,000 pounds are non-quota segregation II and III due to quality 
adjustment. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 25 acres x 2,000 pounds per acre = 50,000 pounds guarantee;
    (2) 50,000 pounds guarantee - 40,000 pounds of effective marketing 
quota = 10,000 pounds of non-quota guarantee;
    (3) 40,000 pounds x $.34 price election for quota = $13,600.00 value 
of guarantee; 10,000 pounds x $.15 price election for non-quota = 
$1,500.00 value of guarantee;
    (4) $13,600.00 + $1,500.00 = $15,100.00 total of value of guarantee;
    (5) 40,000 pounds of quota production to count x .34 = $13,600.00 
quota value of production to count;
    3,000 pounds of non-quota production to count x .15 = $450.00 non-
quota value of production to count;
    (6) $13,600.00 + $450.00 = $14,050.00 total value of production to 
count;
    (8) $15,100.00 total value guarantee - $14,050.00 total value of 
production to count = $1,050.00 loss; and
    (9) $1,050.00 value of loss x 100 percent = $1,050.00 indemnity 
payment.
    (d) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable 
acreage on the

[[Page 214]]

unit will include all appraised and harvested production.
    (e) All appraised production will include:
    (1) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (i) That is abandoned;
    (ii) Put to another use without our consent;
    (iii) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (iv) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us.
    (2) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (3) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
section 14(f)); and
    (4) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (i) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (ii) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (5) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (f) Mature peanut production that is damaged by insurable causes and 
for which the value per pound is less than the average support price per 
pound for the type will be adjusted by:
    (1) Dividing the value per pound for the insured type of peanuts by 
the applicable average price per pound; and
    (2) Multiplying this result by the number of pounds of such 
production.
    (g) To enable us to determine the net weight and quality of 
production of any peanuts for which an ``Inspection Certificate and 
Sales Memorandum'' has not been issued, we must be given the opportunity 
to have such peanuts inspected and graded before you dispose of them. If 
you dispose of any production without giving us the opportunity to have 
the peanuts inspected and graded, the gross weight of such production 
will be used in determining total production to count unless you submit 
a marketing record satisfactory to us which clearly shows the net weight 
and quality of such peanuts.

    Note: In accordance with the Federal Crop Insurance Act, in the 
event of a crop loss, policyholders with the Catastrophic Risk 
Protection level of coverage must elect to either receive benefits under 
these Crop Provisions or if applicable, the Commodity Credit Corporation 
Quota Loan Pool Regulations.)

<R05>
Sec. 457.135  Onion crop insurance provisions.

    The onion crop insurance provisions for the 2000 and succeeding crop 
years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                          Onion Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2) etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Damaged onion production. Storage type onions that do not grade U.S. 
No. 1 or do not satisfy any other standards that may be contained in the 
Special Provisions; or non-storage type onions which do not satisfy 
standards contained in any applicable marketing order or other standards 
that may be contained in the Special Provisions.
    Direct Marketing. Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, and permitting the general public to enter the field for the 
purpose of harvesting all or a portion of the crop.
    Direct seeded. Placing onion seed by machine or by hand at the 
correct depth, into a seedbed that has been properly prepared for the 
planting method and production practice.
    Harvest. Removal of the onions from the field after topping and 
lifting or digging.

[[Page 215]]

    Hundredweight. 100 pounds avoirdupois.
    Lifting or digging. A pre-harvest process in which the onion roots 
are severed from the soil and the onion bulbs laid on the surface of the 
soil for drying in the field.
    Non-storage onions. Generally of a Bermuda, Granex, or Grano 
variety, or hybrids developed from these varieties, that are harvested 
as a bulb and dried only a short time, and consequently have a higher 
moisture content. They are thinner skinned, contain a higher sugar 
content, and are generally milder in flavor than storage onions. Due to 
a higher moisture and sugar content, they are subject to deterioration 
both on the surface and internally if not used shortly after harvest.
    Onion production. Onions of recoverable size and condition, with 
excess dirt and foliage material removed and that are not considered 
damaged onion production.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, onions must be planted in rows.
    Production Guarantee (per acre):
    (a) First stage production guarantee--Thirty-five percent (35%) of 
the final stage production guarantee for direct seeded storage and non-
storage onions and 45 percent of the final stage production guarantee 
for transplanted storage and non-storage onions, unless otherwise 
specified in the Special Provisions.
    (b) Second stage production guarantee--Seventy percent (70%) of the 
final stage production guarantee for direct seeded storage onions and 60 
percent of the final stage production guarantee for transplanted storage 
onions and all non-storage onions, unless otherwise specified in the 
Special Provisions.
    (c) Final stage production guarantee--The quantity of onions (in 
hundredweight) determined by multiplying the approved yield per acre by 
the coverage level percentage you elect.
    Storage onions. Onions other than a Bermuda, Granex, or Grano 
variety, or hybrids developed from these varieties that are harvested as 
a bulb and dried to a lower moisture content, are firmer, have more 
outer layers of paper-like skin, and are darker in color than non-
storage onions. They are generally more pungent, have a lower sugar 
content, and can normally be stored for several months under proper 
conditions prior to use without deterioration.
    Topping. A pre-harvest process to initiate curing, in which onion 
foliage is removed or bent over.
    Transplanted. Placing of the onion plant or bulb, by machine or by 
hand at the correct depth, into a seedbed that has been properly 
prepared for the planting method and production practice.
    Type. A category of onions as identified in the Special Provisions.

                            2. Unit Division

    2. Unit Division.
    In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units as 
provided in section 34 of the Basic Provisions, optional units may be 
established by type, if the type is designated in the Special 
Provisions.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price 
election for all the onions in the county insured under this policy 
unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type, 
in which case you may select one price election for each onion type 
designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for 
each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum 
price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 
percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 
100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.
    (b) Your production guarantee progresses, in stages, to the final 
stage production guarantee. Stages will be determined on an acre basis 
and at least 75% of the plants on such acreage must be at the same stage 
to qualify for the applicable stage guarantee. The stages are as 
follows:
    (1) First stage extends:
    (i) For direct seeded storage and non-storage onions, from planting 
until the emergence of the fourth leaf; and
    (ii) For transplanted storage and non-storage onions, from 
transplanting of onion plants or sets through the 30th day after 
transplanting.
    (2) Second stage extends:
    (i) For direct seeded storage and non-storage onions, from the 
emergence of the fourth leaf; and
    (ii) For transplanted storage and non-storage onions, from the 31st 
day after transplanting.
    (3) Final stage extends from the completion of topping and lifting 
or digging on the acreage until the end of the insurance period, and is 
the quantity of onions (in hundredweight) determined by multiplying the 
approved yield per acre by the coverage level percentage elected.
    (c) Any acreage of onions damaged in the first or second stage, to 
the extent that producers in the area would not normally further care 
for the onions, will be deemed to have been destroyed even though you 
may continue to care for the onions. The production guarantee for such 
acreage will not exceed the production guarantee for the stage in which 
the damage occurred.

[[Page 216]]

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is June 30 preceding 
the cancellation date for counties with an August 31 cancellation date, 
and November 30 preceding the cancellation date for all other counties.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are:

                            6. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the provisions of section 7(c) (Annual Premium) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the annual premium amount is computed by 
multiplying the final stage production guarantee by the price election, 
the premium rate, the insured acreage, your share at the time of 
planting, and any applicable premium adjustment factors contained in the 
actuarial documents.

                             7. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the storage and non-storage 
onions (excluding green (bunch) or seed onions, chives, garlic, leeks, 
and scallions) in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the 
actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are planted for harvest as either storage onions or non-
storage onions;
    (c) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (1) Interplanted with another crop, unless the onions are 
interplanted with a windbreak crop and the windbreak crop is destroyed 
within 70 days after completion of seeding or transplanting; or
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure any acreage of the 
insured crop that:
    (a) Was planted the previous year to storage or non-storage onions, 
green (bunch) onions, seed onions, chives, garlic, leeks, shallots, or 
scallions unless different rotation requirements are specified in the 
Special Provisions or we agree in writing to insure such acreage; or
    (b) Is damaged before the final planting date to the extent that the 
majority of producers in the area would normally not further care for 
the crop and is not replanted, unless we agree that it is not practical 
to replant.

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the acreage must be planted on or 
before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions 
except as allowed in section 14(c).
    (b) The insurance period ends at the earliest of:
    (1) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period as 
follows:
    (i) June 1 for Vidalia, and any other non-storage onions planted in 
the State of Georgia;
    (ii) July 15 for 1015 Super Sweets, and any other non-storage onions 
in the State of Texas;
    (iii) July 31 for Walla Walla Sweets, and any other non-storage 
onions in the states of Oregon and Washington;
    (iv) August 31 for all non-storage onions in any other state; and
    (v) October 15 for all storage onions; or
    (2) The following event for each unit or portion of a unit:
    (i) Removal of the onions from the field; or
    (ii) Fourteen days after lifting or digging.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken;

[[Page 217]]

    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against as listed 
in section 12 (Causes of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we 
will not insure against any loss of production due to damage that occurs 
or becomes evident after the end of the insurance period, including, but 
not limited to, loss of production that occurs after onions have been 
placed in storage.

                         11. Replanting Payment

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the crop is 
damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining 
stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the final stage production 
guarantee for the acreage and we determine that it is practical to 
replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
your actual cost for replanting, but will not exceed the lesser of:
    (1) 7 percent of the final stage production guarantee multiplied by 
your price election for the type originally planted and by your insured 
share; or
    (2) 18 hundredweight multiplied by your price election for the type 
originally planted and by your insured share.
    (c) When onions are replanted using a practice that is uninsurable 
as an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by 
the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be 
reduced.

                12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), any 
representative samples of the unharvested crop that may be required must 
be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in 
the unit. The samples must not be harvested or destroyed until the 
earlier of our inspection or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the 
unit is completed.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal 
that will be used to determine your production to count for production 
that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, 
we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any 
acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your 
production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will 
be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count that is not less than the production guarantee per 
acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required 
appraisal.

                         13. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result of section 13(b)(1) by the respective 
price election;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted (see section 
13(c)) by the respective price elections you chose;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 13(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result in section 13(b)(5) from the result in 
13(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 13(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production (in hundredweight) to count from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is direct marketed to consumers if you fail to meet the 
requirements contained in section 12;
    (C) Put to another use without our consent;
    (D) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (E) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested onion production (mature unharvested production 
may be adjusted based on the percent of damaged onion production in 
accordance with section 13(d));
    (iv) The appraised production that exceeds the difference between 
the first or second stage (as applicable) and the final stage production 
guarantee for acreage that does not qualify for the final stage 
guarantee, if such acreage is not subject to section 13(c)(1) (i) and 
(ii); and
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop.

[[Page 218]]

    (vi) If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not 
reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us. (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested onion production or 
appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If 
you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide 
sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you 
consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the 
amount of production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested onion 
production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop 
is not harvested.
    (2) All harvested onion production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) If the damage to harvested or unharvested onion production 
exceeds the percentage shown in the Special Provisions for the type, no 
production will be counted for that unit or portion of a unit unless 
such damaged onion production from that acreage is sold. If sold, the 
hundredweight of production to be counted will be adjusted by dividing 
the price received for the damaged onion production by the price 
election and multiplying the resulting factor times the hundredweight 
sold.
    (e) The extent of any damaged onion production must be determined 
not later than the time onions are placed in storage if the production 
is stored prior to sale, or the date the onions are delivered to a 
packer, processor, or other handler if production is not stored.

                         14. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 45 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. Additional prevented 
planting coverage levels are not available for onions.

otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by written agreement; or
    (d) Damaged before the final planting date to the extent that most 
producers of tobacco acreage with similar characteristics in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, unless such crop is 
replanted or we agree that replanting is not practical.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a peril 
specified in section 10(a) through (g) that occurs during the insurance 
period.

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, any representative samples we may require of each 
unharvested tobacco type must be at least 5 feet wide (at least two 
rows), and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The 
samples must not be harvested or destroyed until after our inspection.
    (b) If tobacco types 11, 12, 13, or 14 are insured and you have 
filed a notice of damage, you also must leave all tobacco stalks and 
stubble intact for our inspection. The stalks and stubble must not be 
destroyed until we give you written consent to do so or until 30 days 
after the end of the insurance period, whichever is earlier.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee, by type if applicable;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election, by type if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than 
one type;
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), 
for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4), if there are more than 
one type;
    (6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of 
section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of 
section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more 
than one type; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have 100 percent share in 1 acre of type 35 (dark air cured) 
guaranteed tobacco in the unit, with a 2,000 pounds per acre guarantee 
and a price election of $2.00 per pound. You are only able to harvest 
500 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 1.0 acre x 2,000 pounds = 2,000 pounds guarantee;
    (2) 2,000 pounds x $2.00 price election = $4,000.00 value of 
guarantee;
    (4) 500 pounds x $2.00 price election = $1,000.00 value of 
production to count;
    (6) $4,000.00 - $1,000.00 = $3,000.00 loss; and
    (7) $3,000 x 100 percent = $3,000 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count (pounds of appraised or harvested 
production multiplied by the applicable price) for all insurable acreage 
on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for the unit for 
any acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records, if required by 
the Special Provisions, that are acceptable to us; or
    (E) Of types 11, 12, 13, or 14 when the stalks and stubble have been 
destroyed without our consent;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.
    (iii) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon with our consent, if you and we agree on the 
appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance 
period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use 
or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production 
is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for,

[[Page 221]]

representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The 
value of production to count for such acreage will be the number of 
pounds harvested or appraised production multiplied by the support price 
taken from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you 
do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from insurable acreage.
    (d) Mature tobacco production that is damaged by insurable causes 
will be adjusted for quality based on the USDA Official Standard Grades 
for the insured type if it has an average value less than the market 
price, as follows:
    (1) Divide the average value of the damaged appraised and/or 
harvested production by the market price;
    (2) Multiply the result in section 12(d)(1) (not to exceed 1.0) by 
the number of pounds of damaged appraised and/or harvested tobacco; and
    (3) Multiply the product by your price election.
    If no market price has been established for the grade of the damaged 
tobacco, a market price will be imputed by reducing the lowest available 
market price by 20 percent for each grade that the production falls 
below the grade for which such lowest market price is available.
    (e) To enable us to determine the fair market value of tobacco not 
sold through auction warehouses, we must be given the opportunity to 
inspect such tobacco before it is sold, contracted to be sold, or 
otherwise disposed. Failure to provide us the opportunity to inspect 
such tobacco may result in rejection of any claim for indemnity.
    (f) If we consider the best offer you receive for any such tobacco 
to be inadequate, we may obtain additional offers on your behalf.
    (g) Once we agree that any carryover or current year's tobacco has 
no market value due to insured causes, you must destroy it and it will 
not be considered production to count. If you refuse to destroy such 
tobacco, we will include it as production to count and value it at the 
support price.

                            13. Late Planting

    In lieu of late planting provisions in the Basic Provisions 
regarding acreage initially planted after the final planting date, 
insurance will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop after 
the final planting date as follows:
    (a) The production guarantee (per acre) for each type planted during 
the late planting period will be reduced by:
    (1) One percent (1%) for the 1st through the 10th day; and
    (2) Two percent (2%) for the 11th through the 15th day;
    (b) The premium amount for insurable acreage planted to the insured 
crop after the final planting date will be the same as that for timely 
planted acreage. If the amount of premium you are required to pay (gross 
premium less our subsidy) for acreage planted after the final planting 
date exceeds the liability on such acreage, coverage for those acres 
will not be provided (no premium will be due and no indemnity will be 
paid for such acreage).

                         14. Prevented Planting

    The prevented planting provisions in the Basic Provisions are not 
applicable to guaranteed tobacco.

[63 FR 34552, June 25, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 457.137  Green pea crop insurance provisions.

    The Green Pea Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1998 and succeeding 
crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies

                        Green Pea Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Base contract price. The price stipulated in the processor contract 
for the tenderometer reading, grade factor, or sieve size that is 
designated in the Special Provisions, if applicable, without regard to 
discounts or incentives that may apply.
    Bypassed acreage. Land on which production is ready for harvest but 
the processor elects not to accept such production so it is not 
harvested.
    Combining (vining). Separating pods from the vines and, in the case 
of shell peas, separating the peas from the pod for delivery to the 
processor.
    Dry peas. Green peas that have matured to the dry form for use as 
food, feed, or seed.

[[Page 222]]

    Good farming practices. The cultural practices generally in use in 
the county for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and 
produce at least the yield used to determine the production guarantee 
and are those required by the green pea processor contract with the 
processing company, and recognized by the Cooperative State Research, 
Education, and Extension Service as compatible with agronomic and 
weather conditions in the county.
    Green peas. Shell type and pod type peas that are grown under a 
processor contract to be canned or frozen and sold for human 
consumption.
    Harvest. Combining (vining) of the peas.
    Nurse crop (companion crop). A crop planted into the same acreage as 
another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and which is 
planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is 
grown.
    Peas. Green or dry peas.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, peas must initially be placed in rows to be considered 
planted. Acreage planted in any other manner will not be insurable 
unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by written 
agreement.
    Pod type. Green peas genetically developed to be eaten without 
shelling (e.g., snap peas, snow peas, and Chinese peas).
    Practical to replant. In lieu of the definition of ``practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, practical to 
replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the 
insured crop, based on factors including, but not limited to, moisture 
availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, and 
marketing window, that replanting the insured crop will allow the crop 
to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant unless 
the replanted acreage can produce at least 75 percent of the approved 
yield, and the processor agrees in writing that it will accept the 
production from the replanted acreage.
    Price election. In lieu of the definition of ``Price election'' 
contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, price election is 
defined as the price per pound stated in the processor contract 
(contracted price) for the tenderometer reading, grade factor, or sieve 
size contained in the Special Provisions.
    Processor. Any business enterprise regularly engaged in canning or 
freezing green peas for human consumption, that possesses all licenses 
and permits for processing green peas required by the state in which it 
operates, and that possesses facilities, or has contractual access to 
such facilities, with enough equipment to accept and process contracted 
green peas within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.
    Processor contract. A written agreement between the producer and a 
processor, containing at a minimum:
    (a) The producer's commitment to plant and grow green peas, and to 
deliver the green pea production to the processor;
    (b) The processor's commitment to purchase all the production stated 
in the processor contract; and
    (c) A base contract price.
    Multiple contracts with the same processor that specify amounts of 
production will be considered as a single processor contract unless the 
contracts are for different types of green peas.
    Production guarantee (per acre).--The number of pounds determined by 
multiplying the approved actual production history yield per acre by the 
coverage level percentage you elect. For shell type peas, the weight 
will be determined after shelling.
    Shell type. Green peas genetically developed to be shelled prior to 
eating, canning or freezing.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) For any processor contract that stipulates the amount of 
production to be delivered:
    (1) In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, a 
basic unit will consist of all acreage planted to the insured crop in 
the county that will be used to fulfill contracts with each processor;
    (i) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production 
contracted with each processor contract;
    (ii) In accordance with section 12, all production from any basic 
unit in excess of the amount under contract will be included as 
production to count if such production is applied to any other basic 
unit for which the contracted amount has not been fulfilled; and
    (2) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may only 
be established based on shell type and pod type green peas if the shell 
type acreage does not continue into the pod type acreage in the same 
rows or planting pattern.
    (b) For any processor contract that stipulates the number of acres 
to be planted, in addition to or instead of, establishing optional units 
by section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number, or irrigated 
and non-irrigated acreage, optional units may be established based on 
shell type and pod type green peas if the shell type acreage does not 
continue into the pod type acreage in the same rows or planting pattern.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                              Indemnities.

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the green peas in

provide different price elections by type. The percentage of the maximum 
price election you choose for one type will be applicable to all other 
types insured under this policy.
    (b) The appraised production from bypassed acreage that could have 
been accepted by the processor will be included when determining your 
approved yield.
    (c) Acreage that is bypassed because it was damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss will be considered to have a zero yield when determining 
your approved yield.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, 
you must provide a copy of all processor contracts to us on or before 
the acreage reporting date.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the shell type and pod type green peas in the county 
for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are grown under, and in accordance with, the requirements 
of a processor contract executed on or before the acreage reporting date 
and are not excluded from the processor contract at any time during the 
crop year; and
    (3) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop;
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or
    (iii) Planted as a nurse crop.
    (b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, 
under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which 
the green peas are grown, you are at risk of loss, and the processor 
contract provides for delivery of green peas under specified conditions 
and at a stipulated base contract price.
    (c) A commercial green pea producer who is also a processor may 
establish an insurable interest if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The producer must comply with these Crop Provisions;
    (2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors or 
officers of the processor must execute and adopt a resolution that 
contains the same terms as an acceptable processor contract. Such 
resolution will be considered a processor contract under this policy; 
and
    (3) Our inspection reveals that the processing facilities comply 
with the definition of a processor contained in these Crop Provisions.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that it is not practical to replant; and
    (b) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation 
requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, regarding the end of the insurance period, insurance ceases 
at the earlier of:
    (a) The date the green peas:
    (1) Were destroyed;
    (2) Should have been harvested but were not harvested;
    (3) Were abandoned; or
    (4) Were harvested;
    (b) The date you harvest sufficient production to fulfill your 
processor contract if the processor contract stipulates a specific 
amount of production to be delivered;
    (c) Final adjustment of a loss; or
    (d) September 15 of the calendar year in which the insured green 
peas would normally be harvested; or
    (e) September 30 of the calendar year in which the insured peas 
would normally be harvested if you provide notice to us that the insured 
crop will be harvested as dry peas (see section 11(d)).

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions:

[[Page 224]]

    (a) Insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss 
that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions, including:
    (i) Excessive moisture that prevents harvesting equipment from 
entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting 
equipment; and
    (ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected 
number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at 
the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such 
acres or the processing of such production is beyond the capacity of the 
processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed.
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease but only on acreage not planted to peas the 
previous crop year. (In certain instances, contained in the Special 
Provisions or in a written agreement, acreage planted to peas the 
previous year may be covered. Damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures is not covered);
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in section 10(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure any loss of production due to:
    (1) Bypassed acreage because of:
    (i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or
    (ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any 
indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been 
paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage 
was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment or;
    (2) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the 
processor contract.

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the notices required by section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must give us notice:
    (a) Not later than 48 hours after:
    (1) Total destruction of the green peas on the unit; or
    (2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested 
production remains.
    (b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any 
acreage that will not be harvested unless we have previously released 
the acreage. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the 
reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation 
will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an 
uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish 
to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the 
unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 
feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in each unit. The 
samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 
days after notice is given to us;
    (c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend 
to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is 
discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest, so that we may 
inspect any damaged production. If you fail to notify us and such 
failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we 
will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as 
production to count. You are not required to delay harvest; and
    (d) Prior to the time the green peas would normally be harvested if 
you intend to harvest the green peas as dry peas.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee, by type if applicable;
    (2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election, by type if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than 
one type;
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), 
for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4) if there are more than 
one type;
    (6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of 
section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of 
section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more 
than one type; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of shell type green peas 
in the unit, with a guarantee of 4,000 pounds per acre and a price 
election of $0.09 per pound. You are only able to harvest 200,000 
pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:

[[Page 225]]

    (1) 100 acres x 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee;
    (2) 400,000 pounds x $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 value of 
guarantee;
    (4) 200,000 pounds x $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of 
production to count;
    (6) $36,000.00 - $18,000.00 = $18,000.00 loss; and
    (7) $18,000.00 x 100 percent = $18,000.00 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of pod type green 
peas in the same unit, with a guarantee of 5,000 pounds per acre and a 
price election of $0.13 per pound. You are only able to harvest 450,000 
pounds. Your total indemnity for both shell type and pod type green peas 
would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee for the 
shell type, and 100 acres x 5,000 pounds = 500,000 pounds guarantee for 
the pod type;
    (2) 400,000 pounds guarantee x $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 
value of guarantee for the shell type, and 500,000 pounds guarantee x 
$0.13 price election = $65,000.00 value of guarantee for the pod type;
    (3) $36,000.00 + $65,000.00 = $101,000.00 total value of guarantee;
    (4) 200,000 pounds x $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of 
production to count for the shell type, and
    4450,000 pounds x $0.13 = $58,500.00 value of production to count 
for the pod type;
    (5) $18,000.00 + $58,500.00 = $76,500.00 total value of production 
to count;
    (6) $101,000.00 - $76,500.00 = $24,500.00 loss; and
    (7) $24,500.00 loss x 100 percent = $24,500.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count, specified in pounds, from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes or;
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us.
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.
    (iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was 
bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production 
which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract.
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested.
    (2) All harvested green pea production from the insurable acreage. 
The amount of such production will be determined by dividing the dollar 
amount paid, payable, or which should have been paid under the terms of 
the processor contract for the quality and quantity of the peas 
delivered to the processor by the base contract price per pound;
    (3) All harvested green pea production from any of your other 
insurable units that have been used to fulfill your processor contract 
for this unit; and
    (4) All dry pea production from the insurable acreage if you gave 
notice in accordance with section 11(d) for any acreage you intended to 
harvest as dry peas. The harvested or appraised dry pea production will 
be multiplied by 1.667 for shell types and 3.000 for pod types to 
determine the green pea production equivalent. No adjustment for quality 
deficiencies will be allowed for dry pea production.

                            13. Late Planting

    A late planting period is not applicable to green peas unless 
allowed by the Special Provisions and you provide written approval from 
the processor by the acreage reporting date that it will accept the 
production from the late planted acres when it is expected to be ready 
for harvest.

                         14. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 40 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

Sec. 457.138  Grape crop insurance provisions.

    The grape crop insurance provisions for the 2000 and succeeding crop 
years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                          Grape Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Graft. To unite a shoot or bud (scion) with a rootstock or an 
existing vine in accordance with recommended practices to form a living 
union.
    Harvest. Picking the clusters of grapes from the vines either by 
hand or machine.
    Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any 
form of alternating or mixed pattern.
    Set out. Physically planting the desired variety of grape plant in 
the ground in a desired planting pattern.
    Ton. Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.
    Varietal group. Grapes with similar characteristics that are grouped 
for insurance purposes as specified in the Special Provisions.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) In California only, a basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the 
Basic Provisions will be divided into additional basic units by each 
variety that you insure.
    (b) In California only, provisions in the Basic Provisions that 
provide for optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm 
serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not 
applicable. Optional units may be established only if each optional unit 
is located on non-contiguous land, unless otherwise allowed by written 
agreement.
    (c) In all states except California, in addition to, or instead of, 
establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm 
serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated acreage as provided in 
the unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions a 
separate optional unit may be established if each optional unit:
    (1) Is located on non-contiguous land; or
    (2) Consists of a separate varietal group when separate varietal 
groups are specified in the Special Provisions.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) In California, you may select only one price election and 
coverage level for each grape variety in the county specified in the 
Special Provisions.
    (b) In Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, you may select only one price 
election and coverage level for each grape varietal group specified in 
the Special Provisions.
    (c) In all states except California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, 
you may select only one price election and coverage level for all the 
grapes in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by varietal group, in which 
case you may select one price election for each varietal group 
designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for 
each varietal group must have the same percentage relationship to the 
maximum price offered by us for each varietal group. For example, if you 
choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one varietal group, 
you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all 
other varietal groups.
    (d) In California only, if the Special Provisions do not provide a 
price election for a specific variety you wish to insure, you may apply 
for a written agreement to establish a price election. Your application 
for the written agreement must include:
    (1) The number of tons sold for at least the two most recent crop 
years; and
    (2) The price received for all production of the variety in the 
years for which production records are provided.
    (e) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for 
Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by 
variety or varietal group, if applicable :
    (1) Any damage, removal of bearing vines, change in practices or any 
other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield 
upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing vines on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the vines and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed:

[[Page 227]]

    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and the type or variety or 
varietal group, if applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production 
guarantee, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: 
Interplanted perennial crop; removal of vines; damage; change in 
practices and any other circumstance that may affect the yield potential 
of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that 
may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your 
production guarantee at any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (f) In California, Idaho, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, and 
Washington, you may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level 
or the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election we 
offer if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the 
insured crop is evident prior to the time that you request the increase.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding 
the cancellation date for all states except California, and October 31 
preceding the cancellation date for California.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are January 31 in California and November 20 in all 
other states.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must report your acreage by each 
grape variety you insure in California, or by varietal group in all 
other states.

                             7. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be any insurable variety that you 
elect to insure in California or all insurable varieties in all other 
states in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the 
actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown for wine, juice, raisins, or canning;
    (c) That are grown in a vineyard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us;
    (d) That, after being set out or grafted, have reached the number of 
growing seasons designated by the Special Provisions; and
    (e) That have produced an average of two tons of grapes per acre 
during at least one of the three crop years immediately preceding the 
insured crop year, unless we inspect and allow insurance on such 
acreage.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, grapes interplanted with another 
perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine 
that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on February 1 in California and November 21 in 
all other states of each crop year. Notwithstanding the previous 
sentence, for the year of application, if your application is received 
after January 22 but prior to February 1 in California, or after 
November 11 but prior to November 21 in all other states, insurance will 
attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is 
received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 
10 day period and determine that it does not meet insurability 
requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the 
crop or to determine the condition of the vineyard.
    (2) In California, Idaho, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, and 
Washington, for each subsequent crop year that the policy remains 
continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following 
the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy 
cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different 
insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a 
break in continuous coverage.
    (3) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is the date during the calendar year in which the grapes are 
normally harvested, as follows:
    (i) October 10 in Mississippi and Texas;
    (ii) November 1 in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington;
    (iii) November 10 in California; and
    (iv) November 20 in all other states.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the 
crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such

[[Page 228]]

acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. 
Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of grapes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, 
insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or 
indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the vineyard;
    (3) Insects, except as excluded in 10(b)(1), but not damage due to 
insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Phylloxera, regardless of cause; or
    (2) Inability to market the grapes for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the following 
will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have 
started if the crop will not be harvested.
    (b) If the crop has been damaged during the growing season and you 
previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must also provide notice at least 15 days 
prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity as 
a result of the damage previously reported. You must not destroy the 
damaged crop that is marketed in normal commercial channels, until after 
we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the 
requirements of this section, all such production will be considered 
undamaged and included as production to count.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election you selected for each variety or varietal group;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count of each variety or 
varietal group, if applicable, (see section 12 (c) through (e)) by the 
respective price election you selected;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result in section 12(b)(5) from the result in 
section 12(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in tons) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned or destroyed by you without our consent;
    (B) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (C) For which you fail to provide production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies in accordance with subsection 12 (e)); 
and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal,

[[Page 229]]

we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the 
crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further 
damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the 
crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not 
continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the 
claim will be used to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage. Grape 
production that is harvested and dried for raisins will be converted to 
a fresh weight basis by multiplying the number of tons of raisin 
production by 4.5.
    (d) If any grapes are harvested before normal maturity or for a 
special use (such as Champagne or Botrytis-affected grapes), the 
production of such grapes will be increased by the factor obtained by 
dividing the price per ton received for such grapes by the price per ton 
for fully matured grapes of the type for which the claim is being made.
    (e) Mature marketable grape production may be adjusted for quality 
deficiencies as follows:
    (1) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if, due to 
insurable causes, it has a value of less than 75 percent of the average 
market price of undamaged grapes of the same or similar variety. The 
value per ton of the qualifying damaged production and the average 
market price of undamaged grapes will be determined on the earlier of 
the date the damaged production is sold or the date of final inspection 
for the unit. The average market price of undamaged production will be 
calculated by averaging the prices being paid by usual marketing outlets 
for the area during the week in which the damaged grapes were valued.
    (2) Grape production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in subsection 12(e)(1) will be reduced by:
    (i) Dividing the value per ton of the damaged grapes by the maximum 
price election available for such grapes to determine the quality 
adjustment factor; and
    (ii) Multiplying this result (not to exceed 1.000) by the number of 
tons of the eligible damaged grapes.

                     13. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

            Fresh market tomato (dollar plan) crop provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

is a period of time that begins on the first day of the earliest 
planting period for fall planted tomatoes and continues through the last 
day of the insurance period for spring planted tomatoes. The crop year 
is designated by the calendar year in which spring planted tomatoes are 
harvested.
    Direct marketing--Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, and permitting the general public to enter the field for the 
purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Excess rain--An amount of precipitation sufficient to directly 
damage the crop.
    Freeze--The formation of ice in the cells of the plant or its fruit, 
caused by low air temperatures.
    Harvest--The picking of tomatoes on the unit.

[[Page 230]]

    Plant stand--The number of live plants per acre prior to the 
occurrence of an insurable cause of loss.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, for each planting period, tomato seed or transplants 
must initially be planted in rows, unless otherwise provided by Special 
Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
    Planting period--The period of time designated in the actuarial 
documents in which the tomatoes must be planted to be considered fall, 
winter or spring-planted tomatoes.
    Potential production--The number of cartons of mature green or ripe 
tomatoes that the tomato plants will or would have produced per acre, 
assuming normal growing conditions and practices, by the end of the 
insurance period:
    (a) With a classification size of 6x7 (2\8/32\ inch minimum 
diameter) or larger for all types except cherry or plum tomatoes; or
    (b) With a classification size as allowed by written agreement for 
cherry or plum tomatoes.
    Practical to replant--In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or 
damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited 
to moisture availability, condition of the field, marketing windows, and 
time to crop maturity, that replanting to the insured crop will allow 
the crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of 
the insurance period (inability to obtain plants or seed will not be 
considered when determining if it is practical to replant).
    Ripe tomato--A tomato that has a definite break in color from green 
to tannish-yellow, pink or red.
    Row width--The widest distance from the center of one row of plants 
to the center of an adjacent row of plants.
    Tropical depression--A system identified by the U.S. Weather Service 
as a tropical depression, and for the period of time so designated, 
including tropical storms, gales, and hurricanes.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will also be divided into additional basic units by planting period.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.

              3. Amounts of Insurance and Production Stages

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one coverage 
level (and the corresponding amount of insurance designated in the 
actuarial documents for the applicable planting period and practice) for 
all the tomatoes in the county insured under this policy.
    (b) The amount of insurance you choose for each planting period and 
practice must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price 
offered by us for each planting period and practice. For example, if you 
choose 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a specific 
planting period and practice, you must also choose 100 percent of the 
maximum amount of insurance for all other planting periods and 
practices.
    (c) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), do not apply to fresh 
market dollar plan tomatoes.
    (d) The amounts of insurance per acre are progressive by stages as 
follows:

    (e) Any acreage of tomatoes damaged in the first, second, or third 
stage to the extent that the majority of producers in the area would not 
normally further care for it, will be deemed to have been destroyed. The 
indemnity payable for such acreage will be based on the stage the plants 
had achieved when the damage occurred.

[[Page 231]]

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is April 30 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are July 31.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must report on or before the 
acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions for each 
planting period:
    (a) All the acreage of tomatoes in the county insured under this 
policy in which you have a share;
    (b) The dates the acreage was planted within each planting period; 
and
    (c) The row width.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 7 
(Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the annual 
premium amount for each cultural practice (e.g., fall direct-seeded 
irrigated) is determined by multiplying the final stage amount of 
insurance per acre by the premium rate for the cultural practice as 
established in the Actuarial Table, by the insured acreage, by your 
share at the time coverage begins, and by any applicable premium 
adjustment factors contained in the actuarial documents.

                             8. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the tomatoes in the county 
for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are:
    (1) Planted to be harvested and sold as fresh market tomatoes;
    (2) Planted within the planting periods designated in the actuarial 
documents;
    (3) Grown under an irrigated practice;
    (4) Grown on acreage covered by plastic mulch except where the 
Special Provisions allows otherwise;
    (5) Grown by a person who in at least one of the three previous crop 
years:
    (i) Grew tomatoes for commercial sale; or
    (ii) Participated in managing a fresh market tomato farming 
operation;
    (c) That are not:
    (1) Interplanted with another crop;
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume;
    (3) Grown for direct marketing; or
    (4) Plum or cherry type tomatoes, unless allowed by written 
agreement.

                          9. Insurable Acreage

    (a) In lieu of the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching if 
a crop has not been planted in at least one of the three previous crop 
years, we will insure newly cleared land and former pasture land planted 
to fresh market tomatoes.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) You must replant any acreage of tomatoes damaged during the 
planting period in which initial planting took place whenever less than 
50 percent of the plant stand remains: and
    (i) It is practical to replant;
    (ii) If, at the time the crop was damaged, the final day of the 
planting period has not passed; and
    (iii) The damage occurs within 30 days of transplanting or 60 days 
of direct seeding.
    (2) Whenever tomatoes initially are planted during the fall or 
winter planting periods and the conditions specified in sections 9(b)(1) 
(ii) and (iii) are not satisfied, you may elect:
    (i) To replant such acreage and collect any replant payment due as 
specified in section 12. The initial planting period coverage will 
continue for such replanted acreage.
    (ii) Not to replant such acreage and receive an indemnity based on 
the stage of growth the plants had attained at the time of damage. 
However, such an election will result in the acreage being uninsurable 
in the subsequent planting period.
    (3) We will not insure any acreage on which tomatoes (except for 
replanted tomatoes in accordance with sections 9(b) (1) and (2)), 
peppers, eggplants, or tobacco have been grown and the soil was not 
fumigated or otherwise properly treated before planting tomatoes.

                          10. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), coverage begins on each unit or part of a 
unit the later of the date we accept your application, or when the 
tomatoes are planted in each planting period. Coverage ends at the 
earliest of:
    (a) Total destruction of the tomatoes on the unit;
    (b) Abandonment of the tomatoes on the unit;
    (c) The date harvest should have started on the unit on any acreage 
which will not be harvested;
    (d) Final adjustment of a loss on the unit;
    (e) Final harvest; or

[[Page 232]]

    (f) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period as 
follows:
    (1) 140 days after the date of direct seeding or replanting with 
seed; and
    (2) 125 days after the date of transplanting or replanting with 
transplants.

                           11. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Excess rain;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Freeze;
    (4) Hail;
    (5) Tornado;
    (6) Tropical depression; or
    (7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against any loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless no effective control 
measure exists for such disease or insect infestation; or
    (2) Failure to market the tomatoes, unless such failure is due to 
actual physical damage caused by an insured cause of loss that occurs 
during the insurance period.

                         12. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if, due to an 
insured cause of loss, more than 50 percent of the plant stand will not 
produce tomatoes and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of your actual cost of replanting or the result obtained by 
multiplying the per acre replanting payment amount contained in the 
Special Provisions by your insured share.
    (c) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 (Replanting 
Payment) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that limit a replanting 
payment to one each crop year, only one replanting payment will be made 
for acreage planted during each planting period within the crop year.

                13. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements contained in section 14 (Duties In 
The Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if 
you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit you must also give us 
notice not later than 72 hours after the earliest of:
    (a) The time you discontinue harvest of any acreage on the unit;
    (b) The date harvest normally would start if any acreage on the unit 
will not be harvested; or
    (c) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period.

                         14. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage in each stage by the amount of 
insurance per acre for the final stage;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 14(b)(1) by the percentage 
for the applicable stage (see section 3(d));
    (3) Total the results of section 14(b)(2);
    (4) Subtracting either of the following values from the result of 
section 14(b)(3):
    (i) For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, the total 
value of production to be counted (see section 14(c)); or
    (ii) For catastrophic risk protection coverage, the result of 
multiplying the total value of production to be counted (see section 
14(c)) by:
    (A) Sixty percent for the 1998 crop year; or
    (B) Fifty-five percent for 1999 and subsequent crop years; and
    (5) Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(4) by your share.
    (c) The total value of production to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for the stage for 
any acreage:
    (i) That is abandoned;
    (ii) Put to another use without our consent;
    (iii) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (iv) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (2) The value of the following appraised production will not be less 
than the dollar amount obtained by multiplying the number of cartons of 
appraised tomatoes by the minimum value per carton shown in the Special 
Provisions for the planting period:
    (i) Potential production on any acreage that has not been harvested 
the second time for ground-culture tomatoes (the third time for staked 
tomatoes);
    (ii) Unharvested mature green tomatoes (unharvested production that 
is damaged or defective due to insurable causes and is not marketable 
will not be counted as production to count);

[[Page 233]]

    (iii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a 
subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine 
actual production. (If we require you to continue to care for the crop 
and you do not do so, the original appraisal will be used); or
    (B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop, in which case 
the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested 
production, or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.
    (3) The total value of all harvested production from the insurable 
acreage will be the dollar amount obtained by subtracting the allowable 
cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price received for 
each carton of tomatoes (this result may not be less than the minimum 
value shown in the Special Provisions for any carton of tomatoes), and 
multiplying this result by the number of cartons of tomatoes harvested. 
Harvested production that is damaged or defective due to insurable 
causes and is not marketable, will not be counted as production to 
count.

                     15. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

                        16. Minimum Value Option

    (a) The provisions of this option are continuous and will be 
attached to and made a part of your insurance policy, if:
    (1) You elect either Option I or Option II of the Minimum Value 
Option on your application, or on a form approved by us, on or before 
the sales closing date for the initial crop year in which you wish to 
insure fresh market tomatoes (dollar plan) under this option, and pay 
the additional premium indicated in the actuarial documents for this 
optional coverage; and
    (2) You have not elected coverage under the Catastrophic Risk 
Protection Endorsement.
    (b) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 14(c)(3), the 
total value of harvested production will be determined as follows:
    (1) If you selected Option I of the Minimum Value Option, the total 
value of harvested production will be as follows:
    (i) For sold production, the dollar amount obtained by subtracting 
the allowable cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price 
received for each carton of tomatoes (this result may not be less than 
the minimum value option price contained in the Special Provisions for 
any cartons of tomatoes), and multiplying this result by the number of 
carton of tomatoes sold; and
    (ii) For marketable production that is not sold, the dollar amount 
obtained by multiplying the number of cartons of such tomatoes on the 
unit by the minimum value shown in the Special Provisions for the 
planting period (harvested production that is damaged or defective due 
to insurable causes and is not marketable will not be counted as 
production).
    (2) If you selected Option II of the Minimum Value Option, the total 
value of harvested production will be as provided in section 16(b)(1), 
except that the dollar amount specified in section (16)(b)(1)(i) may not 
be less than zero.
    (c) This option may be canceled by either you or us for any 
succeeding crop year by giving written notice on or before the 
cancellation date preceding the crop year for which the cancellation of 
this option is to be effective.

Sec. 457.140  Dry pea crop insurance provisions.

    The dry pea crop insurance provisions for the 2003 and succeeding 
crop years are as follows:
    FCIC policies:

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                         Dry Pea Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions.

    Adequate stand. A population of live plants per acre that will 
produce at least the yield used to establish your production guarantee.
    Base price. The price per pound stipulated in the processor contract 
without regard to discounts or incentives that may apply, and that will 
be paid to the producer for at least 50 percent of the total production 
under contract with the seed company.

[[Page 234]]

    Combining. A mechanical process that separates the peas from the 
pods and other vegetative matter and place the peas into a temporary 
storage receptacle.
    Conditioning. A process that improves the quality of production by 
screening or any other operation commonly used in the dry pea industry 
to remove dry peas that are deficient in quality.
    Contract seed peas. Dry peas produced for seed to be planted at a 
future date and that:
    (a) Are grown on acreage enrolled in the seed certification program 
administered by the state in which the peas are produced;
    (b) Are grown on acreage planted in the spring; and
    (c) Are under a seed company contract.
    Dry peas. Peas of the following types:
    (a) All spring-planted smooth green and yellow varieties of 
commercial dry edible peas, and peas grown to produce seed to be planted 
at a future date that do not meet the requirements contained in the seed 
company contract;
    (b) All fall-planted varieties of Austrian Winter Peas only if 
provided for in the Special Provisions;
    (c) All spring-planted varieties of lentils; and
    (d) All varieties of contract seed peas.
    Harvest. Combining of dry peas.
    Local market price. The cash price per pound for the U.S. No. 1 
grade of dry peas as determined by us. Such price will be the prevailing 
dollar amount these buyers are willing to pay for dry peas containing 
the maximum limits of quality deficiencies allowable for the U.S. No. 1 
grade. Factors not associated with grading under the United States 
Standards for Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas and Lentils will not be 
considered.
    Nurse crop (companion crop). A crop planted into the same acreage as 
another crop, that is intended to improve the growing conditions for the 
crop with which it is grown and that is not intended to be harvested 
with the insured crop.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, dry peas must initially be planted in rows to be 
considered planted. Acreage planted in any other manner will not be 
insurable unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement.
    Practical to replant. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, it will not be considered practical to replant dry 
peas, except for seed peas, more than 25 days after the final planting 
date unless replanting is generally occurring in the area. For seed 
peas, it will not be considered practical to replant unless production 
from the replanted acreage can be delivered under the terms of the seed 
pea processor contract or the seed company agrees in writing to accept 
such production.
    Price election. In addition to the provisions of the definition 
contained in the Basic Provisions, the price election for contract seed 
peas will be a percentage (not to exceed 100 percent) of the base price 
that you elect.
    Seed company. Any business enterprise regularly engaged in the 
processing of contract seed peas, that possesses all licenses and 
permits for marketing contract seed peas required by the state in which 
it operates, and that owns, or has contracted, sufficient drying, 
screening, and bagging or packaging equipment to accept and process the 
contract seed peas within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.
    Seed company contract. A written agreement between the producer and 
the seed company, executed by the acreage reporting date, containing at 
a minimum:
    (a) The producer's promise to plant and grow one or more specific 
varieties of contract seed peas, and deliver the production from those 
varieties to the seed company;
    (b) The seed company's promise to purchase all the production stated 
in the contract; and
    (c) A fixed price, or a method to determine such price based on 
published information compiled by a third party, that will be paid to 
the producer for at least 50 percent of the production stated in the 
contract.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated acreage as provided in the unit division provisions 
contained in the Basic Provisions, a separate optional unit may be 
established for each pea type listed in section 1 of these Crop 
Provisions.
    (b) Contract seed peas may qualify for optional units only if the 
seed company contract specifies the number of acres under contract. 
Contract seed peas produced under a seed company contract that specifies 
only an amount of production or a combination of acreage and production, 
are not eligible for optional units.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the dry peas, 
including contract seed peas, in the county insured under this policy 
unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type, 
in which case you may select one price election for each dry pea type so 
designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for 
each type are not required to have the same percentage relationship to 
the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you 
choose 100

[[Page 235]]

percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may choose 80 
percent of the maximum price election for another type. However, if you 
elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection level of insurance for any dry 
pea type, the same level of coverage will be applicable to all insured 
acreage in the county.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, 
you must submit a copy of the seed company contract to us on or before 
the acreage reporting date if you are insuring contract seed peas.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the dry pea types in the county (including Austrian 
Winter Peas if you request insurance for such peas in accordance with 
section 7(c)) for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial 
documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are planted for harvest as dry peas and which, if grown 
under a seed company contract, are not excluded from such contract 
during the crop year;
    (3) That are grown in accordance with the requirements of the seed 
company contract, if applicable;
    (4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop;
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or
    (iii) Planted as a nurse crop.
    (b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, 
under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which 
the contract seed peas are grown, you are at risk of loss, and the 
processor contract is in effect.
    (c) Austrian Winter Peas are only insurable if you request insurance 
in writing for such dry peas, and we agree in writing to provide 
coverage. Your request to insure Austrian Winter Peas must be submitted 
to us not later than the sales closing date. We will not agree to insure 
Austrian Winter Peas unless an adequate stand exists in the spring.
    (d) Any acreage of dry peas that is destroyed and replanted to a 
different insurable type of dry peas will be considered insured acreage. 
The guarantee and premium for acreage replanted to a different insurable 
type will be based on the replanted type and will be calculated in 
accordance with sections 3 and 7 of the Basic Provisions and section 3 
of these Crop Provisions.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation 
requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions; or
    (b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that most producers of the crop or acreage 
with similar characteristics in the area would normally not further care 
for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical 
to replant. We will not require you to replant if it is not practical to 
replant the type of dry peas originally planted.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) Coverage for Austrian Winter Peas, will begin on the earlier of 
March 16 or the date we agree to accept the acreage for insurance, but 
not before March 1; and
    (b) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for all 
insurable types of dry peas in the county is September 30 of the crop 
year in which the crop normally is harvested unless otherwise specified 
in the Special Provisions.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in section 10(a) through (g) that occurs during the 
insurance period.

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the representative samples of the unharvested crop must be 
at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in the 
unit. If you intend to destroy the crop prior to harvest,

[[Page 236]]

the samples must not be destroyed until after our inspection.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage to your pea crop covered by this 
policy, we will settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage of each dry pea type, if 
applicable, excluding contract seed peas, by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the insured acreage of each contract seed pea 
variety by its respective production guarantee;
    (5) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(4) by the applicable 
base price;
    (6) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(5) by your selected 
price election percentage;
    (7) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(6);
    (8) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(3) and section 12(b)(7);
    (9) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each dry pea 
type, excluding contract seed peas, if applicable (see section 12(d)), 
by the respective price elections;
    (10) Totaling the value of all contract seed pea production (see 
section 12(c));
    (11) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(9) and section 12(b)(10);
    (12) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(11) from the result in 
section 12(b)(8); and
    (13) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)12 by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of spring-planted smooth 
green dry edible peas in the unit, with a guarantee of 4,000 pounds per 
acre and a price election of $0.09 per pound. You are only able to 
harvest 200,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee;
    (2) 400,000 pounds x $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 value of 
guarantee;
    (9) 200,000 pounds x $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of 
production to count; $36,000.00 value of guarantee - $18,000.00 value of 
production to count = $18,000.00 loss; and
    (13) $18,000.00 x 100 percent = $18,000.00 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of contract seed peas 
in the same unit, with a guarantee of 5,000 pounds per acre and a base 
price of $0.40 per pound. Your selected price election percentage is 75 
percent. You are only able to harvest 450,000 pounds. Your total 
indemnity for both spring-planted smooth green dry edible peas and 
contract seed peas would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 4,000 pounds = 400,000 pounds guarantee for the 
spring-planted smooth green dry edible pea type, and
    (4) 100 acres x 5,000 pounds = 500,000 pounds guarantee for the 
contract seed pea type;
    (2) 400,000 pounds guarantee x $0.09 price election = $36,000.00 
value of guarantee for the spring-planted smooth green dry edible pea 
type, and
    (5) 500,000 pounds guarantee x $0.40 base price = $200,000.00 gross 
value of guarantee for the contract seed pea type;
    (6) $200,000 x .75 price election percentage = $150,000 net value of 
guarantee for the contract seed pea type;
    (8) $36,000.00 + $150,000.00 = $186,000.00 total value of guarantee;
    (9) 200,000 pounds x $0.09 price election = $18,000.00 value of 
production to count for the spring-planted smooth green dry edible pea 
type, and
    (10) 450,000 pounds x $0.30 = $135,000.00 value of production to 
count for the contract seed pea type;
    (11) $18,000.00 + $135,000.00 = $153,000.00 total value of 
production to count;
    (12) $186,000.00 - $153,000.00 = $33,000.00 loss; and
    (13) $33,000.00 loss x 100 percent = $33,000.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The value of contract seed pea production to count for each 
variety in the unit will be determined as follows:
    (1) For production meeting the minimum quality requirements 
contained in the seed company contract, and for production that does not 
meet such requirements due to uninsured causes:
    (i) Multiplying the local market price or base price per pound, 
whichever is greater, by the price election percentage you selected; and
    (ii) Multiplying the result by the number of pounds of such 
production.
    (2) For mature production not meeting the minimum quality 
requirements contained in the seed pea processor contract due to 
insurable causes, and immature production that is appraised:
    (i) Multiplying the highest local market price available for such 
dry peas by the price election percentage you selected; and
    (ii) Multiplying the result by the number of pounds of such 
production.
    (d) The total pea production to count (in pounds) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:

[[Page 237]]

    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of dry 
peas, excluding Austrian Winter Peas, may be adjusted for quality 
deficiencies in accordance with section 12 (c) or (e), if applicable); 
and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (e) Mature production of smooth green and yellow peas, lentils, and 
seed peas that do not qualify as contract seed peas under the policy 
terms, and that are not deliverable under the contract or are sold under 
the contract for less than the contract price, may be adjusted for 
quality deficiencies. No adjustment for quality deficiencies will be 
allowed for Austrian Winter Peas.
    (1) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the United States 
Standards for Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils, result in 
production grading U.S. No. 2 or worse because of defects, color, 
skinned production (lentils only), odor, material weathering, or 
distinctly low quality; or
    (ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the 
Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the 
United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (2) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these Crop 
Provisions and which occurs within the insurance period;
    (ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net 
price for the damaged production that is less than the local market 
price;
    (iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us;
    (iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, 
which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed 
by:
    (A) A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse 
operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or
    (C) A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    (3) Dry Pea production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in sections 12(e) (1) and (2), will be reduced as follows:
    (i) The highest local market price for the qualifying damaged 
production will be determined on the earlier of the date such damaged 
production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. The 
highest local market price for the qualifying damaged production will be 
determined in the local area to the extent feasible. We may obtain 
prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices from one or 
more buyers located outside your local market area, we will reduce such 
prices by the additional costs required to deliver the dry peas to those 
buyers. Discounts used to establish the net value of the damaged 
production will be limited to those that are usual, customary, and 
reasonable.
    The value will not be reduced for:
    (A) Moisture content;
    (B) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
    (C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with 
normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the dry

[[Page 238]]

peas; except, if the value of the damaged production can be increased by 
conditioning, we may reduce the value of the production after it has 
been conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the 
value of the production before conditioning;
    (ii) The value per pound of the damaged or conditioned production 
will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality 
adjustment factor;
    (iii) The number of pounds of the damaged or conditioned production 
will then be multiplied by the quality adjustment factor to determine 
the production count to be included in section 12(d); and
    (iv) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured 
crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

                         13. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, 
and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting 
coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

                          Rice Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Flood irrigation. An irrigated practice commonly used for rice 
production whereby the planted acreage is intentionally covered with 
water that is maintained at a uniform and shallow depth throughout the 
growing season.
    Harvest. Combining or threshing the rice for grain. A crop that is 
swathed prior to combining is not considered harvested.
    Local market price. The cash price per pound for the U.S. No. 3 
grade of rough rice offered by buyers in the area in which you normally 
market the rice. Factors not associated with grading under the United 
States Standards for Rice including, but not limited to, protein and oil 
content or milling quality will not be considered.
    Planted. The uniform placement of an adequate amount of rice seed 
into a prepared seedbed by one of the following methods:
    (a) Drill seeding--Using a grain drill to incorporate the seed to a 
proper soil depth;
    (b) Broadcast seeding--Distributing seed evenly onto the surface of 
an un-flooded seedbed followed by either timely mechanical incorporation 
of the seed to a proper soil depth in the seedbed or flushing the 
seedbed with water; or
    (c) Broadcast seeding into a controlled flood--Distributing the rice 
seed onto a prepared seedbed that has been intentionally covered to a 
proper depth by water. The water must be free of movement and be 
completely contained on the acreage by properly constructed levees and 
gates.
    Acreage seeded in any other manner will not be insurable unless 
otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.
    Saline water. Water that contains a concentration of salt sufficient 
to cause damage to the insured crop.
    Second crop rice. The regrowth of a stand of rice following harvest 
of the initially insured rice crop that can be harvested in the same 
crop year.
    Swathed. Severance of the stem and grain head from the ground 
without removal of the rice kernels from the plant and placing in a 
windrow.
    Total milling yield. Rice production consisting of heads, second 
heads, screenings, and brewer's rice as defined by the official United

                            2. Unit Division

    Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price election for all 
the rice in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by type, in which case you 
may select one price election for each rice type designated in the 
Special Provisions. The price

[[Page 239]]

elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage 
relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For 
example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one 
type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for 
all other types.

                           4. Contract Changes

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the rice in the county for 
which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is planted for harvest as grain;
    (c) That is flood irrigated; and
    (d) That is not wild rice.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) We will not insure any acreage planted to rice:
    (1) The preceding crop year unless allowed by the Special 
Provisions; or
    (2) That does not meet the rotation requirements shown in the 
Special Provisions; and
    (b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally 
not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it 
is not practical to replant.

                           8. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar date for the end of 
the insurance period is October 31 immediately following planting.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions (except drought);
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply if caused by an insured 
cause of loss specified in sections 9(a)(1) through (7), drought, or the 
intrusion of saline water.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against in section 
12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of 
production due to the application of saline water, except as specified 
in section 9(a)(8) of these crop provisions.

                         10. Replanting Payment

    (a) A replanting payment for rice is allowed as follows:
    (1) You must comply with all requirements regarding replanting 
payments contained under section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8);
    (2) The rice must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the 
extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of 
the production guarantee for the acreage; and
    (3) The replanted rice must be seeded at a rate that is normal for 
initially planted rice (if new seed is planted at a reduced seeding rate 
into a partially damaged stand of rice, the acreage will not be eligible 
for a replanting payment).
    (b) In accordance with the provisions of section 13 (Replanting 
Payment) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the maximum amount of the 
replanting payment per acre will be the lesser of 20 percent of the 
production guarantee or 400 pounds, multiplied by your price election, 
multiplied by your insured share.
    (c) When rice is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for 
an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the 
amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be 
reduced.

                11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the 
representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet 
wide and extend

[[Page 240]]

the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not be 
harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days 
after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee by type, if applicable;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election by type, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted by type, if 
applicable, (see section 12(c) through (e)) by the respective price 
election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(5) from the result of 
section 12(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in pounds) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
section 12(d));
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage, including 
any production from a second rice crop harvested in the same crop year.
    (d) Mature rough rice may be adjusted for excess moisture and 
quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be 
made prior to any adjustment for quality.
    (1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 
percentage point of moisture in excess of 12 percent. We may obtain 
samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
    (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United 
States Standards for Rice, result in rice not meeting the grade 
requirements for U.S. No. 3 (grades U.S. No. 4 or worse) because of red 
rice, chalky kernels or damaged kernels;
    (ii) The rice has a total milling yield of less than 68 pounds per 
hundredweight;
    (iii) The whole kernel weight is less than 55 pounds per 
hundredweight of milled rice for medium and short grain varieties;
    (iv) The whole kernel weight is less than 48 pounds per 
hundredweight of milled rice for long grain varieties; or
    (v) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the 
Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the 
United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in section 
12(d)(2) resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is 
provided under these crop provisions and which occurs within the 
insurance period;
    (ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions specified in 
section 12(d)(2) result in a net price for the damaged production that 
is less than the local market price;
    (iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions specified in section 12(d)(2) are made using samples of

[[Page 241]]

the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved 
by us;
    (iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, 
which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed 
by:
    (A) A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse 
operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or
    (C) A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    (4) Rice production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in sections 12(d) (2) and (3), will be reduced as follows:
    (i) In accordance with quality adjustment factors contained in the 
Special Provisions; or
    (ii) If quality adjustment factors are not contained in the Special 
Provisions, as follows:
    (A) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the 
local market price will be determined on the earlier of the date such 
quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for 
the unit. The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the 
market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used 
to establish the net price of the damaged production will be limited to 
those that are usual, customary, and reasonable. The price will not be 
reduced for:
    (1) Moisture content;
    (2) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
    (3) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with 
normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the rice; except, if the 
price of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may 
reduce the price of the production after it has been conditioned by the 
cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production 
before conditioning,
    (We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain 
prices from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, 
we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to deliver 
the rice to those buyers.);
    (B) The value of the damaged or conditioned production will be 
divided by the local market price to determine the quality adjustment 
factor; and
    (C) The number of pounds remaining after any reduction due to 
excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross pounds (if appropriate)) 
of the damaged or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the 
quality adjustment factor to determine the net production to count.
    (e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop 
may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

                         13. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 45 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

we will not insure any acreage that:

[[Page 243]]

    (a) Does not meet the rotation requirements contained in the Special 
Provisions for the crop; or
    (b) Is damaged before the final planting date to the extent that 
similarly situated producers in the area would normally not further care 
for the crop, unless it is replanted or we agree that it is not 
practical to replant.

                           8. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but only if sufficient and proper pest control measures 
are used;
    (4) Plant disease, but only if sufficient and proper disease control 
measures are used;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period (see section 9(a)(1) 
through (7)).
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against as 
contained in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure 
against any loss of production due to:
    (1) Damage that occurs or becomes evident after the end of the 
insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that occurs or 
becomes evident in storage; or
    (2) Causes, such as freeze after certain dates, as limited by the 
Special Provisions.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must leave representative samples at least 10 feet wide 
and extending the entire length of each field in the unit if you are 
going to destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be 
harvested.
    (b) We must be given the opportunity to perform a grade inspection 
on the production from any unit for which you have given notice of 
damage.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable production records were not provided; and
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee (If there is unharvested acreage in the unit, the harvested 
and unharvested acreage will be determined separately);
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election (The price election may be limited as specified in 
section 3.);
    (3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if 
applicable (see section 11(d)), by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the results of section 11(b)(5) from the result in 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 harvested acres of potatoes in 
the unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre and a price 
election of $4.00 per hundredweight. You are only able to harvest 10,000 
hundredweight. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee;
    (2) 15,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $60,000.00 value 
of guarantee;
    (4) 10,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value 
of production to count;
    (6) $60,000.00 - $40,000.00 = $20,000.00 loss; and
    (7) $20,000.00 x 100 percent = $20,000.00 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 100 unharvested acres of 
potatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per 
acre and a price election of $3.20 per hundredweight. The price election 
for unharvested acreage is 80.0 percent of your elected price election 
($4.00 x 0.80 = $3.20.) This unharvested acreage was appraised at 35 
hundredweight per acre for a total of 3500

[[Page 244]]

hundredweight as production to count. Your total indemnity for the 
harvested and unharvested acreage would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee 
for the harvested acreage, and 100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 
hundredweight guarantee for the unharvested acreage;
    (2) 15,000 hundredweight guarantee x $4.00 price election = 
$60,000.00 value of guarantee for the unharvested acreage, and 15,000 
hundredweight guarantee x $3.20 price election = $48,000.00 value of 
guarantee for the unharvested acreage;
    (3) $60,000.00 + $48,000.00 = $108,000.00 total value of guarantee;
    (4) 10,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value 
of production to count for the harvested acreage, and 3500 hundredweight 
x $3.20 = $11,200.00 value of production to count for the unharvested 
acreage;
    (5) $40,000.00 + $11,200.00 = $51,200.00 total value of production 
to count;
    (6) $108,000.00 - $51,200.00 = $56,800.00 loss; and
    (7) $56,800.00 loss x 100 percent = $56,800.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The extent of any quality loss must be determined based on 
samples obtained no later than the time the potatoes are placed in 
storage, if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date they are 
delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, broker, or other handler if 
production is not stored.
    (d) The total production to count (in hundredweight) from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;
    (D) From which any production is disposed of without a grade 
inspection; or
    (E) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity. 
Production to count from such acreage will be determined by increasing 
the amount of harvested production by 2 percent per day for each day the 
potatoes were harvested prior to the date the potatoes would have 
reached full maturity. The date the potatoes would have reached full 
maturity will be considered to be 45 days prior to the calendar date for 
the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the 
Special Provisions. This adjustment will not be made if the potatoes are 
damaged by an insurable cause of loss, and leaving the crop in the field 
would either reduce production or decrease quality;
    (iv) Unharvested production (the value of unharvested production 
will be calculated using the reduced price election determined in 
section 2(b) and unharvested production may be adjusted in accordance 
with sections 11(e), (f), (g), and (h)); and
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The price used to determine the 
amount of any indemnity will be limited as specified in section 2 even 
if the representative samples are harvested. The amount of production to 
count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or 
appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If 
you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide 
sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you 
consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the 
amount of production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage (the amount 
of production prior to the sorting or discarding of any production).
    (e) Potato production is eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (1) The potatoes have freeze damage or tuber rot that is evident at, 
or prior to, the end of the insurance period; and
    (2) A grade inspection is performed.
    (f) Potato production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in section 11(e), with 5 percent damage or less (by weight) 
will be adjusted 0.1 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage through 5.0 
percent.
    (g) Potato production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in section 11(e), with 5.1 percent damage or more (by weight) 
will be adjusted as follows:
    (1) For potatoes damaged by freeze, production will be reduced 0.1 
percent for each 0.1 percent of damage through 5.0 percent, 0.5 percent 
for each 0.1 percent of damage from 5.1 through 15.0 percent, and by 1.0 
percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 15.1 through 19.5 percent. 
However, if you do not

[[Page 245]]

discard any harvested production within 21 days of the end of the 
insurance period that has freeze damage in excess of 17.9 percent, we 
will include 15 percent of such production when determining the amount 
of production to count.
    (2) For potatoes that have tuber rot due to an insurable cause other 
than freeze, production to count will be determined as follows:
    (i) For potatoes for which a price is agreed upon between you and a 
buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance 
Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) if the end of the insurance 
period, or that are delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the 
Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is 
applicable) of the end of the insurance period, by dividing the price 
received or that will be received per hundredweight by the highest price 
election designated in the Special Provisions for the insured potato 
type, and multiplying the result (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of 
hundredweight of sold production. If production is sold for a price 
lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local 
market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price 
you could have received in the local market;
    (ii) For harvested potatoes discarded within 21 days (60 days if the 
Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is 
applicable) of the end of the insurance period and appraised unharvested 
production that could:
    (A) Not have been sold, the production to count will be zero; or
    (B) Have been sold, the production will be reduced as follows (all 
percentage points of damage will be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent):
    (1) 0.1 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage through 5.0 percent;
    (2) 05. percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 5.1 percent 
through 6.0 percent;
    (3) 1.0 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 6.1 through 8.0 
percent;
    (4) 2.0 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 8.1 through 9.0 
percent; and
    (5) 2.5 percent for each 0.1 percent of damage from 9.1 through 10.4 
percent.
    (iii) For potatoes for which a price is not agreed upon between you 
and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop 
Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) of the end of the 
insurance period and that remain in storage 22 or more days (61 or more 
days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement 
is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, adjustment will be 
made in accordance with section 11(g)(2)(ii)(B).
    (h) When a combination of freeze damage or a tuber rot condition is 
5.1 percent (by weight) or greater, the amount of production to count 
for production affected by tuber rot will first be determined in 
accordance with section 11(g)(2). If production is not sold within the 
time frame specified in section 11(g)(2), this amount will be further 
adjusted as follows:
    (1) The percentage of potatoes with freeze damage will be determined 
by dividing the weight of potatoes with only freeze damage in 
representatives samples of the production by the total weight of the 
samples;
    (2) The reduction percentage will be determined based on the result 
of section 11(h)(1) and section 11(g)(1); and
    (3) The reduction percentage determined in section 11(h)(2) will be 
multiplied by the amount of production determined in accordance with 
section 11(g)(2).

                         12. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 25 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, and pay 
an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage 
to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

           Northern Potato Crop Insurance Quality Endorsement

    1. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the 
actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of 
your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions 
described herein. In the event of a conflict between the Northern Potato 
Crop Provisions and this endorsement, this endorsement will control.
    2. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing 
date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes 
under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until 
canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop 
year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the 
cancellation date.

[[Page 246]]

    3. All acreage of potatoes insured under the Northern Potato Crop 
Provisions will be insured under this endorsement except:
    (a) Any acreage specifically excluded by the actuarial documents; 
and
    (b) Any acreage grown for seed.
    4. We will adjust production to count (determined in accordance with 
section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato 
Crop Provisions) from (1) unharvested acreage; (2) harvested acreage 
that is stored after a grade inspection; or (3) that is marketed after a 
grade inspection; and that contains potatoes that grade less than U.S. 
No. 2 due to:
    (a) Internal defects (the number of potatoes with such defects must 
be in excess of the tolerance allowed for U.S. No. 2 grade potatoes on a 
lot basis and must not be separable from undamaged production using 
methods used by the potato packers or processors to whom you normally 
deliver your potato production), will be adjusted as follows:
    (1) For potatoes for which a price is agreed upon in writing between 
you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop 
Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) of the end of the 
insurance period, or that are delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 
days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement 
is applicable) of the end of the insurance period, by multiplying the 
production to count by the factor (not to exceed 1.0) that results from 
dividing the price received or that will be received per hundredweight 
of the damaged production by the highest available price election. This 
method of adjustment will not be performed if it has already been 
performed under the terms of section 11(g)(2)(i) of the Northern Potato 
Crop Insurance Provisions. If production is sold for a price lower than 
the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will 
determine the value of the production based on the price you could have 
received in the local market.
    (2) For harvested potatoes discarded within 21 days (60 days if the 
Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is 
applicable) of the end of the insurance period and appraised unharvested 
production that could:
    (i) Not have been sold, the production to count will be zero; or
    (ii) Have been sold, the production to count will be determined in 
accordance with section 4(a)(1). The price used for the damaged 
production will be the price you could have received in the local 
market.
    (3) For potatoes for which a price is not agreed upon between you 
and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop 
Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) of the end of the 
insurance period and that remain in storage 22 or more days (61 or more 
days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement 
is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, production to 
count will be determined in accordance with section 4(b).
    (b) Factors other than those specified in section 4(a), by 
multiplying by a factor (not to exceed 1.0) that is determined as 
follows:
    (1) The combined weight of sampled potatoes that grade U.S. No. 2 or 
better and that are damaged by freeze or tuber rot will be divided by 
the total sample weight; and
    (2) The percentage determined in section 4(b)(1) above will be 
divided by the applicable percentage factor determined in accordance 
with section 9.
    5. Potatoes harvested or appraised prior to full maturity that do 
not grade U.S. No. 2 due solely to size will be considered to have met 
U.S. No. 2 standards unless the potatoes are damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss and leaving the crop in the field would either reduce 
production or decrease quality.
    6. Production to count for potatoes destroyed, stored or marketed 
without a grade inspection will be 100 percent of the gross weight of 
such potatoes.
    7. All determinations must be based upon a grade inspection.
    8. The actuarial documents may provide ``U.S. No. 1'' in place of 
``U.S. No. 2'' as used in this endorsement. If both U.S. No. 1 and 2 are 
available in the actuarial documents, you may elect U.S. No. 1 or 2 by 
potato type or group, if separate types or groups are specified in the 
Special Provisions.
    9. Percentage factor means the historical average percentage of 
potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better, by type, determined from your 
records. If at least 4 continuous years of records are available, the 
percentage factor will be the simple average of the available records 
not to exceed 10 years. If less than four years of records are 
available, the percentage factor will be determined based on a 
combination of your records and the percentage factor contained in the 
Special Provisions.

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)

[[Page 247]]

    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

      Northern Potato Crop Insurance Processing Quality Endorsement

    1. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the 
actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of 
your Northern Potato Crop Provisions and Quality Endorsement subject to 
the terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a conflict 
between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions or Quality Endorsement and 
this endorsement, this endorsement will control.
    2. You must have a Northern Potato Quality Endorsement in place and 
elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing date for the 
initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes under this 
endorsement. This endorsement may be canceled by either you or us for 
any succeeding crop year by giving written notice to the other party on 
or before the cancellation date.
    3. All terms of the Northern Potato Quality Endorsement not modified 
by this endorsement will be applicable to acreage covered under this 
endorsement.
    4. A processor contract must be executed with a potato processor for 
the potato types insured under this endorsement and a copy submitted to 
us on or before the acreage reporting date for potatoes. If you elect 
this endorsement, all insurable acreage of production under contract 
with the processor must be insured under this endorsement.
    5. When the processor contract requires the processor to purchase a 
stated amount of production, rather than all of the production from a 
stated number of acres, the insurable acreage will be determined by 
dividing the stated amount of production by the approved yield for the 
acreage. The number of acres insured under this endorsement will not 
exceed the actual number of acres planted to the potato types and which 
are needed to fulfill the contract.
    6. In lieu of the provisions contained in section 4 of the Northern 
Potato Quality Endorsement, production that is rejected by the processor 
will be adjusted as follows: Production to count (determined in 
accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the 
Northern Potato Crop Provisions) from (1) unharvested acreage; (2) 
harvested acreage that is stored after a grade inspection; or (3) that 
is marketed after a grade inspection; and that contains potatoes that:
    (a) Grade less than U.S. No. 2 due to internal defects, a specific 
gravity lower than the lesser of 1.074 or the minimum acceptable amount 
specified in the processor contract, or a fry color of No. 3 or darker 
due to either sugar exceeding 10 percent or sugar ends exceeding 19 
percent (the number of potatoes with such defects must be in excess of 
the tolerance allowed for U.S. No. 2 grade potatoes on a lot basis and 
must not be separable from undamaged production using methods used by 
the processors to which you normally deliver your potato production), 
will be adjusted as follows:
    (1) For potatoes for which a price is agreed upon in writing between 
you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop 
Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) of the end of the 
insurance period, or that are delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 
days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement 
is applicable) of the end of the insurance period, by multiplying the 
production to count by the factor (not to exceed 1.0) that results from 
dividing the price received or that will be received per hundredweight 
of the damaged production by the highest available price election. This 
method of adjustment will not be performed if it has already been 
performed under the terms of section 11(g)(2)(i) of the Northern Potato 
Crop Insurance Provisions. If production is sold for a price lower than 
the value appropriate and representative of the local market, we will 
determine the value of the production based on the price you could have 
received in the local market.
    (2) For harvested potatoes discarded within 21 days (60 days if the 
Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is 
applicable) of the end of the insurance period and appraised unharvested 
production that could:
    (i) Not have been sold, the production to count will be zero; or
    (ii) Have been sold, the production to count will be determined in 
accordance with section 6(a)(1). The price used for the damaged 
production will be the price you could have received in the local 
market.
    (3) For potatoes for which a price is not agreed upon in writing 
between you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato 
Crop Insurance Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable) of the end of 
the insurance period and that remain in storage 22 or more days (61 or 
more days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Storage Coverage 
Endorsement is applicable) after the end of the insurance period, 
production to count will be determined in accordance with section 6(b).
    (b) Grade less than U.S. No. 2 due to factors other than those 
specified in section 6(a) will be multiplied by a factor (not to exceed 
1.0) that is determined as follows:
    (1) The combined weight of sampled potatoes that grade U.S. No. 2 or 
better and that are damaged by freeze or tuber rot will be divided by 
the total sample weight; and
    (2) The percentage determined in section 6(b)(1) above will be 
divided by the applicable percentage factor determined in accordance 
with section 10.

[[Page 248]]

    7. All grade determinations for the purposes of this endorsement 
will be made using the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes 
for Processing or Chipping.
    8. All determinations must be based upon a grade inspection.
    9. The actuarial documents may provide ``U.S. No. 1'' in place of 
``U.S. No. 2'' as used in this endorsement. If both U.S. No. 1 and 2 are 
available in the actuarial documents, you may elect U.S. No. 1 or 2 by 
potato type or group, if separate types or groups are specified in the 
Special Provisions.
    10. Percentage factor means the historical average percentage of 
potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better, by type, determined from your 
records. If at least 4 continuous years of records are available, the 
percentage factor will be the simple average of the available records 
not to exceed 10 years. If less than four years of records are 
available, the percentage factor will be determined based on a 
combination of your records and the percentage factor contained in the 
Special Provisions.

Sec. 457.145  Potato crop insurance--certified seed endorsement.

    The potato Certified Seed Endorsement provisions for the 2001 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC policies:

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

            Potato Crop Insurance Certified Seed Endorsement

    1. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the 
actuarial documents, this endorsement is attached to and made part of 
your Northern Potato Crop Provisions subject to the terms and conditions 
described herein. In the event of a conflict between the Northern Potato 
Provisions and this endorsement, this endorsement will control.
    2. For the purpose of this endorsement, the term ``potato certified 
seed program'' means the state program administered by the public agency 
responsible for the seed certification process within the state in which 
the seed is produced.
    3. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing 
date for the initial crop year you wish to insure your potatoes under 
this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until 
canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop 
year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the 
cancellation date.
    4. All potatoes grown on insurable acreage and that are entered into 
the potato seed certification program administered by the state in which 
the seed is grown must be insured unless limited by section 5 below.
    5. Your certified seed production guarantee per-acre will be the 
per-acre production guarantee used to cover the same acreage under the 
terms of the Northern Potato Crop Provisions. However, unless a written 
agreement provides otherwise, if the total amount of insurable certified 
seed acreage you have for the current crop year is greater than 125 
percent of your average number of acres entered into and passing 
certification in the potato certified seed program in the three previous 
calendar years, your certified seed production guarantee for each unit 
will be reduced as follows:
    6. You must provide acceptable records of your certified seed potato 
acreage and production for the previous three years. These records must 
clearly indicate the number of your acres entered into the potato seed 
certification program administered by the state in which the seed is 
grown.
    7. All potatoes insured for certified seed production must be 
produced and managed in accordance with standards, practices, and 
procedures required for certification by the state's certifying agency 
and applicable regulations.
    8. If, due to insurable causes occurring within the insurance 
period, the amount of certified seed you produce is less than your 
certified seed production guarantee, we will settle your claim by:
    (a) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective certified seed 
production guarantee;
    (b) Multiplying each result in section 8(a) by the dollar amount per 
hundredweight contained in the Special Provisions for production covered 
under this endorsement;
    (c) Totaling the results of section 8(b);
    (d) Multiplying the number of hundredweight of production that 
qualify as certified seed and any amount of production lost due to 
uninsured causes, or that does not qualify as certified seed due to 
uninsured causes, by the dollar amount per hundredweight contained in 
the Special Provisions for production covered under this endorsement;
    (e) Subtracting the result of section 8(d) from the result of 
section 8(c); and
    (f) Multiplying the result of section 8(e) by your share.
    9. You must notify us of any loss under this endorsement not later 
than 14 days after you receive notice from the state certification 
agency that any acreage or production has failed certification. Nothing 
herein extends the insurance period beyond the time period specified in 
section 8 of the

[[Page 249]]

Northern Potato Crop Provisions and section 11 of the Basic Provisions.
    10. Acreage covered under the terms of this endorsement will have 
the same unit structure as provided under the Basic Provisions and the 
Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if you have two optional 
units (00101 and 00102) under your Northern Potato Crop Insurance Policy 
and you elect this endorsement, you will also have two optional units 
(00201 and 00202) for certified seed coverage, provided that certified 
seed is grown in both units 00101 and 00102. Or, if you have two basic 
units (00100 and 00200) under your Northern Potato Crop Insurance Policy 
and you elect this endorsement, you will also have two basic units 
(00300 and 00400) for certified seed coverage, provided that certified 
seed is grown in both units 00100 and 00200. In the event certified seed 
acreage is not grown in the same optional or basic units as acreage 
covered under the Basic Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop 
Provisions, certified seed units will be established in accordance with 
the unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions and the 
Northern Potato Crop Provisions. For example, if a basic unit is divided 
into two optional units for potato acreage covered under the Basic 
Provisions and the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, but certified seed 
is grown in only one of those optional units, the certified seed acreage 
will be insured as one basic unit.
    11. Any production that does not qualify as certified seed because 
of varietal mixing or your failure to follow the standard practices and 
procedures required for certification will be considered as lost due to 
uninsured causes.

terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a conflict 
between the Northern Potato Crop Provisions and this endorsement, this 
endorsement will control.
    2. You must elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing 
date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes 
under this endorsement. This endorsement will continue in effect until 
canceled. It may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop 
year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the 
cancellation date.
    3. Potato production grown under a contract that requires the 
production to be delivered to a buyer within three days of harvest will 
not be insured under this endorsement. When such contract requires 
delivery of a stated amount of production, rather than all of the 
production from a stated amount of acres, the number of acres not 
insured under this endorsement will be determined by dividing the stated 
amount of production by the approved yield for the acreage. All other 
potato production insured under the Northern Potato Crop Provisions must 
be insured under this endorsement unless the Special Provisions allow 
you to exclude certain potato varieties, types, or groups from this 
endorsement, and you elect to exercise this option. If you elect this 
endorsement, such exclusions must be shown annually on your acreage 
report and will be applicable to all acreage of the excluded varieties, 
types, or groups for the crop year.
    4. When production from separate insurance units, basic or optional, 
is commingled in storage, the production to count for each unit will be 
allocated pro rata based on the production placed in storage from each 
unit. Such allocation will be allowed only if verifiable records of 
production placed in storage are available by unit. If you do not have 
verifiable records, all units without verifiable records will be 
combined in accordance with section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop 
Provisions. For example, if 500 hundredweight from one unit are 
commingled with 1,500 hundredweight from another unit and the production 
to count from the stored production is 1,000 hundredweight, 250 
hundredweight of production to count will be allocated to the unit 
contributing 500 hundredweight and 750 hundredweight to the unit 
contributing 1500 hundredweight to the stored production. This provision 
does not eliminate or change any other requirement contained in this 
policy to provide or maintain separate records of acreage or production 
by unit.
    5. The extended coverage provided by this endorsement will be 
applicable only if:
    (a) Insured potatoes are damaged within the insurance period by an 
insured cause other than freeze that later results in:

[[Page 250]]

    (1) Tuber rot as defined in the Northern Potato Crop Provisions, to 
the extent that 5.1 percent (by weight) or more of the insured 
production is affected;
    (2) Internal defects to the extent that such defects are in excess 
of the amount allowed for the U.S. grade standard you elected for 
purposes of coverage under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Quality 
Endorsement. Such defects must not be separable from undamaged 
production using methods used by the packers or processors to which you 
normally deliver your potato production. This coverage is applicable 
only to production covered under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance 
Quality Endorsement; or
    (3) A specific gravity lower than the lesser of 1.074 or the minimum 
acceptable amount specified in the processor contract, or a fry color of 
No. 3 or darker due to either sugar exceeding 10 percent or sugar ends 
exceeding 19 percent. This coverage is applicable only to production 
covered under the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Processing Quality 
Endorsement.
    (b) You notify us within 72 hours of your initial discovery of any 
damage that has or that may later result in the quality deficiencies 
specified in section 5(a);
    (c) The percentage of production that has any of the quality 
deficiencies specified in section 5(a) is determined no later than 60 
days after the end of the insurance period; and
    (d) The potatoes are evaluated and quality (grade) determinations 
are made by us, a laboratory approved by us, or a potato grader licensed 
or certified by the applicable State or the United States Department of 
Agriculture, in accordance with the United States Standards for Grades 
of Potatoes. Samples of damaged production must be obtained by us or 
party approved by us prior to the sale or disposal of any lot of 
potatoes. Or, if production is not sold or disposed of within 60 days of 
the end of the insurance period, samples must be obtained within 60 days 
of the end of the insurance period.

Sec. 457.147  Central and Southern potato crop insurance provisions.

    The Central and Southern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions for the 
1999 and succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

               Central and Southern Potato Crop Provisions

    These provisions will be applicable in: Alabama; Arizona; all 
California counties except Humboldt, Modoc and Siskiyou; Delaware; 
Florida; Georgia; Maryland; Missouri; New Jersey; New Mexico; North 
Carolina; Oklahoma; Texas; and Virginia.
    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows:
    (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, as applicable; (2) 
the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop Provisions; and (4) the Basic 
Provisions, with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Certified seed. Potatoes for planting a potato crop in a subsequent 
crop year that have been found to meet the standards of the public 
agency that is responsible for the seed certification process within the 
state in which they were grown.
    Discard. Disposal of production by you, or a person acting for you, 
without receiving any value for it.
    Disposed. Any disposition of the crop including but not limited to 
sale or discard.
    Grade inspection. An inspection in which samples of production are 
obtained by us, or a party approved by us, prior to the sale, storage or 
disposal of any lot of potatoes, or any portion of a lot and the 
potatoes are evaluated and quality (grade) determinations are made by 
us, a laboratory approved by us, or a potato grader licensed or 
certified by the applicable State or the United States Department of 
Agriculture, in accordance with the United States Standards for Grades 
of Potatoes.
    Harvest. Lifting potatoes from within the soil to the soil surface.
    Hundredweight. One hundred (100) pounds avoirdupois.
    Lot. A quantity of production that can be separated from other 
quantities of production by grade characteristics, load, location or 
other distinctive features.
    Planting period. The period of time between the calendar dates 
designated in the Special Provisions for the planting of spring-planted, 
summer-planted, fall-planted, or winter-planted potatoes.
    Practical to replant. In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section one of the Basic Provisions, practical to 
replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the 
insured crop, based on factors including, but not limited to, moisture 
availability, condition of the field, marketing windows, and time to 
crop maturity, that replanting to the insured crop will allow the crop 
to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant after 
the end of the late planting period, or the end of the planting period 
in which initial planting took place in

[[Page 251]]

counties for which the Special Provisions designates separate planting 
periods, unless replanting is generally occurring in the area.

                            2. Unit Division

    A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, will 
be divided into additional basic units by planting period.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 2 of the Basic 
Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the potatoes 
in the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions 
provide different price elections by type. If the Special Provisions 
provide for different price elections by type, you may select one price 
election for each potato type designated in the Special Provisions. The 
price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage 
relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for each type. 
For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for 
one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election 
for all other types.
    (b) If the production from any acreage of the insured crop is not 
harvested, the price used to determine your indemnity will be 80 percent 
of your price election.
    (c) Any acreage of potatoes damaged to the extent that similarly 
situated producers in the area would not normally further care for the 
potatoes will be deemed to have been destroyed even though you may 
continue to care for the potatoes. The price election for unharvested 
acreage will apply to such acreage.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is:
    (a) June 30 preceding the cancellation date for counties with a 
September 30 cancellation date;
    (b) September 30 preceding the cancellation date for counties with a 
November 30 or December 31 cancellation date; and
    (c) November 30 preceding the cancellation date for counties with a 
February 28 or March 15 cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

 and Yoakum Counties, Texas; and New Mexico.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            6. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium computation method contained in section 7 of 
the Basic Provisions, the annual premium amount (y) is computed by 
multiplying (a) the production guarantee by (b) the price election for 
harvested acreage, by (c) the premium rate, by (d) the insured acreage, 
by (e) your share at the time of planting, and by (f) any applicable 
premium adjustment factors contained in the actuarial documents 
(axbxcxdxexf = y).

                             7. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the potatoes in the county for which a premium rate 
is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) Planted with certified seed (unless otherwise permitted by the 
Special Provisions);
    (c) Planted for harvest as certified seed stock, or for human 
consumption, (unless specified otherwise in the Special Provisions);
    (d) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (1) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, 
we will not insure any acreage that:
    (a) Does not meet the rotation requirements contained in the Special 
Provisions for the crop; or
    (b) Is damaged before the final planting date or before the end of 
the applicable planting period in counties for which the Special 
Provisions designate separate planting periods, to the extent that 
similarly situated producers in the area would normally

[[Page 252]]

not further care for the crop, unless it is replanted or we agree that 
it is not practical to replant.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the 
date immediately following planting as follows (exceptions, if any, for 
specific counties, varieties or types are contained in the Special 
Provisions):
    (a) July 15 in Missouri; North Carolina; and all Texas counties 
except Bailey, Castro, Dallam, Deaf Smith, Floyd, Gaines, Hale, Haskell, 
Hartley, Knox, Lamb, Parmer, Swisher, and Yoakum.
    (b) July 25 in Arizona; and Virginia.
    (c) August 15 in Oklahoma; and Haskell and Knox Counties, Texas.
    (d) In Alabama; California; Florida; and Georgia; the dates 
established by the Special Provisions for each planting period; and
    (e) October 15 in Bailey, Castro, Dallam, Deaf Smith, Floyd, Gains, 
Hale, Hartley, Lamb, Parmer, Swisher, and Yoakum Counties, Texas; 
Delaware; Maryland; New Jersey; and New Mexico.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss which occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but only if sufficient and proper pest control measures 
are used;
    (4) Plant disease, but only if sufficient and proper disease control 
measures are used;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period (see section 10(a) (1) 
through (7)).
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss not insured against as 
contained in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure 
against any loss of production due to:
    (1) Damage that occurs or becomes evident after the end of the 
insurance period, including, but not limited to, damage that occurs 
after potatoes have been placed in storage; or
    (2) Causes, such as freeze after certain dates, as limited by the 
Special Provisions.

                11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must leave representative samples at least 10 feet wide 
and extending the entire length of each field in the unit if you are 
going to destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be 
harvested.
    (b) We must be given the opportunity to perform a grade inspection 
on the production from any unit for which you have given notice of 
damage.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable production records were not provided; and
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee (if there is unharvested acreage in the unit, the harvested 
and unharvested acreage will be determined separately);
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election (the price election may be limited as specified in 
section 3.);
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if 
applicable, (see section 12(d)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(5) from the result in 
section 12(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 harvested acres of potatoes in 
the unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per acre and a price 
election of $4.00 per hundredweight. You are only able to harvest 10,000 
hundredweight. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee;
    (2) 15,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $60,000.00 value 
of guarantee;
    (4) 10,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value 
of production to count;
    (6) $60,000.00-$40,000.00 = $20,000.00 loss; and
    (7) $20,000.00x100 percent = $20,000.00 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 100 unharvested acres of 
potatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 150 hundredweight per 
acre and a price election of $3.20 per hundredweight. (The price 
election for unharvested acreage is 80.0 percent of your elected price 
election ($4.00 x 0.80 = $3.20.) This unharvested acreage was appraised 
at 35 hundredweight per acre for a total of 3,500 hundredweight as 
production to count. Your total indemnity for the harvested and

[[Page 253]]

unharvested acreage would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee 
for the harvested acreage, and
    100 acres x 150 hundredweight = 15,000 hundredweight guarantee for 
the unharvested acreage;
    (2) 15,000 hundredweight guarantee x $4.00 price election = 
$60,000.00 value of guarantee for the harvested acreage, and
    15,000 hundredweight guarantee x $3.20 price election = $48,000.00 
value of guarantee for the unharvested acreage;
    (3) $60,000.00 + $48,000.00 = $108,000.00 total value of guarantee;
    (4) 10,000 hundredweight x $4.00 price election = $40,000.00 value 
of production to count for the harvested acreage, and
    3500 hundredweight x $3.20 = $11,200.00 value of production to count 
for the unharvested acreage;
    (5) $40,000.00 + $11,200.00 = $51,200.00 total value of production 
to count;
    (6) $108,000.00 - $51,200 = $56,800.00 loss; and
    (7) $56,800.00 loss x 100 percent = $56,800.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The extent of any quality loss must be determined based on 
samples obtained no later than the time potatoes are placed in storage, 
if the production is stored prior to sale, or the date they are 
delivered to a buyer, wholesaler, packer, broker, or other handler if 
production is not stored.
    (d) The total production to count (in hundredweight) from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes;
    (D) From which any production is disposed of without a grade 
inspection; or
    (E) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Production lost due to harvest prior to full maturity. 
Production to count from such acreage will be determined by increasing 
the amount of harvested production by 2 percent per day for each day the 
potatoes were harvested prior to the date the potatoes would have 
reached full maturity. The date the potatoes would have reached full 
maturity will be considered to be 45 days prior to the calendar date for 
the end of the insurance period, unless otherwise specified in the 
Special Provisions. This adjustment will not be made if the potatoes are 
damaged by an insurable cause of loss, and leaving the crop in the field 
would either reduce production or decrease quality.
    (iv) Unharvested production (the value of unharvested production 
will be calculated using the reduced price election determined in 
section 3(b) and unharvested production may be adjusted in accordance 
with section 12(e)); and
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The price used to determine the 
amount of any indemnity will be limited as specified in section 3 even 
if the representative samples are harvested. The amount of production to 
count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or 
appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If 
you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide 
sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you 
consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the 
amount of production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage determined 
in accordance with section 12(e).
    (e) With the exception of production with external defects, only 
marketable lots of mature potatoes will be production to count for loss 
adjustment purposes. Production not meeting the standards for grading 
U.S. No. 2 due to external defects will be determined on an individual 
potato basis for all unharvested potatoes and for any harvested potatoes 
if we determine it is practical to separate the damaged production. All 
determinations must be based upon a grade inspection.
    (1) Marketable lots of potatoes will include any lot of potatoes 
that is:
    (i) Stored;
    (ii) Sold as seed;
    (iii) Sold for human consumption; or
    (iv) Harvested and not sold or that is appraised if such lot meets 
the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 or better on a sample basis.
    (2) Marketable lots will also include any potatoes that we 
determine:
    (i) Could have been sold for seed or human consumption in the 
general marketing area;

[[Page 254]]

    (ii) Were not sold as a result of uninsured causes including, but 
not limited to, failure to meet chipper or processor standards for fry 
color or specific gravity; or
    (iii) Were disposed of without our prior written consent and such 
disposition prevented our determination of marketability.
    (3) Unless included in section 12(e) (1) or (2), a potato lot will 
not be considered marketable if, due to insurable causes of damage, it:
    (i) Is partially damaged, and is salvageable only for starch, 
alcohol, or livestock feed;
    (ii) Is left unharvested and does not meet the standards for grading 
U.S. No. 2 or better due to internal defects; or
    (iii) does not meet the standards for grading U.S. No. 2 or better 
due to external defects, is harvested, and it is not practical to 
separate the damaged production.

                         13. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 25 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, and pay 
an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage 
to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

                   Fresh Market Pepper Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop

documents in which the peppers must be planted to be considered fall, 
winter or spring-planted peppers.
    Potential production--The number of boxes of mature bell peppers 
that the pepper plants will or would have produced per acre by the end 
of the insurance period, assuming normal growing conditions and 
practices.
    Practical to replant--In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or 
damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited 
to moisture availability, condition of the field, marketing windows, and 
time to crop maturity, that replanting to the insured crop will allow 
the crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of 
the insurance period (inability to obtain plants or seed will not be 
considered when determining if it is practical to replant).
    Row width--The widest distance from the center of one row of plants 
to the center of an adjacent row of plants.

[[Page 255]]

    Tropical depression--A system identified by the U.S. Weather Service 
as a tropical depression, and for the period of time so designated, 
including tropical storms, gales, and hurricanes.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, 
will also be divided into additional basic units by planting period.
    (b) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.

              3. Amounts of Insurance and Production Stages

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one coverage 
level (and the corresponding amount of insurance designated in the 
actuarial documents for the applicable planting period and practice) for 
all the peppers in the county insured under this policy.
    (b) The amount of insurance you choose for each planting period and 
practice must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price 
offered by us for each planting period and practice. For example, if you 
choose 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for a specific 
planting period and practice, you must also choose 100 percent of the 
maximum amount of insurance for all other planting periods and 
practices.
    (c) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) do not apply to fresh 
market peppers.
    (d) The amounts of insurance per acre are progressive by stages as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Any acreage of peppers damaged in the first or second stage to 
the extent that the majority of producers in the area would not normally 
further care for it, will be deemed to have been destroyed. The 
indemnity payable for such acreage will be based on the stage the plants 
had achieved when the damage occurred.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is April 30 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are July 31.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the requirements of section 6 (Report of Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must report on or before the 
acreage reporting date contained in the Special Provisions for each 
planting period:
    (a) All the acreage of peppers in the county insured under this 
policy in which you have a share;
    (b) The dates the acreage was planted within each planting period; 
and
    (c) The row width.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 7 
(Annual Premium) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the annual 
premium amount for each cultural practice (e.g., fall direct-seeded 
irrigated) is determined by multiplying the third stage amount of 
insurance per acre by the premium rate for the cultural practice as 
established in the Actuarial Table, by the insured acreage, by your 
share at the time coverage begins, and by any applicable premium 
adjustment factors contained in the actuarial documents.

                             8. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the bell peppers in the 
county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are:

[[Page 256]]

    (1) Planted to be harvested and sold as mature fresh market bell 
peppers;
    (2) Planted within the planting periods designated in the actuarial 
documents;
    (3) Grown under an irrigated practice;
    (4) Grown on acreage covered by plastic mulch except where the 
Special Provisions allow otherwise;
    (5) Grown by a person who in at least one of the three previous crop 
years:
    (i) Grew bell peppers for commercial sale; or
    (ii) Participated in managing a bell pepper farming operation;
    (c) That are not:
    (1) Interplanted with another crop;
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume;
    (3) Pimento peppers; or
    (4) Grown for direct marketing.

                          9. Insurable Acreage

    (a) In lieu of the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching if 
a crop has not been planted in at least one of the three previous crop 
years, we will insure newly cleared land or former pasture land planted 
to fresh market peppers.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) You must replant any acreage of peppers damaged during the 
planting period in which initial planting took place whenever less than 
50 percent of the plant stand remains: and
    (i) It is practical to replant;
    (ii) If, at the time the crop was damaged, the final day of the 
planting period has not passed; and
    (iii) The damage occurs within 30 days of transplanting or 60 days 
of direct-seeding.
    (2) Whenever peppers initially are planted during the fall or winter 
planting periods and the conditions specified in sections 9(b)(1) (ii) 
and (iii) are not satisfied, you may elect:
    (i) To replant such acreage and collect any replant payment due as 
specified in section 12. The initial planting period coverage will 
continue for such replanted acreage.
    (ii) Not to replant such acreage and receive an indemnity based on 
the stage of growth the plants had attained at the time of damage. 
However, such an election will result in the acreage being uninsurable 
in the subsequent planting period.
    (3) We will not insure any acreage on which peppers (except for 
replanted peppers in accordance with sections 9(b)(1) and (2)), 
tomatoes, eggplants, or tobacco have been grown and the soil was not 
fumigated or otherwise properly treated before planting peppers.

                          10. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), coverage begins on each unit or part of a 
unit the later of the date we accept your application, or when the 
peppers are planted in each planting period. Coverage ends at the 
earliest of:
    (a) Total destruction of the peppers on the unit;
    (b) Abandonment of the peppers on the unit;
    (c) The date harvest should have started on the unit on any acreage 
which will not be harvested;
    (d) Final adjustment of a loss on the unit;
    (e) Final harvest; or
    (f) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period as 
follows:
    (1) 165 days after the date of direct-seeding or replanting with 
seed; and
    (2) 150 days after the date of transplanting or replanting with 
transplants.

                           11. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Excess rain;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Freeze;
    (4) Hail;
    (5) Tornado;
    (6) Tropical depression; or
    (7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against any loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless no effective control 
measure exists for such disease or insect infestation; or
    (2) Failure to market the peppers, unless such failure is due to 
actual physical damage caused by an insured cause of loss that occurs 
during the insurance period.

                         12. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if, due to an 
insured cause of loss, more than 50 percent of the plant stand will not 
produce peppers and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of your actual cost of replanting or the result obtained by 
multiplying the per acre replanting payment amount contained in the 
Special Provisions by your insured share.
    (c) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 (Replanting 
Payment) of the Basic

[[Page 257]]

Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that limit a replanting payment to one each 
crop year, only one replanting payment will be made for acreage planted 
during each planting period within the crop year.

                13. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements contained in section 14 (Duties In 
The Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), if 
you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit you also must give us 
notice not later than 72 hours after the earliest of:
    (a) The time you discontinue harvest of any acreage on the unit;
    (b) The date harvest normally would start if any acreage on the unit 
will not be harvested; or
    (c) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period.

                         14. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage in each stage by the amount of 
insurance per acre for the final stage;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 14(b)(1) by the percentage 
for the applicable stage (see section 3(d));
    (3) Total the results of section 14(b)(2);
    (4) Subtracting either of the following values from the result of 
section 14(b)(3):
    (i) For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, the total 
value of production to be counted (see section 14(c)); or
    (ii) For catastrophic risk protection coverage, the result of 
multiplying the total value of production to be counted (see section 
14(c)) by:
    (A) Sixty percent for the 1998 crop year; or
    (B) Fifty-five percent for 1999 and subsequent crop years; and
    (5) Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(4) by your share.
    (c) The total value of production to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for the stage for 
any acreage:
    (i) That is abandoned;
    (ii) Put to another use without our consent;
    (iii) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (iv) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (2) The value of the following appraised production will not be less 
than the dollar amount obtained by multiplying the number of boxes of 
appraised peppers by the minimum value per box shown in the Special 
Provisions for the planting period:
    (i) Potential production on any acreage that has not been harvested 
the third time;
    (ii) Unharvested mature bell peppers (unharvested production that is 
damaged or defective due to insurable causes and is not marketable will 
not be counted as production to count);
    (iii) Production lost due to uninsured causes; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) We may require you to continue to care for the crop so that a 
subsequent appraisal may be made or the crop harvested to determine 
actual production (If we require you to continue to care for the crop 
and you do not do so, the original appraisal will be used); or
    (B) You may elect to continue to care for the crop, in which case 
the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested 
production, or our reappraisal if the crop is not harvested.
    (3) The total value of all harvested production from the insurable 
acreage will be the dollar amount obtained by subtracting the allowable 
cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price received for 
each box of peppers (this result may not be less than the minimum value 
shown in the Special Provisions for any box of peppers), and multiplying 
this result by the number of boxes of peppers harvested. Harvested 
production that is damaged or defective due to insurable causes and is 
not marketable, will not be counted as production to count.

                     15. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

                        16. Minimum Value Option

    (a) The provisions of this option are continuous and will be 
attached to and made a part of your insurance policy, if:
    (1) You elect either Option I or Option II of the Minimum Value 
Option on your application, or on a form approved by us, on or before 
the sales closing date for the initial crop year in which you wish to 
insure fresh market peppers under this option, and pay the

[[Page 258]]

additional premium indicated in the actuarial documents for this 
optional coverage; and
    (2) You have not elected coverage under the Catastrophic Risk 
Protection Endorsement.
    (b) In lieu of the provisions contained in section 14(c)(3), the 
total value of harvested production will be determined as follows:
    (1) If you selected Option I of the Minimum Value Option, the total 
value of harvested production will be as follows:
    (i) For sold production, the dollar amount obtained by subtracting 
the allowable cost contained in the Special Provisions from the price 
received for each box of peppers (this result may not be less than the 
minimum value option price contained in the Special Provisions for any 
box of peppers), and multiplying this result by the number of boxes of 
peppers sold; and
    (ii) For marketable production that is not sold, the dollar amount 
obtained by multiplying the number of boxes of such peppers on the unit 
by the minimum value shown in the Special Provisions for the planting 
period (harvested production that is damaged or defective due to 
insurable causes and is not marketable will not be counted as 
production).
    (2) If you selected Option II of the Minimum Value Option, the total 
value of harvested production will be as provided in section 16(b)(1), 
except that the dollar amount specified in section 16(b)(1)(i) may not 
be less than zero.
    (c) This option may be canceled by either you or us for any 
succeeding crop year by giving written notice on or before the 
cancellation date preceding the crop year for which the cancellation of 
this option is to be effective.

Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election and coverage level for 
each table grape variety in the county insured under this policy.

[[Page 259]]

    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for 
Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by 
variety if applicable:
    (1) Any damage, removal of bearing vines, change in practices, or

yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of 
affected acres;
    (2) The number of bearing vines on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the vines and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such

as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of the following: 
Interplanting perennial crop, removal of vines, damage, change in 
practices and any other circumstance that may affect the yield potential 
of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that 
may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your 
production guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the 
circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

grapes in the county by variety.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be any insurable variety 
of grapes in the county that you elect and for which a premium rate is 
provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are grown for harvest as table grapes;
    (3) That are adapted to the area; and
    (4) That are grown in a vineyard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us.
    (b) In addition to table grapes not insurable under section 8 
(Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we do not insure 
any table grapes grown on vines:
    (1) That, after being set out or grafted, have not reached the 
number of growing seasons designated by the Special Provisions; or
    (2) That have not produced an average of at least 150 lugs of table 
grapes per acre in at least one of the most recent three crop years in 
your actual production history base period. However, we may inspect and 
agree in writing to insure acreage that has not produced this amount.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) that prohibit insurance attaching to a

    (1) Coverage begins on February 1 of each crop year, except that for 
the year of application, if your application is received after January 
22 but prior to February 1, insurance will attach on the 10th day after 
your properly completed application is received in our local office, 
unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and determine 
that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any 
information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition 
of the vineyard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is the date during the calendar year in which the grapes are 
normally harvested or contained in the Special Provisions as provided to 
you on or before the contract change date.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such

[[Page 260]]

acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of table grapes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no 
premium will be due or indemnity paid for such acreage for that crop 
year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (d) If your table grape policy is canceled or terminated for any 
crop year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance 
attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and 
termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered 
to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, 
or indemnity will be due for such crop year.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the vineyard;
    (3) Wildlife;
    (4) Earthquake;
    (5) Volanic eruption; or
    (6) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
cause of loss ((a)(1) through (5) of this section) that occurs during 
the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available;
    (2) Phylloxera, regardless of cause; or
    (3) Inability to market the table grapes for any reason other than 
actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this 
section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable 
to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                11. Duties In the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the following 
will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days after the date harvest should 
have started if the crop will not be harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal 
that will be used to determine your production to count for production 
that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, 
we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any 
acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your 
production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will 
be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre 
if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
    (c) If the crop has been damaged during the growing season, you must 
provide notice at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you 
intend to claim an indemnity as a result of the damage previously 
reported. You must not destroy the damaged crop until the earlier of 15 
days from the date you gave notice of loss, or our written consent to do 
so. If you fail to meet the requirements of this section all such 
production will be considered undamaged and included as production to 
count.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying the result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for the variety;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2);

[[Page 261]]

    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of the variety 
(see section 12(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(5) from the result in 
section 12(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in lugs) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the 
requirements in section 11(b);
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production that meets, or would meet if properly 
handled, the California Department of Food and Agriculture minimum 
standards for table grapes; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All harvested production from insurable acreage regardless of 
condition or disposition. The quantity of production to count for table 
grape production damaged by insurable causes within the insurance period 
that is marketed for any use other than table grapes will be determined 
by multiplying the greater of (1) the value of the table grapes per ton 
or (2) $50, by the number of tons and dividing that result by the 
highest price election available for the insured unit. This result will 
be the number of lugs to count.

                     13. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

                        Dry Bean Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Actual value--The dollar value received, or that could be received, 
for contract seed beans under a seed bean processor contract if the 
contract seed bean production is properly handled in accordance with the 
requirements of such contract.
    Base price--The price per pound (excluding any discounts or 
incentives that may apply) that is stated in the seed bean processor 
contract and that will be paid to the producer for at least 50 percent 
of the total production under contract with the seed company.
    Beans--Dry beans and contract seed beans.
    Combining--A harvesting process that uses a machine to separate the 
beans from the pods and other vegetative matter and place the beans into 
a temporary storage receptacle.
    Contract seed beans--Dry beans grown under the terms of a seed bean 
processor contract for the purpose of producing seed to be used for 
producing dry beans or vegetable beans in a future crop year.
    Dry beans--The crop defined by The United States Standards for Beans 
excluding contract seed beans.
    Harvest--Combining the beans. Beans which are swathed or knifed 
prior to combining are not considered harvested.
    Local market price--The cash price per hundredweight for the U.S. 
No. 2 grade of dry beans of the insured type offered by buyers in the 
area in which you normally market the dry beans. Moisture content and 
factors not associated with grading under the United States Standards 
for Beans will not be considered in establishing this price.
    Net price--The dollar value of dry bean production received, or that 
could have been received, after reductions in value due to insurable 
causes of loss.
    Pick--The percentage, on a weight basis, of defects including 
splits, damaged (including discolored) beans, contrasting types, and 
foreign material that remains in the dry beans

[[Page 262]]

after dockage has been removed by the proper use of screens or sieves.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, beans must initially be planted in rows far enough 
apart to permit mechanical cultivation, unless otherwise provided by the 
Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.
    Practical to replant--In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
practical to replant is defined as our determination, after loss or 
damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited 
to moisture availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, 
and marketing window, that replanting the insured crop will allow the 
crop to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant after 
the end of the late planting period unless replanting is generally 
occurring in the area. For contract seed beans, it will not be 
considered practical to replant unless production from the replanted 
acreage can be delivered under the terms of the seed bean processor 
contract or the seed company agrees to accept such production.
    Seed bean processor contract--A written agreement between the 
contract seed bean producer and the seed company, containing at a 
minimum:
    (a) The contract seed bean producer's promise to plant and grow one 
or more specific varieties of contract seed beans, and deliver the 
production from those varieties to the seed company;
    (b) The seed company's promise to purchase all the production stated 
in the contract; and
    (c) A base price, or a method to determine such price based on 
published independent information, that will be paid to the contract 
seed bean producer for the production stated in the contract.
    Seed company--Any business enterprise regularly engaged in the 
processing of seed beans, that possesses all licenses and permits for 
marketing seed beans required by the State in which it operates, and 
that possesses or has contracted for facilities, with enough drying, 
screening and bagging or packaging equipment to accept and process the 
seed beans within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.
    Swathing or knifing--Severance of the bean plant from the ground, 
including the pods and beans, and placing them into windrows.
    Type--A category of beans identified as a type in the Special 
Provisions.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) In addition to the definition of basic unit in section 1 of the 
Basic Provisions, all acreage of contract seed beans qualifies as a 
separate basic unit. For production based seed bean processor contracts, 
the basic unit will consist of all the acreage needed to produce the 
amount of production under contract, based on the actual production 
history of the acreage. For acreage based seed bean processor contracts, 
the basic unit will consist of all acreage specified in the contract.
    (b) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated acreage as provided in the unit division provisions 
contained in the Basic Provisions, a separate optional unit may be 
established for each bean type shown in the Special Provisions.
    (c) Contract seed beans may qualify for optional units only if the 
seed bean processor contract specifies the number of acres under 
contract. Contract seed beans produced under a seed bean processor 
contract that specifies only an amount of production or a combination of 
acreage and production, are not eligible for optional units.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3(b) (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may select only one price 
election for all the dry beans in the county insured under this policy 
unless the Special Provisions provide different price elections by type, 
in which case you may select one price election for each dry bean type 
designated in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for 
each type are not required to have the same percentage relationship to 
the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you 
choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may 
also choose 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type.
    (b) For contract seed beans only, the dollar amount of insurance is 
obtained by multiplying the production guarantee per acre for each 
variety in the unit by the insured acreage of that variety, times the 
applicable base price, and times the price election percentage you 
selected. The total of these results will be the amount of insurance for 
contract seed beans in the unit.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions, the contract change date is November 30 (December 17 for the 
1998 crop year only) preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the

[[Page 263]]

Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and termination dates 
are:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   State and county                                Cancellation and termination  dates
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
California............................................                                              February 28.
All other States......................................                                                 March 15.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          6. Report of Acreage

    For contract seed beans only, in addition to the requirements of 
section 6 (Report of Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you 
must submit a copy of the seed bean processor contract on or before the 
acreage reporting date.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic 
Provisions(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the beans in the 
county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are planted for harvest as:
    (i) Dry beans; or
    (ii) If applicable, contract seed beans, if the seed bean processor 
contract is executed on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (3) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) For contract seed beans only:
    (1) An instrument in the form of a ``lease'' under which you retain 
control of the acreage on which the insured crop is grown and that 
provides for delivery of the crop under substantially the same terms as 
a seed bean processor contract may be treated as a contract under which 
you have an insurable interest in the crop; and
    (2) We will not insure any acreage of contract seed beans produced 
by a seed company.
    (c) In addition to the types of dry beans designated in the Special 
Provisions, we will insure other types if:
    (1) The type you intend to plant has been demonstrated to be adapted 
to the area. Evidence of adaptability must include:
    (i) Results of test plots for 2 years and recommendations by a 
university or seed company; or
    (ii) Two years of production reports that indicate your experience 
producing the type in your production area;
    (2) You submit on or before the sales closing date your production 
reports and prices received, or the test plot results, and evidence of 
market potential, including the price buyers are willing to pay for the 
type; and
    (3) Both parties (you and us) enter into a written agreement 
allowing insurance on the type in accordance with section 18 of the 
Basic Provisions.
    (d) Any acreage of beans that is destroyed and replanted to a 
different insurable type of beans will be considered insured acreage in 
accordance with section 11.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation 
requirements contained in the Special Provisions; or
    (b) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that the majority of growers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that replanting is not practical. We will not require you to 
replant if it is not practical to replant to the same type of beans as 
originally planted.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the calendar date for the end of 
the insurance period is the date immediately following planting as 
follows:
    (a) October 15 in Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas;
    (b) November 15 in California; and
    (c) October 31 in all other States.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or

[[Page 264]]

    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.

                         11. Replanting Payments

    (a) In accordance with section 13 (Replanting Payment) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), a replanting payment is allowed if the bean 
crop is damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the 
remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production 
guarantee for the acreage and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of 10 percent of the production guarantee for the type to be 
replanted or 120 pounds multiplied by your price election for the type 
to be replanted and by your insured share.
    (c) When beans are replanted using a practice that is uninsurable as 
an original planting, the liability for the unit will be reduced by the 
amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be 
reduced.
    (d) The guarantee and premium for acreage replanted to a different 
insurable type will be based on the replanted type and will be 
calculated in accordance with sections 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage 
Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) and 7 (Annual Premium) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) and section 3 of these Crop 
Provisions.

                12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), 
representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet 
wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples 
must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection 
or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.

                         13. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage to your bean crop covered by this 
policy, we will settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage of each dry bean type by its 
respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 13(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each insured type;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the insured acreage of each contract seed bean type 
by its respective production guarantee;
    (5 ) Multiplying each result in section 13(b)(4) by the applicable 
base price;
    (6) Multiplying each result in section 13(b)(5) by your selected 
price election percentage;
    (7) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(6);
    (8) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(3) and section 13(b)(6);
    (9) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each dry bean 
type if applicable, (see section 13(d)) by the respective price 
election;
    (10) Totaling the value of all contract seed bean production (see 
section 13(c));
    (11) Totaling the results in section 13(b)(9) and section 13(b)(10);
    (12) Subtracting the total in section 13(b)(11) from the total in 
section 13(b)(8); and
    (13) Multiplying the result by your share.
    (c) The value of contract seed bean production to count for each 
type in the unit will be determined as follows:
    (1) For production meeting the minimum quality requirements 
contained in the seed bean processor contract and for production that 
does not meet such requirements due to uninsured causes:
    (i) Multiplying the actual value or base price per pound, whichever 
is greater, by the price election percentage you selected; and
    (ii) Multiplying the result by the number of pounds of such 
production.
    (2) For production not meeting the minimum quality requirements 
contained in the seed bean processor contract due to insurable causes:
    (i) Multiplying the actual value by the price election percentage 
you selected; and
    (ii) Multiplying the result by the number of pounds of such 
production.
    (d) The total bean production to count (in pounds) from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production of dry 
beans may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in 
accordance with section 13(e)); and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or

[[Page 265]]

abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon 
such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you 
put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the 
appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (e) Mature dry bean production to count may be adjusted for excess 
moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, 
it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality. Adjustment for 
excess moisture and quality deficiencies will not be applicable to 
contract seed beans.
    (1) Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 
percentage point of moisture in excess of 18 percent. We may obtain 
samples of the production to determine the moisture content.
    (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) A pick is designated in the Special Provisions and the pick of 
the damaged production exceeds this designation; or
    (ii) A pick is not designated in the Special Provisions and 
deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the United States Standards 
for Beans, result in dry beans not meeting the grade requirements for 
U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. No. 3 or worse) because the beans are damaged or 
badly damaged; or
    (iii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by 
the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of 
the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop 
provisions and which occurs within the insurance period;
    (ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net 
price for the damaged production that is less than the local market 
price;
    (iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us;
    (iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, 
which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed 
by:
    (A) A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse 
operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or
    (C) A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    (4) Dry bean production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in sections 13(e) (2) and (3), will be reduced:
    (i) If a conversion factor is designated by the Special Provisions, 
by multiplying the number of pounds of eligible production by the 
conversion factor designated in the Special Provisions for the 
applicable grade or pick; or
    (ii) If a conversion factor is not designated by the Special 
Provisions as follows:
    (A) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the 
local market price will be determined on the earlier of the date such 
quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for 
the unit. If a local market price is not available for the insured crop 
year, the current years' maximum price election available for the 
applicable type will be used. The price for the qualifying damaged 
production will be the market price for the local area to the extent 
feasible. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. If we 
obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local market 
area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required to 
deliver the dry beans to those buyers. Discounts used to establish the 
net price of the damaged production will be limited to those that are 
usual, customary, and reasonable. The price of the damaged production 
will not be reduced for:
    (1) Moisture content;
    (2) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
    (3) Drying, handling, processing, including trading tare for grade 
to obtain a higher

[[Page 266]]

grade and price, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, 
handling, and marketing of the dry beans; except, if the price of the 
damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may reduce the 
price of the production after it has been conditioned by the cost of 
conditioning but not lower than the value of the production before 
conditioning;
    (B) The value per pound of the damaged or conditioned production 
will be divided by the local market price to determine the quality 
adjustment factor; and
    (C) The number of pounds remaining after any reduction due to 
excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross pounds (if appropriate)) 
of the damaged or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the 
quality adjustment factor to determine the net production to count.
    (f) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop 
may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

                         14. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

<R05>
Sec. 457.151  Forage seeding crop insurance provisions.

    The Forage Seeding Crop Insurance Provisions for 2003 and succeeding 
crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies:

                     Forage Seeding Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Crop year--The period within which the planting is or normally would 
become established and shall be designated by the calendar year in which 
the planting is made for spring planted acreage and the next succeeding 
calendar year for fall planted acreage.
    Fall planted--A forage crop seeded after June 30.
    Forage--Planted perennial alfalfa, perennial red clover, perennial 
grasses, or a mixture thereof, or other species, as shown in the 
actuarial documents.
    Good farming practices--The cultural practices generally in use in 
the county for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and 
produce a normal stand, and are those recognized by the Cooperative 
State Research, Education, and Extension Service as compatible with 
agronomic and weather conditions in the county.
    Harvest. Severance of the forage plant from its roots. Acreage that 
is only grazed will not be considered harvested.
    Normal stand--A population of live plants per square foot that meets 
the minimum required number of plants as shown in the Special 
Provisions.
    Nurse Crop (companion crop)--A crop seeded into the same acreage as 
another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and that is 
planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is 
grown.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the provisions in section 1 of the 
Basic Provisions, land on which seed is initially spread onto the soil 
surface by any method and subsequently is mechanically incorporated into 
the soil in a timely manner and at the proper depth will be considered 
planted, unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial 
documents, or written agreement.
    Replanting--Performing the cultural practices necessary to prepare 
the land for replacing of the forage seed and then replacing the forage 
seed in the insured acreage with the expectation of producing a normal 
stand. Replacing new seed into an existing damaged stand, which results 
in a reduced seeding rate from the original seeding rate, will not be 
considered replanting.
    Sales closing date--In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic 
Provisions, a date contained in the Special Provisions by which an 
application must be filed and by which you may change your crop 
insurance coverage for a crop year. If the Special Provisions provide a 
sales closing date for both fall seeded and spring seeded practices for 
the insured crop and you plant any insurable fall seeded acreage, you 
may not change your crop insurance coverage after the fall sales closing 
date for the fall seeded practice.
    Spring planted--A forage crop seeded before July 1.

                            2. Unit Division

    A basic unit, as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, will 
also be divided into

[[Page 267]]

additional basic units by spring planted and fall planted acreage.

                         3. Amounts of Insurance

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance 
Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you may only select one coverage 
level and the corresponding amount of insurance designated in the 
actuarial documents for the applicable type and practice for all the 
forage seeding in the county that is insured under this policy. The 
amount of insurance you choose for each type and practice must have the 
same percentage relationship to the maximum amount of insurance offered 
by us for each type and practice. For example, if you choose 100 percent 
of the maximum amount of insurance for a specific type and practice, you 
must also choose 100 percent of the maximum amount of insurance for all 
other types and practices.
    (b) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 
(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), do not apply to 
forage seeding.

                          4. Contract Changes.

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date for counties 
with a March 15 cancellation date and April 30 preceding the 
cancellation date for all other counties.

                 5. Cancellation and Termination Dates.

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   Cancellation and
              State and county                    termination dates
------------------------------------------------------------------------
California, Nevada, New Hampshire, New       July 31.
 York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota counties
 for which the Special Provisions designate
 both fall and spring final planting dates,
 and Vermont.
South Dakota counties for which the Special  March 15.
 Provisions designate only a spring final
 planting date, and all other states.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          6. Report of Acreage.

    In lieu of the provisions of section 6(a) of the Basic Provisions, a 
report of all insured acreage of forage seeding must be submitted on or 
before each forage seeding acreage report date specified in the Special 
Provisions.

                             7. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the forage in the county for 
which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is planted during the current crop year, or replanted 
during the calendar year following planting, to establish a normal stand 
of forage;
    (c) That is not grown with the intent to be grazed, or not grazed at 
any time during the insurance period; and
    (d) That is not interplanted with another crop, except nurse crops, 
unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.

                          8. Insurable Acreage.

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) In California counties Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Shasta, Siskiyou and 
all other states, any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the 
final planting date, to the extent that such acreage has less than 75 
percent of a normal stand, must be replanted unless we agree that it is 
not practical to replant; and
    (b) In California, unless otherwise specified in the Special 
Provisions, any acreage of the insured crop damaged anytime during the 
crop year to the extent that such acreage has less than 75 percent of a 
normal stand must be replanted unless it cannot be replanted and reach a 
normal stand within the insurance period.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) regarding when insurance ends, forage 
seeding insurance will end at the earliest of:
    (a) Total destruction of the insured crop on the unit;
    (b) The initial harvest of the unit, if a late harvest date is not 
listed in the Special Provisions;
    (c) The first harvest after the late harvest date, if a late harvest 
date is specified in the Special Provisions. You may harvest the crop as 
often as practical in accordance with good farming practices on or 
before the late harvest date.
    (d) Final adjustment of a loss on a unit;
    (e) Abandonment of the insured crop;
    (f) The date grazing commences on the insured crop; or
    (g) The following calendar dates:

    (i) Fall planted acreage in all California counties except
    Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Shasta and Siskiyou--November 30;
    (ii) Spring planted acreage in Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Shasta and 
Siskiyou Counties California, Colorado, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, 
Utah and Washington--April 14;
    (iii) Spring planted acreage in all other states--May 21;
    (iv) Fall planted acreage in Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Shasta and 
Siskiyou Counties California and all other states--October 15;
    (2) During the calendar year of seeding for spring planted acreage 
in all California counties except Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Shasta and 
Siskiyou--November 30.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes that result in loss of, or failure to establish, a 
stand of forage that occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.

                         11. Replanting Payment

    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 13 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) A replanting payment is allowed if:
    (1) In California, unless specified otherwise in the Special 
Provisions, acreage planted to the insured crop is damaged by an 
insurable cause of loss occurring within the insurance period to the 
extent that less than 75 percent of a normal stand remains and the crop 
can reach maturity before the end of the insurance period;
    (2) In Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Shasta, Siskiyou Counties, California, 
and all other states:
    (i) A replanting payment is allowed only whenever the Special 
Provisions designate both fall and spring final planting dates;
    (ii) The insured fall planted acreage is damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss to the extent that less than 75 percent of a normal stand 
remains;
    (iii) It is practical to replant;
    (iv) We give written consent to replant; and
    (v) Such acreage is replanted the following spring by the spring 
planting date.
    (b) The amount of the replanting payment will be equal to 50 percent 
of the amount of indemnity determined in accordance with section 13 
unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.
    (c) No replanting payment will be made on acreage for which one 
replanting payment has been allowed.
    (d) If the information reported by you on the acreage report results 
in a lower premium than the actual premium determined to be due based on 
the acreage, share, practice, or type determined actually to have 
existed, the replanting payment will be reduced proportionately.

                12. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the 
representative samples of the crop must be at least 10 feet wide and 
extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples must not 
be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 days 
after tilling of the balance of the unit is completed.
    (b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the 
Event of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), you must 
give us written notice if, during the period before destroying the crop 
on any fall planted acreage that is damaged, you decide to replant the 
acreage by the spring final planting date.

                        13. Settlement of Claim.

    (a) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage of each type and practice by the 
amount of insurance for the applicable type and practice;
    (2) Totaling the results in section 13(a)(1);
    (3) Multiplying the total acres with an established stand for the 
insured acreage of each type and practice in the unit by the amount of 
insurance for the applicable type and practice;
    (4) Totaling the results in section 13(a)(3);
    (5) Subtracting the result in section 13(a)(4) from the result in 
section 13(a)(2); and
    (6) Multiplying the result in section 13(a)(5) by your share.
    Example: Assume you have 100 percent share in 30 acres of type A 
forage in the unit, with an amount of insurance of $100.00 per acre. At 
the time of loss, the following findings are established: 10 acres had a 
remaining stand of 75 percent or greater. You also have 20 acres of type 
B forage in the unit, with an amount of insurance of $90.00 per acre. 10 
acres had a remaining stand of 75

[[Page 269]]

percent or greater. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    1. 30 acres x $100.00 = $3,000 amount of insurance for type A; 20 
acres x $90.00 = $1,800 amount of insurance for type B;
    2. $3,000 + $1,800 = $4,800 total amount of insurance;
    3. 10 acres with 75% stand or greater x $100.00 = $1,000 production 
to count for type A: 10 acres with 75% stand or greater x $90.00 = $900 
production to count for type B;
    4. $1,000 + $900 = $1,900 total production to count;
    5. $4,800-$1,900 = $2,900 loss;
    6. $2,900 x 100 percent share = $2,900 indemnity payment.
    (b) The acres with an established stand will include:
    (1) Acreage that has at least 75 percent of a normal stand;
    (2) Acreage abandoned or put to another use without our prior 
written consent;
    (3) Acreage damaged solely by an uninsured cause; or
    (4) Acreage that is harvested and not reseeded.
    (c) The amount of indemnity on any spring planted acreage determined 
in accordance with section 13(a) will be reduced 50 percent if the stand 
is less than 75 percent but more than 55 percent of a normal stand.

                     14. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

Sec. 457.152  Hybrid seed corn crop insurance provisions.

    The Hybrid Seed Corn Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1998 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured policies

                    Hybrid Seed Corn Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions, (Sec. 457.8) with (1) 
controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Adjusted yield. An amount determined by multiplying the county yield 
by the coverage level factor.
    Amount of insurance per acre. A dollar amount determined by 
multiplying the adjusted yield by the price election you select and 
subtracting any minimum guaranteed payment, not to exceed the total 
compensation specified in the hybrid seed corn processor contract. If 
your hybrid seed corn processor contract contains a minimum guaranteed 
payment that is stated in bushels, we will convert that value to dollars 
by multiplying it by the price election you selected.
    Approved yield. In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic 
Provisions, an amount FCIC determines to be representative of the yield 
that the female parent plants are expected to produce when grown under a 
specific production practice. FCIC will establish the approved yield 
based upon records provided by the seed company and other information it 
deems appropriate.
    Bushel. Fifty-six pounds avoirdupois of shelled corn, 70 pound 
avoirdupois of ear corn, or the number of pounds determined under the 
seed company's normal conversion chart when that chart is used to 
determine the approved yield and the claim for indemnity.
    Certified seed test. A warm germination test performed on clean seed 
according to specifications of the ``Rules for Testing Seeds'' of the 
Association of Official Seed Analysts.
    Commercial hybrid seed corn. The offspring produced by crossing a 
male and female parent plant, each having a different genetic character. 
This offspring is the product intended for use by an agricultural 
producer to produce a commercial field corn crop for grain.
    County yield. An amount contained in the actuarial documents that is 
established by FCIC to represent the yield that a producer of hybrid 
seed corn would be expected to produce if the acreage had been planted 
to commercial field corn.
    Coverage level factor. A factor contained in the Special Provisions 
to adjust the county yield for commercial field corn to reflect the 
higher value of hybrid seed corn.
    Dollar value per bushel. An amount that determines the value of any 
seed production to count. It is determined by dividing the amount of 
insurance per acre by the result of multiplying the approved yield by 
the coverage level percentage, expressed as a decimal.

[[Page 270]]

    Female parent plants. Corn plants that are grown for the purpose of 
producing commercial hybrid seed corn and have had the stamens removed 
or are otherwise male sterile.
    Field run. Commercial hybrid seed corn production before it has been 
dried, screened, or processed.
    Good farming practices. In addition to the definition contained in 
the Basic Provisions, good farming practices include those practices 
required by the hybrid seed corn processor contract.
    Harvest. Combining, threshing or picking ears from the female parent 
plants to obtain commercial hybrid seed corn.
    Hybrid seed corn processor contract. An agreement executed between 
the hybrid seed corn crop producer and a seed company containing, at a 
minimum:
    (a) The producer's promise to plant and grow male and female parent 
plants, and to deliver all commercial hybrid seed corn produced from 
such plants to the seed company;
    (b) The seed company's promise to purchase the commercial hybrid 
seed corn produced by the producer; and
    (c) Either a fixed price per unit of measure (bushels, 
hundredweight, etc.) of the commercial hybrid seed corn or a formula to 
determine the value of such seed. Any formula for establishing the value 
must be based on data provided by a public third party that establishes 
or provides pricing information to the general public, based on prices 
paid in the open market (e.g., commodity futures exchanges), to be 
acceptable for the purpose of this policy.
    Inadequate germination. Germination of less than 80 percent of the 
commercial hybrid seed corn as determined by using a certified seed 
test.
    Insurable interest. Your share of the financial loss that occurs in 
the event seed production is damaged by a cause of loss specified in 
section 10.
    Local market price. The cash price offered by buyers for any 
production from the female parent plants that is not considered 
commercial hybrid seed corn under the terms of this policy.
    Male parent plants. Corn plants grown for the purpose of pollinating 
female parent plants.
    Minimum guaranteed payment. A minimum amount (usually stated in 
dollars or bushels) specified in your hybrid seed corn processor 
contract that will be paid or credited to you by the seed company 
regardless of the quantity of seed produced.
    Non-seed production. Production that does not qualify as seed 
production because of inadequate germination.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, the insured crop must be planted in rows wide enough 
to permit mechanical cultivation, unless otherwise provided by the 
Special Provisions or by written agreement.
    Planting pattern. The arrangement of the rows of the male and female 
parent plants in a field. An example of a planting pattern is four 
consecutive rows of female parent plants followed by two consecutive 
rows of male parent plants.
    Practical to replant. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, practical to replant applies to either the female or 
male parent plant. It will not be considered practical to replant unless 
production from the replanted acreage can be delivered under the terms 
of the hybrid seed corn processor contract, or the seed company agrees 
that it will accept the production from the replanted acreage.
    Prevented planting. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, prevented planting applies to the female and male 
parent plants. The male parent plants must be planted in accordance with 
the requirements of the hybrid seed corn processor contract to be 
considered planted.
    Sample. For the purpose of the certified seed test, at least 3 
pounds of randomly selected field run shelled corn for each variety of 
commercial hybrid seed corn grown on the unit.
    Seed company. A business enterprise that possesses all licenses for 
marketing commercial hybrid seed corn required by the state in which it 
is domiciled or operates, and which possesses facilities with enough 
storage and drying capacity to accept and process the insured crop 
within a reasonable amount of time after harvest. If the seed company is 
the insured, it must also be a corporation.
    Seed production. All seed produced by female parent plants with a 
germination rate of at least 80 percent as determined by a certified 
seed test.
    Shelled corn. Kernels that have been removed from the cob.
    Variety. The name, number or code assigned to a specific genetic 
cross by the seed company or the Special Provisions for the insured crop 
in the county.

                            2. Unit Division

    For any processor contract that stipulates the amount of production 
to be delivered:
    (a) In lieu of the definition of ``basic unit'' contained in the 
Basic Provisions, a basic unit will consist of all acreage planted to 
the insured crop in the county that will be used to fulfill a hybrid 
seed corn processor contract;
    (b) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production 
contracted with each processor contract;
    (c) In accordance with section 12, all production from any basic 
unit in excess of the amount under contract will be included as 
production to count if such production is applied to any other basic 
unit for which the

[[Page 271]]

contracted amount has not been fulfilled; and
    (d) Optional units will not be established.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions, you may select only one price election for all the hybrid 
seed corn in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by variety, in which case 
you may select one price election for each hybrid seed corn variety 
designated in the Special Provisions. The price election you choose for 
each variety must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum 
price offered by us for each variety. For example, if you choose 100 
percent of the maximum price election for one specific variety, you must 
also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other 
varieties.
    (b) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of 
the Basic Provisions are not applicable to this contract.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must:
    (a) Report by type and variety, the location and insurable acreage 
of the insured crop;
    (b) Report any acreage that is uninsured, including that portion of 
the total acreage occupied by male parent plants; and
    (c) Certify that you have a hybrid seed corn processor contract and 
report the amount, if any, of any minimum guaranteed payment.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the female parent plants in the county for which a 
premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are grown under a hybrid seed corn processor contract 
executed before the acreage reporting date;
    (3) That are planted for harvest as commercial hybrid seed corn in 
accordance with the requirements of the hybrid seed corn processor 
contract and the production management practices of the seed company; 
and
    (4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Planted with a mixture of female and male parent seed in the 
same row;
    (ii) Planted for any purpose other than for commercial hybrid seed 
corn;
    (iii) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (iv) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) An instrument in the form of a ``lease'' under which you retain 
control of the acreage on which the insured crop is grown and that 
provides for delivery of the crop under substantially the same terms as 
a hybrid seed corn processor contract will be treated as a contract 
under which you have an insurable interest in the crop.
    (c) A commercial hybrid seed corn producer who is also a seed 
company may be able to insure the hybrid seed corn crop if the following 
requirements are met:
    (1) The seed company has an insurable interest in the hybrid seed 
corn crop;
    (2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors of the 
seed company has executed and adopted a corporate resolution that 
contains the same terms as a hybrid seed corn processor contract. This 
corporate resolution will be considered a contract under this policy;
    (3) Sales records for at least the previous years' seed production 
must be provided to confirm that the seed company has produced and sold 
seed. If such records are not available, the crop may be insured under 
the Coarse Grains Crop Provisions with a written agreement; and
    (4) Our inspection reveals that the storage and drying facilities 
satisfy the definition of a seed company.
    (d) Any of the insured crop that is under contract with different 
seed companies may be insured under separate policies with different 
insurance providers provided all acreage of the insured crop in the 
county is insured. If you elect to insure the insured crop with 
different insurance providers, you agree to pay separate administrative 
fees for each insurance policy.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, 
we will not insure any acreage of the insured crop:
    (a) Planted and occupied exclusively by male parent plants;
    (b) Not in compliance with the rotation requirements contained in 
the Special Provisions or, if applicable, required by the hybrid seed 
corn processor contract; or
    (c) If either the female or male parent plants are damaged before 
the final planting date and we determine that the insured crop is 
practical to replant but it is not replanted.

[[Page 272]]

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance attaches upon completion of planting of:
    (1) The female parent plant seed on or before the final planting 
date designated in the Special Provisions, except as allowed in section 
16 of the Basic Provisions; and
    (2) The male parent plant seed.
    (b) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the 
October 31 immediately following planting.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in section 10(a) (1) through (7) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due 
to:
    (1) The use of unadapted, incompatible, or genetically deficient 
male or female parent plant seed;
    (2) Frost or freeze after the date established by the Special 
Provisions;
    (3) Failure to follow the requirements stated in the hybrid seed 
corn processor contract and production management practices of the seed 
company;
    (4) Inadequate germination, even if resulting from an insured cause 
of loss, unless you have provided adequate notice as required by section 
11(b)(1); or
    (5) Failure to plant the male parent plant seed at a time or in a 
manner sufficient to assure adequate pollination of the female parent 
plants, unless you are prevented from planting the male parent plant 
seed by an insured cause of loss.

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must leave representative samples of at least one 
complete planting pattern of the female and male parent plant rows that 
extend the entire length of each field in the unit. If you are going to 
destroy any acreage of the insured crop that will not be harvested, the 
samples must not be destroyed until after our inspection.
    (b) In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) You must give us notice of probable loss at least 15 days before 
the beginning of harvest if you anticipate inadequate germination on any 
unit; and
    (2) You must provide a completed copy of your hybrid seed corn 
processor contract unless we have determined it has already been 
provided by the seed company, and the seed company certifies that such 
contract is used for all its growers without any waivers or amendments.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) You will not receive an indemnity payment on a unit if the seed 
company refuses to provide us with records we require to determine the 
dollar value per bushel of production for each variety.
    (c) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective amount of 
insurance per acre, by type and variety if applicable;
    (2) Totaling the results of section 12(c)(1) if there are more than 
one type or variety;
    (3) Multiplying the total seed production to count (see section 
12(d)) for each type and variety of commercial hybrid seed corn by the 
applicable dollar value per bushel for that type or variety;
    (4) Multiplying the total non-seed production to count (see section 
12(e)) for each type and variety by the applicable local market price 
determined on the earlier of the date the non-seed production is sold or 
the date of final inspection;
    (5) Totaling the results of sections 12(c)(3) and 12(c)(4) by type 
and variety;
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 12(c)(5) from the result of 
section 12(c)(1) if there is only one type or variety, or subtracting 
the result of 12(c)(5) from the result of section 12(c)(2) if there are 
more than one type or variety; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(c)(6) by your share. For 
example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the development 
of variety ``A'' hybrid seed corn in the unit, with an amount of

[[Page 273]]

insurance per acre guarantee of $340 (county yield of 160 bushels times 
a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent coverage level, times 
a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the minimum guaranteed 
payment of zero). Your seed production was 1,400 bushels and the dollar 
value per bushel was $9.80. Your non-seed production was 100 bushels 
with a local market value of $2.00 per bushel. Your indemnity would be 
calculated as follows:
    (1) 50 acres x $340 = $17,000 amount of insurance guarantee;
    (3) 1,400 bushels x $9.80 = $13,720 value of seed production;
    (4) 100 bushel of non-seed x $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production;
    (5) $13,720 + $200 = $13,920;
    (6) $17,000 - $13,920 = $3,080; and
    (7) $3,080 x 100 percent share = $3,080 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres insured for the 
development of variety ``B'' hybrid seed corn in the unit, with an 
amount of insurance per acre guarantee of $297 (county yield of 140 
bushels times a coverage level factor of .867 for the 65 percent 
coverage level, times a price election of $2.45 per bushel, minus the 
minimum guaranteed payment of zero). You harvested 1,200 bushels and the 
dollar value per bushel for the harvested amount was $8.56. You also 
harvested 200 bushels of non-seed with a market value of $2.00 per 
bushel. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 50 acres x $340 = $17,000 amount of insurance guarantee for type 
``A'' and 50 acres x $297 = $14,850 amount of insurance guarantee for 
type ``B'';
    (2) $17,000 + $14,850 = $31,850 amount of insurance guarantee;
    (3) 1,400 bushels x $9.80 = $13,720 value of seed production for 
type ``A'' and 1,200 bushels x $8.56 = $10,272 value of seed production 
for type ``B'';
    (4) 100 bushels of non-seed x $2.00 = $200 of non-seed production 
for type ``A'' and 200 bushels of non-seed x $2.00 = $400 of non-seed 
production for type ``B'';
    (5) $13,720 + $200 + $10,272 + $400 = $24,592 value of production to 
count;
    (6) $31,850 - $24,592 = $7,258; and
    (7) $7,258 x 100 percent share = $7,258 indemnity payment.
    (d) Production to be counted as seed production will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the amount of insurance per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Mature unharvested production with a germination rate of at 
least 80 percent of the commercial hybrid seed corn as determined by a 
certified seed test. Any such production may be adjusted in accordance 
with section 12(f);
    (iv) Immature appraised production;
    (v) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) Harvested production that you deliver as commercial hybrid seed 
corn to the seed company stated in your hybrid seed corn processor 
contract, regardless of quality, unless the production has inadequate 
germination.
    (e) Production to be counted as non-seed production will include all 
harvested or mature appraised production that does not qualify as seed 
production to count as specified in section 12(d). Any such production 
may be adjusted in accordance with section 12(f).
    (f) For the purpose of determining the quantity of mature 
production:
    (1) Shelled commercial hybrid seed corn will be:
    (i) Increased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture 
below 15 percent; or
    (ii) Decreased 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of 
moisture in excess of 15 percent.
    (2) The weight of ear corn required to equal one bushel of shelled 
seed corn will be increased 1.5 pounds for each full percentage point of 
moisture in excess of 14 percent, and

[[Page 274]]

any portion of a percentage point will be disregarded. The moisture 
content of ear corn will be determined from a shelled sample of the ear 
corn.
    (3) When records of commercial hybrid seed corn production provided 
by the seed company have been adjusted to a shelled corn basis of 15.0 
percent moisture and 56 pound avoirdupois bushels, sections 12(f)(1) and 
(2) above will not apply to harvested production. In such cases, records 
of the seed company will be used to determine the amount of production 
to count, provided that the moisture and weight of such production are 
calculated on the same basis as that used to determine the approved 
yield.

                         13. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 50 percent of your amount 
of insurance for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, 
and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting 
coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

Sec. 457.153  Peach crop insurance provisions.

    The Peach Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2001 and succeeding crop 
years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                          Peach Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Actual price per bushel for:
    (a) Fresh peaches means the average price per bushel of U.S. Extra 
No. 1 ``2-inch'' peaches (if not available, the next larger size for 
which a price is available) determined from applicable prices reported 
by the Market News Service of the United States Department of 
Agriculture for seven consecutive marketing days, commencing with the 
day harvest of the variety begins. In the absence of FOB shipping point 
price from the Market News Service, the price per bushel of U.S. Extra 
No. 1 ``2-inch'' peaches will be the total of the price election and 
allowable costs for the undamaged peaches; and
    (b) Processing peaches means the average price per bushel received 
from the processor for that applicable variety determined for seven 
consecutive marketing days, commencing with the day harvest of the 
variety begins.
    Bearing tree. A tree in at least the 4th growing season after set 
out.
    Bushel. Fifty pounds of ungraded peaches.
    Direct marketing. Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, or permitting the general public to enter the field for the 
purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Harvest. The picking or removal of mature peaches from the trees 
either by hand or machine.
    Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any 
form of alternating or mixed pattern.
    Loss in quality. When the crop is damaged to the extent that the 
producer does not receive the average price for U.S. Extra No. 1 peach.
    Marketable. Peach production acceptable for processing or other 
human consumption even if failing to meet any U.S. or applicable state 
grading standard.
    Packing shed. A facility at which peaches are graded, packed and 
cooled in preparation for shipment to a wholesale market.
    Set out. Transplanting the tree into the orchard.

  2. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the peaches in 
the county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions 
provide different price elections by type, in which case you may select 
one price election for each peach type (fresh or processing) designated 
in the Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type 
must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered 
by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the 
maximum price election for one type, you must choose 100 percent of the 
maximum price election for all other types.
    (b) You must report, not later than the production reporting date 
designated in section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and 
Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), by type if applicable:

[[Page 275]]

    (1) Any damage, removal of or addition of trees, or change in 
practices, or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield 
below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the 
number of affected acres;
    (2) The number of bearing and non-bearing trees on insurable and 
uninsurable acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees, variety, type, and the planting pattern; 
and
    (4) For the first year of insurance, acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
is changed:
    (i) The age of the crop that is interplanted with the peaches;
    (ii) The variety, and type if applicable;
    (iii) The planting pattern; and
    (iv) Any other reasonable and pertinent information that we request 
in order to establish your approved yield.
    We will adjust the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of interplanting a 
perennial crop; removal or addition of trees or varieties of trees; 
physical or structural tree damage; a change in practices or changes in 
tree population and density, and any other circumstance affecting the 
yield potential of the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any 
circumstance that may affect your yields from previous levels, we will 
adjust your production guarantee as necessary at any time we become 
aware of the circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

                           3. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding 
the cancellation date.

                  4. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are November 20.

                             5. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the peaches in the county for 
which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown on tree varieties that:
    (1) Were commercially available when the trees were set out;
    (2) Are a variety having a chilling hour requirement that is 
appropriate for the area;
    (3) Are grown on a root stock that is adapted to the area.
    (c) That the crop insured will be any of the types or varieties of 
peaches that are grown for the production of Fresh or Processing Peaches 
(except Processing Peaches excluded in California) on insured acreage 
and for which a guarantee and premium rate are provided by the Actuarial 
Table.
    (d) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us; and
    (e) That has reached at least the fourth growing season after set 
out. However, we may agree in writing to insure acreage that has not 
reached this age if it has produced at least 100 bushels of peaches per 
acre.

                          6. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, peaches interplanted with another 
perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine 
that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           7. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on November 21 of each crop year, except that 
for the year of application, if your application is received after 
November 11 but prior to November 21, insurance will attach on the 10th 
day after your properly completed application is received in our local 
office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 10-day period and 
determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must 
provide any information that we require for the crop to determine the 
condition of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is September 30.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable interest on any acreage of 
peaches on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year and

[[Page 276]]

if the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, insurance will 
not be considered to have attached, and no premium or indemnity will be 
due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (d) If your peach policy is canceled or terminated for any crop 
year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance 
attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and 
termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered 
to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, 
or indemnity will be due for such crop year.

                            8. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Earthquake;
    (4) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (5) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (6) Volcanic eruption;
    (7) Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken;
    (8) An insufficient number of chilling hours to effectively break 
dormancy; or
    (9) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Split pits, regardless of cause; or
    (2) Inability to market the peaches for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                9. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), and unless the 
insurance period has ended prior to each of the following events, the 
following will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within three days of the date that harvest of 
the damaged variety should have started if the crop will not be 
harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing unless you have records 
verifying that the direct market peaches were ``weighed and graded'' 
through a packing shed. Failure to give timely notice that production 
will be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count not less than the production guarantee per acre if 
such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
    (c) If you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of 
the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), and if you intend to claim an 
indemnity on any unit, you must notify us at least 15 days prior to the 
beginning of harvest of the damaged variety, so that we may inspect the 
damaged production. You must not sell or dispose of the damaged crop 
until after we have given you written consent to do so.
    (d) If you fail to meet the requirements of this section and such 
failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, all 
such production will be considered undamaged and included as production 
to count.

                         10. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type, if applicable, by 
its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 10(b)(1) by the respective 
price election;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 10(b)(2);

[[Page 277]]

    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted by type, if 
applicable, (see subsection 10(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 10(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the total in section 10(b)(5) from the total in 
section 10(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 10(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in bushels) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production will be determined as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) From which production is sold by direct marketing if you fail to 
meet the requirements contained in section 9;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production;
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
adequately care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the 
claim will be used to determine the production to count; and
    (v) Any appraised production on insured acreage will be considered 
production to count unless such production is exceeded by the actual 
harvested production.
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (3) Mature marketable peach production may be reduced as a result of 
a loss in quality due to an insured cause of loss. The amount of 
production to count for such peaches will be determined as follows:
    (i) Peaches grown for fresh use by:
    (A) Dividing the value of the damaged peaches by the actual price 
for undamaged peaches; and
    (B) Multiplying the result of section 10(c)(3)(i)(A) by the number 
of bushels of the eligible damaged peaches.
    (ii) Peaches grown for processing by:
    (A) Dividing the value of the damaged peaches by the actual price of 
undamaged peaches for processing; and
    (B) Multiplying the result of section 10(c)(3)(ii)(A) by the number 
of bushels of the eligible damaged peaches.
    (4) Peaches that cannot be marketed due to insurable causes will not 
be considered production to count.

                     11. Late and Prevented Planting

    the late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

Sec. 457.154  Processing sweet corn crop insurance provisions.

    The Processing Sweet Corn Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1998 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                  Processing Sweet Corn Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Base contract price. The price stipulated on the processor contract 
without regard to discounts or incentives that may apply.
    Bypassed acreage. Land on which production is ready for harvest but 
the processor elects not to accept such production so it is not 
harvested.
    Good farming practices. The cultural practices generally in use in 
the county for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and 
produce at least the yield used to determine the production guarantee 
and are those required by the sweet corn processor contract with the 
processing company, and recognized by the Cooperative State Research, 
Education, and Extension Service as compatible with agronomic and 
weather conditions in the county.
    Harvest. The removal of the ears from the stalks for the purpose of 
delivery to the processor.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, sweet corn must initially be placed in rows far enough 
apart to permit mechanical cultivation. Acreage planted in any other 
manner

[[Page 278]]

will not be insurable unless otherwise provided by the Special 
Provisions or by written agreement.
    Practical to replant. In lieu of the definition of Practical to 
replant contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, practical to 
replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the 
insured crop, based on factors including, but not limited to, moisture 
availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, and 
marketing window, that replanting the insured crop will allow the crop 
to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant unless 
the replanted acreage can produce at least 75 percent of the approved 
yield, and the processor agrees in writing that it will accept the 
production from the replanted acreage.
    Processor. Any business enterprise regularly engaged in canning or 
freezing processing sweet corn for human consumption, that possesses all 
licenses and permits for processing sweet corn required by the state in 
which it operates, and that possesses facilities, or has contractual 
access to such facilities, with enough equipment to accept and process 
contracted processing sweet corn within a reasonable amount of time 
after harvest.
    Processor contract. A written agreement between the producer and a 
processor, containing at a minimum:
    (a) The producer's commitment to plant and grow sweet corn, and to 
deliver the sweet corn production to the processor;
    (b) The processor's commitment to purchase all the production stated 
in the processor contract; and
    (c) A base contract price.
    Multiple contracts with the same processor that specify amounts of 
production will be considered as a single processor contract.
    Ton. Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.
    Unhusked ear weight. Weight of the seed-bearing spike of sweet corn 
including the membranous or green outer envelope.
    Usable tons. The quantity of sweet corn for which the producer is 
compensated or should have been compensated by the processor.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) For processor contracts that stipulate the amount of production 
to be delivered:
    (1) In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, a 
basic unit will consist of all acreage planted to the insured crop in 
the county that will be used to fulfill contracts with each processor;
    (i) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production 
contracted with each processor contract;
    (ii) In accordance with section 12, all production from any basic 
unit in excess of the amount under contract will be included as 
production to count if such production is applied to any other basic 
unit for which the contracted amount has not been fulfilled; and
    (2) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable.
    (b) For any processor contract that stipulates the number of acres 
to be planted, the provisions contained in section 34 of the Basic 
Provisions will apply.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the processing 
sweet corn in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by type. The percentage of 
the maximum price elections you choose for one type will be applicable 
to all other types insured under this policy.
    (b) The insurance guarantee per acre is expressed as tons of 
unhusked ear weight. Any other measured production will be converted to 
an unhusked ear weight equivalent.
    (c) The appraised production from bypassed acreage that could have 
been accepted by the processor will be included when determining your 
approved yield.
    (d) Acreage that is bypassed because it was damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss will be considered to have a zero yield when determining 
your approved yield.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, 
you must provide a copy of all processor contracts to us on or before 
the acreage reporting date.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the processing sweet corn in the county for which a 
premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;

[[Page 279]]

    (2) That is grown under, and in accordance with, the requirements of 
a processor contract executed on or before the acreage reporting date 
and not excluded from the processor contract at any time during the crop 
year; and
    (3) That is not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, 
under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which 
the sweet corn is grown, you are at risk of loss, and the processor 
contract provides for delivery of sweet corn under specified conditions 
and at a stipulated base contract price.
    (c) A commercial sweet corn producer who is also a processor may 
establish an insurable interest if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The producer must comply with these Crop Provisions;
    (2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors or 
officers of the processor must execute and adopt a resolution that 
contains the same terms as an acceptable processor contract. Such 
resolution will be considered a processor contract under this policy; 
and
    (3) Our inspection reveals that the processing facilities comply 
with the definition of a processor contained in these Crop Provisions.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that it is not practical to replant; and
    (b) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation 
requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, regarding the end of the insurance period, insurance ceases 
at the earlier of:
    (a) The date the sweet corn:
    (1) Was destroyed;
    (2) Should have been harvested but was not harvested;
    (3) Was abandoned; or
    (4) Was harvested;
    (b) The date you harvest sufficient production to fulfill your 
processor contract if the processor contract stipulates a specific 
amount of production to be delivered;
    (c) Final adjustment of a loss; or
    (d) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, the calendar date for the 
end of the insurance period in which the sweet corn would normally be 
harvested as follows:
    (1) September 30 in Malheur County, Oregon, all Idaho counties, and 
all Iowa counties;
    (2) October 20 in all other Oregon counties, and in all Washington 
counties; or
    (3) September 20 in all other states.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) Insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss 
that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions, including:
    (i) Excessive moisture that prevents harvesting equipment from 
entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting 
equipment; and
    (ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected 
number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at 
the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such 
acres or the processing of such production is beyond the capacity of the 
processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed.
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures or as otherwise limited by the 
Special Provisions;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss listed in section 10(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure any loss of production due to:
    (1) Bypassed acreage because of:
    (i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or
    (ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any 
indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been 
paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage 
was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment; or
    (2) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the 
processor contract.

[[Page 280]]

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must give us notice:
    (a) Not later than 48 hours after:
    (1) Total destruction of the sweet corn on the unit; or
    (2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested 
production remains.
    (b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any 
acreage that will not be harvested unless we have previously released 
the acreage. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the 
reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation 
will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an 
uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish 
to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the 
unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 
feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in each unit. The 
samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 
days after notice is given to us; and
    (c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend 
to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is 
discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest, so that we may 
inspect any damaged production. If you fail to notify us and such 
failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we 
will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as 
production to count. You are not required to delay harvest.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee, by type if applicable;
    (2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election, by type if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than 
one type;
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), 
for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4) if there are more than 
one type;
    (6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of 
section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of 
section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more 
than one type; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type A processing sweet 
corn in the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price 
election of $50.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 200 tons. Your 
indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee;
    (2) 300 tons x $50.00 price election = $15,000.00 value of 
guarantee;
    (4) 200 tons x $50.00 price election = $10,000.00 value of 
production to count;
    (6) $15,000.00 - $10,000.00 = $5,000.00 loss;
    (7) $5,000.00 x 100 percent = $5,000.00 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of type B processing 
sweet corn in the same unit, with a guarantee of 4.0 tons per acre and a 
price election of $45.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 350 tons. 
Your total indemnity for both types A and B would be calculated as 
follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee for type A, and
    100 acres x 4.0 tons = 400 tons guarantee for type B;
    (2) 300 tons x $50.00 price election = $15,000.00 value of guarantee 
for type A, and
    400 tons x $45.00 price election = $18,000.00 value of guarantee for 
type B;
    (3) $15,000.00 + $18,000.00 = $33,000.00 total value of guarantee;
    (4) 200 tons x $50.00 price election = $10,000.00 value of 
production to count for type A, and
    350 tons x $45.00 price election = $15,750.00 value of production to 
count for type B;
    (5) $10,000.00 + $15,750.00 = $25,750.00 total value of production 
to count;
    (6) $33,000.00 - $25,750.00 = $7,250.00 loss;
    (7) $7,250.00 loss x 100 percent = $7,250.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count, specified in tons of unhusked ear 
weight, from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us.
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.
    (iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was 
bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in

[[Page 281]]

production which would not be acceptable under the terms of the 
processor contract.
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested.
    (2) All harvested processing sweet corn production from the 
insurable acreage. The amount of such production will be:
    (i) The usable tons of processing sweet corn shown on the processor 
settlement sheet, if available; or
    (ii) Determined by dividing the dollar amount paid, payable, or 
which should have been paid under the terms of the processor contract 
for the quantity of the sweet corn delivered to the processor by the 
base contract price per ton; and
    (3) All harvested processing sweet corn production from any other 
insurable units that have been used to fulfill your processor contract 
for this unit.
    The total production to count will be expressed as an unhusked ear 
weight. Any other measure of production will be converted to an unhusked 
ear weight equivalent.

                            13. Late Planting

    A late planting period is not applicable to processing sweet corn 
unless allowed by the Special Provisions and you provide written 
approval from the processor by the acreage reporting date that it will 
accept the production from the late planted acres when it is expected to 
be ready for harvest.
    14. Prevented Planting.
    Your prevented planting coverage will be 40 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to the levels specified in the actuarial documents.

    Good farming practices. The cultural practices generally in use in 
the county for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and 
produce at least the yield used to determine the production guarantee 
and are those required by the bean processor contract with the 
processing company, and recognized by the Cooperative State Research, 
Education, and Extension Service as compatible with agronomic and 
weather conditions in the county.
    Harvest. The mechanical picking of bean pods from the vines.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, beans must initially be placed in rows far enough 
apart to permit mechanical cultivation to be considered planted. Acreage 
planted in any other manner will not be insurable unless otherwise 
provided by the Special Provisions or by written agreement.

[[Page 282]]

    Practical to replant. In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, practical to 
replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the 
insured crop, based on factors including, but not limited to, moisture 
availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, and 
marketing window, that replanting the insured crop will allow the crop 
to attain maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the 
insurance period. It will not be considered practical to replant unless 
the replanted acreage can produce at least 75 percent of the approved 
yield, and the processor agrees in writing that it will accept the 
production from the replanted acreage.
    Processing beans. Lima, snap, or other bean types identified in the 
Special Provisions that are grown under a processor contract to be 
canned or frozen and sold for human consumption.
    Processor. Any business enterprise regularly engaged in canning or 
freezing processing beans for human consumption, that possesses all 
licenses and permits for processing beans required by the state in which 
it operates, and that possesses facilities, or has contractual access to 
such facilities, with enough equipment to accept and process the 
contracted beans within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.
    Processor contract. A written agreement between the producer and a 
processor, or between the producer and a broker, containing at a 
minimum:
    (a) The producer's commitment to plant and grow processing beans, 
and to deliver the bean production to the processor or broker;
    (b) The processor's, or broker's, commitment to purchase all the 
production stated in the processor contract; and
    (c) A base contract price.
    Multiple contracts with the same processor that specify amounts of 
production will be considered as a single processor contract unless the 
contracts are for different types of processing beans.
    Ton. Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.
    Type. A category of processing beans identified as a type in the 
Special Provisions.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) For any processor contract that stipulates the amount of 
production to be delivered:
    (1) In lieu of the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, a 
basic unit will consist of all acreage planted to the insured crop in 
the county that will be used to fulfill contracts with each processor;
    (i) There will be no more than one basic unit for all production 
contracted with each processor contract;
    (ii) In accordance with section 12, all production from any basic 
unit in excess of the amount under contract will be included as 
production to count if such production is applied to any other basic 
unit for which the contracted amount has not been fulfilled; and
    (2) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units will not 
be established.
    (b) For any processor contract that stipulates the number of acres 
to be planted, in addition to or instead of, establishing optional units 
by section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number, or irrigated 
and non-irrigated acreage, optional units may be established by type if 
acreage of one type does not continue into acreage of another type in 
the same rows or planting pattern.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the processing 
beans in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by type. The percentage of 
the maximum price elections you choose for one type will be applicable 
to all other types insured under this policy.
    (b) The appraised production from bypassed acreage that could have 
been accepted by the processor will be included when determining your 
approved yield.
    (c) Acreage that is bypassed because it was damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss will be considered to have a zero yield when determining 
your approved yield.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, 
you must provide a copy of all processor contracts to us on or before 
the acreage reporting date.

                             7. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the processing beans in the county for which a 
premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;

[[Page 283]]

    (2) That are grown under, and in accordance with, the requirements 
of a processor contract executed on or before the acreage reporting date 
and are not excluded from the processor contract at any time during the 
crop year; and
    (3) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (ii) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, 
under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which 
the processing beans are grown, you are at risk of loss, and the 
processor contract provides for delivery of the processing beans under 
specified conditions and at a stipulated base contract price.
    (c) A commercial processing bean producer who is also a processor or 
broker may establish an insurable interest if the following requirements 
are met:
    (1) The producer must comply with these Crop Provisions;
    (2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors or 
officers of the processor or the broker must execute and adopt a 
resolution that contains the same terms as an acceptable processor 
contract. Such resolution will be considered a processor contract under 
this policy; and
    (3) Our inspection reveals that the processing facilities comply 
with the definition of a processor contained in these Crop Provisions.

                          8. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that it is not practical to replant; and
    (b) We will not insure acreage that does not meet any rotation 
requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions.

                           9. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, regarding the end of the insurance period, insurance ceases 
at the earlier of:
    (a) The date the processing beans:
    (1) Were destroyed;
    (2) Should have been harvested but were not harvested;
    (3) Were abandoned; or
    (4) Were harvested;
    (b) The date you harvest sufficient production to fulfill your 
processor contract if the processor contract stipulates a specific 
amount of production to be delivered;
    (c) Final adjustment of a loss; or
    (d) The date shown below for the end of the insurance period in the 
calendar year in which the processing beans would normally be harvested, 
unless otherwise agreed to in writing, as follows:
    (1) October 30 for all processing beans in the state of Arkansas;
    (2) October 15 for all processing beans in the states of Delaware, 
Maryland, and New Jersey;
    (3) October 5 for all processing beans in the states of Idaho, 
Oregon, and Washington;
    (4) September 30 for snap beans in the state of New York;
    (5) September 20 for snap beans in all other states; or
    (6) October 5 for lima beans in all other states.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) Insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss 
that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions, including:
    (i) Excessive moisture that prevents the harvesting equipment from 
entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting 
equipment; and
    (ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected 
number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at 
the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such 
acres or the processing of such production is beyond the capacity of the 
processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed.
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease on acreage not planted to processing beans the 
previous crop year. (In certain instances, contained in the Special 
Provisions or in a written agreement, acreage planted to processing 
beans the previous year may be covered. Damage due to insufficient or 
improper application of disease control measures is not covered);
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in section 10 (a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure any loss of production due to:
    (1) Bypassed acreage because of:
    (i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or

[[Page 284]]

    (ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any 
indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been 
paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage 
was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment; or
    (2) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the 
processor contract.

                11. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the notice required by section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must give us notice:
    (a) Not later than 48 hours after:
    (1) Total destruction of the processing beans on the unit; or
    (2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested 
production remains.
    (b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any 
acreage that will not be harvested unless we have previously released 
the acreage. You must also provide acceptable documentation of the 
reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide such documentation 
will result in our determination that the acreage was bypassed due to an 
uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be harvested and you wish 
to destroy the crop, you must leave representative samples of the 
unharvested crop for our inspection. The samples must be at least 10 
feet wide and extend the entire length of each field in each unit. The 
samples must not be destroyed until the earlier of our inspection or 15 
days after notice is given to us; and
    (c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend 
to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is 
discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest. If you fail to 
notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the 
damaged production, we will consider all such production to be undamaged 
and include it as production to count. You are not required to delay 
harvest.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee, by type if applicable;
    (2) Multiplying each result of section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election, by type if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(2) if there are more than 
one type;
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 12(c)), 
for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 12(b)(4) if there are more than 
one type;
    (6) Subtracting the results of section 12(b)(4) from the results of 
section 12(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the results of 
section 12(b)(5) from the result of section 12(b)(3) if there are more 
than one type; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of snap type processing 
beans in the unit, with a guarantee of 3.0 tons per acre and a price 
election of $110.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 200 tons. Your 
indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee;
    (2) 300 tons x $110.00 price election = $33,000.00 value of 
guarantee;
    (3) 200 tons x $110.00 price election = $22,000.00 value of 
production to count;
    (4) $33,000.00 - $22,000.00 = $11,000.00 loss; and
    (5) $11,000.00 x 100 percent = $11,000.00 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of lima type 
processing beans in the same unit, with a guarantee of 1.0 ton per acre 
and a price election of $225.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 75 
tons. Your total indemnity for both snap and lima types processing beans 
would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 3.0 tons = 300 tons guarantee for the snap type, and 
100 acres x 1.0 ton = 100 tons guarantee for the lima type;
    (2) 300 tons x $110.00 price election = $33,000.00 value of 
guarantee for the snap type, and 100 tons x $225.00 price election = 
$22,500.00 value of guarantee for the lima type;
    (3) $33,000.00 + $22,500.00 = $55,500.00 total value of guarantee;
    (4) 200 tons x $110.00 price election = $22,000.00 value of 
production to count for the snap type, and 75 tons x $225.00 price 
election = $16,875.00 value of production to count for the lima type;
    (5) $22,000.00 + $16,875.00 = $38,875.00 total value of production 
to count;
    (6) $55,500.00 - $38,875.00 = $16,625.00 loss; and
    (7) $16,625.00 loss x 100 percent = $16,625.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count, specified in tons, from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;

[[Page 285]]

    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us.
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes.
    (iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was 
bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production 
which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract.
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care 
for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put 
the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested.
    (2) All harvested processing bean production from the insurable 
acreage. The amount of such production will be:
    (i) The usable tons of processing beans shown on the processor 
settlement sheet, if available; or
    (ii) Determined by dividing the dollar amount paid, payable, or 
which should have been paid under the terms of the processor contract 
for the quality and quantity of beans to be delivered to the processor 
by the base contract price per ton; and
    (3) All harvested processing bean production from any other 
insurable units that have been used to fulfill your processor contract 
for this unit.

                            13. Late Planting

    A late planting period is not applicable to processing beans unless 
allowed by the Special Provisions and you provide written approval from 
the processor by the acreage reporting date that it will accept the 
production from the late planted acres when it is expected to be ready 
for harvest.

                         14. Prevented Planting

    Your prevented planting coverage will be 40 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

Sec. 457.156  Quota tobacco crop insurance provisions.

    The Quota Tobacco Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1999 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured policies:

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                 Quota Tobacco Crop Insurance Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Amount of insurance. The dollar amount determined by multiplying the 
insured poundage quota by the current year's support price or the 
percentage of the current year's support price you select less any 
adjustments for late planting as specified in section 14.
    Approved yield. The yield calculated in accordance with 7 CFR part 
400, subpart G, if required by the Special Provisions.
    Basic unit. In lieu of the definition in the Basic Provisions, a 
basic unit is all insurable acreage of an insurable type of tobacco in 
the county in which you have a share on the date of planting for the 
crop year and that is identified by a single FSA farm serial number at 
the time insurance first attaches under these provisions for the crop 
year.
    Carryover tobacco. Any tobacco produced on the land identified by a 
FSA farm serial number in previous years that remained unsold at the end 
of the most recent marketing year.
    County. In lieu of the definition in the Basic Provisions, county is 
defined as the county or other political subdivision of a

[[Page 286]]

established and recorded by the local FSA office for the land identified 
by the FSA farm serial number plus any additional poundage, as allowed 
by the USDA Tobacco Marketing Quota Regulations, that you intend to 
produce for each unit in that crop year minus the amount of any 
carryover tobacco. The term may not include any tobacco that would be 
subject to a marketing quota penalty under USDA Tobacco Marketing Quota 
Regulations. For any crop year in which there are no effective USDA 
Tobacco Marketing Quota Regulations, the effective poundage marketing 
quota will be the pounds obtained by multiplying the applicable approved 
yield per acre by the lower of the reported or insured acreage on the 
basic unit, unless otherwise provided by the actuarial documents.

late planting in accordance with section 14, if applicable, multiplied 
by the appropriate number of insured acres and by your selected coverage 
level.
    Late planting period. In lieu of the definition in section 1 of the 
Basic Provisions, the period that begins the day after the final 
planting date for the insured crop and ends 15 days after the final 
planting date, unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.
    Market price. The previous years' season average price published by 
National Agricultural Statistics Service for the applicable type of 
tobacco in the area.

hydroponic plants, have been transplanted by hand or machine from the 
tobacco bed to the field.
    Pound. Sixteen ounces avoirdupois.
    Replanting. In lieu of the definition in section 1 of the Basic 
Provisions, performing the cultural practices necessary to replace the 
tobacco plant, and then replacing the tobacco plant in the insured 
acreage with the expectation of producing at least the quota.

unit contained in section 1 of these Crop Provisions. The provision in 
the Basic Provisions regarding optional units are not applicable, unless 
specified by the Special Provisions.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to section 3 of the Basic Provisions, a production 
report, if required by the Special Provisions, must be filed in 
accordance with section 3(c) of the Basic Provisions.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are March 15.

marketing quota; and
    (2) Be submitted to your local insurance provider's office on or 
before the acreage reporting date.

[[Page 287]]

    (c) In the event of a loss, if the written lease agreement has been 
submitted timely, we will distribute the effective poundage marketing 
quota in accordance with the terms of the written lease agreement. If 
the written lease agreement is not submitted timely, we will prorate the 
effective poundage marketing quota across the FSA farm serial number to 
all insured and uninsured persons based on planted acres within land 
identified by the FSA farm serial number.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of paragraph (c) of section 7 of the Basic Provisions, your 
annual premium amount is determined by either:
    (a) Multiplying the amount of insurance by the rate, your share, and 
any premium adjustment percentages that may apply; or
    (b) If no support price program exists, multiplying the approved 
yield by the coverage level, the support price, the acres, your share, 
and any premium adjustment percentages that may apply.

                             8. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be any of the tobacco types designated in the Special 
Provisions for the county, in which you have a share, that you elect to 
insure, and for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial 
documents.
    (b) In addition to section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will not include any poundage above the effective poundage 
marketing quota or the insured poundage quota.

                          9. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions, 
we will not insure any acreage under these crop provisions that is:
    (a) Planted to a discount variety;
    (b) Planted to a tobacco type for which no premium rate is provided 
by the actuarial documents;
    (c) Planted in any manner other than as provided in the definition 
of ``planted acreage'' in section 1 of these Crop Provisions, unless 
otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by written agreement; or
    (d) Damaged before the final planting date to the extent that most 
of the producers of tobacco acreage with similar characteristics in the 
area would normally not further care for the crop, unless such crop is 
replanted or we agree that replanting is not practical.

                          10. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11(b) of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance ceases at the earliest of:
    (a) Total destruction of the tobacco on the unit;
    (b) Weighing-in at the tobacco warehouse;
    (c) Removal of the tobacco from the field where grown except for 
curing, grading, packing, or immediate delivery to the tobacco 
warehouse; or
    (d) The February 28 immediately following the normal harvest period.

                           11. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a peril 
specified in section 11 (a) through (g) that occurs during the insurance 
period.

                12. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, any representative samples we may require of each 
unharvested tobacco type must be at least 5 feet wide (at least two 
rows) and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The 
samples must not be harvested or destroyed until after our inspection.

                         13. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records, we will 
allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our 
liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured poundage quota by your elected 
percentage of the current year's support price.
    (2) Subtracting the total value of the production to be counted (see 
section 13(c)) from the amount of insurance; and
    (3) Multiplying the result in section 13(b)(1) by your share. For 
example:
    You have 100 percent share of type 31 quota tobacco in the unit, 
with an insurable poundage quota of 1,000 pounds and a support price of 
$1.73 per pound. The amount of insurance equals $1730.00 (1,000 
insurable poundage quota x $1.73 support price). You are only able to 
harvest 600 pounds. The value of the total production to count equals 
$1038.00 (600 harvested pounds x $1.73 support price). Your indemnity 
would be calculated as follows:

[[Page 288]]

    (1) $1730.00 (amount of insurance) - $1038.00 (value of the total 
production to count) = $692.00 loss
    (2) $692.00 loss x 100 percent = $692.00 indemnity payment
    (c) The value of the total production to count (pounds of appraised 
or harvested production) for all insurable acreage on the unit will 
include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the amount of insurance per insured acre for the 
unit for any acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records, if 
required by the Special Provisions;
    (ii) The value of production lost due to uninsured causes which is 
the number of pounds of such production multiplied by the support price;
    (iii) The value of potential production on unharvested insured 
acreage that you intend to put to another use with our consent, if you 
and we agree on the number of pounds of such production to count which 
will be multiplied by the support price. Upon such agreement, the 
insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to 
another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of 
production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
allow you to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The value of production to count for 
such acreage will be the number of pounds of harvested or appraised 
production taken from samples at the time harvest should have occurred 
multiplied by the support price. If you do not leave the required 
samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, 
the value of production to count will be our appraisal made prior to 
giving you consent to put the acreage to another use multiplied by the 
support price); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the value of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal multiplied by the support price if additional damage 
occurs and the crop is not harvested;
    (2) All harvested production from insurable acreage multiplied by:
    (i) The average price for any tobacco sold on a warehouse floor; and
    (ii) Fair market value for all other tobacco sold or not sold.
    (d) Mature tobacco production that is damaged by insurable causes 
will be adjusted for quality based on the USDA Official Standard Grades 
for the insured type of tobacco.
    (e) To enable us to determine the fair market value of tobacco not 
sold through auction warehouses, you must give us the opportunity to 
inspect such tobacco before it is sold, contracted to be sold, or 
otherwise disposed. Failure to provide us the opportunity to inspect 
such tobacco may result in rejection of any claim for indemnity.
    (f) If we consider the best offer you receive for such tobacco to be 
inadequate, we may obtain additional offers on your behalf.
    (g) Once we agree that any carryover or current year's tobacco has 
no market value due to insured causes, you must destroy it. If you 
disagree and refuse to destroy the tobacco with no value, we will 
determine the value and count it as production to count.

                            14. Late Planting

    (a) In lieu of late planting provisions in the Basic Provisions 
regarding acreage initially planted after the final planting date, 
insurance will be provided for acreage planted to the insured crop after 
the final planting date as follows:
    (1) For each acre or portion thereof planted during the first 10 
days after the final planting date, the farm yield will be reduced by 1 
percent per day; and
    (2) For each acre or portion thereof planted during the 11th through 
the 15th day after the final planting date, the farm yield will be 
reduced by 2 percent per day.
    (b) If you plant enough acreage to fulfill the effective poundage 
marketing quota, there will be no reduction in the insured poundage 
quota as a result of any late planted acreage.

                         15. Prevented Planting

    The prevented planting provisions in the Basic Provisions are not 
applicable to quota tobacco.

Sec. 457.157  Plum crop insurance provisions.

    The Plum Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2001 and succeeding crop 
years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                          Plum Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1)

[[Page 289]]

The Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the 
Special Provisions; (3) these Crop Provisions; and (4) the Basic isions 
with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Adapted. Varieties of the insured crop that are recognized by the 
Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service as 
compatible with agronomic and weather conditions in the county.
    Direct marketing. Sale of the insured crop directly to consumers 
without the intervention of an intermediary such as a wholesaler, 
retailer, packer, processor, shipper, or buyer. Examples of direct 
marketing include selling through an on-farm or roadside stand, farmer's 
market, and permitting the general public to enter the field for the 
purpose of picking all or a portion of the crop.
    Harvest. The picking of mature plums from the trees by hand.
    Interplanted. Acreage on which two or more crops are planted in any 
form of alternating or mixed pattern.
    Lug. Twenty-eight (28) pounds of the insured crop.
    Scion. Twig or portion of a twig of one plant that is grafted onto a 
stock of another.
    Varietal group. Different varieties of plums that are grouped 
according to the normal maturity dates as specified in the Special 
Provisions.

                            2. Unit Division

    Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by 
section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated 
and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units must meet 
one or more of the following, as applicable, unless otherwise provided 
by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or written agreement:
    (a) Optional units may be established if each optional unit is 
located on non-contiguous land.
    (b) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units for 
non-contiguous land, optional units may be established by varietal group 
when provided for in the Special Provisions. The requirements of section 
34(a)(1) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable for this method of 
unit division.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, 
Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the plums in the 
county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide 
different price elections by varietal group, in which case you may 
select one price election for each plum varietal group designated in the 
Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each varietal 
group must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price 
offered by us for each varietal group. For example, if you choose 100 
percent of the maximum price election for one varietal group, you must 
also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other 
varietal groups.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for 
Determining Indemnities) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), by 
varietal group if applicable:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such 
acreage is changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop and varietal group if 
applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of interplanting a 
perennial crop, removal of trees, damage, change in practice, and any 
other circumstance that may effect the yield potential of the insured 
crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your 
yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee as 
necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic 
Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is October 31 
preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 (Life of Policy, Cancellation, and 
Termination) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the cancellation and 
termination dates are January 31.

[[Page 290]]

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 (Insured Crop) of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8), the crop insured will be all the plums in the county for 
which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown on tree varieties that:
    (1) Were commercially available when the trees were set out;
    (2) Are adapted to the area;
    (3) Are grown on rootstock that is adapted to the area; and
    (4) Are regulated by the California Tree Fruit Agreement, California 
Advisory Board Standards, a related crop advisory board, or the State;
    (c) That are irrigated;
    (d) That have produced an average of at least 200 lugs per acre in 
at least one of the three most recent actual production history crop 
years, unless we inspect the acreage and give our approval to insure 
such acreage in writing;
    (e) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us; and
    (f) That have reached at least the fifth (5th) growing season after 
set out. Plums produced on scions that have not reached the fifth 
growing season may be insured if the provisions in section 6(a), (b), 
(c), and (e) are met. Such trees must have produced at least 200 lugs 
per acre in at least one year after being grafted.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 (Insurable Acreage) of the 
Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8) that prohibit insurance attaching to a 
crop planted with another crop, plums interplanted with another 
perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine 
that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 (Insurance 
Period) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) Coverage begins on February 1 of each crop year. Notwithstanding 
the previous sentence, for the year of application, if your application 
is received after January 22 but prior to February 1, insurance will 
attach on the 10th day after your properly completed application is 
received in our local office unless we inspect the acreage during the 
10-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability 
requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the 
crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is September 30.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 (Insurance Period) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8):
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of plums on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, 
insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or 
indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (d) If your plum policy is canceled or terminated for any crop year, 
in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance attached for 
that crop year but on or before the cancellation and termination dates 
whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached 
for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will 
be due for such crop year.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 (Causes of Loss) 
of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), insurance is provided only against 
the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Wildlife, unless control measures have not been taken;
    (4) Earthquake;
    (5) Volcanic eruption;
    (6) An insufficient number of chilling hours to effectively break 
dormancy; or
    (7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period.

[[Page 291]]

    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 (Causes 
of Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), we will not insure 
against damage or loss of production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available;
    (2) Rejection of the crop by the packing house due to being 
undersized, immature, overripe, or mechanically damaged; or
    (3) Inability to market the plums for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                10. Duties In The Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 (Duties in the Event 
of Damage or Loss) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the following 
will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days of the date harvest should have 
started if the crop will not be harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal 
that will be used to determine your production to count for production 
that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, 
we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any 
acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your 
production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will 
be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre 
if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
    (c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest or immediately if 
damage is discovered during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged 
production.
    (d) You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given 
you written consent to do so.
    (e) If you fail to notify us in accordance with this section, we may 
consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as 
production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate, acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
from such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each varietal group, if 
applicable, by its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying the results in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each varietal group, if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each varietal 
group, if applicable, (see section 11(c)) by the respective price 
election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the results in section 11(b)(5) from the results in 
section 11 (b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (in lugs) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is sold by direct marketing directly if you fail to meet 
the requirement contained in section 10;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us.
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage:
    (i) That is packed and sold as fresh fruit and meets the U.S. No. 1 
standards as modified by the California Tree Fruit Agreement publication 
for plums for the applicable crop year;

[[Page 292]]

    (ii) That is packed and sold as fresh fruit but does not meet the 
grade requirements specified in section 11(c)(2)(i) due to insurable 
causes. Such production will be adjusted by:
    (A) Dividing the value per lug of this production by the highest 
price election available for the applicable varietal group; and
    (B) Multiplying the resulting factor, if less than 1.0, by the 
number of lugs of such plums.
    (iii) That is damaged and is, or could be, marketed for any use 
other than fresh packed plums. Such production will be adjusted by:
    (A) Multiplying the number of tons of such production by the value 
per ton of the damaged plums or $50.00, whichever is greater; and
    (B) Dividing that result by the highest price election available for 
the applicable varietal group.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

    Varietal group. Apple varieties with similar characteristics that 
are grouped for insurance purposes as specified in the Special 
Provisions.
    2. Unit Division.
    In addition to the requirements of section 34(b) of the Basic 
Provisions, optional units may be established if each optional unit is 
located on non-contiguous land. Optional units may also be established 
by varietal group in accordance with section 14 of these provisions.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the apples in the 
county insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide 
different price elections by type or varietal group, in which case you 
may select one

[[Page 293]]

price election for each apple type or varietal group designated in the 
Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type or 
varietal group must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum 
price offered by us for each type or varietal group. For example, if you 
choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type or 
varietal group, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price 
election for all other types or varietal group.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date contained in 
section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type or varietal group if 
applicable:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern;
    (4) The separate acreage for each varietal group of apples intended 
for fresh-market or processing, for each varietal group as shown on the 
actuarial documents; and
    (5) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and anytime the planting pattern of such acreage 
has changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type if applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield. We will reduce the yield used to establish your 
production guarantee as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect 
of the following: interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; 
change in practices and any other circumstance on the yield potential of 
the insured crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may 
reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production 
guarantee as necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election if a 
cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop 
has occurred prior to the time that you request the increase.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are November 20.

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the apples in the county for which a premium rate is 
provided by the actuarial table:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That are grown on tree varieties that:
    (1) Are adapted to the area;
    (2) Are in area A and have produced at least an average of 10 bins 
per acre;
    (3) Are in area B and have produced at least an average of 150 
bushels per acre;
    (4) Are in Area C and have produced at least an average of 200 
bushels per acre; and
    (c) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that 
prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, apples 
interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect 
the acreage and determine that it does not meet the insurability 
requirements contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) Coverage begins on November 21 of each crop year, except for the 
year of application, if your application is received after November 11 
but prior to November 21. In that case, insurance will attach on the 
10th day after your properly completed application is received in our 
local office unless we inspect the acreage prior to the end of the 10 
day period and determine that it does not meet insurability 
requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the 
crop to determine the condition of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is November 5.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. There will no 
coverage of any insurable interest acquired after the acreage reporting 
date.
    (2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage 
of apples on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and 
the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, insurance will 
not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or indemnity will 
be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:

[[Page 294]]

    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (d) If your apple policy is canceled or terminated for any crop 
year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance 
attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and 
termination dates whichever is later, insurance will not be considered 
to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, 
or indemnity will be due for such crop year.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or unmulched pruning debris has not been removed from the 
orchard;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Earthquake;
    (6) Volcanic eruption;
    (7) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured 
peril that occurs during the insurance period;
    (8) Excess sun, only if you have elected the Fresh Fruit Option B 
and the Sunburn Option as described in section 13; and
    (9) Wildlife;
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of 
production due to:
    (1) Failure of the fruit to size, shape, or color properly; or
    (2) Inability to market the apples for any reason other than actual 
physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For 
example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market 
due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.
    (3) Mechanical damage including, but not limited to, limb rubs, 
scars, and punctures; or
    (4) Russeting.

                10. Duties In the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the following will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within three 3 days of the date harvest 
should have started if the crop will not be harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal 
that will be used to determine your production to count for production 
that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, 
we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any 
acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your 
production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will 
be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre 
if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
    (c) If you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must notify 
us at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest, or immediately if 
damage is discovered during harvest, so that we may inspect the damaged 
production.
    (d) You must not destroy the damaged crop until after we have given 
you written consent to do so. If you fail to meet the requirements of 
this section and such failure results in our inability to inspect the 
damaged production, all such production will be considered undamaged and 
included as production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee, by type if applicable;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election, by type if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(2) if there are more than 
one type;

[[Page 295]]

    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 11(c)), 
for each type if applicable, by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results in section 11(b)(4), if there are more than 
one type;
    (6) Subtracting the total in section 11(b)(5) from the total in 
section 11(b)(3); and
    (7) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(6) by your share.
    For example:
    You have 100 percent share in 28 acres of fresh market apples and 30 
acres of processing apples in the unit, with a 300 bushel per acre 
guarantee and a price election of $5.00 per bushel for fresh market and 
$2.00 per bushel for processing. You are only able to harvest 4,500 
bushels of fresh market apples and 6,500 bushels of processing. Your 
indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 28 acres x 300 bushels = 8,400 bushels guarantee of fresh 
market; 30 acres x 300 bushels = 9,000 bushels guarantee of processing;
    (2) 8,400 bushels x $5.00 price election = $42,000.00 value of 
guarantee for fresh market; 9,000 bushels x $2.00 price election = 
$18,000.00 value of guarantee for processing;
    (3) $42,000.00 + $18,000.00 = $60,000 total value guarantee;
    (4) 4,500.00 bushels x $5.00 price election = $22,500.00 value of 
production to count for fresh market;
    6,500.00 bushels x $2.00 price election = $13,000.00 value of 
production to count for processing;
    (5) $22,500.00 + $13,000.00 = $35,500.00 total value of production 
to count;
    (6) $60,000.00 - $35,500.00 = $24,500.00 loss; and
    (7) $24,000.00 x 100 percent = $24,500.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count (boxes or bushels) from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the 
requirements contained in section 10;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested marketable production; and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will 
then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that 
harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which 
case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to 
care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will 
be used to determine the production to count; and
    (2) All marketable harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (3) Mature marketable apple production may be reduced as a result of 
loss in quality due to hail, wind, freeze, or sunburn in accordance with 
section 13 of these provisions, if you elect one or more of these 
coverages.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

              13. Optional Coverage for Quality Adjustment

    (a) These quality adjustment options apply only if the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) You have not elected to insure your apples under the 
Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) Endorsement.
    (2) You elected the Fresh Fruit Option A or the Fresh Fruit Option 
B; or you elected both the Fresh Fruit Option B and the Sunburn Option 
on your application or other form approved by us, and did so on or 
before the sales closing date for the initial crop year for which you 
wish it to be effective. By doing so, you agreed to pay the additional 
premium designated in the actuarial documents for this optional 
coverage; and
    (3) You or we did not cancel the option in writing on or before the 
cancellation date. Your election of CAT coverage for any crop year after 
this endorsement is effective will be considered as notice of 
cancellation by you.
    (b) If you select Fresh Fruit Option A only, Fresh Fruit Option A 
will apply to all of your apples intended for processing and fresh 
market.
    (c) If you select Fresh Fruit Option B, those provisions will apply 
to all of your apples intended for fresh market and the provisions of 
Fresh Fruit Option A will apply to all of your apples intended for 
processing.
    (d) If you select the Sunburn Option as designated in the Special 
Provisions, you must also select Fresh Fruit Option B.
    (e) In addition to the requirements of section 10 of these 
provisions, you must permit us to inspect and grade the fruit prior to 
harvest or no quality adjustment will be made.
    (f) Fresh Fruit Option A and Fresh Fruit Option B are subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) Fresh Fruit Option A--In addition to section 11(c) of these 
provisions and notwithstanding the definition of ``marketable'' in

[[Page 296]]

section 1 of these provisions, your production to count will be adjusted 
when your apples are damaged by hail to the extent that such apples will 
not grade U.S. No. 1 (processing). Harvested apple production that is 
damaged by hail to the extent that it does not grade 80 percent U.S. No. 
1 (processing) or better, in accordance with applicable USDA Standards 
for Grades of Apples, will be adjusted as follows:
    (i) Production to count with 21 through 40 percent not grading U.S. 
No. 1 (processing) or better will be reduced 2 percent for each full 
percent in excess of 20 percent.
    (ii) Production to count with 41 through 50 percent not grading U.S. 
No. 1 (processing) or better will be reduced 40 percent plus an 
additional 3 percent for each full percent in excess of 40 percent.
    (iii) Production to count with 51 percent through 64 percent not 
grading U.S. No. 1 (processing) or better will be reduced 70 percent 
plus an additional 2 percent for each full percent in excess of 50 
percent.
    (iv) Production to count with 65 percent or more not grading U.S. 
No. 1 (processing) or better will be considered 100 percent cull 
production.
    (v) The difference between the total production and the production 
to count as determined above will be considered cull production.
    (vi) Thirty (30) percent of all cull production will be considered 
production to count, unless otherwise specified in the Special 
Provisions.
    (vii) No reduction in production to count will be applied to any 
apple grading less than U.S. No. 1 (processing) due solely to size, 
shape, russeting, or color.
    (viii) Any appraisal we make on the insured acreage will be 
considered production to count unless such appraised production is 
knocked to the ground by wind or hail or frozen on the tree to the 
extent that harvest is not practical.
    (2) Fresh Fruit Option B--Notwithstanding section 11(c) and the 
definitions of ``harvest'' and ``marketable'' in section 1 of these 
provisions, the total production to count for a unit will include all 
harvested and appraised production. Harvested apple production that is 
damaged by hail to the extent that it does not grade 80 percent U.S. 
Fancy or better, in accordance with applicable USDA Standards for Grades 
of Apples, will be adjusted as follows:
    (i) Production to count with 21 through 40 percent not grading U.S. 
Fancy or better will be reduced 2 percent for each full percent in 
excess of 20 percent.
    (ii) Production to count with 41 through 50 percent not grading U.S. 
Fancy or better will be reduced 40 percent plus an additional 3 percent 
for each full percent in excess of 40 percent.
    (iii) Production to count with 51 percent through 64 percent not 
grading U.S. Fancy or better will be reduced 70 percent plus an 
additional 2 percent for each full percent in excess of 50 percent.
    (iv) Production to count with 65 percent or more not grading U.S. 
Fancy or better will be considered 100 percent cull production.
    (v) The difference between the total production and the production 
to count as determined above will be considered cull production.
    (vi) Apples that are knocked to the ground by wind or frozen to the 
extent they can be harvested but not marketed as U.S. Fancy grade apples 
will be considered 100 percent cull production.
    (vii) Thirty (30) percent of all cull production will be considered 
production to count, unless otherwise specified in the Special 
Provisions.
    (viii) No reduction in production to count will be applied to any 
apple grading less than U.S. Fancy due solely to size, shape, russeting, 
or color.
    (ix) Any appraisal we make on the insured acreage will be considered 
production to count unless such appraised production is knocked to the 
ground by wind, hail, or frozen on the tree to the extent that harvest 
is not practical.
    (g) Sunburn Option
    (1) In addition to the causes of loss specified in section 9 of 
these provisions, excess sun is an insurable cause of loss.
    (2) Notwithstanding the definitions of ``harvest'' and 
``marketable'' in section 1 and 11(c)(1) and (2) of these provisions, 
the total production to be counted for a unit will include all harvested 
and appraised production. Harvested apple production that, due to 
excessive sun or in conjunction with hail damage, does not grade 80 
percent U.S. Fancy or better, in accordance with applicable USDA 
Standards, will be adjusted as follows:
    (i) Production to count with 21 through 40 percent not grading U.S. 
Fancy or better due solely to excessive sun or excessive sun along with 
hail damage, will be reduced 2 percent for each full percent in excess 
of 20 percent.
    (ii) Production to count with 41 through 50 percent not grading U.S. 
Fancy or better due solely to excessive sun or excessive sun along with 
hail damage, will be reduced 40 percent plus an additional 3 percent for 
each full percent in excess of 40 percent.
    (iii) Production to count with 51 through 64 percent not grading 
U.S. Fancy or better due solely to excessive sun or excessive sun along 
with hail damage, will be reduced 70 percent plus an additional 2 
percent for each full percent in excess of 50 percent.
    (iv) Production to count with 65 percent or more not grading U.S. 
Fancy or better due solely to excessive sun or excessive sun along with 
hail damage, will be considered 100 percent cull production.

[[Page 297]]

    (v) The difference between the total production and the production 
to count as determined above will be considered cull production.
    (vi) Thirty (30) percent of all cull production will be considered 
as production to count unless otherwise specified in the Special 
Provisions.
    14. Option C--Prices and Units by Varietal Group.
    (a) Exclusive of other options, optional units and price elections 
by varietal group apply only if the following conditions are met:
    (1) You have not elected to insure your apples under the 
Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) Endorsement;
    (2) You or we did not cancel the option in writing on or before the 
cancellation date. Your election of CAT coverage for any crop year after 
this endorsement is effective will be considered notice of cancellation 
of the option by you; and
    (3) You have maintained separate records of production for each 
varietal group and you can identify the acreage upon which each varietal 
group is produced.
    (b) If you select the Fresh Fruit Option A for all insurable

established by type or

[[Page 298]]

varietal group if allowed by the Special Provisions.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) You may select only one price election and coverage level for 
each crop grown in the county and listed in the Special Provisions that 
is insured under this policy. If separate price elections are available 
by type or varietal group of a crop, the price elections you choose for 
each type or varietal group must have the same percentage relationship 
to the maximum price offered by us for each type or varietal group. For 
example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one 
type of cling peaches, you must choose 100 percent of the maximum price 
election for all other types of cling peaches.
    (b) You must report, by the production reporting date designated in 
section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type or varietal group, if 
applicable, for each stonefruit crop:
    (1) Any damage, removal of trees, change in practices, or any other 
circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon 
which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected 
acres;
    (2) The number of bearing trees on insurable and uninsurable 
acreage;
    (3) The age of the trees and the planting pattern; and
    (4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with 
another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such 
acreage is changed:
    (i) The age of the interplanted crop, and type or varietal group if 
applicable;
    (ii) The planting pattern; and
    (iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish 
your approved yield.
    We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee 
as necessary, based on our estimate of the effect of interplanting a 
perennial crop, removal of trees, damage, change in practice, and any 
other circumstance that could affect the yield potential of the insured 
crop. If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your 
yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee as 
necessary at any time we become aware of the circumstance.
    (c) You may not increase your elected or assigned coverage level or 
the ratio of your price election to the maximum price election we offer 
if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured 
crop is evident prior to the time that you request the increase.
    4. Contract Changes.
    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is October 31 for California and August 31 preceding the 
cancellation date for all other states.
    5. Cancellation and Termination Dates.
    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are January 31 for California and 
November 20 for all other states.

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all of each stonefruit crop you elect to insure, that is 
grown in the county, and for which premium rates are provided in the 
actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is grown on trees that:
    (1) Were commercially available when the trees were set out;
    (2) Is adapted to the area; and
    (3) Is grown on a root stock that is adapted to the area;
    (c) That is irrigated;
    (d) That have produced at least 200 lugs of fresh market production 
per acre, or at least 2.2 tons per acre for processing crops, in at 
least 1 of the 3 most recent actual production history crop years, 
unless we inspect such acreage and give our approval in writing;
    (e) That are regulated by the applicable state's Tree Fruit 
Agreement or related crop advisory board for the state (for applicable 
crop or type);
    (f) That are grown in an orchard that, if inspected, is considered 
acceptable by us; and
    (g) That have reached at least the fifth growing season after set 
out. However, we may agree in writing to insure acreage that has not 
reached this age if it meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this 
section.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In lieu of the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions that 
prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, 
stonefruit interplanted with another perennial crop is insurable unless 
we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the 
requirements for insurability contained in your policy.

                           8. Insurance Period

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) Coverage begins on February 1 in California and November 21 for 
all other states of each crop year, except that for the year of 
application, if your application is received after January 22 but prior 
to February 1 in California or after November 11 but prior to November 
21 in all other states, insurance will attach on the 10th day after your 
properly completed application is received in our local office, unless 
we inspect the acreage during the 10 day period and determine that it 
does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any 
information that we

[[Page 299]]

require for the crop or to determine the condition of the orchard.
    (2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each 
crop year is:
    (i) July 31 for all apricots; and
    (ii) September 30 for all nectarines and peaches; and
    (iii) As otherwise provided for specific counties or types in the 
Special Provisions.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after 
coverage begins but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop 
year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable, 
insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the 
calendar date of acquisition.
    (2) If you lose or relinquish your insurable share on any insurable 
acreage of stonefruit on or before the acreage reporting date for the 
crop year and if the acreage was insured by you the previous crop year, 
insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium or 
indemnity will be due for such acreage for that crop year unless:
    (i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar 
form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;
    (ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such 
transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and
    (iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for each 
subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, 
coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the 
insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that 
results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a 
subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous 
coverage.
    (d) If your stonefruit policy is canceled or terminated for any crop 
year, in accordance with the terms of the policy, after insurance 
attached for that crop year but on or before the cancellation and 
termination dates whichever is the later, insurance will not be 
considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, 
administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions;
    (2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been 
controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the orchard;
    (3) Wildlife;
    (4) Earthquake;
    (5) Volcanic eruption; or
    (6) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in sections 9(a)(1) through (5) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of 
production due to:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless adverse weather:
    (i) Prevents the proper application of control measures or causes 
properly applied control measures to be ineffective; or
    (ii) Causes disease or insect infestation for which no effective 
control mechanism is available;
    (2) Split pits regardless of cause; or
    (3) Inability to market the insured crop for any reason other than 
actual physical damage from an insurable cause of loss specified in this 
section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable 
to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept 
production.

                10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the following will apply:
    (a) You must notify us within 3 days after the date harvest should 
have started if the insured crop will not be harvested.
    (b) You must notify us at least 15 days before any production from 
any unit will be sold by direct marketing. We will conduct an appraisal 
that will be used to determine your production to count for production 
that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, 
we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any 
acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your 
production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will 
be sold by direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of 
production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre 
if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.
    (c) In addition to section 14 of the Basic Provisions, if you intend 
to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must give us notice at least 15 
days prior to the beginning of harvest. You must not destroy the damaged 
crop until after we have given you written consent to do so. If you fail 
to notify us and such failure results in our inability to inspect the 
damaged production, we may consider all such production to be undamaged 
and include it as production to count.

                         11. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:

[[Page 300]]

    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage for each type or varietal group 
by its respective production guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result of section 11(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for the type or varietal group;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2). (If there is only one 
type or varietal group, the result of (3) will be the same as the result 
of (2));
    (4) Multiplying the total production to count (see section 11(c)), 
for each type or varietal group, by the respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of 
section 11(b)(2). (If there is only one type or varietal group, the 
result of (6) will be the same as the result of (5)); and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.

                              For example:

    You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of varietal group A 
stonefruit in the unit, with a guarantee of 500 lugs per acre and a 
price election of $6.00 per lug. You are only able to harvest 5,000 
lugs. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 50.0 acres x 500 lugs = 25,000 lugs guarantee;
    (2) and (3) 25,000 lugs x $6.00 price election = $150,000.00 value 
of guarantee;
    (4) 5,000 lugs x $6.00 price election = $30,000.00 value of 
production to count;
    (5) and (6) $150,000.00--$30,000.00 = $120,000.00 loss; and
    (7) $120,000.00 x 100 percent = $120,000 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of varietal group B 
stonefruit in the unit, with a guarantee of 300 lugs per acre and a 
price election of $3.00 per lug. You are only able to harvest 3,000 
lugs. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 50.0 acres x 500 lugs varietal group A = 25,000 lugs guarantee; 
and 50.0 acres x 300 lugs varietal group B = 15,000 lugs guarantee;
    (2) 25,000 lugs x $ 6.00 price election = $150,000.00 value of 
guarantee for varietal group A; and 15,000 lugs x $3.00 price election = 
$45,000.00 value of guarantee for varietal group B;
    (3) $150,00.00 + $45,000.00 = $195,000.00 total value of guarantee;
    (4) 5,000 lugs varietal group A x $6.00 price election = $30,000.00 
value of production to count; and 3,000 lugs varietal group B x $3.00 
price election = $9,000.00 value of production to count; and
    (5) $30,000.00 + $9,000.00 = $39,000.00 total value of production to 
count;
    (6) $195,000.00--$39,000.00 = $156,000.00 loss
    (7) $156,000.00 loss x 1.000 = $156,000 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count (in lugs or tons) from all 
insurable acres on a unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the 
requirements contained in section 10;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production that would be marketable if harvested; 
and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to 
abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer 
the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the insured crop. We 
will then make another appraisal when you notify us if any further 
damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the 
crop. If you harvest the crop we will use the harvested production. If 
you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to 
deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; 
and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (3) The quantity of harvested production will be reduced if the 
following conditions apply:
    (i) The value of the damaged production is less than 75 percent of 
the marketable value of undamaged production due to an insured cause of 
loss; and
    (ii) For stonefruit insured as fresh fruit only, the stonefruit 
either is packed and sold as fresh fruit and meets only the utility 
grade requirements of the applicable grading standards, or fails to meet 
the applicable grading standards but is or could be sold for any use 
other than fresh packed stonefruit.
    (4) Harvested production of stonefruit that is eligible for quality 
adjustment as specified in section 11(c)(3) will be reduced as follows:
    (i) When packed and sold as fresh fruit or when insured as a 
processing crop, by dividing the marketable value per lug or ton by the 
highest price election (for the applicable coverage level) and 
multiplying the result

[[Page 301]]

(not to exceed 1.00) by the quantity of such production; or
    (ii) For all other fresh stonefruit, multiplying the number of tons 
that could be marketed by the value per ton (for the applicable coverage 
level) and dividing that result by the highest price election available 
for that type.

                     12. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
(Sec. 457.8) are not applicable.

[63 FR 29935, June 2, 1998, as amended at 65 FR 47840, Aug. 4, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 457.160  Processing tomato crop insurance provisions.

    The Processing Tomato Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1998 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured polices:

                    Processing Tomato Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Acre. 43,560 square feet of land on which row widths do not exceed 6 
feet, or the land on which at least 7,260 linear feet rows are planted 
if row widths exceed 6 feet.
    Bypassed acreage. Land on which production is ready for harvest but 
the processor elects not to accept such production so it is not 
harvested.
    First fruit set. The reproductive stage of the plant at which 30 
percent of the plants have produced a fruit that has reached a minimum 
of one inch in diameter.
    Good farming practices. The cultural practices generally in use in 
the county for the crop to make normal progress toward maturity and 
produce at least the yield used to determine the production guarantee 
and are those required by the tomato processor contract with the 
processing company, and are those recognized by the Cooperative State 
Research, Education, and Extension Service as compatible with agronomic 
and weather conditions in the county.
    Harvest. The severance of tomatoes from the vines.
    Plant stand. The number of plants per acre considered to be normal 
for the applicable tomato variety and growing area.
    Planted acreage--In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, tomatoes must initially be placed in rows to be 
considered planted. Acreage planted in any other manner will not be 
insurable unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement.
    Practical to replant. In lieu of the definition of ``Practical to 
replant'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, practical to 
replant is defined as our determination, after loss or damage to the 
insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited to moisture 
availability, marketing window, condition of the field, and time to crop 
maturity, that replanting the insured crop will allow the crop to attain 
maturity prior to the calendar date for the end of the insurance period. 
It will not be considered practical to replant unless the replanted 
acreage can produce at least 75% of the approved yield, and the 
processor agrees in writing that it will accept the production from the 
replanted acreage.
    Processor. Any business enterprise regularly engaged in processing 
tomatoes for human consumption, that possesses all licenses and permits 
for processing tomatoes required by the state in which it operates, and 
that possesses facilities, or has contractual access to such facilities, 
with enough equipment to accept and process contracted processing 
tomatoes within a reasonable amount of time after harvest.
    Processor contract. A written agreement between the producer and a 
processor, containing at a minimum:
    (a) The producer's commitment to plant and grow processing tomatoes, 
and to deliver the tomato production to the processor;
    (b) The processor's commitment to purchase all the production stated 
in the processor contract; and
    (c) A price per ton that will be paid for the production.
    Ton. Two thousand (2,000) pounds avoirdupois.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any unit 
division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, no indemnity will 
be paid for any loss of production on any unit if the insured produced a 
crop sufficient to fulfill the processor contracts forming the basis for 
the guarantee, and any indemnity will be limited to the amount necessary 
to compensate for loss in yield at the price elected between production 
to count and the contract requirements.
    (b) In California only, in addition to, or instead of, establishing 
optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA farm serial number 
and by irrigated and non-irrigated

[[Page 302]]

acreage as provided in the unit division provisions contained in the 
Basic Provisions, optional units may be established if acreage planted 
to tomatoes is separated by a field that is not planted to tomatoes, or 
by a permanent boundary such as a permanent waterway, fence, public road 
or woodland. Such optional unit must consist of the minimum number of 
acres stated in the Special Provisions. Acreage planted to tomatoes that 
is less than the minimum number of acres required will attach to the 
closest unit within the section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial 
number.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) You may select only one price election for all the processing 
tomatoes in the county insured under this policy unless the Special 
Provisions provide different price elections by type. The percentage of 
the maximum price election you choose for one type will be applicable to 
all other types insured under this policy. For example, if you choose 
100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also 
choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.
    (b) Liability under this policy will not exceed the number of tons 
required to be accepted by the processor under a processor contract in 
effect on or before:
    (1) The earlier of August 20 or the date of damage to the insured 
crop in all counties with an acreage reporting date of July 15; or
    (2) The earlier of the acreage reporting date or the date of damage 
in all other counties. (Exclude indemnities that occur in stage one and 
replant payments.)
    (c) The price election used to determine the amount of an indemnity 
is progressive by stage and increases, at specified intervals, to the 
price used for final stage losses. Stages will be determined on an acre 
basis. The stages and applicable price elections are:
    (1) First stage is from planting until first fruit set. If any 
acreage of the insured crop is destroyed in this stage, the price used 
to establish the amount of any indemnity owed for such acreage will be 
50 percent of your price election;
    (2) Second stage is from the first fruit set until harvest. If any 
acreage of the insured crop is destroyed in this stage, the price used 
to establish the amount of any indemnity owed for such acreage will be 
80 percent of your price election; and
    (3) Third stage (final stage) is harvested acreage. The price 
election used in this stage to establish the amount of any indemnity 
owed will be 100 percent of your price election.
    (d) Any acreage of tomatoes damaged to the extent, that the majority 
of producers in the area would not normally further care for the 
tomatoes, will be deemed to have been destroyed even though you may 
continue to care for it. The price election used to determine the amount 
of an indemnity will be that applicable to the stage in which the 
tomatoes were destroyed.
    (e) The appraised production from bypassed acreage that could have 
been accepted by the processor will be included when determining your 
approved yield.
    (f) Acreage that is bypassed because it was damaged by an insurable 
cause of loss to the extent that the processor cannot use the product 
will be considered to have a zero yield when determining your approved 
yield.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date for California 
and November 30 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are January 15 in California and 
March 15 in all other states.

                          6. Report of Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, 
you must provide a copy of all processor contracts to us on or before 
the acreage reporting date in all counties, unless otherwise specified 
in the Special Provisions.

                            7. Annual Premium

    In lieu of the premium amount determinations contained in section 7 
of the Basic Provisions, the annual premium amount per acre is 
determined by multiplying the production guarantee per acre by the price 
election for the third (final) stage; by the premium rate; by the 
insured acreage; by the applicable share at the time of planting; and 
ultimately by any applicable premium adjustment factors contained in the 
actuarial documents.

                             8. Insured Crop

    (a) In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the tomatoes in the county for which a premium rate 
is provided by the actuarial documents:
    (1) In which you have a share;
    (2) That are planted for harvest as processing tomatoes;
    (3) That are grown under, and in accordance with, the requirements 
of a processor contract executed on or before August 20 in all counties 
with an acreage reporting date

[[Page 303]]

of July 15, or on or before the acreage reporting date in all other 
counties, and are not excluded from the processor contract for or during 
the crop year; and
    (4) That are not (unless allowed by the Special Provisions or by 
written agreement):
    (i) Grown on acreage on which tomatoes were grown in either of the 
two previous years, except in California;
    (ii) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (iii) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    (b) You will be considered to have a share in the insured crop if, 
under the processor contract, you retain control of the acreage on which 
the tomatoes are grown, you are at risk of loss, and the processor 
contract provides for delivery of processing tomatoes under specified 
conditions and at a stipulated price.
    (c) A tomato producer who is also a processor may establish an 
insurable interest if the following requirements are met:
    (1) The processor must comply with these Crop Provisions;
    (2) Prior to the sales closing date, the Board of Directors or 
officers of the processor must execute and adopt a resolution that 
contains the same terms as an acceptable processor contract. Such 
resolution will be considered a contract under this policy; and
    (3) Our inspection provides that the processing facilities comply 
with the definition of a processor contained in these Crop Provisions.

                           9. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions:
    (a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that the majority of producers in the area 
would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted unless 
we agree that it is not practical to replant; and
    (b) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation 
requirements, if applicable, contained in the Special Provisions.

                          10. Insurance Period

    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, regarding the end of the insurance period, insurance ceases 
at the earlier of the date:
    (a) You harvest sufficient production to fulfill your processor 
contract if the processor contract stipulates a specific amount of 
production to be delivered;
    (b) The tomatoes should have been harvested but was not harvested;
    (c) The tomatoes were abandoned;
    (d) Harvest was completed;
    (e) Final adjustment of a loss was completed; or
    (f) The following calendar date for the end of the insurance period
    (1) October 20 in California; and
    (2) October 10 in all other states.

                           11. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions:
    (a) Insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss 
that occur during the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions, including:
    (i) Excessive moisture that prevents the harvesting equipment from 
entering the field or that prevents the timely operation of harvesting 
equipment; and
    (ii) Abnormally hot or cold temperatures that cause an unexpected 
number of acres over a large producing area to be ready for harvest at 
the same time, affecting the timely harvest of a large number of such 
acres or the processing of such production being beyond the capacity of 
the processor, either of which causes the acreage to be bypassed;
    (2) Fire;
    (3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (5) Wildlife;
    (6) Earthquake;
    (7) Volcanic eruption; or
    (8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if due to a cause of 
loss contained in sections 11(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the 
insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded by section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due 
to:
    (1) Acreage being bypassed, if the acreage is bypassed because:
    (i) The breakdown or non-operation of equipment or facilities; or
    (ii) The availability of a crop insurance payment. We may deny any 
indemnity immediately in such circumstance or, if an indemnity has been 
paid, require you to repay it to us with interest at any time acreage 
was bypassed due to the availability of a crop insurance payment;
    (2) The processing tomatoes not being timely harvested, unless such 
delay in harvesting is solely and directly due to an insured cause of 
loss; or
    (3) Your failure to follow the requirements contained in the 
processor contract.

                         12. Replanting Payment

    (a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a 
replanting payment is allowed if the crop sustained a loss exceeding 50 
percent of the plant stand and it is practical to replant.

[[Page 304]]

    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or three tons, 
multiplied by your third stage (final) price election, multiplied by 
your share.

                13. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In addition to the notice required by section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must give us notice:
    (a) Not later than 48 hours after:
    (1) Total destruction of the tomatoes in the unit; or
    (2) Discontinuance of harvest on a unit on which unharvested 
production remains;
    (b) Within 3 days after the date harvest should have started on any 
acreage that will not be harvested. You must also provide acceptable 
documentation of the reason the acreage was bypassed. Failure to provide 
such documentation will result in our determination that the acreage was 
bypassed due to an uninsured cause of loss. If the crop will not be 
harvested and you wish to destroy the crop, you must leave 
representative samples of the unharvested crop for our inspection. The 
samples must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length of 
each field in the unit. The samples must not be destroyed until the 
earlier of our inspection or 15 days after notice is given to us; and
    (c) At least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend 
to claim an indemnity on any unit, or immediately if damage is 
discovered during the 15 day period or during harvest, so that we may 
inspect the damaged production. If you fail to notify us and such 
failure results in our inability to inspect the damaged production, we 
will consider all such production to be undamaged and include it as 
production to count. You are not required to delay harvest.

                         14. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:
    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which such production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee, by type if applicable;
    (2) Multiplying each result of section 14(b)(1) by the respective 
price election, by type if applicable;
    (3) Totaling the results of section 14(b)(2) if there are more than 
one type;
    (4) Multiplying the total production to counted (see section 14(c)), 
for each type if applicable, by its respective price election;
    (5) Totaling the results of section 14(b)(4) if there are more than 
one type;
    (6) Subtracting the result of section 14(b)(4) from the result of 
section 14(b)(2) if there is only one type or subtracting the result of 
section 14(b)(5) from the result of section 14(b)(3) if there are more 
than one type; and
    (7) Multiplying the result of section 14(b)(6) by your share.
For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of type A processing 
tomatoes in the unit, with a guarantee of 18.8 tons per acre and a price 
election of $50.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 10.0 tons. Your 
indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 50.0 acres x 18.8 tons = 940.0 tons guarantee;
    (2) 940.0 tons x $50.00 price election = $47,000.00 value guarantee;
    (4) 10.0 tons x $50.00 price election = $500.00 value of production 
to count;
    (6) $47,000.00 - $500.00 = $46,500.00 loss; and
    (7) $46,500 x 100 percent = $46,500.00 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of type B processing 
tomatoes in the same unit, with a guarantee of 15.0 tons per acre and a 
price election of $35.00 per ton. You are only able to harvest 5.0 tons. 
Your total indemnity for both types A and B would be calculated as 
follows:
    (1) 50.0 acres x 18.8 tons = 940.0 ton guarantee for type A and 50.0 
acres x 15.0 tons = 750.0 ton guarantee for type B;
    (2) 940.0 ton guarantee x $50.00 price election = $47,000.00 value 
of guarantee for type A and 750.0 ton guarantee x $35.00 = $26,500.00 
value of guarantee for type B;
    (3) $47,000.00 + $26,500.00 = $72,500.00 total value of guarantee;
    (4) 10.0 tons x $50.00 price election = $500.00 value of production 
to count for type A and 5.0 tons x $35.00 price election = $175.00 value 
of production to count for type B;
    (5) $500.00 + $175.00 = $675.00 total value of production to count;
    (6) $72,500.00 - $675.00 = $71,575.00 loss; and
    (7) $71,575 loss x 100 percent = $71,575.00 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production to count, specified in tons, from all 
insurable acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide production records that are 
acceptable to us.

[[Page 305]]

    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Production on acreage that is bypassed unless the acreage was 
bypassed due to an insured cause of loss which resulted in production 
which would not be acceptable under the terms of the processor contract;
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandoned, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us, (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested;
    (2) All harvested production (in tons) delivered to the processor 
which meets the quality requirements of the processor contract 
(expressed as usable or payable weight).
    (3) All harvested tomato production delivered to processor which 
does not meet the quality requirements of the processor contract due to 
not being timely delivered.
    (d) Once harvest has begun on any acreage covered by a processor 
contract that specifies the number of tons to be delivered, the total 
indemnity payable will be limited to an amount based on the lesser of 
the guaranteed tons, or the tons remaining unfulfilled under the 
processor contract.

                     15. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 457.161  Canola and rapeseed crop insurance provisions.

    The canola and rapeseed crop insurance provisions for the 2003 and 
succeeding crop years are as follows:
    FCIC policies:

                        Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and reinsured policies:

                   Canola and Rapeseed Crop Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) the Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions, with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Canola. A crop of the genus Brassica as defined in accordance with 
the Official United States Standards for Grain--Subpart C--U.S. 
Standards for Canola.
    Harvest. Combining or threshing for seed. A crop that is swathed 
prior to combining is not considered harvested.
    Local market price (Canola). The cash price per pound for U.S. No. 2 
grade canola that reflects the maximum limits of quality deficiencies 
allowable for the U.S. No. 2 grade canola.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the definition contained in the 
Basic Provisions, land on which seed is initially spread onto the soil 
surface by any method and subsequently is mechanically incorporated into 
the soil in a timely manner and at the proper depth will be considered 
planted. Acreage planted in any other manner will not be insurable 
unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial 
documents, or by written agreement.
    Price of damaged production. The cash price per pound available if 
the production were sold for canola that qualifies for quality 
adjustment in accordance with section 12 of these crop provisions.
    Rapeseed. A crop of the genus Brassica that contains at least 30 
percent of an industrial type of oil as shown on the Special Provisions 
and that is measured on a basis free from foreign material.
    Swathed. Severance of the stem and seed pods from the ground and 
placing into windrows without removal of the seed from the pod.

                            2. Unit Division

    In addition to optional units by section, section equivalent or FSA 
farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices, 
optional units may be by type if the type is designated on the Special 
Provisions.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions, you may select

[[Page 306]]

only one price election for all the canola and rapeseed in the county 
insured under this policy unless the Special Provisions provide 
different price elections by type, in which case you may select one 
price election for each canola and rapeseed type designated in the 
Special Provisions. The price elections you choose for each type must 
have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us 
for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum 
price election for a specific type, you must also choose 100 percent of 
the maximum price election for all other types.

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date for counties 
with a March 15 cancellation date, and June 30 preceding the 
cancellation date for all other counties.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   Cancellation and

All counties in Georgia....................  Sept. 30.
All other counties without fall planted      Mar. 15.
 types specified on the actuarial table.
All other counties with fall planted types   Aug. 31.
 specified on the actuarial table.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

                             6. Insured Crop

    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all canola and rapeseed in the county for which a 
premium rate is provided by the actuarial table:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is planted for harvest as seed; and
    (c) That is not, unless allowed by Special Provisions or by written 
agreement:
    (1) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume.

                          7. Insurable Acreage

    In addition to the provisions of section 9 of the Basic Provisions,
    (a) Any acreage of the insured crop that is damaged before the final 
planting date, to the extent that most producers producing crops on 
similarly situated acreage in the area would not normally further care 
for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical 
to replant; and
    (b) We will not insure any acreage that does not meet the rotation 
requirements contained in the Special Provisions.

                           8. Insurance Period

    In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic 
Provisions, the end of the insurance period is October 31 of the 
calendar year in which the crop is normally harvested.

                            9. Causes of Loss

    In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of 
loss which occur during the insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if applicable, caused by 
an insured cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period.

                         10. Replanting Payment

    (a) In accordance with section 13 of the Basic Provisions, a 
replanting payment is allowed if the insured crop is damaged by an 
insurable cause of loss to the extent that most producers producing the 
crop on similarly situated acreage in the area, would not continue to 
care for the crop and it is practical to replant.
    (b) The maximum amount of the replanting payment per acre will be 
the lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or 175 pounds, 
multiplied by your price election, multiplied by your insured share.
    (c) When the canola or rapeseed is replanted using a practice or 
type that is uninsurable as an original planting, the liability for the 
unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment that is 
attributable to your share. The premium amount will not be reduced.

                11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    In accordance with the requirements of section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions, the representative samples of the unharvested crop that we 
may require must be at least 10 feet wide and extend the entire length 
of each field in the unit. If you intend to put the acreage to another 
use or not harvest the acreage, the samples must not be harvested or 
destroyed until our inspection.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:

[[Page 307]]

    (1) For any optional units, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable production records were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic units, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for the units.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production 
guarantee;
    (2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective 
price election for each type, if applicable;
    (3) If there are more than one type, totaling the results in section 
12(b)(2);
    (4) Multiplying the total production to be counted of each type, if 
applicable, (see section 12(c)) by the respective price election;
    (5) If there are more than one type, totaling the results in section 
12(b)(4);
    (6) If there are more than one type, subtracting the total in 
section 12(b)(5) from the total in section 12(b)(3);
    (7) If there is only one type, subtracting the total in section 
12(b)(4) from the total in section 12(b)(2); and
    (8) Multiplying the result in section 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(7), as 
applicable, by your share.
    (c) The total production to count (pounds) from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) That is put to another use without our consent;
    (C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
section 12(d)); and
    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put 
to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount 
of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Mature canola may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality 
deficiencies. Mature rapeseed may be adjusted for excess moisture only. 
If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any 
adjustment for quality.
    (1) Canola and rapeseed production will be reduced by 0.12 percent 
for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 8.5 percent. We 
must be permitted to obtain samples of the production to determine the 
moisture content.
    (2) Canola production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United 
States Standards for Grain, result in the canola not meeting the grade 
requirements for U.S. No. 3 or better (U.S. Sample grade) because of 
kernel damage (excluding heat damage), or a musty, sour, or commercially 
objectionable foreign odor; or
    (ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the 
Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the 
United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss in canola 
production only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these Crop 
Provisions and which occurs within the insurance period;
    (ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net 
price for the damaged production that is less than the local market 
price;
    (iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us;
    (iv) With regard to deficiencies in quality, the samples are 
analyzed by:
    (A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards 
Act or the United States Warehouse Act;
    (B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a 
warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit 
Corporation; or

[[Page 308]]

    (C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed 
by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the 
Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law 
regarding warehouses; and
    (v) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or 
animal health, the samples analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.
    (4) Canola production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in sections 12(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced:
    (i) In accordance with the quality adjustment factors contained in 
the Special Provisions; or
    (ii) As follows if quality adjustment factors are not contained in 
the Special Provisions:
    (A) Divide the price of damaged production by the local market price 
to determine the quality adjustment factor.
    (B) The number of pounds remaining after any reduction due to 
excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross pounds) of the damaged 
or conditioned production will then be multiplied by the quality 
adjustment factor to determine the net production to count.
    (5) For canola, the price of damaged production and the local market 
price will be determined at the earlier of the date such quality 
adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit 
subject to the following conditions:
    (i) Discounts used to establish the price of damaged production will 
be limited to those that are usual, customary, and reasonable.
    (ii) The price of damaged production will not be reduced for:
    (A) Moisture content;
    (B) Damage due to uninsured causes;
    (C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with 
normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the canola; except, if the 
price of damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may 
reduce the price of damaged production after the production has been 
conditioned by the cost of conditioning but not lower than the price of 
damaged production before conditioning. We may obtain prices of damaged 
production from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain prices of damaged 
production from one or more buyers located outside your local market 
area, we will reduce such price of damaged production by the additional 
costs required to deliver the canola to those buyers; or
    (D) Erucic acid or glucosinolates in excess of the amount allowed 
under the definition of canola contained in the Official United States 
Standards for Grain; and
    (iii) Factors not associated with grading under the Official United 
States Standards for Grain including, but not limited to protein and 
oil, will not be considered.
    (e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop 
may be counted as production of the insured crop on an unadjusted weight 
basis.
    For example:
    You have 100 percent share in 25 acres of Fall Oleic Canola in a 
unit with a 650 pound production guarantee and a price election of $0.11 
per pound. You are only able to harvest 14,700 pounds and there is no 
appraised production. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 25 acres x 650 pounds = 16,250 pounds of Fall Oleic Canola;
    (2) 16,250 pounds x $0.11 price election = $1,788 value of guarantee 
for Fall Oleic Canola;
    (3) 14,700 pounds x $0.11 price election = $1,617 total value of 
production to count for Fall Oleic Canola;
    (4) $1,788 value of guarantee - $1,617 value of production to count 
= $171 value of loss; and
    (5) $171 value of loss x 100 percent = $171 indemnity payment.
    You also have a 100 percent share in 50 acres of Fall High Erucic 
Rapeseed in the same unit with a production guarantee of 750 pounds per 
acre and a price election of $0.15 per pound. You are only able to 
harvest 14,000 pounds and there is no appraised production. Your total 
indemnity for both Fall Oleic Canola and Fall High Erucic Rapeseed would 
be calculated as follows:
    (1) 25 acres x 650 pounds = 16,250 pounds guarantee for the Fall 
Oleic Canola, and 50 acres x 750 pounds = 37,500 pounds guarantee for 
the Fall High Erucic Rapeseed;
    (2) 16,250 pounds guarantee x $0.11 price election = $1,788 value of 
the guarantee for the Fall Oleic Canola, and 37,500 pounds guarantee x 
$0.15 price election = $5,625 value of the guarantee for the Fall High 
Erucic Rapeseed;
    (3) $1,788 + $5,625 = $7,413 total value of the guarantees;
    (4) 14,700 pound x $0.11 price election = $1,617 value of production 
to count for the Fall Oleic Canola, and 14,000 pounds x $0.15 price 
election = $2,100 value of production to count for the Fall High Erucic 
Rapeseed;
    (5) $1,617 + $2,100 = $3,717 total value of production to count;
    (6) $7,413 value of guarantee - $3,717 value of production = $3,696 
loss; and
    (7) $3,696 value of loss x 100 percent = $3,696 indemnity payment.

                            13. Late Planting

    In lieu of section 16(a) of the Basic Provisions, the production 
guarantee for each acre planted to the insured crop during the late 
planting period will be reduced by 1 percent per day for each day 
planted after the final planting date unless otherwise specified in the 
Special Provisions.

[[Page 309]]

                         14. Prevented Planting

    In addition to the provisions contained in section 17 of the Basic 
Provisions, your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or 
additional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart 
T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented 
planting coverage to the levels specified in the actuarial documents.

Sec. 457.162  Nursery crop insurance provisions.

    The Nursery Crop Insurance Provisions for the 1999 and succeeding 
crop years are as follows:
    FCIC Policies

                 United States Department of Agriculture

                   Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

                           Reinsured Policies

(Appropriate title for insurance provider)
    Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies

                    Nursery Crop Insurance Provisions

    If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of 
priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection 
Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop 
Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.

                             1. Definitions

    Act. The Federal Crop Insurance Act, 7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.
    Amount of insurance. For each basic unit, your practice value 
multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elect, multiplied by 
your price election, and multiplied by your share. Your accumulated paid 
losses during the crop year for each basic unit or the optional units 
will not exceed your amount of insurance.
    Crop year. The period beginning the day insurance attaches and 
extending until 11:59 p.m. of the following September 30. Crop year is 
designated by the calendar year in which it ends.
    Crop year deductible. The deductible percentage multiplied by the 
sum of all plant inventory values for each basic unit. The crop year 
deductible will be increased for any increases in the inventory value on 
the plant inventory value report or through the purchase of a peak 
inventory endorsement, if in effect at the time of loss. The crop year 
deductible will be reduced by any previously incurred deductible if you 
timely report each loss to us.
    Deductible percentage. An amount equal to 100 percent minus the 
percent of coverage you select.
    Eligible plant list. A list published by FCIC in electronic format 
and available from your agent that includes the botanical and common 
names of insurable plants, the winter protection requirements for 
container material and the areas in which they apply, the hardiness zone 
to which field grown material is insurable, the designated hardiness 
zones for each county, and the unit classification for each plant on the 
list. A paper copy of the eligible plant list is also available from 
your agent.
    Field grown. Nursery plants planted and grown in the ground without 
the use of any artificial root containment device. In-ground fabric bags 
are not considered an artificial root containment device.
    Field market value A. The value of undamaged insurable plants, based 
on the prices contained in the plant price schedule, in the basic or 
optional unit, as applicable, immediately prior to the occurrence of any 
loss as determined by our appraisal. This allows the amount of insurance 
under the policy to be divided among the individual units in accordance 
with the actual value of the plants in the unit at the time of loss for 
the purpose of determining whether you are entitled to an indemnity for 
insured losses in the unit, optional or basic, as applicable.
    Field market value B. The value of the insurable plants, based on 
the prices contained in the plant price schedule, in the basic or 
optional unit, as applicable, following the occurrence of a loss as 
determined by our appraisal plus any reduction in value due to uninsured 
causes. This is used to determine the loss of value for each individual 
unit so that losses can be paid on an individual unit basis, optional or 
basic, as applicable.
    Field market value C. The value of undamaged insurable plants based 
on the prices contained in the plant price schedule for all types within 
the basic unit immediately prior to the occurrence of any loss as 
determined by our appraisal. This value is used to calculate the actual 
value of the plants in the basic unit at the time of loss to ensure that 
you have not underreported your plant values.
    In-ground fabric bag. (Also called a grow bag or a root control 
bag). A porous fabric bag made of a non-biodegradable material such as 
polypropylene that typically has a plastic bottom, and is used for 
growing woody plants in the ground.
    Irrigated practice. In lieu of the definition in the Basic 
Provisions, the application of water, using appropriate systems and at 
the proper times, to provide the quantity of water needed to sustain 
normal growth of your insured plant inventory and provide cold 
protection for applicable plants as specified in the eligible plant 
list.

[[Page 310]]

    Loss. Field market value A minus field market value B.
    Marketable. Of a condition that it may be offered for sale in the 
market.
    Nursery. A business enterprise that derives at least 50 percent of 
its gross income from the wholesale marketing of plants.
    Occurrence deductible. This deductible allows a smaller deductible 
than the crop year deductible to be used when; (1) Inventory values are 
less than the reported practice value, or (2) you have elected optional 
units. The occurrence deductible is the lesser of: (a) The deductible 
percentage multiplied by field market value A multiplied by the under 
report factor; or (b) the crop year deductible.
    Plant inventory value report. Your report that declares the value of 
insurable plants in accordance with section 6.
    Plant price schedule. A schedule of insurable plant prices published 
by FCIC in electronic format that establishes the value of undamaged 
insurable plants and the maximum amount we will pay for damaged 
insurable plants. A paper copy is available from your crop insurance 
agent.
    Practice. A cultural method of producing plants. Standard nursery 
containers grown and field grown are considered separate insurable 
practices.
    Practice value. The full value of all insurable plants in each basic 
unit on your plant inventory value report including any report that 
increases the value of your insurable plant inventory. This will be used 
to determine the amount of insurance under this policy.
    Price election. The allowable percentage, as specified in the 
actuarial documents, of the prices shown in the plant price schedule 
that you elect and that is used to determine the amount of insurance and 
any indemnity.
    Standard nursery containers. Rigid containers not less than 3 inches 
in diameter at the widest point of the container interior and that are 
appropriate in size and have drainage holes appropriate for the plant. 
In-ground fabric bags, trays, cellpacks with individual cells less than 
3 inches in diameter at the widest point of the container interior, and 
burlap are not considered standard nursery containers under these Crop 
Provisions.
    Stock plants. Plants used solely for propagation during the 
insurance period.
    Under report factor. The factor which adjusts your indemnity for 
underreporting of inventory values. The factor is always used in 
determining any indemnity. For each practice, the under report factor is 
the lesser of: (a) 1.000 or; (b) the sum of all practice values reported 
on all plant inventory value reports, including any peak inventory value 
reports during the coverage term of the Peak Inventory Endorsement minus 
the total of all previous losses, as adjusted by any previous under 
report factor, divided by field market value C.

                            2. Unit Division

    (a) In lieu of the definition of ``basic unit'' contained in section 
1 of the Basic Provisions, a basic unit consists of all insurable plants 
in which you have a share in the county for each practice for which a 
separate rate is established in the actuarial documents. Although the 
basic unit may be divided into optional units in accordance with 
sections 2(b) and 2(c), you will still be considered to have a basic 
unit that will be used to establish the amount of insurance, crop year 
deductible, under report factor, premium, and the total amount of 
indemnity payable under this policy.
    (b) In lieu of the optional unit provisions in the Basic Provisions, 
if you elect either limited or additional levels of coverage, for an 
additional premium, inventory that would otherwise be one basic unit may 
be divided into optional units by plant type as specified in section 
2(c). If you elect optional units, your amount of insurance will be 
divided among optional units in relation to the actual value of plants 
in each optional unit. If, at the time of loss, the aggregate value of 
the plants in all your optional units exceeds your practice value, you 
will be subject to the under report factor provisions.
    (c) Plant Types contained on the eligible plant list.
    1. Deciduous Trees (Shade and Flower);
    2. Broad-leaf Evergreen Trees;
    3. Coniferous Evergreen Trees;
    4. Fruit and Nut Trees;
    5. Deciduous Shrubs;
    6. Broad-leaf Evergreen Shrubs;
    7. Coniferous Evergreen Shrubs;
    8. Small Fruits;
    9. Herbaceous Perennials;
    10. Roses;
    11. Ground Cover and Vines;
    12. Annuals;
    13. Foliage; and
    14. Other plant types listed in the Special Provisions.
    (d) You must elect either basic units or optional units.

  3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining 
                               Indemnities

    (a) The production reporting requirements contained in section 3 of 
the Basic Provisions are not applicable.
    (b) In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic 
Provisions, you must select one price election for all plants, 
regardless of type, insured under this policy.
    (c) Your amount of insurance will be reduced by the amount of any 
indemnity paid under this policy. For losses occurring when a Peak 
Inventory Endorsement is in effect, to determine the amount of insurance 
remaining after the loss you must subtract the amount of the indemnity 
from the peak

[[Page 311]]

amount of insurance, then subtract any remaining amount of indemnity 
from the amount of insurance.
    (d) If you restock your nursery plant inventory, you may increase 
your amount of insurance in accordance with section 6(f).

                           4. Contract Changes

    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is June 30 of each year.

                  5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are September 30 preceding the crop 
year.

                     6. Plant Inventory Value Report

    (a) Section 6 of the Basic Provisions is not applicable.
    (b) You must submit a plant inventory value report to us with your 
application and for each subsequent crop year, not later than September 
1. If you do not submit a plant inventory value report by September 1, 
your policy will continue using the reported inventory values in effect 
as of August 31.
    (c) The plant inventory value report must include all growing 
locations, the practice value, and your share. At our option, you will 
be required to provide documentation in support of your plant inventory 
value report, including, but not limited to, a detailed plant inventory 
listing that includes the name, the number, and the size of each plant; 
sales and purchases of plants for the 3 previous crop years in the 
amount of detail we require, and your ability to properly obtain and 
maintain nursery stock. For catastrophic level policies only, you must 
report your previous plant sales on the plant inventory value report. 
You may be required to provide documentation to support such sales.
    (d) Your plant inventory value report, including any revised report, 
and your peak inventory value report will be used to determine your 
premium and amount of insurance.
    (e) Your plant inventory value report must reflect your insurable 
nursery plant inventory value according to prices contained in the plant 
price schedule. In no instance will we be liable for plant values 
greater than those contained in the plant price schedule.
    (f) You may revise your plant inventory value report to increase the 
reported inventory value. Any revision must be made in writing before 
May 31st of the crop year. We may inspect the inventory. Your revised 
plant inventory value report will be considered accepted by us and 
insurance will attach on any proposed increase in inventory value 30 
days after your written request is received unless we reject the 
proposed increase in your plant inventory value in writing. We will 
reject any requested increase if a loss occurs within 30 days of the 
date the request is made.
    (g) You must report the full value of your practice value in 
accordance with section 6(e). Failure to report the full value of your 
practice value will result in the reduction of any claim in accordance 
with section 12(d).
    (h) For catastrophic insurance coverage only: (1) Your plant 
inventory value report for container grown nursery plants cannot exceed 
the lesser of the actual value from section 6(e) or 150 percent of your 
previous year's sales of container grown nursery plants; (2) Your plant 
inventory value report for field grown nursery plants cannot exceed the 
lesser of the actual value from section 6(e) or 250 percent of your 
previous years' sale of field grown nursery plants, and if the above 
restrictions cause you to under report the value of your inventory, you 
must present records acceptable to us to prove your actual inventory 
value to receive a waiver of these restrictions.

                               7. Premium

    (a) In lieu of section 7(c) of the Basic Provisions, we will 
determine your premium by multiplying the amount of insurance by the 
appropriate premium rate and by the premium adjustment factors listed on 
the actuarial documents that may apply.
    (b) In addition to the provisions in section 7 of the Basic 
Provisions, the premium will be adjusted for partial crop years. Premium 
will be charged for the entire month for any calendar month during which 
any amount of coverage is provided under these provisions or the peak 
inventory endorsement.
    (c) Additional premium from an increase in the plant inventory value 
report is due and payable when the revised plant inventory value report 
is accepted by us.

                            8. Insured Plants

    In lieu of the provisions of sections 8 and 9 of the Basic 
Provisions, the insured nursery plant inventory will be all the nursery 
plants in the county that:
    (a) Are shown on the Eligible Plant List and meet all the 
requirements for insurability (plant types, species and cultivars not 
insurable under the eligible plant list may be insured by written 
agreement, subject to FCIC's determination that the proper storage 
requirements and an accurate insurable price for the plant can be 
determined, and provided all other requirements, such as plant and 
container size, are met);
    (b) Are determined by us to be acceptable;
    (c) Are grown in a county for which a premium rate is provided in 
the actuarial documents;
    (d) Are grown in a nursery inspected by us and determined to be 
acceptable;

[[Page 312]]

    (e) Are irrigated unless otherwise provided by the Special 
Provisions (You must have adequate irrigation equipment and water to 
irrigate all insurable nursery plants at the time coverage begins and 
throughout the insurance period);
    (f) Are grown in accordance with the production practices for which 
premium rates have been established;
    (g) Are grown in an appropriate medium;
    (h) Are not grown for sale as Christmas trees;
    (i) Are not stock plants; and
    (j) Produce edible fruits or nuts provided the fruit or nuts are not 
intended for harvest while the plant is located in the nursery.

                           9. Insurance Period

    (a) In lieu of the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provision: 
(1) For the year of application, coverage begins 30 days after your crop 
insurance agent receives an application signed by you, unless we notify 
you that your inventory is not acceptable; (2) For subsequent crop 
years, the insurance period begins at 12:01 a.m. each October 1st; (3) 
No application for insurance for any current crop year will be accepted 
after May 31st of the crop year; (4) If you apply for coverage after May 
31st, coverage will not begin prior to October 1st; and (5) For the 1999 
crop year only, if you insured your nursery under 7 CFR 457.114 and you 
elect to cancel such policy by November 30, 1998, and obtain insurance 
under these Crop Provisions by November 30, 1998, by simultaneous 
cancellation and application, and if you select the same coverage level, 
the 30 day delay in coverage will not apply to your container grown 
nursery crop, and coverage for your container grown nursery crop will 
begin on the date of application. If you change coverage levels, the 30 
day delay in coverage on your container grown nursery crop specified in 
section 9(a)(1) will apply and coverage under 7 CFR 457.114 will 
continue until coverage under this policy begins.
    (b) Insurance ends at the earliest of:
    (1) The date of final adjustment of a loss when the total 
indemnities due equal the amount of insurance;
    (2) Removal of bare root nursery plant material from the field;
    (3) Removal of all other insured plant material from the nursery; or
    (4) 11:59 p.m. on September 30.

                           10. Causes of Loss

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic 
Provisions, insurance is provided for unavoidable damage caused only by 
the following causes of loss that occur within the insurance period:
    (1) Adverse weather conditions, except as specified in section 10(b) 
or the Special Provisions;
    (2) Fire, provided weeds and undergrowth in the vicinity of the 
plants or buildings on your insured site are controlled by chemical or 
mechanical means;
    (3) Wildlife;
    (4) Earthquake;
    (5) Volcanic eruption; or
    (6) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to a cause of loss 
specified in sections 10(a)(1) through (5) that occurs within the 
insurance period; or
    (7) Delay in marketability of the plants, if such delay results in a 
reduction in the value of the plants, due to a cause of loss specified 
in section 10(a)(1) through (6) that occurs within the insurance period.
    (b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the 
Basic Provisions, we do not insure against any loss caused by:
    (1) Disease or insect infestation, unless:
    (i) A disease or insect infestation occurs for which no effective 
control measure exists; or
    (ii) Coverage is specifically provided by the Special Provisions.
    (2) A failure of, or a reduction in, the power supply, unless such 
failure or reduction is due to an insurable cause of loss specified in 
section 10(a);
    (3) The inability to market the nursery plants as a direct result of 
quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;
    (4) Cold temperatures, if cold protection is required in the 
eligible plant list, unless:
    (i) You have installed adequate cold protection equipment or 
facilities and there is a failure or breakdown of the cold protection 
equipment or facilities resulting from an insurable cause of loss 
specified in section 10(a) (the insured plants must be damaged by cold 
temperatures and the damage must occur within 72 hours of the failure of 
such equipment or facilities unless we establish that repair or 
replacement was not possible between the time of failure or breakdown 
and the time the damaging temperatures occurred); or
    (ii) The lowest temperature or its duration exceeded the ability of 
the required cold protection equipment to keep the insured plants from 
sustaining cold damage;
    (5) Collapse or failure of buildings or structures, unless the 
damage to the building or structures results from a cause of loss 
specified in section 10(a); or
    (6) Failure of plants to grow to an expected size due to drought.

                11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

    (a) In addition to your duties contained in section 14 of the Basic 
Provisions,
    (1) You must obtain our written consent prior to:
    (i) Destroying, selling or otherwise disposing of any plant 
inventory that is damaged; or

[[Page 313]]

    (ii) Changing or discontinuing your normal growing practices with 
respect to care and maintenance of the insured plants.
    (2) You must submit a claim for indemnity to us on our form, not 
later than 60 days after the date of your loss, but in no event later 
than 60 days after the end of the insurance period.
    (b) Failure to obtain our written consent as required by section 
11(a)(1) will result in the denial of your claim.

                         12. Settlement of Claim

    We will determine indemnities for any unit as follows:
    (a) Determine the under report factor for the basic unit;
    (b) Determine the occurrence deductible;
    (c) Subtract field market value B from field market value A;
    (d) Multiply the result of 12(c) by the under report factor;
    (e) Subtract the occurrence deductible from the result in section 
12(d); and
    (f) If the result of section 12(e) is greater than zero, and subject 
to the limit of section 12(g), your indemnity equals the result of 
section 12(e), multiplied by your price election, and multiplied by your 
share.
    (g) The total of all indemnities for the crop year will not exceed 
the amount of insurance including any peak amount of insurance during 
the coverage term of the peak inventory endorsement.

                     13. Late and Prevented Planting

    The late and prevented planting provisions in the Basic Provisions 
are not applicable.

                         14. Written Agreements

    (a) In lieu of section 18(a) of the Basic Provisions, for the year 
of application you must request a written agreement in writing with the 
application and not later than the cancellation date for each subsequent 
crop year;
    (b) In addition to the requirements of section 18 of the Basic 
Provisions any written agreement is valid only until the end of the 
insurance period; and
    (c) In lieu of section 18(e) of the Basic Provisions, an application 
for a written agreement submitted after the date of application for the 
initial year and the cancellation date for all subsequent crop years may 
be approved if you demonstrate your physical inability to have applied 
timely and, after physical examination of the nursery plant inventory, 
we determine the inventory will be marketable at the value shown on the 
plant value inventory report.

                              15. Examples

                           Single Unit Example

    Assume you have a 100 percent share and the plant inventory value 
reported by you is $100,000, your coverage level is 75 percent, and your 
price election is 75 percent. Your amount of insurance is $56,250 
($100,000 x .75 x .75). At the time of loss, field market value A is 
$125,000, field market value B is $80,000, and field market value C is 
$125,000. The under report factor is .80 ($100,000 divided by $125,000). 
The deductible percentage is 25 percent (100-75), the crop year 
deductible is $25,000 (.25 x $100,000) and the occurrence deductible is 
$25,000 (.25 x $125,000 x .80). Your indemnity would be calculated as 
follows:
    Step (1) Determine the under report factor
    $100,000 / $125,000= .80;
    Step (2) Field market value A minus field market value B
    $125,000 - $80,000 = $45,000;
    Step (3) Result of step 2 multiplied by the under report factor 
(step 1)
    $45,000 x .80 = $36,000;
    Step (4) Result of step 3 minus the occurrence deductible
    $36,000 - $25,000 = $11,000;
    Step (5) Result of step 4 multiplied by your price election
    $11,000 x .75 = $8,250;
    Step (6) Result of step 5 multiplied by your share
    $8,250 x 1.000 = $8,250 indemnity payment.

                      Peak Inventory Report Example

    Assume you have a second loss on the same basic unit. Your amount of 
insurance has been reduced by subtracting your previous indemnity 
payment or $8,250 from your amount of insurance ($56,250 - $8,250 = 
$48,000). Your crop year deductible has been reduced to zero by the 
previous loss ($25,000--$36,000, but not less than zero). You purchase a 
Peak Inventory Endorsement and report $60,000 in inventory. Your peak 
amount of insurance is your reported inventory times your coverage level 
times your price election ($60,000 x .75 x .75 = $33,750). The combined 
amount of insurance for the coverage term of the peak endorsement is 
$48,000 + $33,750 = $81,750. Your crop year deductible is increased by 
$15,000 ($60,000 x .25). At the time of loss, field market value A is 
$124,000, field market value B is $58,000, and field market value C is 
$124,000. The under report factor is 1.00 [($160,000 - $36,000) / 
$124,000]. The crop year deductible is $15,000 (.25 x $60,000) and the 
occurrence deductible is $15,000 (the lesser of field market value A x 
.25 or the crop year deductible). Your indemnity would be calculated as 
follows:
    Step (1) Determine the under report factor
    ($160,000-$36,000) / $124,000 = 1.00;
    Step (2) Field market value A minus field market value B
    $124,000 - $58,000 = $66,000;
    Step (3) Result of step 2 multiplied by the under report factor 
(step 1)
    $66,000 x 1.00 = $66,000;
    Step (4) Result of step 3 minus the occurrence deductible

[[Page 314]]

    $66,000 - $15,000 = $51,000;
    Step (5) Result of step 4 multiplied by your price election
    $51,000 x .75 = $38,250;
    Step (6) Result of step 5 multiplied by your share
    $38,250 x 1.000 = $38,250 indemnity payment.
    Your peak amount of insurance is reduced to zero. Your amount of 
insurance is reduced by the amount the indemnity exceeds the peak amount 
of insurance. $48,000-($38,250-$33,750) = $48,000 - $4,500 = $43,500

                   Multiple Unit Multiple Loss Example

    Assume you have a 100 percent share and the plant inventory value 
reported by you is $100,000, your coverage level is 75 percent, and your 
price election is 75 percent. You have elected optional units and have 
two optional units, unit 1 and unit 2. Your amount of insurance is 
$56,250 ($100,000 x .75 x .75). You have a loss on unit 1 and no loss on 
unit 2. At the time of loss, field market value A on unit 1 is $60,000, 
field market value B on unit 1 is $18,000, and field market value C is 
$125,000. The under report factor is .80 ($100,000 / $125,000). The 
deductible percentage is 25 percent (100-75), the crop year deductible 
is $25,000 (.25 x $100,000) and the occurrence deductible is $12,000 
(.25 x $60,000 x .80). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:
    Step (1) Determine the under report factor
    $100,000 / $125,000 = .80;
    Step (2) Field market value A minus field market value B
    $60,000 - $18,000 = $42,000;
    Step (3) Result of step 2 multiplied by the under report factor 
(step 1)
    $42,000 x .80 = $33,600;
    Step (4) Result of step 3 minus the occurrence deductible
    $33,600 - $12,000 = $21,600;
    Step (5) Result of step 4 multiplied by your price election
    $21,600 x .75 = $16,200;
    Step (6) Result of step 5 multiplied by your share
    $16,200 x 1.000 = $16,200 indemnity payment.
    Your crop year deductible is reduced to $13,000 ($25,000-$12,000). 
Your amount of insurance is reduced to $40,050 ($56,250-$16,200). You do 
not restock unit 1 after the first loss. Values on unit 2 do not change 
from the those measured at the time of the loss on unit 1. Assume you 
have a second loss during the crop year but this time on unit 2. Field 
market value A on unit 2 is $65,000, Field market value B on unit 2 is $ 
0.00 and field market value C on the basic unit is $83,000. Your loss 
would be determined as follows:

    Step (1)  Determine the under report factor
    $66,400 / $83,000= .80;
    Step (2) Field market value A minus field market value B
    $65,000 - $0.00 = $65,000;
    Step (3) Result of step 2 multiplied by the under report factor 
(step 1)
    $65,000 x .80 = $52,000;
    Step (4) Result of step 3 minus the occurrence deductible
    $52,000 - $13,000 = $39,000;
    Step (5) Result of step 4 multiplied by your price election
    $39,000 x .75 = $29,250;
    Step (6) Result of step 5 multiplied by your share
    $29,250 x 1.000 = $29,250 indemnity payment.

swathed prior to combining is not considered harvested.
    Late planting period. In lieu of the definition of ``Late planting 
period'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, late planting 
period is defined as the period that begins the day after the final 
planting date for the insured crop and ends 20 days after the final 
planting date.
    Local market price. The cash price for millet with a 50-pound test 
weight adjusted to zero percent foreign material content basis offered 
by buyers in the area in which you normally market the millet. Factors 
not associated with grading, including, but not limited to moisture 
content, will not be considered.
    Millet. Proso millet produced for grain to be used primarily as bird 
and livestock feed.
    Nurse crop (companion crop). A crop planted into the same acreage as 
another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and that is 
planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is 
grown.
    Planted acreage. In addition to the definition of ``Planted 
acreage'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, planted 
acreage is also defined as land on which seed is initially spread onto 
the soil surface by any method and is subsequently mechanically 
incorporated into the soil in a timely manner and at the proper depth. 
Acreage planted in any manner not contained in the definition of 
``planted acreage'' will not be insurable unless otherwise provided by 
the Special Provisions.
    Swathed. Severance of the stem and grain head from the ground 
without removal of the seed from the head and placing into a windrow.
    Windrow. Millet that is cut and placed in a row.

this policy.
    3. Contract Changes.
    In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract 
change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date.
    4. Cancellation and Termination Dates.
    In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the 
cancellation and termination dates are March 15.
    5. Insured Crop.
    In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop 
insured will be all the millet in the county for which a premium rate is 
provided by the actuarial documents:
    (a) In which you have a share;
    (b) That is planted for harvest as grain;
    (c) That is not planted as a nurse crop; and
    (d) That is not (unless allowed by Special Provisions or written 
agreement):
    (1) Interplanted with another crop; or
    (2) Planted into an established grass or legume.
    6. Insurable Acreage.
    In addition to section 9 of the Basic Provisions, any acreage of the 
insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that 
a majority of producers in the area would not normally further care for 
the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to 
replant.
    7. Insurance Period.
    In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the calendar 
date for the end of the insurance period is the date immediately 
following planting as follows:
    (a) North Dakota and South Dakota:
    (1) September 15 for acreage not swathed and windrowed; or
    (2) October 10 for acreage swathed and windrowed by September 15;
    (b) All other states, unless otherwise specified in the Special 
Provisions:
    (1) September 30 for acreage not swathed and windrowed by September 
30; or
    (2) October 15 for acreage swathed and windrowed by September 30.
    8. Causes of Loss.
    In accordance with section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is 
provided only against the following causes of loss that occur within the 
insurance period:
    (a) Adverse weather conditions;
    (b) Fire;
    (c) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of pest control measures;
    (d) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper 
application of disease control measures;
    (e) Wildlife;
    (f) Earthquake;
    (g) Volcanic eruption; or
    (h) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a cause of 
loss that occurs during the insurance period.
    9. Duties In the Event of Damage or Loss.
    In accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the 
representative samples of the unharvested crop must be at least 10 feet 
wide and extend the entire length of each field in the unit. The samples 
must not be harvested or destroyed until the earlier of our inspection 
or 15 days after harvest of the balance of the unit is completed.
    10. Settlement of Claim.
    (a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you 
are unable to provide records of production:
    (1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for 
which acceptable records of production were not provided; or
    (2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production 
to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage 
for each unit.
    (b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will 
settle your claim on any unit by:
    (1) Multiplying the insured acreage by the production guarantee;
    (2) Subtracting the total production to count (See section 10(c)) 
from the result of section 10(b)(1);
    (3) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(2) by your price 
election; and
    (4) Multiplying the result of section 10(b)(3) by your share and any 
adjustment from section 10(f).
    For example:
    You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of millet in the unit, 
with a guarantee of 15 bushels per acre and a price election of $4.00 
per bushel. You are only able to harvest 800 bushels. Your indemnity 
would be calculated as follows:
    (1) 100 acres x 15 bushel = 1,500 bushel guarantee;
    (2)1,500 bushels guarantee - 800 bushel production to count = 700 
bushel loss;
    (3) 700 bushel x $4.00 price election = $2,800 loss; and
    (4) $2,800 x 100 percent share = $2,800 indemnity payment.
    (c) The total production (bushels) to count from all insurable 
acreage on the unit will include:
    (1) All appraised production as follows:
    (i) Your appraised production will not be less than the production 
guarantee for acreage:
    (A) That is abandoned;
    (B) Put to another use without our consent;
    (C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or
    (D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are 
acceptable to us;
    (ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;
    (iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be 
adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with 
subsection 10(d));

[[Page 317]]

    (iv) Potential production on insured acreage you want to put to 
another use or you wish to abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised 
amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that 
acreage will end if you put the acreage to another use or abandon the 
crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:
    (A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may 
give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave 
intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the 
crop in locations acceptable to us. (The amount of production to count 
for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals 
from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not 
leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient 
care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to 
put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of 
production to count); or
    (B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of 
production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or 
our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not 
harvested; and
    (2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.
    (d) Mature millet may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality 
deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made 
prior to any adjustment for quality.
    (1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each 0.1 percent 
point of moisture in excess of 12 percent. We may obtain samples of the 
production to determine the moisture content.
    (2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:
    (i) Deficiencies in quality, result in the millet weighing less than 
50 pounds per bushel; or
    (ii) Substances or conditions are present that are identified by the 
Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the 
United States as being injurious to human or animal health.
    (3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:
    (i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a 
cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop 
provisions and within the insurance period;
    (ii) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a net 
price for the damaged production that is less than the local market 
price;
    (iii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or 
conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by 
a disinterested third party approved by us; and
    (iv) The samples are analyzed by a grader or by a laboratory 
approved by us with regard to substances or conditions injurious to 
human or animal health (test weight for quality adjustment purposes may 
be determined by our loss adjuster).
    (4) Millet production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as 
specified in sections 10(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality 
adjustment factor contained in the Special Provisions if quality 
adjustment factors are not available in the county, the eligible millet 
production will be reduced as follows:
    (i) The market price of the qualifying damaged production and the 
local market price will be determined on the earlier of the date such 
quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for 
the unit.
    (ii) The price for the qualifying damaged production will be the 
market price for the local area to the extent feasible. Discounts used 
to establish the net price of the damaged production will be limited to 
those that are usual, customary, and reasonable. The price will not be 
reduced for:
    (A) Moisture content;
    (B) Damage due to uninsured causes; or
    (C) Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with 
normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of the millet; except, if the 
value of the damaged production can be increased by conditioning, we may 
reduce the value of the production after it has been conditioned by the 
cost of conditioning but not lower than the value of the production 
before conditioning. We may obtain prices from any buyer of our choice. 
If we obtain prices from one or more buyers located outside your local 
market area, we will reduce such prices by the additional costs required 
to deliver the millet to those buyers.
    (iii) The value of the damaged or conditioned production determined 
in section 10(d)(4)(ii) will be divided by the local market price to 
determine the quality adjustment factor;
    (iv) The number of bushels remaining after any reduction due to 
excessive moisture (the moisture-adjusted gross bushel, if appropriate) 
of the damaged or conditioned production under section 10(d)(1) will 
then be multiplied by the quality adjustment factor from section 
10(d)(4)(iii) to determine the production to count.
    (e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop 
may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.
    (f) If the insured crop is not swathed and not harvested, the amount 
of indemnity payable under section 10(b)(4) will be reduced by 30 
percent to reflect those costs not incurred by you. If the insured crop 
is swathed but not harvested, the amount of indemnity payable under 
section 10(b)(4) will be reduced by 15 percent to reflect those costs 
not incurred by you.

[[Page 318]]

    11. Late Planting.
    In lieu of the provisions contained in section 16(a) of the Basic 
Provisions, the production guarantee for each acre planted to the 
insured crop during the late planting period, unless otherwise specified 
in the Special Provisions, will be reduced by:
    (a) One percent for the first through the tenth day; and
    (b) Three percent for the eleventh through the twentieth day.
    12. Prevented Planting.
    Your prevented planting coverage will be 60 percent of your 
production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have an 
additional coverage level, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, 
and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting 
coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.

Secretary of Agriculture in part 1, subpart A of this title and appendix 
A thereto, implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 
552). The Secretary's regulations, as implemented by the regulations in 
this part, govern the availability of records of the Agricultural 
Research Service (ARS) to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 510.2  Public inspection, copying, and indexing.

    5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) requires that certain materials be made available 
for public inspection and copying and that a current index of these 
materials be published quarterly or otherwise be made available. Members 
of the public may request access to such materials maintained by ARS at 
the following office: Information Staff, ARS, REE, USDA, Room 1-2248, 
Mail Stop 5128, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705-5128;

such requests in accordance with Subsection 1.3(c) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 510.4  Multitrack processing.

    (a) When ARS has a significant number of requests, the nature of 
which precludes a determination within 20 working days, the requests may 
be processed in a multitrack processing system, based on the date of 
receipt, the amount of work and time involved in processing the request, 
and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing.
    (b) ARS may establish as many processing tracks as appropriate; 
processing within each track shall be based

[[Page 335]]

on a first-in, first-out concept, and rank-ordered by the date of 
receipt of the request.
    (c) A requester whose request does not qualify for the fastest track 
may be given an opportunity to limit the scope of the request in order 
to qualify for the fastest track. This multitrack processing system does 
not lessen agency responsibility to exercise due diligence in processing 
requests in the most expeditious manner possible.
    (d) ARS shall process requests in each track on a ``first-in, first-
out'' basis, unless there are unusual circumstances as set forth in 
Sec. 1.16 of this title, or the requester is entitled to expedited 
processing as set forth in Sec. 1.9 of this title.

    Authority: National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as amended, 42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514, 34 FR 4247, as amended by E.O. 11991, 
42 FR 26927; E.O. 12144, 44 FR 11957; 5 U.S.C. 301; 40 CFR 1500-1508.

    Source: 51 FR 34191, Sept. 25, 1986, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 520.1  General statement.

    These procedures assure that research and other activities of the 
Agricultural Research Service (ARS) comply with the intent of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and appropriate 
regulations implementing this Act. These procedures incorporate and 
supplement, and are not a substitute for, CEQ regulations under 40 CFR 
parts 1500-1508, and Department of Agriculture NEPA Policies and 
Procedures under 7 CFR part 1b. ARS conducts and supports research as 
authorized by legislation to support one of the USDA goals of assuring 
adequate supplies of high quality food and fiber. Information generated 
through such research often forms the basic data needed to assess the 
impact of a new technology upon the environment. Large scale projects 
simulating commercial practices are normally implemented in cooperation 
with other agencies of the Federal or State Governments.


<R05>
Sec. 520.2  Definition.

    Control Agents mean biological material or chemicals which are 
intended to enhance the production efficiency of an agricultural crop or 
animal such as through elimination of a pest.


<R05>
Sec. 520.3  Policy.

    (a) It is ARS policy to comply with the provisions of NEPA and 
related laws and policies.
    (b) Environmental documents should be concise, written in plain 
language, and address the issues pertinent to the decision being made.
    (c) Environmental documents may be substituted or combined with 
other reports which serve to facilitate decisionmaking.
    (d) Costs of analyses and environmental documents are to be planned 
for during the budgetary process for the plan, program, or project. 
Special provisions for financing NEPA process activities which are 
unanticipated and extraordinary may be made in the Office of the 
Administrator of ARS.
    (e) ARS personnel will cooperate with other agencies, States, 
contractors, or other entities proposing to undertake activities 
involving the ARS to assure that NEPA considerations are

[[Page 336]]

addressed early in the planning process to avoid delays and conflicts as 
required by 40 CFR 1501.2.
    (f) For some activities, project participants outside ARS may be 
required to provide data and documentation. When an applicant or 
contractor prepares an environmental assessment (EA) or a contractor 
prepares an environmental impact statement (EIS), the activities shall 
be carried out according to 40 CFR 1506.5.
    (g) Environmental documents, decision notices, and records of 
decision must be made available for review by the public. There shall be 
an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be 
addressed in the environmental analysis process (40 CFR 1501.7).
    (h) The concepts of tiering to eliminate repetitive discussions 
applicable to EIS's (40 CFR Part 1502) are also applicable to EA's.
    (i) ARS personnel may adopt an existing EA or EIS when a proposed 
action is substantially the same as the action for which the existing EA 
or EIS was prepared (40 CFR 1506.3 (b)).
    (j) ARS personnel may incorporate by reference any existing 
documents in order to reduce the bulk of an EA or EIS (40 CFR 1502.21).
    (k) After prior consultation with the Council on Environmental 
Quality, ARS personnel may forego preparation of an EA or EIS in 
emergency situations (40 CFR 1506.11).


<R05>
Sec. 520.4  Responsibilities.

    (a) Administrator. The Administrator is responsible for 
environmental analysis and documentation required for compliance with 
the provisions of NEPA and related laws, policies, plans, programs, and 
projects. The ARS Assistant Administrator for Cooperative Interactions 
has been delegated responsibility for the establishment of procedures 
and coordination necessary to carry out the policies and provisions of 
NEPA.
    (b) Deputy Administrators and Area Directors. The Deputy 
Administrators and Area Directors are responsible to the Administrator 
for assuring that ARS programs are in compliance with the policies and 
procedures of NEPA.


<R05>
Sec. 520.5  Categorical exclusions.

    For the following categories of actions, the preparation of an EA or 
EIS is not required:
    (a) Department of Agriculture categorical exclusions (7 CFR 1b.3).
    (1) Policy development, planning and implementation which are 
related to routine activities such as personnel, organizational changes 
or similar administrative functions;
    (2) Activities which deal solely with the functions of programs, 
such as program budget proposals, disbursement, transfer or 
reprogramming of funds;
    (3) Inventories, research activities and studies, such as resource 
inventories and routine data collection when such actions are clearly 
limited in context and intensity;
    (4) Educational and information programs and activities;
    (5) Activities which are advisory and consultative to other 
agencies, public and private entities, and
    (6) Activities related to trade representation and market 
development activities overseas.
    (b) ARS categorical exclusions. ARS actions which, based on previous 
experience, have been found to have limited scope and intensity and 
produce little or no individual or cumulative impacts to the human 
environment. Some examples are:
    (1) Repair, replacement of structural components or equipment, or 
other routine maintenance of facilities controlled in whole or in part 
by ARS;
    (2) Research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or 
with only short-term effects on the environment. Examples are:
    (i) Research operations conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse 
or other contained facility where research practices and safeguards 
prevent environment impacts such as the release of hazardous materials 
into the environment;
    (ii) Inventories, studies or other such activities that have limited 
context and minimal intensity in terms of changes in the environment;
    (iii) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated 
field plots, which does not involve the use of control agents requiring 
containment

[[Page 337]]

or a special license or a permit from a regulatory agency.
    (c) Exceptions to categorical exclusions. An environmental 
assessment shall be prepared for an activity which is normally within 
the purview of categorical exclusion if there are extraordinary 
circumstances which may cause such activity to have a significant 
environmental effect.


<R05>
Sec. 520.6  Preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA).

    (a) Actions requiring EA. The following actions would normally 
require an EA:
    (1) Programs, supported in the majority by ARS, which may assist in 
the transition of a particular technology from field evaluation stage to 
large-scale demonstration or simulated commercial phase;
    (2) Field work having an impact on the local environment such as 
earth excavation, explosives, weather modifications, or other such 
techniques; and
    (3) The testing outside the laboratory, such as small isolated field 
plots, of control agents which require containment precautions or either 
a special license or a permit from a regulatory agency.
    (b) Multiple agencies actions. If more than one Federal agency 
participates in a program activity, the EA shall be prepared by the lead 
agency as provided in 40 CFR 1501.5.
    (c) Format and conclusion. An EA can be in any format provided it 
covers in a logical and succinct fashion the information necessary for 
determining whether a proposed Federal action may have a significant 
environmental impact and thus warrant preparation of an EIS. The EA will 
contain the information required by 40 CFR 1508.9. This information will 
include brief discussions of the need for the project or other proposal, 
alternatives, environmental impacts of the proposed action and 
alternatives and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.
    (d) Decision notice. Upon completion of an EA, the responsible 
official will consider the information it contains, decide whether an 
EIS is required or that no significant environmental impact will occur, 
and will document the decision and the reasons for it. The decision and 
the EA shall be available to the public in a manner appropriate to the 
situation. If there is a finding of no significant impact, the EA may be 
combined with the decision notice.


<R05>
Sec. 520.7  Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

    (a) Actions requiring EIS. An EIS will normally be prepared for:
    (1) Proposals for legislation which are determined to be a major 
Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment; or,
    (2) Other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality 
of the human environment. In the experience of ARS, an environmental 
impact statement shall normally be required in situations when a 
research project has advanced beyond the laboratory and small plot 
testing to full scale field testing over a very large area and involving 
the introduction of control agents.
    (b) Notice of intent. If the responsible official recommends the 
preparation of an EIS, then the public shall be apprised of the 
decision. This notice shall be prepared according to 40 CFR 1508.22.
    (c) Draft and final EIS. The process of preparing the draft and 
final EIS, as well as the format, shall be according to 40 CFR parts 
1502-1506.
    (d) Decisionmaking and implementation. The responsible official may 
make a decision no sooner than thirty days after the notice of 
availability of the final EIS has been published in the Federal Register 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 1506.10). The decision 
will be documented in a Record of Decision required by 40 CFR 1502.2, 
and monitoring and mitigation activities will be implemented as required 
by 40 CFR 1505.3.

Sec. 600.1  General.

    (a) The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was authorized 
by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture 
Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-354, 7 U.S.C. 6901 note) and 
established by Secretary's Memorandum 1010-1 (2.b.6), Reorganization of 
the Department of Agriculture, to provide national leadership in the 
conservation, development, and productive use of the Nation's natural 
resources. Such leadership encompasses the conservation of soil, water, 
air, plant, and animal resources with consideration of the many human 
(economic and sociological) interactions. NRCS is the Federal agency 
that works with landowners on private lands to help them conserve their 
natural resources. NRCS employees are highly skilled in many scientific 
and technical specialties, including soil science, soil conservation, 
agronomy, biology, agroecology, range conservation, forestry, 
engineering, geology, hydrology, wetlands science, cultural resources, 
and economics. NRCS was formerly the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) 
which was established by the Soil Conservation Act of 1935 (Pub. L. 74-
46, 49 Stat. 163 (16 U.S.C. 590 (a-f))). NRCS has responsibility for 
three major areas:
    (1) Soil and water conservation;
    (2) Natural resource surveys including soil surveys, resources 
inventory, snow surveys, and water supply forecasting; and
    (3) Community resource protection and management including watershed 
projects, river basin studies and investigations, resource conservation 
and development areas, land evaluation and site assessment, and 
emergency watershed protection. In addition, NRCS has leadership for the 
Wetlands Reserve Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, 
Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative, Farmland Protection Program, 
Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, Forestry Incentives Program, and 
Conservation Farm Option. NRCS provides technical support for the 
Conservation Reserve Program.
    (b) The NRCS organization consists of a National Headquarters 
located in Washington, D.C.; six regional offices; 50 state offices and 
two equivalent offices in the Caribbean Area and the U.S. Trust 
Territories of the Pacific Basin Area; approximately 2,500 field offices 
and 300 specialized offices; 26 plant materials centers; 17 major land 
resource area soil survey offices; nine national centers; and seven 
national institutes. A Chief who reports to the USDA Under Secretary for 
Natural Resources and Environment heads NRCS.


<R05>
Sec. 600.2  National headquarters.

    (a) Chief. The Chief, with assistance of the Associate Chief, is 
responsible for administering a coordinated national program of natural 
resource conservation; planning, directing, and coordinating all 
program, technical, and administrative activities of NRCS; developing

<R05>
Sec. 601.1  Functions assigned.

    The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is the Federal 
agency that works with private landowners to conserve their natural 
resources. NRCS employees help land users and communities approach 
conservation planning and implementation with an understanding of how 
natural resources relate to each other and to people--and how human 
activities affect those resources. The agency emphasizes voluntary, 
science-based assistance, partnerships, and cooperative problem solving 
at the community level. The mission of NRCS is to work on the Nation's 
non-Federal lands to conserve, improve, and sustain natural resources. 
The following functions support the mission.
    (a) NRCS facilitates and provides conservation technical assistance 
at the local level that helps people assess their natural resource 
conditions and needs, set goals, identify programs and other resources 
to address those needs, develop proposals and recommendations, implement 
solutions, and measure their success. The agency's role is to assist 
with:
    (1) Resource inventories,
    (2) Resource assessments,
    (3) Planning assistance, and/or
    (4) Technical assistance.
    (b) NRCS provides technical assistance through local conservation 
districts to land users, communities, watershed groups, Federal and 
State agencies, other partners, and customers.
    (c) NRCS provides assistance on a voluntary basis.
    (d) The agency's work focuses on soil, water, air, plant, and animal 
conservation including erosion reduction, water quality improvement, 
wetland restoration and protection, fish and wildlife habitat 
improvement, range management, stream restoration, water management, and 
other natural resource issues.
    (e) Through the conservation operations program, NRCS maintains a 
cadre of conservationists and interdisciplinary technical experts who 
provide landowners with advice and recommendations. Science based 
procedures and techniques are based on new knowledge and research 
provided by the Agricultural Research Service and others. NRCS developed 
and maintains a system of directives--including manuals, handbooks, and 
technical references--to institutionalize new methods, procedures, and 
standards used to deliver technical assistance at the field level.
    (f) NRCS has general responsibility for administration of the 
following programs:
    (1) Conservation operations, authorized by the Soil Conservation Act 
of 1935 and the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977. 
Activities include:
    (i) Conservation technical assistance to land users, communities, 
units of State and local government, and other Federal agencies in 
planning and implementing natural resource solutions to reduce erosion, 
improve soil and water quantity and quality, improve and conserve 
wetlands, enhance fish and wildlife habitat, improve air quality, 
improve pasture and range conditions, reduce upstream flooding, and 
improve woodlands. Assistance is also provided to implement the highly 
erodible land (HEL) and wetland conservation (Swampbuster) provisions 
and--on a reimbursable basis--the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and 
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the 1985 Food Security Act, as 
amended by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 and 
Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. NRCS technical 
field staff make HEL and wetland determinations and assist land users to 
develop and implement conservation plans needed

[[Page 345]]

to ensure compliance with the law. NRCS is also the lead Federal agency 
for delineating wetlands on agricultural lands for purposes of 
implementing both the provisions of the Food Security Act and Section 
404 of the Clean Water Act.
    (ii) Soil surveys that provide the public with local information on 
the uses and capabilities of their soil resource. Soil surveys are based 
on scientific analysis and classification of the soils and are used to 
determine land capabilities and conservation treatment needs. Surveys 
are conducted cooperatively with other Federal agencies, land grant 
universities, State agencies, and local units of government. NRCS is the 
world leader in soil classification and soil mapping, and is expanding 
into soil quality.
    (iii) Snow survey and water supply forecasts that provide western 
States and Alaska with vital information and forecasts of seasonable 
variable water supplies. NRCS field staff in cooperation with partnering 
organizations manually collect data from 850 remote high mountain sites. 
Data is electronically collected from an additional 600 SNOTEL 
(automated snowpack telemetry network) sites. In cooperation with the 
National Weather Service, the data is assembled and analyzed. Then, NRCS 
staff develop seasonal water supply forecasts.
    (iv) Plant Material Centers that assemble, test, and encourage 
increased plant propagation and usefulness of plant species for biomass 
production, carbon sequestration, erosion reduction, wetland 
restoration, water quality improvement, streambank and riparian area 
protection, coastal dune stabilization, and to meet other special 
conservation treatment needs. The work is carried out cooperatively with 
State and Federal agencies, private organizations, commercial 
businesses, and seed and nursery associations. After species are proven, 
they are released to the private sector for commercial production.
    (v) National Resources Inventory (NRI) that is a statistically-based 
survey designed and implemented using scientific principles to assess 
conditions and trends of soil, water, and related resources on 
nonfederal lands in the United States. The NRI captures data on land 
cover and use, soil erosion, prime farmland, wetlands, habitat 
diversity, selected conservation practices, and related attributes at 
thousands of scientifically selected sample sites in all 50 states, 
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and some Pacific Basin locations.
    (2) Conservation programs in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and 
Reform Act of 1996, most of which are funded by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation (CCC). NRCS provides leadership and technical assistance for 
the following programs:
    (i) Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). EQIP provides a 
single, voluntary conservation program for farmers and ranchers who face 
serious threats to soil, water, and related natural resources. 
Nationally, it provides technical, financial, and educational 
assistance, half of it targeted to livestock-related natural resource 
problems and half to more general conservation priorities.
    (ii) Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). WRP is a voluntary program to 
restore and protect wetlands on private property. It provides an 
opportunity for landowners to receive financial incentives to restore 
wetlands in exchange for retiring marginal agricultural land.
    (iii) Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP). WHIP is a 
voluntary program for people who want to develop and improve wildlife 
habitat on private lands. It provides both technical assistance and cost 
sharing to help establish and improve fish and wildlife habitat.
    (iv) Farmland Protection Program (FPP). This program provides funds 
to help purchase development rights to keep productive farmland in 
agricultural use. Working through existing programs, USDA joins with 
State, tribal, or local governments to acquire voluntary conservation 
easements or other interests from landowners.
    (v) Forestry Incentives Program (FIP). FIP supports good forest 
management practices on privately owned, non-industrial forest lands 
nationwide. FIP is designed to benefit the environment while meeting 
future demands for wood products. Although not funded by CCC, Section 
373 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996

[[Page 346]]

extended the program under discretionary appropriations.
    (3) Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) Program, authorized 
by Section 102 of the Flood and Agriculture Act of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-702) 
and Sections 1528-1538 of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 
97-98). This program is initiated and directed at the local level by 
volunteers who involve multiple communities, various units of 
government, municipalities, and grassroots organizations. RC&D is a 
catalyst for civic-oriented groups to share knowledge and resources in a 
collective attempt to solve common problems. The program offers aid in 
balancing the environmental, economic, and social needs of an area.
    (4) Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) and other responsibilities 
assigned under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 
(Pub. L. 95-87). Under RAMP, NRCS provides technical and financial 
assistance to landowners to reclaim certain abandoned coal-mined lands. 
This assistance can be used to reclaim these lands for approved uses, 
which include pasture, range, woodland, cropland, noncommercial 
recreation, and wildlife habitat. The program's first priority is to 
protect public health, welfare, safety, and property from hazards caused 
by past surface coal mining or by surface effects of deep mining.
    (5) Watershed surveys and planning, authorized by the Watershed 
Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Pub. L. 83-566, Section 6 (16 
U.S.C. 1001-1008)). The 1996 appropriations act combined the Small 
Watershed Planning and the River Basin Surveys and Investigations 
programs into a new program called the Watershed Surveys and Planning 
Program. The program involves cooperation with other Federal, State, and 
local agencies to conduct watershed planning, river basin surveys and 
investigations, flood hazard analysis, and floodplain management 
assistance, which aid in the development of coordinated water resource 
programs, including the development of guiding principles and 
procedures.
    (6) Watershed and flood prevention operations include several 
activities. Watershed operations are authorized by the Flood Control Act 
of 1944 (Public Law 78-534) and the Watershed Protection and Flood 
Prevention Act of 1954 (Public Law 87-566) and amendments; both of which 
are addressed by 7 CFR 622. Since 1998, the appropriations act for the 
Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (Public Law 83-566) has 
included funds, not to exceed a specified amount, that may be used for 
Public Law 78-534 projects.
    (i) Publc Law 83-566 and Public Law 78-534, jointly called the Small 
Watershed Program, authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate 
with State and local agencies to plan and carry out works of improvement 
for flood prevention; for the conservation, development, utilization, 
and disposal of water; and for the conservation and proper use of land 
in watershed or sub-watershed areas. Under Public Law 83-566, these 
areas shall not exceed 250,000 acres. There is no acreage limitation 
under Public Law 78-534.
    (ii) The Small Watershed Program provides for cooperation with State 
and other public agencies (called project sponsors) in the installation 
of planned works of improvement and land treatment measures in 
authorized watershed projects. Eligible measures include flood 
prevention, water conservation, recreation, agricultural water 
management, floodplain easements, municipal and industrial water, and 
rural water supply.
    (7) Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program, authorized by 
Section 216 of Public Law 81-516, 33 U.S.C. 701b-1, and Section 403 of 
the Agriculture Credit Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-334, 16 U.S.C. 2203), 
as amended by Section 382 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and 
Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127, 110 Stat. 888, 1016). EWP 
provides assistance to reduce an imminent threat to life and property 
caused by a sudden impairment of a watershed from a natural disaster. 
Emergency work includes such measures as removing debris from streams, 
stabilizing streambanks, repairing levees, critical area stabilization, 
and purchasing floodplain easements. Technical and financial assistance 
is available to sponsoring local organizations (units of government, 
Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and organizations formed by 
State law) for this disaster

[[Page 347]]

recovery work. Sponsors are required to provide the local share of the 
costs; obtain real property rights, water rights, and permits; and do 
any needed operation and maintenance.

    This subpart sets forth Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) 
policies and procedures for furnishing technical assistance in 
conservation operations.

[61 FR 27999, June 4, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 610.2  Scope.

    (a) Conservation operations, including technical assistance, is the 
basic soil and water conservation program of NRCS. This program is 
designed to:
    (1) Reduce soil losses from erosion;
    (2) Help solve soil, water, and agricultural waste management 
problems;
    (3) Bring about adjustments in land use as needed;
    (4) Reduce damage caused by excess water and sedimentation;
    (5) Enhance the quality of fish and wildlife habitat; and
    (6) Improve all agricultural lands, including cropland, forestland, 
and grazing lands that include pastureland, rangeland, and grazed 
forestland so that the long-term sustainability of the resource base is 
achieved.
    (b) The Natural Resources Conservation Service is USDA's technical 
agency for providing assistance to private landowners, conservation 
districts, and other organizations in planning and carrying out their 
conservation activities and programs. NRCS works with individuals, 
groups, and units of government to help them plan and carry out 
conservation decisions to meet their objectives.

[64 FR 42003, Aug. 3, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 610.3  Assistance through conservation districts.

    (a) Technical assistance is provided through and in cooperation with 
conservation districts in the 50 States, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These districts, formed under 
authority of State laws, are operated and controlled by local citizens. 
They provide the leadership and the program needed to meet the 
conservation objectives of the district.
    (b) NRCS furnishes technical assistance to conservation districts as 
specified in memorandums of understanding. Soil conservationists 
assigned to conservation districts work directly with land users and 
others according to the program needs and the priorities established by 
the conservation districts.
    (c) The practical experience of land users is combined with the 
scientific knowledge and skills of professional conservationists to plan 
and carry out locally formulated conservation programs.

[[Page 349]]

    (d) When requested, technical assistance may be provided to owners, 
operators, or groups using land that is under the jurisdiction of the 
United States Department of the Interior if such land is included in a 
conservation district or if assistance is in accordance with memorandums 
of understanding identifying the coordination of agency activities.


<R05>
Sec. 610.4  Technical assistance furnished.

    The Natural Resources Conservation Service provides technical 
assistance to land users and others who are responsible for making 
decisions and setting policies that influence land use, conservation 
treatment, and resource management. Technical assistance furnished by 
NRCS consists of program assistance, planning assistance, application of 
conservation practices, and assistance in the technical phases of USDA 
cost-share programs.
    (a) Program assistance is provided to conservation districts and 
other organizations concerned with the conservation of soil, water, 
plant, and wildlife resources. This assistance includes providing 
resource inventory data and identifying conservation problems and needs 
in order for districts to develop long-range soil and water conservation 
programs. Individuals, groups, and organizations requesting NRCS 
assistance through conservation districts include:
    (1) Farmers, ranchers, and other land users concerned with the 
conservation of land and water resources.
    (2) County and other local government units such as park 
authorities, departments of public works, planning, zoning (rural, 
urban, and flood plain), school, and institution boards, highway 
departments, and tax assessors.
    (3) Citizen groups, youth groups, recreation groups, and garden 
clubs.
    (4) State and local units of government (highway, health, 
recreation, water resources, and regional planning) involved in 
establishing public policy regarding the use of resources.
    (5) Federal departments and agencies such as Defense, Housing and 
Urban Development, Public Roads, Health and Human Services; and 
Interior.
    (6) Professional consultants who provide services such as 
engineering, planning, environmental assessment, tax assessment, and 
forest management.
    (b) Planning assistance includes evaluation of soil, water, 
vegetation, and other resource data needed for making land use, 
environmental and conservation treatment decisions. NRCS helps land 
users make conservation plans for farms, ranches, and other land units. 
This help includes onsite planning assistance in making conservation 
plans. The plans are based on a soil survey and interpretations for the 
intended land uses and conservation treatment. Plans may also include 
other inventories of soil, water, plant, and related resources needed in 
the planning process. Information about the responses of each kind of 
soil and the conservation practices and resource management needed for 
different land uses is provided. The land user's decisions recorded in 
the plan are based on his conservation objectives. Conservation plans 
provide for the orderly installation of conservation practices. 
Conservation plans reflect changing conditions.
    (c) Application assistance is provided to help land users apply and 
maintain planned conservation work. NRCS assistance for applying the 
conservation practices in the plan may include:
    (1) Designing, constructing, and maintaining conservation practices;
    (2) Selecting management alternatives and cultural practices needed 
to establish and maintain vegetation; and
    (3) Other conservation practices needed to protect land and water 
resources.
    (d) The Natural Resources Conservation Service assists in carrying 
out certain phases of USDA soil and water conservation cost-share 
programs. NRCS assists individual program participants with conservation 
plans needed for long-term cost-share agreements. NRCS is assigned 
responsibility by the Secretary of Agriculture for technical phases of 
applying conservation practices on the land. This assignment includes:
    (1) Determining what practices are needed and feasible to install, 
(2) selecting sites and planning and designing practices, (3) providing 
assistance

[[Page 350]]

for installing practices, and (4) certifying that the work done is in 
accordance with NRCS standards and specifications.

(NRCS) to predict soil erosion due to water and wind. Section 301 of the 
Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIRA) and the 
Food Security Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3801-3813 specified that the 
Secretary would publish the universal soil loss equation (USLE) and wind 
erosion equation (WEQ) used by the Department within 60 days of the 
enactment of FAIRA. This subpart sets forth the equations, definition of 
factors, and provides the rules under which NRCS will utilize the USLE, 
the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), and the WEQ.


<R05>
Sec. 610.12  Equations for predicting soil loss due to water erosion.

    (a) The equation for predicting soil loss due to erosion for both 
the USLE and the RUSLE is A = R x K x LS x C x P. (For further 
information about USLE see the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook 
537, ``Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses--A Guide to Conservation 
Planning,'' dated 1978. Copies of this document are available from the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, DC 
20013. For further information about RUSLE see the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Handbook 703, ``Predicting Soil Erosion by Water: A Guide to 
Conservation Planning with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 
(RUSLE).'' Copies may be purchased from the National Technical 
Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.)
    (b) The factors in the USLE equation are:
    (1) A is the estimation of average annual soil loss in tons per acre 
caused by sheet and rill erosion.
    (2) R is the rainfall erosivity factor. Accounts for the energy and 
intensity of rainstorms.
    (3) K is the soil erodibility factor. Measures the susceptibility of 
a soil to erode under a standard condition.
    (4) LS is the slope length and steepness factor. Accounts for the 
effect of length and steepness of slope on erosion.
    (5) C is the cover and management factor. Estimates the soil loss 
ratio for each of 4 or 5 crop stage periods throughout the year, 
accounting for the combined effect of all the interrelated cover and 
management variables.
    (6) P is the support practice factor. Accounts for the effect of 
conservation support practices, such as contouring, contour 
stripcropping, and terraces on soil erosion.
    (c) The factors in the RUSLE equation are defined as follows:
    (1) A is the estimation of average annual soil loss in tons per acre 
caused by sheet and rill erosion.
    (2) R is the rainfall erosivity factor. Accounts for the energy and 
intensity of rainstorms.
    (3) K is the soil erodibility factor. Measures the susceptibility of 
a soil to erode under a standard condition and adjusts it bi-monthly for 
the effects of freezing and thawing, and soil moisture.
    (4) LS is the slope length and steepness factor. Accounts for the 
effect of

[[Page 351]]

length and steepness of slope on erosion based on 4 tables reflecting 
the relationship of rill to interrill erosion.
    (5) C is the cover and management factor. Estimates the soil loss 
ratio at one-half month intervals throughout the year, accounting for 
the individual effects of prior land use, crop canopy, surface cover, 
surface roughness, and soil moisture.
    (6) P is the support practice factor. Accounts for the effect of 
conservation support practices, such as cross-slope farming, 
stripcropping, buffer strips, and terraces on soil erosion.


<R05>
Sec. 610.13  Equations for predicting soil loss due to wind erosion.

    (a) The equation for predicting soil loss due to wind in the Wind 
Erosion Equation (WEQ) is E = f(IKCLV). (For further information on WEQ 
see the paper by N.P. Woodruff and F.H. Siddaway, 1965. ``A Wind Erosion 
Equation,'' Soil Science Society of America Proceedings, Vol. 29, No. 5, 
pages 602-608, which is available from the American Society of Agronomy, 
Madison, Wisconsin. In addition, the use of the WEQ in NRCS is explained 
in the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National Agronomy 
Manual, 190-V-NAM, second ed., Part 502, March, 1988, which is available 
from the NRCS, P.O. Box 2890, Washington, DC 20013.)
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The factors in the WEQ equation are defined as follows:
    (1) E is the estimation of the average annual soil loss in tons per 
acre.
    (2) f indicates the equation includes functional relationships that 
are not straight-line mathematical calculations.
    (3) I is the soil erodibility index. It is the potential for soil 
loss from a wide, level, unsheltered, isolated field with a bare, 
smooth, loose and uncrusted surface. Soil erodibility is based on soil 
surface texture, calcium carbonate content, and percent day.
    (4) K is the ridge roughness factor. It is a measure of the effect 
of ridges formed by tillage and planting implements on wind erosion. The 
ridge roughness is based on ridge spacing, height, and erosive wind 
directions in relation to the ridge direction
    (5) C is the climatic factor. It is a measure of the erosive 
potential of the wind speed and surface moisture at a given location 
compared with the same factors at Garden City, Kansas. The annual 
climatic factor at Garden City is arbitrarily set at 100. All climatic 
factor values are expressed as a percentage of that at Garden City.
    (6) L is the unsheltered distance. It is the unsheltered distance 
across an erodible field, measured along the prevailing wind erosion 
direction. This distance is measured beginning at a stable border on the 
upwind side and continuing downward to the nonerodible or stable area, 
or to the downwind edge of the area being evaluated.
    (7) V is the vegetative cover factor. It accounts for the kind, 
amount, and orientation of growing plants or plant residue on the soil 
surface.


<R05>
Sec. 610.14  Use of USLE, RUSLE, and WEQ.

    (a) All Highly Erodible Land (HEL) determinations are based on the 
formulas set forth in 7 CFR Sec. 12.21 using some of the factors from 
the USLE and WEQ and the factor values that were contained in the local 
Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) as of January 1, 1990. In addition, 
this includes the soil loss tolerance values used in those formulas for 
determining HEL. The soil loss tolerance value is used as one of the 
criteria for planning soil conservation systems. These values are 
available in the FOTG in the local field office of the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service.
    (b) RUSLE will be used to:
    (1)(i) Evaluate the soil loss estimates of conservation systems 
contained in the FOTG.
    (ii) Evaluate the soil loss estimates of systems actually applied, 
where those systems were applied differently than specified in the 
conservation plan adopted by the producer or where a conservation plan 
was not developed, in determining whether a producer has complied with 
the HEL conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as 
amended, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 3801 et seq., set forth in 7 CFR Part 12; and
    (2) Develop new or revised conservation plans.

             Subpart D--Conservation of Private Grazing Land

    Source: 67 FR 68497, Nov. 12, 2002, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 610.31  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the policies for the Conservation of 
Private Grazing Land (CPGL) Program, as authorized by Section 386 of the 
Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, (Pub. L. 104-
127, April 4, 1996) 16 U.S.C. 2005b. Under the CPGL Program, NRCS will 
provide technical assistance to landowners and managers who request 
assistance based on locally-established priorities and resource 
concerns. The purpose of the CPGL Program is to provide technical 
assistance to private grazing land owners and managers to voluntarily 
conserve or enhance grazing land resources to meet ecological, economic, 
and social demands.
    (b) The term ``private grazing land'' means private, State-owned, 
tribally owned, and any other non-federally owned rangeland, 
pastureland, grazed forestland, hayland, and other lands used for 
grazing.
    (c) The NRCS Chief may implement the CPGL Program in any of the 50 
States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. NRCS will provide assistance in 
cooperation with conservation districts, or directly to a landowner or 
operator.


<R05>
Sec. 610.32  Technical assistance furnished.

    (a) Provide technical assistance to grazing-land owners and managers 
to plan and implement resource conservation on grazing land. The 
objective of planning on grazing land is to assist landowners and 
managers in understanding the basic ecological principles associated 
with managing their land. This objective can be met by implementing a 
plan that meets the needs of the resources (soil, water, air, plants, 
and animals) and management objectives of the owner or manager. NRCS may 
provide assistance, at the request of the private grazing-land owner or 
manager to:

[[Page 355]]

    (1) Maintain and improve private grazing land resources that provide 
multiple benefits;
    (2) Ensure the long-term sustainability of private grazing land 
resources;
    (3) Implement new grazing land management technologies;
    (4) Manage resources on private grazing land through conservation 
planning, including, but not limited to; grazing management, nutrient 
management, and weed and invasive species control;
    (5) Maintain and improve water quality and quantity, aquatic and 
wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and aesthetics on private 
grazing land;
    (6) Harvest, process, and market private grazing land resources; and
    (7) Identify opportunities to diversify private grazing land 
enterprises.
    (b) Refer to 7 CFR 610.4 on other items relating to technical 
assistance.
    (c) To receive technical assistance, a landowner or manager may 
contact NRCS or the local conservation district to seek assistance to 
solve identified natural resource problems or opportunities.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 611.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This part sets forth policy on soil survey operations of the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).
    (b) NRCS is responsible for soil survey activities of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA). A soil survey provides (1) an orderly, 
on-the-ground, scientific inventory of soil resources according to their 
potentialities and problems of use, and (2) information about each kind 
of soil in sufficient detail to meet all reasonable needs of farmers, 
agricultural technicians, community planners, engineers, and scientists 
in planning and transferring the findings of research and experience to 
specific land areas.


<R05>
Sec. 611.2  Cooperative relationships.

    (a) Soil surveys on nonfederal lands are carried out cooperatively 
with state agricultural experiment stations and other state agencies. 
The cooperative effort is evidenced in a memorandum of understanding 
setting forth guidelines for actions to be taken by each cooperating 
party in the performance of soil surveys. Similar cooperative 
arrangements exist between NRCS and other federal agencies for soil 
surveys on federal lands.
    (b) Arrangements for nonfederal financial participation in the cost 
of soil surveys may be made with states, counties, soil conservation 
districts, planning agencies, and other local groups.


<R04>
                    Subpart B--Soil Survey Operations


<R05>
Sec. 611.10  Standards, guidelines, and plans.

    (a) NRCS conducts soil surveys under national standards and 
guidelines for naming, classifying, and interpreting soils and for 
publishing soil surveys in the USDA series.
    (b) A soil survey work plan of a county or area of similar size that 
is to be completed for publication is prepared prior to the start of 
each soil survey. The work plan provides information relevant to the 
conduct and publication of the soil survey. The plan is

[[Page 356]]

signed by representatives of NRCS, land grant universities, and in some 
states representatives of other state agencies. Federal land 
administering agencies also sign the work plan if federal lands are 
included in the survey.


<R05>
Sec. 611.11  Reproduction and distribution of soil survey information.

    (a) Published soil surveys. (1) When soil survey field work is 
completed on a designated area, NRCS publishes the soil survey as soon 
as possible so that the information will be available to the public The 
published soil survey includes soil maps, soil descriptions, and soil 
interpretations for appropriate uses such as farming, engineering, 
range, woodland, recreation, and wildlife.
    (2) Each party cooperating with NRCS in a soil survey will receive 
without cost 50 copies of the published soil survey. Prior to 
publication each may order additional copies at printing cost by 
preparing a special amendment to the soil survey work plan.
    (3) The number of copies to be published and the distribution of a 
published soil survey are coordinated by NRCS with those cooperating in 
the survey and with the U.S. Senators from the state and the U.S. 
Representative from the congressional district in which the survey was 
made.
    (4) Copies of published soil surveys are sent by the Superintendent 
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, to depository libraries 
that have requested them. Copies also are sent to interested agencies 
that have requested them.
    (5) Published soil surveys may be obtained without charge if 
available, from NRCS field and state offices, and from respective 
members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives. Land 
grant universities also may have copies. When the supply is exhausted, 
reference copies generally are available from libraries or on inter-
library loan.
    (b) Interim soil reports. (1) State and local units of government 
and others may need soil survey information for subdivision, town, or 
county planning, tax assessment, and other uses prior to the time a soil 
survey is published. NRCS may prepare interim reports to provide soil 
survey information to meet these needs.
    (2) Interim soil reports may include copies of soil survey field 
sheets, soil descriptions, and soil interpretive maps and tables showing 
the general rating of each kind of soil for various uses such as 
farming, range, woodland, engineering, recreation, and wildlife.
    (c) Resource conservation plan data. Information prepared 
specifically for use in developing resource conservation plans for soil 
conservation district cooperators is considered confidential. Soil maps 
and interpretations prepared for this use will not be made available to 
others without the consent of the landowner as well as the district 
governing body. However, copies of soil survey field sheets and related 
data from which the conservation plan was developed may be purchased 
from the local NRCS field office with prior approval from the NRCS state 
office. The purchase is subject to the fee schedule cited in Sec. 1.2(b) 
of this title.
    (d) Identity of advance reproductions. Advance reproductions of 
individual soil survey field sheets include the name of the soil survey 
area, the state, the names of the parties cooperating in the survey, 
date of survey, map scale, and necessary precautionary notes.

course and related hydro meteorological networks. Planning for such 
networks is carried out in accordance with OMB Circular A-62.
    (b) Determines and provides information on the expected water 
supply, including seasonal streamflow data. If pertinent and appropriate 
to the needs of cooperators and not otherwise available to them, may 
provide necessary interpretative analyses and forecasts required for 
operation of water-control structures and/or agricultural operations.
    (c) On request and to the extent NRCS resources and any required 
cooperator contributions are available, establishes hydrometeorological 
stations to cllect and provide data and necessary interpretive analyses 
to the requesting party. By written agreement NRCS may accept 
cooperators' funds, materials, equipment, and services for this purpose.
    (d) Develops and encourages use of new techniques and improving data 
collection and processing.
    (e) Cooperates with other federal, state, and local agencies, 
organizations, and Canadian provinces and agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 612.3  Data collected and forecasts.

    (a) Basic data are currently collected at numerous sites in the 
western states area. Data sites generally include a snow course where 
both snow depth and water equivalent of snow are measured. However, 
special sites may measure only snow depth or water equivalent. Many of 
these sites also provide related

[[Page 358]]

drometeorological data, such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, 
solar tradiation, and wind.
    (b) Water supply forecasts in the western states area are generally 
made monthly from January through June. Forecasts may be made more 
frequently for an established need when data are available to NRCS.


<R05>
Sec. 612.4  Eligible individuals or groups.

    (a) Any individual or group who is a significant water user and who 
would benefit from a water supply forecast may obtain forecasts from 
NRCS on a regular basis provided data are available to NRCS to develop a 
forecast at the desired location.
    (b) The program collects and interprets data as a service and an aid 
to agricultural interests, particularly those served by or affiliated 
with soil, water, and other conservation districts. Information 
collected by NRCS for these agricutural users is also made available to 
other Federal, State, and private agencies and to the general public 
without charge. Cooperator financial contribution is usually required 
for special measurements or interpretations beyond the scope of the 
regular program.


<R05>
Sec. 612.5  Dissemination of water supply forecasts and basic data.

    Water supply outlook reports prepared by NRCS and its cooperators 
containing water supply forecasts and basic data are usually issued 
monthly by each NRCS state office in the western states area for the 
months of January through June. Other reports jointly issued by NRCS and 
its cooperators include a fall water supply summary, annual and 
accumulative summaries of data, and a western states area report 
covering water supply outlook.


<R05>
Sec. 612.6  Application for water supply forecast service.

    Requests for obtaining water supply forecasts or related assistance 
may be directed to any NRCS office in the western states areas. NRCS 
offices are described in part 600 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 612.7  Forecast user responsibility.

    The forecast user's obligation to the federal government is to give 
appropriate credit and recognition to NRCS for information furnished.

    Source: 49 FR 12188, Mar. 29, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 613.1  Purpose.

    This part provides Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) 
policy on the operations of plant materials centers. The centers have 
responsibilities for assembling, testing, releasing, and providing for 
the commercial production and use of plant materials for programs of 
soil, water, and related resource conservation and development.


<R05>
Sec. 613.2  Policy and objectives.

    (a) It is NRCS policy to assemble, comparatively evaluate, release, 
and distribute for commercial increase new or improved plant materials 
needed for broad programs of resource conservation and development for 
agriculture, wildlife, urban, recreation, and other land uses and 
environmental needs. It is NRCS policy to conduct plant materials work 
in cooperation with other agencies of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, such as the Agricultural Research Service, and with other 
federal and state research agencies including state agricultural 
experiment stations. The emphasis of the NRCS plant materials work is to 
find suitable plants for erosion control adapted to soil and site 
conditions where vegetation is difficult to establish. In contrast, the 
emphasis of research agencies and organizations in plant development is 
to improve economically important crops. The

[[Page 359]]

NRCS program of testing and releasing new seed-propagated plant 
materials follows the guidelines in ``Statement of Responsibilities and 
Policies Relating to the Development, Release, and Multiplication of 
Publicly Developed Varieties of Seed-Propagated Crops,'' which was 
adopted in June 1972 by land grant colleges and interested federal 
agencies. NRCS releases improved conservation plant materials requiring 
vegetative multiplication in ways appropriate for particular states and 
particular species by working with experiment stations, crop improvement 
associations, and other state and federal agencies.
    (b) The objective of the plant materials activity is to select or 
develop special and improved plants, and techniques for their successful 
establishment and maintenance to solve conservation problems and needs 
related to:
    (1) Controlling soil erosion on all lands.
    (2) Conserving water.
    (3) Protecting upstream watersheds.
    (4) Reducing sediment movement into waterways and reservoirs through 
the stabilization of critical sediment sources such as surface mined 
lands, highway slopes, recreation sites, and urban and industrial 
development areas.
    (5) Stabilizing disposal areas for liquid and solid wastes.
    (6) Improving plant diversity and lengthening grazing season on 
dryland pastures and rangelands.
    (7) Replacing brush on mountain slopes with fire-retarding plant 
cover to reduce the possibility of fires that threaten life and property 
or result in serious sediment sources.
    (8) Improving the effectiveness of windbreaks and shelterbelts for 
reducing airborne sediment, controlling snow drifting, and preventing 
crop damage from wind erosion.
    (9) Protecting streambank, pond, and lake waterlines from erosion by 
scouring and wave action.
    (10) Improving wildlife food and cover.
    (11) Selecting special-purpose plants to meet specific needs for 
environment protection and enhancement.
    (12) Selecting plants that tolerate air pollution agents and toxic 
soil chemicals.


<R05>
Sec. 613.3  NRCS responsibilities in plant materials.

    NRCS operates or enters into agreements with state universities or 
other state organizations to operate plant materials centers. NRCS 
employs specialists for selecting and using plant materials. NRCS 
responsibilities are to:
    (a) Identify the need for suitable plant materials and cultural and 
management methods in resource conservation and for environmental 
protection and enhancement.
    (b) Assemble and comparatively evaluate plant materials at the plant 
materials centers and on sites where soil, climate, or other conditions 
differ significantly from those at the centers.
    (c) Make comparative field plantings for final testing of promising 
plants and techniques in cooperation with conservation districts and 
other interested cooperators.
    (d) Release cooperatively improved conservation plants and maintain 
the breeder or foundation stocks in ways appropriate for particular 
state and plant species by working with experiment stations, crop 
improvement associations, and other state and federal agencies.
    (e) Produce limited amounts of foundation or foundation-quality seed 
and plants available by grant to or by exchange with conservation 
districts, experiment stations, other federal and state research 
agencies, and state seed certifying organizations that will use the 
material to establish seed fields, seed orchards or plantings for 
vegetative increase.
    (f) Encourage conservation districts, commercial seed producers, and 
commercial and state nurseries to produce needed plant materials for 
conservation uses and to assist them in this production.
    (g) Encourage the use of improved plant materials in resource 
conservation and environmental improvement programs.

[[Page 360]]


<R05>
Sec. 613.4  Special production of plant materials.

    NRCS can produce plant materials in the quantity required to do a 
specific conservation job if this production will serve the public 
welfare and only if the plant materials are not available commercially. 
This function will be performed only until the plant materials are 
available commercially. Specific production of plant materials by NRCS 
requires the approval of the Chief.


<R05>
Sec. 613.5  Plant materials centers.

    (a) The National Plant Materials Center. The National Plant 
Materials Center at Beltsville, Maryland, serves as the central facility 
for assembling, increasing, and determining the characteristics of plant 
materials from foreign and domestic sources. Plant materials with 
potential value for conservation and related uses are distributed to 
other plant materials centers.
    (b) Other Plant Materials Centers. There are 23 other plant 
materials centers. Each serves several major land resource areas. 
Seventeen of these other centers are operated by NRCS, and six by 
cooperating agencies, as follows:

    (a) The regulations in this part set forth the policies, procedures, 
and requirements for the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program (EWRP). 
Under the EWRP, NRCS will make offers to purchase wetland conservation 
easements from persons owning croplands that were damaged by the 1993 
Midwest floods if those lands have the potential for restoration to 
wetland conditions and if the owner voluntarily agrees to restore and 
maintain those conditions. The easements are to be purchased to promote 
the restoration and maintenance of wetland characteristics, such as 
hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation of the soil and 
hydrophytic vegetation. The functions and values of the wetlands for 
wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, flood water retention, 
floodway enhancement, ground water recharge, open space, aesthetic 
values, and environmental education will thus be promoted. The wetland 
conservation easements will permanently prohibit use of the affected 
land as cropland. Additionally, the easement shall require permanent 
maintenance of the wetland conditions, except in the case of natural 
disaster.
    (b) The EWRP is available only in the following States: Illinois, 
Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and 
Wisconsin. Certain cropland areas within these States have been 
determined to have been inundated by the Midwest floods of 1993. As more 
fully defined and described in

[[Page 373]]

this part, eligible land may include farmed wetlands or prior converted 
wetlands (wetlands converted prior to December 23, 1985), together with 
adjacent lands on which the wetlands are functionally dependent so long 
as the likelihood of successful restoration of such land and the 
potential wetland values merit inclusion in the program with reasonable 
costs.

Sec. 623.8  Easement value.

    NRCS offers for easements will be based on the fair market value, as 
determined by the NRCS State Conservationist, of the land covered by the 
easements. Fair market value will be based on post-flood conditions as 
if reclaimed. Land easement values will be determined by the State 
Conservationist in consultation with a technical committee. A technical 
committee shall included representatives of: ASCS, Extension Service, 
and FWS. Additionally, the State Conservationist may collect information 
from other sources as he deems necessary. Coordination between States 
will be provided by the Chief, NRCS.

Sec. 623.9  Easement priority.

    The State Conservationist, in consultation with the FWS and with 
input from a technical committee and other interested Federal agencies, 
will establish a ranking process to establish the priority of parcels 
offered into the EWRP. This process will rank the floodway enhancement 
and environmental benefits per dollar of government expenditure on 
restoration and easement purchase. The factors for determining the 
priority for selection will consider the following:
    (a) Protection and enhancement of habitat for migratory birds and 
wildlife, including the contribution the restoration may make to the 
recovery of threatened and endangered species,
    (b) Floodway expansion,
    (c) Proximity to other protected wetlands,
    (d) Level of hydrology restored,
    (e) Wetland function or values,

<R05>
Sec. 624.1  Purpose.

    This part sets forth the requirements and procedures for Federal 
assistance administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(NRCS) under section 216, Pub. L. 81-516 and section 403 of Title IV of 
the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-334.


<R05>
Sec. 624.2  Objective.

    The objective of the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program is 
to assist in relieving imminent hazards to life and property from floods 
and the products of erosion created by natural disasters that cause a 
sudden impairment of a watershed.


<R05>
Sec. 624.3  Scope.

    (a) Authorized EWP technical and financial assistance may be made 
available when an emergency exists. Emergency water shed protection 
consists of emergency measures for runoff retardation and soil erosion 
prevention as needed to reduce hazards to life and property from floods, 
drought, and the products of erosion on any watershed imparied by a 
natural disaster.
    (b) Technical assistance includes engineering and other technical 
expertise necessary for planning and installing emergency measures. 
Emergency watershed protection is authorized in the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands.


<R05>
Sec. 624.4  Administration.

    NRCS shall provide overall administrative directive and guidance for 
EWP. NRCS will transfer funds to the Forest Service (FS) of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) at the national level for work to be 
installed by FS or its cooperators. Under general program criteria and 
procedures established by NRCS, FS is responsible for administering EWP 
measures on National Forests and National Grasslands. FS is also 
responsible for emergency measures on all forested lands or rangelands 
within the National Forests, on adjacent rangelands that are 
administered under formal agreement with FS, and on other forest lands. 
On

[[Page 381]]

these lands, emergency work is done by either NRCS or FS as mutually 
agreed. In carrying out their responsibilities, FS and NRCS work 
cooperatively with other Federal, State, and local government agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 624.5  Eligible emergencies, recipients, and assistance.

    (a) Conditions of eligibility. Emergency watershed protection 
assistance is made available when the following conditions of 
eligibility are determined to exist by the state conservationist. 
Procedures for providing emergency assistance vary according to whether 
the watershed emergency constitutes an exigency or a nonexigency 
situation. Emergency measures for both types of situations are those 
undertaken to remove or reduce hazards created by the disaster to 
safeguard life and property from flooding, drought, or the products of 
erosion.
    (1) Watershed emergency. A watershed emergency exists when a natural 
occurrence causes a sudden impairment of a watershed that creates an 
imminent threat to life or property. To be eligible for assistance, the 
imminent threat to life or property must significantly exceed that which 
existed before the impairment.
    (i) Natural occurrence includes but is not limited to floods, fires, 
windstorms, earthquakes, volcanic actions, and drought.
    (ii) A watershed impairment exists when the ability of a watershed 
to carry out its natural functions is reduced to the extent of creating 
an imminent threat to life or property.
    (iii) A sudden watershed impairment results from a single natural 
occurrence or a short-term combination of occurrences. Watershed 
impairments resulting from long-term combinations or series of natural 
or other occurrences are not considered sudden watershed impairments.
    (iv) Exigency and nonexigency situations. Watershed emergencies are 
classified as either exigency or nonexigency situations.
    (A) An exigency exists when the near-term probability of damage to 
life or property is high enough to demand immediate Federal action. An 
exigency continues to exist as long as the probability of damage 
continues at a high enough level.
    (B) A nonexigency situation exists when the near-term probability of 
damage to life or property is high enought to constitute an emergency 
but not sufficiently high to be considered an exigency. A nonexigency 
situation continues to exist as long as the probability of damage 
remains high enough to be considered an emergency.
    (v) Changes in emergency situations. Changes in the near-term 
probability of threat to life or property will be reflected by changes 
in the classification of emergencies. As the near-term probability that 
the threats will be realized is reduced because of emergency assistance 
or other factors, exigency and nonexigency situations will be 
appropriately reclassified. Similarly, as occurrences increase the 
probability of threats to life or property, situations previously 
considered nonemergencies will be appropriately reclassified as 
nonexigencies and previous nonexigency emergency situations will be 
appropriately reclassified as exigencies.
    (vi) Drought emergencies. Assistance is available in drought 
emergencies when the eligibility criteria specified in this rule are met 
and the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) 
determines that a drought emergency exists under regulations promulgated 
to carry out sections 401 and 402 of the Agriculture Credit Act of 1978 
(Pub. L. 95-334).
    (b) Eligible recipients. Include those public or private landowners, 
land managers, land users, or others who--
    (1) Have a legal interest in or responsibility for the values 
threatened by a watershed emergency; and
    (2) Have exhausted or have insufficient funds or other resources 
available to provide adequate relief from the applicable hazards. 
Interested persons other than Federal agencies must be represented by a 
project sponsor. Project sponsors must:
    (i) Be a State or political subdivision of a State or a qualified 
Indian tribe or tribal organization;
    (ii) Have legal authority and agree to use such authority to obtain 
needed landrights, water rights, and permits; and

[[Page 382]]

    (iii) Agree to provide for the operation and maintenance of 
completed emergency measures.
    (c) Eligible assistance. (1) In an exigency--
    (i) Federal emergency funds may bear up to 100 percent of the 
construction costs of emergency measures.
    (ii) Funds must be obligated within 10 days after receipt of the 
emergency funds or after the date of the disaster event when conditions 
permit beginning construction activities, whichever is later.
    (iii) Emergency work must be completed within 30 days after funds 
are obligated.

The NRCS Chief retains discretion to grant extensions for good cause. 
Documentation must support requests for extensions. Extensions may 
extend an additional 10 days for the obligation of funds and an 
additional 30 days for the completion of work.
    (2) In a nonexigency--
    (i) Federal emergency funds may bear up to 80 percent of the 
construction costs for emergency measures.
    (ii) Funds must be obligated and construction completed within 220 
consecutive calendar days after the date of receipt of funds. Extensions 
are permitted at the discretion of the NRCS Chief if unforeseen or 
uncontrollable events cause delays. A request for such an extension must 
be documented.
    (3) Sponsors may provide their share of construction costs in the 
form of cash; inkind services such as labor, equipment, etc.; or a 
combination of cash and inkind services. Cost sharing is waived for 
measures to be installed on Federal lands such as national forests or 
national grasslands.

<R05>
Sec. 624.6  Eligible measures.

    (a) Eligibility. To be eligible for assistance a measure must--
    (1) Retard runoff, prevent flooding, or prevent soil erosion;
    (2) Reduce threats to life or property resulting from a watershed 
emergency;
    (3) Be economically and environmentally defensible and sound from an 
engineering standpoint;
    (4) Be limited to the minimum that will reduce applicable threats to 
a level not to exceed that which existed before the impairment of the 
watershed;
    (5) Yield beneficial effects to more than one individual except in 
an exigency; and
    (6) Conform to rules and regulations published by NRCS for complying 
with Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, and Executive Order 
11988, Floodplain Management.
    (b) Documentation. (1) When an exigency does not exist, the economic 
rationale of proposed measures must be submitted in appropriate detail 
with the request for funds. Generally, the expected value of imminent 
damages (amount of damages multiplied by the near-term probability of 
their occurrence) must exceed the cost of emergency measures. 
Information provided in the request for emergency funds to support 
economic defensibility of the measures must include but is not limited 
to--
    (i) Number and extent of values at risk because of the watershed 
impairment;
    (ii) Estimated damages to the values at risk if the threat is 
realized;
    (iii) Events that must occur for the threat to be realized and the 
estimated probability of their occurrence both individually and 
collectively; and
    (iv) Estimates of the nature, extent, and cost of emergency measures 
to be constructed to relieve the threat.
    (2) In nonexigency situations, the state conservationist shall also 
submit adequate information to substantiate the environmental 
defensibility the emergency measures proposed for installation. This 
must include but is not limited to--
    (i) Thorough descriptions of beneficial and adverse effects on 
environmental resources including fish and wildlife habitat;
    (ii) Descriptions of water quality and water conservation impacts as 
appropriate; and
    (iii) Analysis of effects on downstream water rights.

The Chief shall issue instructions as are necessary to determine the 
economic and environmental defensibility of measures proposed for 
installation consistent with this rule.
    (c) Implementation. (1) When planning emergency measures, emphasis 
should

[[Page 383]]

be placed on measures that are the least expensive and most 
environmentally sound. The measures are to be accomplished by using the 
least damaging construction techniques and equipment that will retain as 
much of the existing characteristics of the channel and riparian habitat 
as possible. Emergency measure construction practices may include but 
are not limited to such things as seasonal construction, minimum 
clearing, reshaping soil, limiting excavation to one bank (on 
alternating sides where appropriate), and prompt revegetation of 
disturbed areas.
    (2) Measures needed to offset adverse impacts should be planned for 
installation concurrent with installation of the emergency measures. If 
they cannot be installed then, plans should be included to ensure their 
installation within 30 days. Cost sharing for these measures is at the 
same rate as for the original emergency construction.
    (3) An EWP team consisting of NRCS personnel from the National 
Office and the technical service center shall determine the eligibility 
of all permanent, enduring, or long-life measures or practices proposed 
for construction. The team shall determine the need for funds before any 
commitments are made.
    (4) Where lands under jurisdiction of FS are involved, the team will 
be assisted by FS representatives of the National Office and area or 
regional offices. The team shall also be available, at the request of 
the state conservationists, regional foresters, and area directors, to 
help determine the eligibility of other EWP measures or practices and to 
assist with administrative details.

[46 FR 56577, Nov. 17, 1981, as amended at 48 FR 4448, Feb. 1, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 624.7  Limitations on use of emergency funds.

    Emergency watershed protection funds may not be used to:
    (a) Perform operation or maintenance (periodic work that is 
necessary to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of a measure to 
perform as originally designed and installed).
    (b) Solve watershed problems that existed before the disaster.
    (c) Repair, rebuild, or maintain private or public transportation 
facilities, public utilities, or similar facilities.
    (d) Perform work on features of projects installed under the 
authority of Pub. L. 83-566, Pub. L. 78-534, Resource Conservation and 
Development, or measures installed by other Federal agencies. Exceptions 
may be made at the discretion of the Chief of NRCS.
    (e) Construct works that would adversely affect downstream water 
rights.
    (f) Make improvements to public or private property not essential to 
the reduction of threats caused by watershed improvement.
    (g) Perform any work not determined to be economically and 
environmentally defensible under the provisions of this rule.

[46 FR 56577, Nov. 17, 1981, as amended at 48 FR 4448, Feb. 1, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 624.8  Environment.

    Environmental aspects of emergency work are to be given careful 
consideration. A program environmental impact statement (EIS) for EWP 
work has been developed in compliance with section 102(2)(C) of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852 
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.)). An environmental evaluation is to be prepared 
for all nonexigency situations. State conservationists shall notify 
concerned area and field offices of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and, through existing coordination 
mechanisms of State clearinghouses, the State fish and game and other 
appropriate agencies of anticipated EWP work. They shall invite the 
assistance of these agencies in preparing the environmental evaluation 
and in planning and implementing the emergency work. Archeological, 
historical, or other special expertise needed is to be solicited from 
appropriate agencies and groups. Environmental and other considerations 
are to be integrated into emergency work by using an interagency and 
interdisciplinary planning approach.

[48 FR 4448, Feb. 1, 1983]

[[Page 384]]


<R05>
Sec. 624.9  Application.

    Sponsors may apply to any NRCS office for EWP assistance. NRCS shall 
help sponsors prepare their applications. The NRCS offices are defined 
in part 600 of this chapter. Information supplied should include the 
nature, location, and scope of the problems and the assistance needed.


<R05>
Sec. 624.10  Investigation and request for funds.

    (a) On receipt of an application for EWP, the State conservationist 
and regional forester or area director, where appropriate, shall 
immediately investigate the emergency situation to determine if EWP is 
applicable. In carrying out EWP work, State conservationists shall take 
into consideration two broad types or degrees of emergency situations:
    (1) An imminent situation of unusual urgency--and exigency--and (2) 
an emergency requiring action but of less urgency than an imminent 
situation. (See Sec. 624.5)
    (b) Prompt remedial action to eliminate an imminent threat to loss 
of life is to be provided when an exigency exists. The State 
conservationist shall notify Project Development and Maintenance and 
indicate the nature of the emergency and the estimated amount of funds 
needed. If funds are made available, the state conservationist may 
authorize actions necessary to remedy the emergency. The state 
conservationist shall confirm the situation in a memorandum to the Chief 
that explains the nature of the emergency, the location of the 
emergency, the kind of remedial work and funds needed, sponsors, 
description of potential damage, etc. In these situations, the 
memorandum from the State conservationist with its brief information 
constitutes the request for funds.
    (c) If an exigency does not exist but the impairment justifies 
emergency assistance, the state conservationist shall submit a request 
for funds to the Chief within 60 days after the disaster event. Neither 
NRCS nor FS may commit funds until notified by the National Office of 
the availability of funds.

<R05>
Sec. 631.1  Purpose.

    (a) The Great Plains Conservation Program (GPCP) is a special 
program targeted to the total conservation treatment of farm or ranch 
units with the most severe soil and water resources problems. The 
purpose of the program is to assist farm, ranch and other land users to 
make changes in their cropping systems and land uses which are needed to 
conserve, develop, protect, and utilize the soil and water resources of 
their lands. This purpose is achieved by controlling erosion, conserving 
water, and adjusting land use to mitigate climatic, soil, topographic, 
flood, saline and other natural hazards.
    (b) Program participation is voluntary and is carried out by 
applying a conservation plan encompassing an entire operating unit. A 
conservation plan is developed with the land user in consultation with 
the local conservation district and is used to establish a GPCP 
contract. This contract provides for cost sharing between the land user 
and the Secretary of Agriculture for applying needed land use 
adjustments and conservation treatment within a specified time schedule. 
The program is supplemental to, not a substitution for, other programs 
in the Great Plains area.

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 632.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to set forth the Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS) rules and regulations to carry out the Rural 
Abandoned Mine Program under section 406, Pub. L. 95-87; 91 Stat. 460 
(30 U.S.C. 1236).
    (b) The Rural Abandoned Mine Program:
    (1) Through the NRCS delivery system, assists land users to 
voluntarily develop reclamation plans and apply conservation treatment 
for the reclamation, conservation, and development of eligible coal-
mined lands and water, and
    (2) Provides cost sharing through long-term contracts according to 
an approved reclamation plan, to land users for establishing land use 
and conservation treatment on these lands.


<R05>
Sec. 632.2  Objectives.

    (a) The objectives of the program are to protect people and the 
environment from the adverse effects of past coal-mining practices and 
to promote the development of the soil and water resources of 
unreclaimed mined lands by:
    (1) Stabilizing mined lands.
    (2) Controlling erosion and sediment on mined areas and areas 
affected by mining.
    (3) Reclaiming lands and water for useful purposes.
    (4) Enhancing water quality or quantity where it has been disturbed 
by past coal-mining practices.


<R05>
Sec. 632.3  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Rural Abandoned Mine Program is administered by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) through NRCS in accordance with the 
delegation of responsibility contained in Sec. 601.1(h) of this chapter.
    (1) The Chief of NRCS is responsible for national program management 
and administration and for coordinating program operations with the 
Office of Surface Mining (OSM), U.S. Department of the Interior.
    (2) State conservationists (Responsible Federal Officials) are 
responsible for program operations within a State including program 
coordination with the State reclamation agency and the representatives 
of OSM.
    (b) The primary public contacts for program assistance are the 
district conservationists located in local NRCS field offices.
    (c) NRCS is assisted by other USDA agencies in accordance with 
existing authorities and agreements in carrying out the program.
    (d) NRCS is to coordinate Rural Abandoned Mine Program activities 
with NRCS programs and the other reclamation programs authorized by Pub. 
L. 95-87 that are carried out by the Office of Surface Mining of the 
U.S. Department of the Interior, State reclamation agencies, and Indian 
tribes. Coordination includes program development, development of 
reclamation standards, preparation of special reports, requests for 
funding, and related actions required to achieve coordination between 
programs.
    (e) NRCS is to consult with State and local reclamation committees 
to obtain recommendations on program operation, evaluation of 
applications for reclamation assistance, and public participation. The 
NRCS State Conservationist is to use existing reclamation committees or 
encourage the organization of a new State committee for this purpose. 
The State Conservationist is to serve as a member when the committee is 
functioning for the purposes of this program. Representatives of the 
Office of Surface Mining, State reclamation agency, State water quality 
agency, State conservation agency, and other agencies or groups are to 
be invited to participate as members. Individual citizens may 
participate through the State committee. Local committees, if needed, 
are to be organized on a multicounty, county, conservation district, or 
other appropriate area with a local membership structure similar to the 
State committee. The district conservationist is to be a member of a 
local reclamation committee organized to provide program guidance.

                        Subpart B--Qualifications


<R05>
Sec. 632.10  Applicability.

    This program applies to any county or other designated area within a 
State that had abandoned or inadequately reclaimed coal-mined lands 
within its borders before August 3, 1977.


<R05>
Sec. 632.11  Availability of funds.

    (a) The provisions of the program are subject to the annual 
appropriation by Congress of funds from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation 
Fund and the transfer of as much as 20 percent of these funds from the 
Office to Surface Mining to NRCS for program operation.
    (b) Allotments of Rural Abandoned Mine Program funds to state 
conservationists are to reflect the national program needs, the 
geographic areas from which the funds were derived, the funding priority 
assigned to applications for program assistance, including benefits 
expected to be derived, and the practicability and feasibility of the 
reclamation work proposed.


<R05>
Sec. 632.12  Funding priorities.

    (a) All eligible applications within a State are to be assigned a 
funding priority and subpriority. Assignment of a priority and 
subpriority establishes the order in which the proposed reclamation work 
will be selected and evaluated for funding. (See Sec. 632.20(b) for 
additional selection criteria.) Applications for individual, joint, or 
special projects (See Sec. 632.18) for areas of different priorities or 
subpriorities are to be assigned the highest applicable priority or 
subpriority. The funding priorities are as follows:
    (1) Priority 1. Protection of public health, safety, general 
welfare, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal-
mining practices. Extreme danger means a condition that could be 
expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons, property, or the 
environment and to which persons or improvements on real property are 
exposed.
    (2) Priority 2. Protection of public health, safety, and general 
welfare from the adverse effects of coal-mining practices that do not 
constitute an extreme danger.
    (3) Priority 3. Restoration of the land and water resources and the 
environment where previously degraded by the adverse effects of coal-
mining practices, including measures for the conservation and 
development of soil, water (excluding channelization), woodland, fish 
and wildlife, recreation resources, and agricultural productivity. First 
consideration in this priority is to be the reduction of offsite damage 
affecting the public. Second consideration is to be given to restoring 
to beneficial uses for the main benefit of the land user.
    (b) Eligible and feasible applications for program assistance within 
each priority category (Sec. 632.12(a)) are to be funded in the 
following order:
    (1) Individual persons or public entities who owned the eligible 
area before May 2, 1977, and who neither consented to nor exercised 
control over the mining operation.

[[Page 393]]

    (2) Individual persons who would actively use the area, if 
reclaimed, for agricultural or silvicultural purposes.
    (3) All other participants.

[43 FR 44749, Sept. 28, 1978; 45 FR 65181, Oct. 2, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 632.13  Eligible lands and water.

    Lands and water eligible for reclamation are those that were mined 
for coal or were affected by coal-mining processes and were abandoned or 
inadequately reclaimed before August 3, 1977. These lands and water are 
not eligible if:
    (a) There is continuing reclamation responsibility on the part of a 
mine operator, permittee, or agent under State or Federal law or on the 
part of the State as a result of bond forfeiture. However, if the amount 
of the bond forfeiture was insufficient to reclaim the area covered by 
the bond, the area will be considered eligible.
    (b) They are under Federal ownership and control.
    (c) The surface rights are under easement or lease to be remined for 
coal or other minerals.


<R05>
Sec. 632.14  Eligible land users.

    Landowners holding surface land and water rights, residents, 
tenants, or their agents who own or have management control of eligible 
land and/or water are eligible to participate in the program. Residents 
or tenants who do not own the land must have control of the land for the 
period of the proposed contract and have the written consent of the 
landowner. Land users may participate by operating as persons, 
partnerships, associations, corporations, estates, trusts, or non-
Federal public entities, and by acting individually or jointly with 
other eligible land users. However, joint participation with other 
eligible land users is required if the primary purpose of reclamation is 
enhancement of water quality or quantity.


<R05>
Sec. 632.15  Eligible uses and treatment of reclaimed lands.

    (a) Reclaimed lands and water may be used for cropland, hayland, 
pasture land, rangeland, woodland, wildlife land, natural areas, 
noncommercial recreation land, and the supporting uses associated with 
these land uses. Other land uses proposed by public entities for public 
use and benefit such as open space, conservation uses, natural areas, 
and recreation sites may be approved by the NRCS State conservationist 
in accordance with the priorities stated in Sec. 632.12. However, 
development of public sites, such as the installation of recreation 
facilities, is not eligible for cost sharing.
    (b) Reclaimed land use is determined by the objectives of the land 
user, compatibility of the land use with surrounding land use, and the 
practicability and feasibility of restoring the soil and water resources 
to support the use selected.
    (c) The maximum acreage of eligible lands and water that may be 
offered for contract under one ownership is 320 acres for the life of 
the program.
    (d) Conservation treatment eligible for Federal cost sharing 
includes the combination of practices needed and feasible to achieve:
    (1) Protection of life, property, and elimination of public health 
and safety hazards, including land stabilization.
    (2) Restoration of the environment where degraded by past mining, 
including water quality, visual quality, recreation resources, fish and 
wildlife habitat, and erosion and sediment control.
    (3) A site that can be developed for a beneficial use as specified 
in Sec. 632.15(a). Examples of eligible treatment that may be cost 
shared include but are not limited to: Land shaping and grading, 
critical area planting or other plantings for stabilization, improving 
visual quality, wildlife food and cover, diversions or terraces, 
waterways or lined ditches, grade stabilization structures, sediment 
basins, and special practices for sealing shafts and tunnels, correcting 
subsidence problems, or other unusual situations. Practices not eligible 
for cost sharing are those that are solely applied to develop a 
reclamation site (including sites developed by public entities for 
public use), increase the production of crops, or for the recurring 
maintenance of applied reclamation.
    (e) Applied conservation treatment is to meet the applicable Federal 
and State standards for the reclamation

[[Page 394]]

and conservation treatment of abandoned or inadequately reclaimed coal-
mined lands and water. Where needed, these standards are incorporated in 
local NRCS technical guides as the NRCS standards and specifications 
applicable to the program. Special practices as specified in 
Sec. 632.15(d) are to be developed in cooperation with appropriate State 
or Federal agencies having the expertise or responsibility for the 
practices.
    (f) NRCS State conservationists, in consultation with the State 
reclamation committee, are to:
    (1) Develop a list of practices that are eligible for cost sharing, 
and
    (2) Maintain, as applicable, lists of average costs of applying 
conservation treatment to eligible lands and waters.


<R05>
Sec. 632.16  Methods of applying planned land use and treatment.

    (a) Land users may arrange to apply the planned land uses and 
conservation treatment specified in the contract by one or more of the 
following methods:
    (1) By performing the required treatment with his own labor and 
equipment.
    (2) By hiring a qualified contractor to install the required 
treatment.
    (3) By requesting NRCS to award and administer a contract to perform 
the required treatment in accordance with 41 CFR chapters I and IV.
    (b) State conservationists are to develop criteria specifying the 
conditions for which NRCS will award and administer a contract. Criteria 
will consider: Type of equipment required, type and amount of 
conservation treatment required, costs of the required reclamation, 
needs of the land user, and the applicable cost-share rate. If the 
Federal share is less than 100 percent, a land user must put up his 
estimated share of the cost before NRCS awards the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 632.17  Cost-share rates.

    (a) Cost-share rates paid by the Federal Government are to be 
established and issued as instructions by the NRCS Administrator in 
accordance with the following criteria:
    (1) For 120 acres or less, the cost-share rate is to provide up to 
80 percent of the costs of land use and conservation treatment depending 
on the income-producing potential of the land after reclamation. 
However, this rate may be increased to a level required to obtain 
participation if the main benefits of reclamation are offsite (in the 
public interest) and there is a declaration of financial burden by the 
participant.
    (2) The rate on acreage in excess of 120 acres up to 320 acres 
maximum is to be reduced by up to 0.5 percent per acre. This reduced 
rate applies to the entire acreage offered for contract.


<R05>
Sec. 632.18  Special projects.

    (a) The NRCS State conservationist may approve the following types 
of special projects subject to the eligibility requirements, funding 
priorities, and cost-share rates as stated in Secs. 632.12, 632.13, 
632.14, 632.15, and 632.17:
    (1) Field trials or demonstration projects recommended by the State 
reclamation committee.
    (2) Projects to enhance water quality and quantity where past coal-
mining practices disturbed local water supplies and where joint action 
by a group of eligible land users in cooperation with Federal and State 
agencies is needed to restore the water resource.


<R05>
Sec. 632.19  Crop history and allotments.

    (a) Most crop history and allotments on eligible lands were 
discontinued at the time of mining. However, if eligible lands are 
classified as cropland at the time the contract is signed, the cropland 
crop history and allotment, if any, may be:
    (1) Preserved for a period not to exceed twice the length of the 
contract as provided in 7 CFR part 719, or
    (2) Voluntarily surrendered by the land user.


<R04>
                        Subpart C--Participation


<R05>
Sec. 632.20  Application for assistance.

    (a) Land users must submit an application for program assistance 
through the local conservation district or NRCS field office. NRCS is to 
announce dates for receiving applications through local media. 
Applications are to be reviewed by the conservation district and/or 
local reclamation committee,

[[Page 395]]

which is to verify eligibility and recommend funding priorities to the 
NRCS district conservationist. The NRCS district conservationist is to 
assign funding priorities according to the recommendations unless he 
determines that applications are incomplete, ineligible, or unfeasible. 
Low priority applications that cannot be serviced within specific time 
periods established by the State conservationist are to be returned to 
the applicant with an appropriate explanation. These applicants may 
reapply at a later date if they are still interested.
    (b) Eligible applicants are serviced within each subpriority 
according to the following criteria:
    (1) The specific type, amount, and relative importance of benefits 
to be derived. (Public benefits and offsite environmental improvement 
will take precedence over onsite benefits.)
    (2) Feasibility and practicability of reclaiming for the proposed 
uses.
    (3) Land user's ability to proceed.
    (4) Date of the application.


<R05>
Sec. 632.21  Reclamation plan.

    (a) Responsibility. Land users are responsible for developing a 
reclamation plan that will serve as a basis for a contract. Normally, a 
land user will need the technical services of NRCS and the conservation 
district or another professional to develop an acceptable plan.
    (b) Objectives and priorities. The reclamation plan is to provide 
for the appropriate program objectives and priorities as stated in 
Secs. 632.2 and 632.12 and meet the definition of a reclamation plan as 
defined in Sec. 632.4.
    (c) Review. (1) In areas served by conservation districts, 
reclamation plans are to be reviewed and signed by the district board to 
insure that planned land use and treatment is compatible with 
surrounding land uses and that proposed assistance is consistent with 
the district plan of work and priorities. In areas not served by 
conservation districts, the land use compatibility review may be 
performed by the local reclamation committee.
    (2) If reclamation plans include lands within or adjacent to Federal 
lands, the plan is to be reviewed with the appropriate Federal land 
management agency to insure that the planned land use is compatible with 
that of the surrounding area.
    (3) Land users are responsible for insuring that the proposed land 
use and treatment is compatible with local land use ordinances.
    (d) Approval. Proposed land use, conservation treatment, and 
sequence of application contained in the plan are to be agreed to by 
both NRCS and the land user. The district conservationist is to sign the 
reclamation plan to indicate technical approval.


<R05>
Sec. 632.22  Contracts.

    (a) Cost-sharing contracts. A land user who has an approved 
reclamation plan may enter into a contract with NRCS to receive Federal 
cost-share assistance. All land users are to sign the contract. A land 
user is required to furnish evidence of management control, such as a 
long-term lease, recorded deed, or land contract, and must have the 
written consent of the landowner. The NRCS contracting officer is to 
sign the contract after determining that all documents meet program 
requirements.
    (b) Effect of contract. A land user who signs a contract is 
obligated to apply or arrange for the application of the land use and 
conservation treatment as scheduled in the reclamation plan according to 
approved standards and specifications. A land user may request NRCS to 
award and administer a contract to apply the conservation treatment as 
scheduled in the reclamation plan in accordance with Sec. 632.16(a)(3).
    (c) Permits, landrights, and water rights. The land user is 
responsible for obtaining the permits, surface land- rights, and water 
rights that may be required to perform the planned work. NRCS is to 
assist land users in identifying the specific permit, landright, or 
water right required.
    (d) Operation and maintenance. During the contract period the land 
user is responsible for the operation and maintenance of applied 
conservation treatment. Operation and maintenance requirements are to be 
included in the contract.
    (e) Period of contract. The contract period is to be no less than 5 
nor more than 10 years. A contract is to extend

[[Page 396]]

for at least 3 years after the application of the last cost-shared 
conservation treatment to insure adequate establishment of vegetation 
and other treatment. Exceptions to the 3-year provision may be granted 
by the state conservationist for unusual circumstances.
    (f) Transfer of contract. (1) If during the contract period all or 
part of the right and interest in the land is transferred by sale or 
other action, the contract is terminated on the land unit that was 
transferred and the land user:
    (i) Forfeits all right to any future cost-share payments on the 
transferred land unit, and
    (ii) Must refund cost-share payments that have been made on the 
transferred land unit not to exceed the difference between the estimated 
value of the land at the time of entering into the contract and at the 
time of transfer, unless the new land user becomes a party to the 
contract as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (2) If the new land user becomes a party to the contract:
    (i) He is to assume all obligations of the previous land user on the 
transferred land unit.
    (ii) The contract with the new land user is to remain in effect with 
the original terms and conditions.
    (iii) The contract is to be modified in writing to show the changes 
caused by the transfer. If the modification is not acceptable to the 
contracting officer, the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply.
    (3) The transfer of all or part of a land unit by a land user does 
not affect the rights and obligations of other land users who have 
signed the contract.
    (g) Modification of contract. (1) A contract previously entered into 
with a land user may be modified only with the approval of the State 
conservationist or as authorized under established policies. No contract 
may be modified unless it is determined that the modification is 
desirable to carry out the program.
    (2) Contracts may be modified to add, delete, substitute, or reapply 
conservation treatment if:
    (i) Applied conservation treatment failed to achieve the desired 
results through no fault of the land user,
    (ii) Applied treatment deteriorated because of conditions beyond the 
control of the land user, or
    (iii) Other treatment is substituted that will achieve the desired 
results.
    (h) Joint contract. A land user may enter a contract jointly with 
other land users subject to the 320 acres maximum limitation per 
landowner. However, joint participation is permitted only if it will 
result in better land use and treatment than individual participation or 
if it is required by Secs. 632.14 and 632.18(a)(2).
    (i) Termination of contract. Contracts may be terminated by mutual 
consent of the signatories only if the State conservationist determines 
that the termination is authorized under established policies and is in 
the public interest. In this case, the State conservationist is to 
determine the amount of refund.


<R05>
Sec. 632.23  Access to land unit and records.

    Any authorized NRCS employee or agent is to have the right of access 
to land under application or contract and the right to examine any 
program records to ascertain the accuracy of any representations made in 
the application or contract. This includes the right to furnish 
technical assistance and to inspect work done under the contract.


<R04>
                    Subpart D--Cost-Share Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 632.30  Applicability.

    This subpart contains procedures for making cost-share payments to a 
land user when land use and conservation treatment is applied as 
specified in Sec. 632.16(a)(1) or (2).


<R05>
Sec. 632.31  Cost-share payment.

    (a) Amount of cost-share payment. Cost-share payments are to be made 
at rates specified in the contract. The cost-share payment is to be 
determined by one of the following methods:
    (1) Average cost.
    (2) Actual cost but not more than the average cost.
    (3) Specified maximum cost. If the average cost or the specified 
maximum cost at the time of starting the installation of a conservation 
practice or

[[Page 397]]

identifiable unit is less than the cost specified in the contract, 
payment is to be made at the lower rate. If the cost at the start of 
installation is higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A 
contract modification is necessary if NRCS determines that the higher 
cost is a significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. If 
costs are significant, cost-share payment is not to be made until the 
modification reflecting the increase is approved. If the higher costs 
are not significant, cost-share payments may be made if funds are 
available.
    (b) Time of payment. Cost-share payments are to be made to the land 
user after a practice or an identifiable unit has been satisfactorily 
applied. The land user is to submit claims for payment to the district 
conservationist no later than September 30 of the year after 
application. Late claims require approval of the State conservationist 
before payment can be made. A claim is to show the proportion of each 
land user's contribution to the applied practice or identifiable unit.
    (c) Approval. The district conservationist must certify that a 
practice or identifiable unit has been satisfactorily applied before 
NRCS can make cost-share payments.
    (d) Ineligible claim. A land user is not eligible to receive cost-
share payments for a practice or an identifiable unit that was not 
carried out under program requirements.
    (e) Authorization for payment. (1) Materials or services needed to 
carry out contracts are to be obtained by land users. Contracts may 
provide for part or all of the cost-share payment for a practice or 
identifiable unit to be made directly to suppliers of materials or 
services. The materials or services must be delivered or performed 
before payment is made.
    (2) The contracting officer is to authorize payment for materials or 
services not exceeding:
    (i) The cost share of the material or service used, or
    (ii) The total cost share of the practices or identifiable unit if 
requested by the land user.
    (3) The land user who purchases materials or services to carry out a 
contract is responsible for them until the district conservationist 
determines that the material or service was used for the intended 
purpose. If a material or service cost-shared by NRCS is used for a 
purpose other than to carry out the contract, the land user is indebted 
to the United States for the cost of the misused material or service. 
This indebtedness is to be repaid to NRCS as a refund or withheld from 
cost-share payments otherwise due the land user under the contract.
    (4) NRCS has the right to inspect materials or services and to take 
samples for testing. Inspections by NRCS will not be necessary if NRCS 
considers State inspection regulations adequate.
    (5) Materials or services must meet the quality standards as 
specified. NRCS may make exceptions for materials or services that do 
not meet the standards only if they will satisfactorily serve the 
intended purpose. NRCS is to deduct from the cost-share payment the 
difference between the price of the materials or services specified and 
the actual value of the different materials or services.
    (f) Division of cost-share payments. Federal cost-share payments 
made directly to suppliers of materials or services are credited to the 
land user who was issued the authorization. The remainder of the cost 
share is credited to the land user who carried out the remainder of the 
practice or identifiable unit. If more than one land user contributed to 
carrying out a practice or identifiable unit, the cost-share payment is 
to be divided proportionately according to the contribution made by each 
of the land users. Furnishing a landright or water right is not a 
contribution for cost-share payment purposes.
    (g) Other aid. Non-Federal public entities may furnish all or part 
of the land user's portion of the cost of applying a practice or 
identifiable unit with no reduction in the Federal cost share.
    (h) Assignments and claims. Land users may not assign cost-share 
payments except as provided under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 203, as 
amended by 41 U.S.C. 15. Federal cost-share payments due any land user 
are not subject to claims for advances except as provided in this 
section.

                    Subpart E--Appeals and Violations


<R05>
Sec. 632.40  Appeals.

    Land users may appeal decisions under this part in accordance with 
part 614 of this title.

[60 FR 67316, Dec. 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 632.41  Violations.

    (a) Actions causing violation. The following actions constitute 
violation of a contract by a land user:
    (1) Knowingly or negligently damaging or causing conservation 
treatment to be impaired.
    (2) Adopting land use or treatment that tends to defeat the program 
purposes during the period of the contract.
    (3) Failing to comply with the terms of the contract.
    (4) Filing a false claim.
    (5) Misusing an authorization.
    (b) Effect of violation--(1) Contract to be terminated. (i) By 
signing a contract, the land user agrees to forfeit all rights to 
further cost-share payments under a contract and to refund cost-share 
payments received not to exceed the difference between the estimated 
value of the land at time of entering into the contract and the value at 
time of termination, if the contracting officer, with approval of the 
State conservationist, determines that:
    (A) There was a violation of the contract during the time the land 
user had control of the land, and
    (B) The violation was of a nature as to warrant termination of the 
contract.
    (ii) The land user is to be obligated to refund cost-share payments 
and cost shares paid under authorizations not to exceed the difference 
between the estimated value of the land at time of entering into the 
contract and the value at time of termination.
    (2) Contract not terminated. (i) By signing a contract, the land 
user agrees to refund cost-share payments received under the contract or 
to accept payment adjustment if the contracting officer, with the 
approval of the State conservationist, determines that:
    (A) There was a violation of the contract during the time the land 
user had control of the land, and
    (B) The nature of the violation does not warrant termination of the 
contract.
    (ii) Payment adjustments may include decreasing the rate of a cost 
share, deleting a cost-share commitment from the contract, or 
withholding cost-share payments earned but not paid. The land user who 
signs the contract may be obligated to refund cost-share payments and 
cost shares paid under authorizations.


<R05>
Sec. 632.42  Violation procedures.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the regulations dealing with 
contract violations. The Chief reserves the right to revise or 
supplement any of the provisions of this section at any time if the 
action does not adversely affect the land user, or if the land user has 
been officially notified before this action is taken. No cost-share 
payment shall be made pending the decision on whether a contract 
violation has occurred.
    (b) Determination by contracting officer. On notification that a 
contract violation may have occurred, the contracting officer is to:
    (1) Determine, with the approval of the State conservationist, that 
a violation did not occur or that the violation was of such a nature 
that no penalty of forfeiture, refund, or payment adjustment is 
necessary. No notice is issued to the land user, and no further action 
is to be taken; or
    (2) Determine that a violation did occur, but the land user agrees 
to accept the penalty. If the land user agrees in writing to accept a 
penalty of forfeiture, refund, payment adjustment or termination, no 
further action is to be taken. The land user's agreement to accept the 
penalty must be approved by the contracting officer and State 
conservationist.
    (c) Notice of possible violation. (1) When the State conservationist 
is notified that a contract violation may have occurred that may warrant 
a penalty of forfeiture, refund, payment adjustment, or termination, he 
is to notify, in writing, each land user who signed the agreement of the 
alleged violation. This notice may be personally delivered or sent by 
certified or registered mail. A land user is considered to have

[[Page 399]]

received the notice at the time of personal receipt acknowledged in 
writing, at the time of the delivery of a certified or registered 
letter, or at the time of the return of a certified or registered letter 
where delivery was refused.
    (2) The notice setting forth the nature of the alleged violation is 
to give the land user an opportunity to appear at a hearing before a 
hearing officer designated by the State conservationist. The land user's 
request for a hearing is to be submitted in writing and must be received 
in the NRCS field office within 30 days after receipt of the notice. The 
land user is to be notified in writing by the hearing officer of the 
time, date, and place for the hearing. The land user is to have no right 
to a hearing if he does not file a written request for a hearing, or if 
he or his representative does not appear at the appointed time, unless 
the hearing officer, at his discretion, permits an appearance. A request 
for a hearing filed by a land user is considered to be a request by all 
land users who signed the contract.
    (d) Hearing. A public hearing is to be conducted to obtain the facts 
about the alleged violation. The hearing officer is to limit the hearing 
to relevant facts and evidence and is not to be bound by the strict 
rules of evidence as required in courts of law. Witnesses may be sworn 
in at the discretion of the hearing officer.
    (1) The land user or his representative is to be given full 
opportunity to present oral or documentary evidence about the alleged 
violation. Likewise, the United States may submit statements and 
evidence. Individuals not otherwise represented at the hearing may be 
permitted, at the discretion of the hearing officer, to give information 
of evidence. The hearing officer, at his discretion, may permit 
witnesses to be cross-examined.
    (2) The hearing officer is to make a record of the hearing so that 
the testimony can be summarized. A summary of the testimony may be made 
if both the land user and the State conservationist agree. A transcript 
of the hearing is to be made if requested by either the State 
conservationist or the land user within 10 days of the hearing. If a 
transcript is requested by the land user, the land user may be assessed 
the cost of a copy of the transcript.
    (3) The hearing officer is to close the hearing after a reasonable 
period of time if the land user or his representative is not present at 
the scheduled time. The hearing officer may, at his discretion, accept 
information and evidence submitted by others present for the hearing.
    (4) The hearing officer is to furnish the State conservationist with 
a written report setting forth his findings, conclusions, and 
recommendations. The report is to include the summary of testimony or 
transcript made of the hearing and any other information that would aid 
the State conservationist in reaching his decision.
    (e) Decision by State conservationist. The State conservationist is 
to make a decision after considering the hearing officer's report, 
including recommendations of the conservation district board if any, and 
any other information available to him, including, if applicable, the 
amount of the forfeiture, refund, or payment adjustment. The decision is 
to state whether the violation is of such a nature as to warrant 
termination of the contract. The State conservationist is to notify, in 
writing, each land user who signed the contract of his decision. The 
State conservationist may authorize or require the reopening of any 
hearing before a hearing officer for any reason at any time before his 
decision.
    (f) Appeal to Chief. Any land user affected by a decision of the 
State conservationist has the right of appeal to the Chief. The appeal 
and any briefs or statements must be received in the Office of the Chief 
within 30 days after the land user has received notice of the State 
conservationist's decision. The State conservationist is to file a brief 
or statement in the Office of the Chief within 20 days after the land 
user's brief or statement is received there. The appeal is to be limited 
to the records and the issues made before the State conservationist. The 
Chief's decision is final. The decision is to be determined by the 
record before him and the issues presented in the appeal, and the land 
user is to be notified in writing.

[[Page 400]]

    (1) If the decision provides for termination of the contract, it is 
to state that the contract is terminated, that all rights to further 
cost-share payments under the contract are forfeited, and that cost-
share payments received under the contract are to be refunded, but the 
refund is not to exceed the difference between the estimated value of 
the land at time of entering into the contract and the value at time of 
termination. The decision is to state the amount of refund and method of 
payment.
    (2) If the decision does not provide for termination of the 
contract, the land user may be required to make a refund of cost-share 
payments or to accept payment adjustments. The decision is to state the 
amount of refunds of cost-share payments or payment adjustments. In 
determining amounts of refund or payment adjustments, the following are 
to be considered:
    (i) The extent of the violation.
    (ii) Whether the violation was deliberate or the result of 
negligence or was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the land 
user.
    (iii) The effect on the program if no refund or payment adjustment 
is required.
    (iv) The extent to which the land user benefited by the violation.
    (v) The effect of the violation on the contract as a whole.
    (vi) Other considerations including the appropriateness and 
reasonableness of the refund or payment adjustment.

<R05>
Sec. 632.50  Environmental evaluation.

    (a) Environmental evaluation is an integral part of planning used by 
NRCS in developing each reclamation plan under this program. Planning 
includes site inventory and analysis, evaluation of reasonable 
alternatives, and identification of significant environmental impacts. 
Major points in planning when NRCS or the land user can make decisions 
concerning further action are:
    (1) After an evaluation of the application for program assistance to 
verify eligibility, land user objectives, and priorities for funding.
    (2) After a site-specific inventory and analysis to evaluate 
feasible treatment alternatives, costs, and environmental impacts.
    (3) After development of an acceptable reclamation plan as a basis 
for contract.
    (4) Before the signing of a mutually acceptable contract for 
financial cost-share assistance.
    (b) The scope and complexity of the assessment is to be consistent 
with the scope and complexity of the proposed reclamation.
    (c) An interdisciplinary team, consisting of NRCS and/or other 
cooperating agency personnel as needed, is used in making the 
assessment.
    (d) The Responsible Federal Official (RFO) is to use the 
environmental evaluation to make a decision concerning the need to 
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) in accordance with 
Sec. 632.52.

<R05>
Sec. 632.51  Accord with environmental laws and orders.

    (a) A final program EIS is available in compliance with section 
102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). This 
statement discloses the cumulative program impacts that significantly 
affect the quality of the human environment.
    (b) The program is to be conducted in accordance with other laws and 
Executive orders concerning environmental protection.
    (c) Channelization of streams is prohibited under this program. 
Channelization as used herein means the overall widening, deepening, 
realining, or constructing a nonvegetative protective lining over all or 
part of the perimeter of a perennial stream channel as described in NRCS 
Channel Modification Guidelines, Part B, Items 4, 5, 6, and 7, as 
published in the Federal Register on March 1, 1978 (43 FR 8278).

[[Page 401]]


<R05>
Sec. 632.52  Identifying typical classes of action.

    (a) The RFO will analyze the environmental assessment of the 
proposed action to determine which of the following classes of action 
applies. This determination will be recorded and will be available to 
the public on request.
    (1) Actions not requiring a site-specific EIS. All proposed actions 
and their impacts that are determined to be adequately discussed in the 
program EIS or determined not to be major Federal actions will not 
require a site-specific EIS. However, if the assessment reveals that 
these proposed actions will have significant adverse effects on the 
quality of the human environment, the RFO will:
    (i) Modify the action to eliminate or mitigate the significant 
adverse impacts, or
    (ii) Withdraw further Federal assistance if significant adverse 
impacts cannot be eliminated or mitigated.
    (2) Actions requiring a site-specific EIS. A site-specific EIS is 
required for proposed actions if their impacts are not adequately 
discussed in the program EIS, and the proposal is determined to be a 
major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment in accordance with Sec. 650.7(b) of this chapter. When a 
decision is made to prepare an EIS, a Notice of Intent will be published 
in the Federal Register. The content and format of the EIS is to be 
consistent with the format of the program EIS and use scoping and 
tiering techniques to focus on the significant environmental issues.
    (3) Actions excluded from the EIS requirements. Those actions taken 
to prevent loss of life or property under the extreme danger provisions 
of priority 1 as described in Sec. 632.12. These actions are determined 
by a limited environmental assessment that reasonably identifies the 
possible loss of life or property.

of inundation or saturation of the soil, native vegetation, and natural 
topography of eligible lands. The NRCS may provide cost-share assistance 
for the activities that promote the protection of wetland functions and 
values. Specific protection actions may be undertaken by the participant 
or other NRCS designee.
    (b) Participant eligibility. To be eligible to participate in the 
WBP, a person must:
    (1) Be the landowner of eligible land for which enrollment is 
sought; or
    (2) Have possession of the land by written lease over all designated 
acreage in the agreement for at least two years preceding the date of 
the agreement and will have possession over the all designated acreage 
for the agreement period.
    (c) Eligible land. (1) The NRCS shall determine whether land is 
eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands may 
be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful 
protection of wetland functions and values when considering the cost of 
entering the agreement and protection costs. Land placed under an 
agreement shall be specifically identified and designated for the period 
of the agreement.
    (2) The following land is eligible for enrollment in the WBP:
    (i) Privately owned inland fresh wetland areas of types 1 through 7.
    (ii) Privately owned inland fresh wetland areas of types 1 through 7 
which are under a drainage easement with the U.S. Department of the 
Interior or with a State government which permits agricultural use; or
    (iii) Other privately owned land which is adjacent to or within one 
quarter mile of designated types 1 through 7 wetlands and which is 
determined by the State Conservationist to be essential for the nesting, 
breeding, or feeding of migratory waterfowl, or for the protection of 
wetland.
    (d) Ineligible land. The following land is not eligible for 
enrollment in the WBP:
    (1) Converted wetlands if the conversion was in violation of 16 
U.S.C. 3821 et seq.;
    (2) Lands owned by an agency of the United States;
    (3) Land which is set aside or diverted under any other program 
administered by the Department of Agriculture;
    (4) Land which is harvested in the first year of the agreement 
period prior to being designated, except for land on which timber is 
harvested in accordance with a Forest Management Plan which is included 
in the conservation plan and is approved by the State forester or 
equivalent State official;
    (5) Lands where implementation of agreement practices would be 
futile due to on-site or off-site conditions; and
    (6) Land on which the ownership has changed during the 2-year period 
preceding the first year of the agreement period unless:
    (i) The new ownership was acquired by will or succession as a result 
of the death of the previous owner,
    (ii) The land was acquired by the owner or operator to replace 
eligible land from which he was displaced because of its acquisition by 
any Federal, State, or other agency having the right of eminent domain, 
or
    (iii) The new owner operated the land to be designated for as long 
as 2 years preceding the first year of the agreement and has control of 
such land for the agreement period.


<R05>
Sec. 633.5  Application procedures.

    (a) Application for participation. To apply for enrollment, a person 
must submit an application for participation in the WBP.
    (b) Preliminary agency actions. The NRCS must certify that the 
designated acreage that would be placed under an agreement constitutes a 
viable wetland unit, contains sufficient adjacent land

[[Page 404]]

to protect the wetland, and provides essential habitat for the nesting, 
breeding or feeding of migratory waterfowl.
    (c) Where funds allocated to the State do not permit accepting all 
requests which are filed, the State Conservationist, in consultation 
with the State Technical Committee, may establish ranking criteria and 
limit the approval of requests for agreements in accordance with the 
ranking scheme. Any ranking scheme shall consider estimated costs of the 
agreement, costs of protection, availability of matching funds, 
significance of wetland functions and values, and estimated success of 
protection measures.
    (d) The NRCS may place higher priority on certain geographic regions 
of the State where the protection of wetlands may better achieve NRCS 
State and regional goals and objectives.
    (e) Notwithstanding any limitation of this part, the State 
Conservationist may enroll eligible lands at any time in order to 
encompass total wetland areas subject to multiple ownership or otherwise 
to achieve program objectives. Similarly, the State Conservationist may, 
at any time, exclude otherwise eligible lands if the participation of 
the adjacent landowners is essential to the successful protection of the 
wetlands and those adjacent landowners are unwilling to participate.


<R05>
Sec. 633.6  Program participation requirements.

    (a) WBP Agreement. An agreement shall be executed for each 
participating farm. The agreement shall be signed by the owner of the 
designated acreage and any other person who, as landlord, tenant, or 
share cropper, will share in the payment or has an interest in the 
designated acreage. There may be more than one agreement for a farm.
    (b) Agreement period. The agreement period shall:
    (1) Be for a term of 10 years;
    (2) Become effective on January 1 of the year in which the agreement 
is approved except that the agreement shall become effective on January 
1 of the next succeeding year in cases where, at the time the agreement 
is approved, the NRCS determines that the agreement signers will be 
unable to comply with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section in 
the year in which such agreement is approved.
    (c) Agreement terms and conditions. The acreage designated under an 
agreement shall:
    (1) Be maintained for the agreement period in a manner which will 
preserve, restore, or improve the wetland character of the land;
    (2) Not be drained, burned, filled, or otherwise used in a manner 
which would destroy the wetland character of the acreage, except that 
the provisions of this paragraph shall not prohibit the carrying out of 
management practices which are specified in a conservation plan for the 
farm;
    (3) Not be used as a dumping area for draining other wetlands, 
except where the State Conservationist determines that such use is 
consistent with the sound management of wetlands and is specified in the 
conservation plan;
    (4) Not be used as a source of irrigation water;
    (5) Not be used for the harvesting of a crop;
    (6) Not be hayed except for during periods of severe drought and

consultation with the State Technical

[[Page 405]]

Committee, may establish uniform maximum annual payment limits for 
agreements within a State or for geographic areas within a State.
    (d) Preliminary estimates of annual payments. Upon request prior to 
filing an application for enrollment, a person may be apprised of the 
maximum annual payment rates.
    (e) Adjustment of annual rates.
    (1) The State Conservationist, in consultation with the State 
Technical Committee, shall reexamine the payment rates with respect to 
each agreement at the beginning of the fifth year of any ten-year 
initial or renewal period and before the renewal expires.
    (2) An adjustment in the payment rates shall be made for any initial 
or renewal period taking into consideration the current land rental 
rates and crop values in the area. No adjustment shall be made in a 
payment rate which will result in a reduction of an annual payment rate 
from the rate which is specified in the initial or renewal agreement.
    (3) The rate or rates of annual payments may be increased if the 
program participant permits access by the general public to the 
designated acreage for hunting, trapping, fishing, and hiking, subject 
to applicable State and Federal regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 633.8  Cost-share payments.

    (a) In addition to annual payments, the NRCS may share the cost with 
program participants of protecting the wetland functions and values of 
the enrolled land as provided in the conservation plan. The NRCS may pay 
up to 75 percent of such costs.
    (b) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by the 
NRCS that an eligible practice or an identifiable unit of the practice 
has been established in compliance with appropriate standards and 
specifications. Identified practices may be implemented by the program 
participant or other designee.
    (c) A program participant may seek additional cost-share assistance 
from other public or private organizations as long as the activities 
funded are in compliance with this part. In no event shall the program 
participant receive an amount which exceeds 100 percent of the total 
actual cost of the practices.


<R05>
Sec. 633.9  Conservation plan.

    (a) The program participant, with assistance from NRCS and in 
consultation with the Conservation District, shall prepare a 
conservation plan for the acreage designated under an agreement.
    (b) The conservation plan is the basis for the agreement and is

parties to the agreement, consent to the termination of the agreement 
where:
    (1) The parties to the agreement are unable to comply with the terms 
of the agreement as the result of conditions beyond their control;
    (2) Compliance with the terms of the agreement would work a severe 
hardship on the parties to the agreement; or
    (3) Termination of the agreement would be in the public interest.
    (b) If an agreement is terminated in accordance with the provisions 
of this section, the annual payment for the year in which the agreement

                           Subpart A--General


<R05>
Sec. 634.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), with the concurrence of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), to set forth regulations to carry out a Rural 
Clean Water Program (RCWP) under section 35, Pub. L. 95-217; 91 Stat. 
1579; 33 U.S.C. 1288.
    (b) The Rural Clean Water Program provides financial and technical 
assistance to private landowners and operators (participants) having 
control of rural land. The assistance is provided through long-term 
contracts (5 to 10 years) to install best management practices (BMP's) 
in project areas which have critical water quality problems resulting 
from agricultural activities. The proposed project area must be within a 
high priority area in an approved agricultural portion of a 208 water 
quality management plan. Participation in RCWP is voluntary.
    (c) The program is a new USDA program and an extension of existing 
water-quality management programs of EPA.


<R05>
Sec. 634.2  Objective.

    The RCWP is designed to reduce agricultural nonpoint source 
pollutants to improve water quality in rural areas to meet water quality 
standards or water quality goals. The objective is to be achieved in the 
most cost-effective manner possible in keeping with the provision of 
adequate supplies of food and fiber and a quality environment.


<R05>
Sec. 634.3  Administration.

    At the national level, the Secretary of Agriculture, with the 
concurrence of the Administrator, EPA, administers RCWP. The Secretary 
of Agiculture has delegated responsibility for administration of the 
program (43 FR 8252) to the Administrator, Natural Resources 
Conservation Service (NRCS). NRCS will be assisted by other USDA 
agencies in accordance with existing authorities.

[[Page 408]]

    (a) A National Rural Clean Water Coordinating Committee (NRCWCC), 
chaired by the Administrator, NRCS, is to assist in carrying out the 
Rural Clean Water Program.
    (b) At the State level, a State Rural Clean Water Coordinating 
Committee (SRCWCC) is to assist the State Conservationist, NRCS, in 
administering the program. The State Conservationist will chair the 
SRCWCC.
    (c) To assure coordination at the project level, a local Rural Clean 
Water Coordinating Committee is to be established at the time the 
application is developed. An existing local committee may be used, where 
practicable, to perform the functions of this committee.
    (d) The Administrator, NRCS, through the State Conservationists, 
NRCS, is to enter into agreements, where practicable, with soil 
conservation districts, State soil and water conservation agencies, or 
State water quality agencies to administer all or part of the program 
for a project area. That portion of program administration to be 
conducted by these agencies will be defined in the project application 
and grant agreement. Where this is not practicable, USDA will administer 
the program in a project area. In those instances where USDA retains 
administration of the program in a project area, NRCS will enter into 
agreements for the transfer of funds to the Agricultural Stabilization 
and Conservation Service (ASCS) for the administration of part of the 
program.

Sec. 634.10  Applicability.

    RCWP is applicable in project areas that meet the criteria for 
eligibility contained in Sec. 634.12 and are authorized for funding by 
the Administrator, NRCS.


<R05>
Sec. 634.11  Availability of funds.

    (a) The provisions of the program are subject to the appropriation 
of funds by Congress to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
    (b) The allocation of funds to the administering agencies is to be 
made on the basis of the total funds needed to carry out the project.
    (c) The obligation of Federal funds for RCWP contracts with 
participants

[[Page 414]]

is to be made on the basis of the total contract costs.


<R05>
Sec. 634.12  Eligible project areas.

    (a) Only those project areas which are included in an approved 
agricultural portion of a 208 water quality management plan, or revised 
portions thereof, and have identified agricultural nonpoint source water 
quality problems are eligible for authorization under RCWP. Those 
critical areas or sources of pollutants significantly contributing to 
the water quality problems are eligible for financial and technical 
assistance.
    (b) The management agency designated by the Governor under section 
208(c)(1) of the Act to implement the agricultural portion of the 208 
plan must assure in writing in the project application that there will 
be an adequate level of participation by land owners or operators with 
critical areas or sources in a project area.
    (c) An RCWP project area is a hydrologically related land area. 
Exceptions may be made for ease of administration, or to focus on 
concentrated critical areas. To be designated as an RCWP project area 
eligible for authorization, the area's water quality problems must be 
related to agricultural nonpoint source pollutants, including sediment 
animal waste, irrigation return flows, runoff, or leachate that contain 
high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved solids, toxics 
(pesticides and heavy metals), or high pathogen levels. Generally, the 
project areas will be less than 200,000 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 634.13  Project applications.

    (a) The SRCWCC is to assure that a process exists to prepare the 
RCWP project applications for submission by the Governor in order of

States or local governments with their own cost-share programs may 
receive greater consideration for the funding of RCWP projects,
    (ii) Commitment of local leadership to promote the program, and
    (5) The project area's contribution to meeting the national water 
quality goals.
    (b) Based on the project applications, the NRCWCC is to recommend an 
upper limit of the Federal contribution to the total cost of the 
project.
    (c) All project applications will be reviewed by EPA. Project 
applications approval for funding require written EPA concurrence, 
except that the Administrator, NRCS, may assume EPA's concurrence if EPA 
does not act within 45 days following receipt of the project 
application. EPA review of project applications will occur concurrently 
with review by the NRCWCC.
    (d) The Administrator, NRCS, will approve projects for funding. The 
NRCWCC acting through the Chairman will announce the approval of the 
project. The State Conservationist, NRCS, through the SRCWCC, will also 
inform the other involved Federal, State, and local agencies of the 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 634.15  Agreements.

    The State Conservationist, NRCS, upon receiving notice of an 
approved project, is to enter into a grant agreement with the 
administering agency, except in those cases where USDA is to administer 
the program. When USDA retains administration, the State 
Conservationist, NRCS, is to enter into a fund transfer agreement with 
the State Executive Director, ASCS.
    (a) Grant agreements. Grant agreements detail the working 
arrangements and applicable operating regulations between NRCS and the 
administering agency. A written grant agreement identifying the parties 
involved, their responsibilities for carrying out the program, and the 
amount of program funds to be encumbered by NRCS is to be executed by 
the parties. This agreement is the fund obligating document. It also 
sets out the necessary working arrangements between parties for 
determining and allocating the administering agency's costs. All grants 
to administering agencies are to be in

[[Page 416]]

accordance with OMB Circular No. A-102, Department of the Treasury 
Circular No. 1075, and Federal Management Circular No. 74-4. State or 
local administering agency grants will be funded under Letter-of-Credit 
serviced by the U.S. Treasury Regional Disbursing Office, or by NRCS 
approved advance/reimbursement financing arrangements subject to the 
terms and conditions of the grant agreement.
    (1) The grant agreement will provide for payment of cost-sharing for 
BMP (Sec. 634.5(j)) and administrative costs (Sec. 634.5(c)).
    (2) The grant agreement may provide for payment of technical 
assistance costs when the administering agency has the capability, and 
the NRCS designates that agency to provide this assistance to RCWP 
participants.
    (3) The administering agency is to monitor the performance of 
activities supported by RCWP grant funds to assure that time schedules 
and participant RCWP contract requirements are being met. Performance 
goals are to be measured against the terms of the grant agreement and 
program directives. When NRCS determines that onsite technical 
inspections, certified completion data, and financial status reports do 
not provide adequate grant evaluation data, the following information 
may be requested:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the objectives 
established for the plan,
    (ii) Reasons why established objectives were not met, and
    (iii) Objectives established for the next reporting period.
    (4) Grant agreements may be amended by mutural agreement of the 
parties to the agreement. NRCS may unilaterally amend agreements when 
the sole consideration is a change in the cost and the Administrator, 
NRCS, based on NRCWCC recommendations, determines that such an 
adjustment is necessary to carry out the program efficiently and 
effectively.
    (b) Fund transfer agreements. When it is impractical for NRCS to 
enter into agreements with local soil conservation districts, State soil 
and water conservation agencies, or State water quality agencies to 
administer the program in a project area, USDA will retain program 
administration. In this case, the State Executive Director, ASCS, and 
the State Conservationist, NRCS, are to enter into an agreement for the 
transfer of funds to ASCS through county ASC committees for activities 
included in administrative cost (Sec. 634.5(c)) and BMP cost 
(Sec. 634.5(j)). The following general working arrangements are to 
apply:
    (1) Administering contracts, making cost-share payment, and program 
reporting are to be provided by ASCS as the administering agency.
    (2) NRCS, or its designee, with appropriate Federal or State agency 
support, will provide technical assistance to participants in preparing 
RCWP contracts and in carrying out their water-quality plans.
    (c) Agreements for services. NRCS may enter into an agreement for 
services with a State or local agency. The designee must meet the 
requirements of OMB Circular No. A-102.
    (d) Contracts for services. NRCS may enter into contracts for 
services with individuals or firms for providing technical assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 634.16  Suspension of grants.

    (a) Suspension orders. Work on a project or on a portion or phase of 
a project for which a grant has been awarded, may be suspended by order 
of the State Conservationist, NRCS. Suspension does not affect RCWP 
contracts existing at the time the suspension order is issued, or the 
administering agency's responsibility to make payments under such 
contracts unless specifically provided for in the suspend order. In no 
event will the participant's right to cost-share payment be diminished 
by action taken under this section.
    (b) Use of suspension orders. Suspension may be required for good 
cause, such as default by the administering agency, failure to comply 
with the terms and conditions of the grant, realignment of programs, or 
advancements in the state of the art.
    (c) Contents of suspension orders. Prior to issuance, suspension 
orders will be discussed with the administering agency and may be 
appropriately modified, in the light of such discussions. Suspension 
orders are to include:

[[Page 417]]

    (1) A clear description of the work to be suspended,
    (2) Instructions as to the issuance of further orders by the 
administering agency for materials or services,

exceed forty-five (45) calendar days.
    (e) Effect of suspension order. (1) Upon receipt of a suspension 
order, the administering agency shall promptly comply with its terms and 
take all reasonable steps to minimize costs allocable to the work 
covered by the order during the period of work suspension. During the 
suspension period, NRCS shall either:
    (i) Cancel the suspension order, in full or in part, and authorize 
resumption of work, or
    (ii) Take action to terminate the work covered by such order as 
provided by Sec. 634.17.
    (2) If a suspension order is canceled, or the period of the order 
expires, the administering agency shall promptly resume the suspended 
work. An equitable adjustment shall be made in the grant period, the 
project period, or grant amount, or all of these, and the grant 
agreement may be amended:
    (i) The suspension order results in an increase in the time, or cost 
properly allocable to, the performance of any part of the project; and
    (ii) The administering agency asserts a written claim for such 
adjustment within thirty (30) days after the end of the period of work 
suspension. If no written claim is made, NRCS may unilaterally make such 
adjustments.
    (iii) Reasonable costs resulting from the suspension order shall be 
allowed in arriving at any terminations settlement.
    (3) Costs incurred by the administering agency after a suspension 
order is delivered that are not authorized by this section or 
specifically authorized in writing by the State Conservationist, NRCS, 
shall not be allowable costs.


<R05>
Sec. 634.17  Termination of grant agreement.

    (a) Termination agreement or notice. (1) The State Conservationist, 
NRCS, may, based on evidence of failure to comply with the terms of the 
grant agreement, issue a notice of intent to terminate the grant 
agreement. The notice of intent to terminate has the force and effect of 
extending or modifying the conditions of the suspend order. Any 
modification of the conditions of the suspend order shall be shown in 
the notice and discussed with the administering agency. The State 
Conservationist shall give not less than ten (10) days written notice to 
the administering agency (certified mail, return receipt requested) of 
intent to terminate the grant in whole or in part.
    (2) After the administering agency has been afforded an opportunity 
for consultation, the State Conservationist, NRCS, may request 
authorization from the Administrator, NRCS, to terminate the grant in 
whole or in part. If the Administrator, NRCS, concurs in the termination 
action, the proposed termination notice will be forwarded to the 
Administrator, EPA, for concurrence.
    (3) After the Administrators, NRCS and EPA, have been informed of 
any expressed views of the administering agency and concurred in the 
proposed termination, the State Conservationist, NRCS, may, in writing 
(certified mail, return receipt requested), terminate the grant in whole 
or in part.
    (4) Termination of all or part of the grant agreement may be carried 
out by either execution of a termination agreement by the State 
Conservationist, NRCS, or issuance of a grant termination notice by the 
State Conservationist, NRCS. The agreement or notice shall establish the 
effective date of termination of the grant, the basis for settlement of 
grant termination

[[Page 418]]

costs, and the amount and date of payment of any sums due either party.
    (b) Basis for termination. A grant may be terminated by NRCS for 
good cause subject to negotiation and payment of appropriate termination 
settlement costs. Cause for termination by NRCS includes:
    (1) Failure by the administering agency to make satisfactory 
progress toward achieving an adequate level of participation; or other 
evidence satisfactory to the NRCWCC, Administrator, EPA, and the 
Administrator, NRCS, that the administering agency has failed or is 
unable to perform in accordance with the provisions of the grant 
agreement; or
    (2) Failure through no fault of the administering agency to achieve 
an adequate level of participation; or other evidence satisfactory to 
the NRCWCC, Administrator, EPA, and the Administrator, NRCS, that the 
planned actions approved in the project application cannot be achieved.
    (c) Effect of grant termination. (1)(i) In those cases where cause 
for grant termination is based on the administering agency's failure or 
inability to perform (Sec. 634.17(b)(1)), upon termination, the 
administering agency must refund or credit to the United States that 
portion of the grant funds paid or owed to the administering agency and 
allocable to the terminated project work. Funds needed to meet 
unavoidable commitments may be retained. All other funds, including 
unexpended cost-sharing monies for existing RCWP contracts executed 
prior to the termination date, shall be refunded to the United States. 
The administering agency shall not make any new commitments or enter 
into any new RCWP contracts. The administering agency shall reduce the 
amount of other outstanding commitments insofar as possible and report 
to the State Conservationist, NRCS, the uncommitted balance of funds 
awarded under the grant. The allowability of termination costs will be 
determined in conformance with applicable Federal cost principles.
    (ii) Upon termination of a grant agreement, existing RCWP contracts 
and their related obligations will immediately, and in no case later 
than 5 calendar days be transferred to the ASCS county office to assure 
continuity in payments to participants. The State Conservationist, NRCS, 
will immediately initiate action under Sec. 634.15 to establish a new 
administering agency for completion of the project.
    (2) In those cases where cause for grant termination is based on 
failure to achieve the planned actions through no fault of the 
administering agency, the termination agreement and amended grant 
agreement are to permit the administering agency to fulfill the 
obligations of its existing RCWP contracts. The administering agency 
shall not make any new commitments or enter into any new RCWP contracts 
without NRCS approval.


<R05>
Sec. 634.18  Termination of project.

    (a) An RCWP project is terminated by the State Conservationist 
because an adequate level of participation cannot be achieved. Upon this 
determination, the State Conservationist shall publish in a newspaper of 
public record in the project area a notice of intent to terminate all or 
part of the grant agreement and the project (Sec. 634.7(c)), and an 
announcement of the time and place of a public hearing.
    (b) No sooner than 15 days from the publication of the notice of 
intent to terminate all or part of the project and grant agreement, the 
State Conservationist will conduct a public hearing in the project area.
    (c) If, based on the hearing record, the performance record of the 
administering agency, and the recommendations of the SRCWCC, the State 
Conservationist determines that the project will be terminated pursuant 
to Sec. 634.17(c), the State Conservationist will enter into a grant 
termination agreement or issue a grant termination notice.
    (d) The existing RCWP contracts will be transferred to the ASCS 
county office pursuant to Sec. 634.17(c)(1)(ii).
    (e) The State Conservationist will prepare a project close-out 
report summarizing the actions accomplished.

[[Page 419]]


<R05>
Sec. 634.19  Project completion and closeout.

    (a) The maximum total life of a project shall be fifteen (15) years 
or less.
    (b) The allowable contracting period may be increased if an adequate 
level of participation has been achieved and the designated management 
agency assures a significant increase in participation can be reached in 
a reasonable time.
    (c) The grant or fund transfer agreement with an administering 
agency shall expire when the administering agency has fulfilled all of 
its obligations in the long-term RCWP contracts.
    (d) When a project is completed, the administering agency is to 
provide the State Conservationist, NRCS, a closeout report which 
summarizes the actions accomplished.


<R04>
                  Subpart C--Participant RCWP Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 634.20  Eligible land.

    RCWP is only applicable to privately owned land. Land owned by 
corporations whose ownership is public (i.e., their stock is publicly 
traded over the market) is eligible for program assistance only if the 
corporation can document that the installation of BMP's places an 
inappropriate financial burden on the corporation.


<R05>
Sec. 634.21  Eligible participants.

    (a) Any landowner or operator whose land or activities in a project 
area is contributing to the area's agricultural nonpoint source water 
quality problems and who has an approved water quality plan is eligible 
to enter into an RCWP contract.
    (b) This program will be conducted in compliance with all 
nondiscrimination requirements as contained in the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 and amendments thereto and the Regulations of the Secretary of 
Agriculture (7 CFR 15.1 through 15.12).


<R05>
Sec. 634.22  Application for assistance.

    (a) Landowners or operators must apply for RCWP assistance through 
the office of the administering agency or its designee(s) by completing 
the prescribed application form.
    (b) The priority for assistance among landowners and operators in 
developing water quality plans is to be determined jointly, through an 
agreed-to process, by the county ASC committee and the soil conservation 
district, with technical assistance from NRCS.
    (c) Applications that are ineligible or technically infeasible are 
to be returned to the applicant with a letter stating the reasons for 
disapproval. Applications that are of a low priority will be retained 
and the applicant will be sent a notice that the application is being 
held for a period to be determined locally for future consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 634.23  Water quality plan.

    (a) The participant's water quality plan, developed with technical 
assistance by the NRCS or its designee, is to include appropriate BMP's 
identified in the approved agricultural portion of the 208 water quality 
management plan. Such BMP's must reduce the amount of pollutants that 
enter a stream or lake by:
    (1) Methods, such as reducing the application rates or changing the 
application methods of potential pollutants, and
    (2) Methods, such as practices or combinations of practices which 
prevent potential pollutants from leaving source areas or reduce the 
amount of potential pollutants that reach a stream or lake after leaving 
a source area.
    (b) Participant's water quality plans shall as a minimum include 
BMP's for all critical areas or sources. The plans will include BMP's 
which are required but not cost-shared. Non-cost-shared BMP's, essential 
for the performance and maintenance of cost-shared BMP's shall be 
required as a condition of the RCWP contract.
    (c) The participant is responsible for compliance with all other 
applicable Federal, State, and local laws that deal with the 
participant's nonpoint source water quality problems, such as the 
treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. BMP's required for 
compliance may be cost shared.
    (d) It is recognized that the participants' water-quality plans upon 
which

[[Page 420]]

the RCWP contracts are to be based may include conservation measures 
other than those related to water quality improvement. These measures 
are not eligible for cost sharing under this program. The installation 
of such conservation measures will not be required as a condition of the 
RCWP contract and will not be shown in the time schedules for 
implementing BMP's.
    (e) Time schedules for implementing BMP's are to be provided in the 
participant's water quality plan. The time schedule is to establish the 
length of the contract within the 5 to 10 year period established by 
law.
    (f) The Natural Resources Conservation Service will certify as to 
the technical adequacy of the water-quality plan.
    (g) The soil conservation districts are to review and approve all 
water-quality plans and modifications.


<R05>
Sec. 634.24  Cost sharing.

    (a) The portion of BMP cost (including labor) to be cost shared 
shall be that part which the Secretary determines is necessary and 
appropriate. The value of land upon which BMP's are applied, or the 
participant's water rights, cannot be considered a part of the 
participant's share of the cost.
    (b) The administering agency, in consultation with the county ASC 
committee(s), soil conservation district(s), and designated management 
agency will annually set maximum individual BMP cost-share levels for 
the project area. However, the Federal share of the cost of the contract 
cannot exceed 50 percent unless a variance has been granted.
    (c) Recommended variances exceeding the 50 percent level must be in 
the public interest and based on the following criteria:
    (1) The main benefits to be derived from measures are related to 
improving offsite water quality, and
    (2) The matching share requirements would place a burden on the 
landowner or operator which would probably prevent him or her from 
participating in the program.
    (d) BMP's to be cost shared must have a positive effect on water 
quality by reducing the amount of agricultural nonpoint source 
pollutants that enter a stream or lake.
    (e) Cost sharing is not to be made available for:
    (1) Measures installed primarily for bringing additional land into 
crop production, including but not limited to land clearing and brush 
removal;
    (2) Measures installed primarily for increasing production on 
existing cropland, including but not limited to bedding, field ditches, 
open drains, and tile drains;
    (3) Measures having flood protection as the primary purpose, 
including but not limited to open channels, clearing and snagging, and 
obstruction removal;
    (4) Structural measures authorized for installation under Pub. L. 
83-566.
    (f) The Federal cost-share level is not to be reduced by the 
contribution of a State or subdivision thereof. Total payments from 
Federal, State, and local sources for a BMP may not exceed the total 
cost of that BMP.


<R05>
Sec. 634.25  Contracting.

    (a) To participate in RCWP, a landowner or operator must enter into 
a contract in which he or she agrees to apply his or her water-quality 
plan. Any person who controls, or shares control, of the farm, ranch, or 
other land for the proposed contract period (5 to 10 years) must sign 
the contract.
    (b) Cost-sharing payments cannot be provided for any measure that is 
initiated before the contract is approved by the administering agency.
    (c) The participant must furnish satisfactory evidence of his or her 
control of the farm, ranch, or other land. The administering agency is 
to determine the acceptability of the evidence and maintain current 
ownership evidence in the contract file.
    (d) RCWP contracts shall include the basic contract document, 
special provisions as needed, the participant's water-quality plan, 
schedule of operations, and any other data necessary.
    (e) NRCS or its designee shall approve the technical adequacy of the 
RCWP contract and obtain the required signature of the participants. The 
NRCS or its designee will provide the contract to the administering 
agency for certification of fund availability and for execution.

[[Page 421]]

    (f) Participants shall install best management practices according 
to the specifications that are applicable at the time measures are 
installed.
    (g) NRCS will provide technical assistance to participants for 
installing BMPs. The State Conservationist, NRCS, or its designee may 
enter into contracts with qualified soil conservation districts or 
others to provide technical assistance.
    (h) The RCWP contract is to require BMPs to be operated and 
maintained by the participant at no cost to that administering agency.
    (i) The contract period is to be not less than 5 and not more than 
10 years. A contract is to extend for at least 1 year after the 
application of the last cost-shared BMPs. All contract items are to be 
accomplished prior to contract expiration.
    (j) A land owner or operator may enter into a contract jointly 
(pooling ageement) with other land owners or operators to solve mutual 
water quality problems. Each participant must enter into an RCWP 
contract to treat water quality problems not covered by the joint 
arrangement.
    (k) Participants may use all available sources of assistance to 
accomplish their water-quality objectives. They are responsible for:
    (1) Accomplishing the water-quality plan;
    (2) Keeping the administering agency informed of their current 
mailing address;
    (3) Obtaining, having in hand, and maintaining any required permits 
and landrights necessary to perform the planned work;
    (4) Applying or arranging for the application of BMPs, as scheduled 
in the plan, according to approved standards and specifications;
    (5) The operation and maintenance of BMPs installed during the 
contract period; and
    (6) Obtaining the authorities, rights, easements, or other approvals 
necessary to maintain BMPs in keeping with applicable laws and 
regulations.
    (l) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, NRCS, and 
Administrator, EPA, the administering agency shall not enter into any 
new RCWP contracts after five (5) years of elapsed time from the date 
when RCWP funds are first made available to begin the project.
    (m) Contracts may be terminated due to hardship by mutual agreement 
if the administering agency and the State Conservationist, NRCS, 
determine that such action would be in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 634.26  Contract modifications.

    (a) The administering agency may modify contracts previously entered 
into if it is determined to be desirable to carry out the purposes of 
the program, facilitate the practical administration thereof, or to 
accomplish equitable treatment with respect to other conservation, land-
use, or water-quality programs.
    (b) Requirements of active contracts may be waived or modified by 
the administering agency only if such waiver or modification is 
specifically provided for in these regulations. NRCS concurrence in 
modifications is necessary when modifications involve a technical aspect 
of the participant's water-quality plan. A contract may be modified only 
if it is determined that such modifications are desirable to carry out 
purposes of the program or to facilitate the program's practical 
administration.
    (c) Contracts may be modified to add, delete, substitute, or 
reinstall best management practices when:
    (1) The installed measure failed to achieve the desired results 
through no fault of the participant,
    (2) The installed measure deteriorated because of conditions beyond 
the control of the participant, or
    (3) Another BMP is substituted that will achieve the desired 
results.
    (d) Contract modifications are not required when items of work are 
accomplished prior to scheduled completion or within 1 year following 
the year of scheduled completion.
    (e) If, during the contract period, all or part of the right and 
interest in the land is transferred by sale or other transfer action, 
the contract is terminated on the land unit that was transferred and the 
participant having control over such land:

[[Page 422]]

    (1) Forfeits all right to any future cost-share payments on the 
transferred land unit, and
    (2) Must refund with interest all cost-share payments that have been 
made on the transferred land unit unless the new land owner or operator 
becomes a party to the contract, except that where it is determined by 
the administering agency, with the approval of the State 
conservationist, NRCS, that the established BMPs will provide water 
quality benefits for the design life of the BMP, the payment may be 
retained.
    (f) If the new land owner or operator becomes a party to the 
contract:
    (1) Payment which has been earned, but not made to the participant 
who applied the BMPs and had control prior to the transfer, can be made,
    (2) Such land owner or operator is to assume all obligations of the 
previous participant on the transferred land unit,
    (3) The contract with the new participant is to remain in effect 
with the original terms and conditions, and
    (4) The contract is to be modified in writing to show the changes 
caused by the transfer. If the modification is not acceptable to the 
administering agency, the provisions of paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of 
this section apply.
    (g) The transfer of all or part of a land unit by a participant does 
not affect the rights and obligations of other participants who have 
signed the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 634.27  Cost-share payment.

    (a) General. Participants are to obtain or contract for materials or 
services as needed to install BMPs. Federal Cost-share payments are to 
be made by the administering agency upon certification by the District 
Conservationist, NRCS, or its designee, that the BMPs, or an 
identifiable unit thereof, have been properly carried out and meet the 
appropriate standards and specifications.
    (b) Payment maximum. The maximum total Federal cost-share payment to 
a participant shall be limited to $50,000. Exceptions to this limit may 
be made by the administering agency with concurrence of the 
Administrator, NRCS, upon recommedation of the NRCWCC, where it 
determines that the main benefits to be derived are essential for 
meeting the water quality objectives in the project area.
    (c) Basis for cost-share payment. (1) Cost-share payments are to be 
made by the administering agency at the cost-share percentage and by one 
of the following methods designated by the administering agency and set 
out in the contract:
    (i) Average cost, or
    (ii) Actual cost not to exceed average cost.
    (2) If the average cost at the time of starting the installation of 
a BMP or identifiable unit is less than the costs specified in the 
contract, payment is to be at the lower rate. If the costs at the start 
of installation are higher, payment may be made at the higher rate. A 
modification will be necessary if the higher cost results in a 
significant increase in the total cost-share obligation. Cost-share 
payment is not to be made until the modification reflecting the increase 
is approved.
    (d) Average cost development. Average costs are to be developed by 
the administering agency for each project using cost data from the local 
area. These costs should be reviewed by the SRCWCC for consistency with 
average costs in other USDA programs. The average cost list is to be 
updated annually by the administering agency.
    (e) Application for payment. Cost-share payments can be made by the 
administering agency after a participant has carried out a BMP or an 
identifiable unit of a BMP. Application for payment must be submitted to 
the administering agency, be certified by the NRCS or its designee, and 
be supported by such cost receipts as are required by the administering 
agency. It is the participant's responsibility to apply for payments.
    (f) Authorizations for payments to suppliers. (1) The contract may 
authorize that part or all of the Federal cost share for a BMP or an 
identifiable unit be made directly to suppliers of materials or 
services. The materials or services must be delivered or performed 
before payment is made.
    (2) Federal cost shares will not be in excess of the cost share 
attributable to the material or service used or not in

[[Page 423]]

excess of the cost share for all identifiable units as may be requested 
by the participant.
    (g) Material inspection and analysis. When authorizations for 
payments to suppliers are specified, the administering agency, its 
representatives, or the Government reserve the right to inspect, sample, 
and analyze materials or services prior to their use.
    (h) Assignments, set-offs, and claims. (1) A State or local 
administering agency may allow the assignment of payments to the extent 
provided by State law. When ASCS is designated as the administering 
agency, assignments by any participant who may be entitled to cost-share 
payment under the program are prohibited unless they are made in 
accordance with the provisions of section 203, Title 31, U.S.C., as 
amended, and section 15, Title 41, U.S.C., as amended.
    (2) If any participant to whom compensation is payable under RCWP is 
indebted to the United States and such indebtedness is listed on the 
county register of indebtedness maintained by the County ASC committee, 
the compensation due the participant must be used (set-off) to reduce 
that idebtedness. Indebtedness to USDA is to be given first 
consideration. Deductions for setoffs involving a nonresident alien 
shall be made as provided by 26 U.S.C. 871. Setoffs made pursuant to 
this section are not to deprive the participant of any right to contest 
the justness of the indebtedness involved, either by administrative 
appeal or by legal action.
    (3) Any cost-share payment due any participant shall be allowed 
without deduction of claims for advances except as provided for above 
and without regard to any claim or lien against any crop, or proceeds 
thereof, in favor of the participant or any other creditor.
    (i) Access to land unit and records. Any authorized administering 
agency, or NRCS employees or agents, shall have the right of access at 
reasonable times to land under application or contract, and the right to 
examine any program records to ascertain the accuracy of any 
representations made in the application or contract. This is limited to 
the right to furnish technical assistance and to inspect work performed 
under the contract.
    (j) Suspension of payments. No cost-share payments will be made 
pending a decision on whether or not a contract violation has occurred.
    (k) Ineligible payments. The filing of requests for payment for 
BMP's not carried out, or for BMP's carried out in such a manner that 
they do not meet contract specifications, constitutes a violation of the 
contract.


<R05>
Sec. 634.28  Appeals not related to contract violations.

    (a) The participant may, prior to execution of the contract, request 
that the administering agency review or reconsider criteria being used 
in developing his or her contract. Such review or reconsideration may 
include the eligibility of BMP's which had not been approved for 
application in the project area, cost-sharing levels for BMP's, 
priorities for developing water quality plans, and standards and 
specifications.
    (1) If verbal agreement is not reached, the participant may make a 
written request within 30 days after receiving notice of the decision of 
his or her verbal request.
    (2) The administering agency shall have 30 days in which to make a 
decision and notify the participant in writing.
    (3) The decision of the administering agency shall be final.
    (b) If, after the contract has been executed, the participant and 
the administering agency are unable to reach written agreement relative 
on matters which are not related to contract violations, the participant 
may request and receive a review by the appeals board. The administering 
agency will:
    (1) Notify the participant, in writing, of the date the appeals 
board will consider the appeal.
    (2) Within 30 days after receiving the administering agency's 
notice, the participant may file a request to appear and present oral 
and other evidence. If the participant does not request an appearance, 
the administering agency appeals board will decide the dispute on

[[Page 424]]

the evidence available to them, including statements or briefs of the 
authorized representatives of the soil conservation district and NRCS. 
The administering agency shall notify the participants of the appeals 
board's decision in writing. There shall be no further administrative 
appeal of this decision.
    (c) Filing of documents. A document is considered filed when it is 
received in the office of the person or agency concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 634.29  Violations.

    (a) Actions causing violations. The following actions constitute 
violation of a contract by a participant:
    (1) Knowingly or negligently damaging or causing BMP's to become 
impaired.
    (2) Adopting a land use or practice during the contract period which 
tends to defeat the purposes of the program.
    (3) Failing to comply with the terms of the contract.
    (4) Filing a false claim.
    (5) Misusing authorizations for payment.
    (b) Contract termination as a result of violations. (1) By signing a 
contract, the participant agrees to forfeit all rights to further cost-
sharing payments under a contract and to refund all cost-share payments 
received, with interest, if the administering agency, with the 
concurrence of the State Conservationist, NRCS, determines that:
    (i) There was a violation of the contract during the time the 
participant had control of the land; and
    (ii) The violation was of such a nature as to warrant termination of 
the contract.
    (2) The participant shall be obligated to refund all cost-share 
payments and all cost shares paid under authorizations, with interest, 
at the rates established by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 
Pub. L. 92-41, 85 Stat. 97.
    (c) Payment adjustments and refunds resulting from violations. (1) 
By signing a contract, the participant agrees to refund cost-share 
payments received under the contract or to accept payment adjustments if 
the administering agency determines and the State Conservationist, NRCS, 
concurs that:
    (i) There was a violation of the contract during the time the 
participant had control of the land; and
    (ii) The nature of the violation does not warrant termination of the 
contract.
    (2) Payment adjustments may include decreasing the rate of cost 
share, or deleting from the contract a cost-share commitment, or 
withholding cost-share payments earned but not paid. The participant who 
signs the contract may be obligated to refund cost-share payments.


<R05>
Sec. 634.30  Appeals in USDA administered projects.

    The participant in a USDA-administered RCWP project may appeal 
decisions of the administering agency in accordance with part 614 of 
this title.

[60 FR 67316, Dec. 29, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 634.31  Appeals of contract violations.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the regulations dealing with 
contract violations. The Administrator, NRCS, reserves the right to 
revise or supplement any of the provisions of this section at any time 
if the action does not adversely affect the participant, or if the 
participant has been officially notified before this action is taken.
    (b) Determination by administering agency. Upon notification that a 
contract violation may have occurred, the administering agency:
    (1) Determines that a violation did not occur or that the violation 
was of such a nature that no further action is to be taken; or
    (2) Determines that a violation did occur and the participant agrees 
to accept a written penalty of forfeiture, refund, payment adjustment, 
or termination. If no agreement is reached, further action is to be 
taken.
    (c) Notice of possible violation. (1) When the administering agency 
is notified that a contract violation may have occurred and the matter 
is not resolved under Sec. 634.31(b)(1) it shall notify, in writing, 
each participant who signed the contract of the alleged violation. This 
notice setting forth the alleged violation may be personally delivered 
or sent by certified or registered mail.

[[Page 425]]

A participant is considered to have received the notice at the time of 
personal receipt acknowledged in writing, at the time of delivery of a 
certified or registered letter, or at the time of the return of a 
refused certified or registered letter.
    (2) The notice shall give the participant an opportunity to appear 
at a hearing before an appeals board. The participant's request for a 
hearing shall be submitted in writing, and must be received by the 
appeals board within 30 days after receipt of the notice. The 
participant shall be notified in writing by the appeals board of the 
time, date, and place for the hearing. The participant shall have no 
right to a hearing if he does not file a written request for a hearing, 
or if he or his representative does not appear at the appointed time, 
unless the appeals board, at its discretion, permits an appearance. A 
request for a hearing filed by a participant shall be considered to be a 
request by all participants who signed the contract.
    (d) Hearing. The appeals board shall conduct an open hearing to 
obtain the facts about the alleged violation. The appeals board shall 
limit the hearing to relevant facts and evidence, and shall not be bound 
by the strict rules of evidence. Witnesses may be sworn in at the 
discretion of the appeals board.
    (1) The participant or his or her representative shall be given full 
opportunity to present oral or documentary evidence about the alleged 
violation. Likewise, the administering agency may submit statements and 
evidence. Individuals not otherwise represented at the hearing may, at 
the discretion of the appeals board, be permitted to give information or 
evidence. The appeals board, at its discretion, may permit witnesses to 
be cross-examined.
    (2) The appeals board shall make a record of the hearing. A summary 
of the testimony may be made if both the participant and the appeals 
board agree. A transcript of the hearing shall be made if requested by 
either the appeals board or the participant within 10 days prior to the 
hearing. If a transcript is requested by the participant, the 
participant may be assessed the cost of a copy of the transcript.
    (3) The appeals board shall, after a reasonable period of time, 
close the hearing if the participant or his or her representative is not 
present at the scheduled time. The appeals board may, at its discretion, 
accept information and evidence submitted by others present for the 
hearing.
    (4) The appeals board shall furnish the administering agency and the 
State Conservationist, NRCS, with a written report setting forth their 
findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The report shall include the 
summary of testimony or transcript made of the hearing and any other 
information which would aid the administering agency in reaching a 
decision.
    (e) Decision by the administering agency. The administering agency 
shall make a decision within 30 days on the basis of the appeals board 
report, recommendations of soil conservation district board, if any, and 
any other information available, including if applicable, the amount of 
the forfeiture, refund, or payment adjustment. The decision shall state 
whether the violation is of such a nature as to warrant termination of 
the contract. The administering agency shall notify, in writing, each 
participant who signed the contract of its decision. The administering 
agency may authorize or require the reopening of any hearing before the 
appeals board for any reason at any time before their decision. The 
administering agency's decision shall be final.
    (1) If the decision provides for termination of the contract, it 
shall state that the contract is terminated and that all rights to 
further cost-share payments under the contract are forfeited and that 
all cost-share payments received under the contract shall be refunded 
with interest. The decision is to state the amount of refund and method 
of payment.
    (2) If the decision does not provide for termination of the 
contract, the participant may be required to make a refund of cost-share 
payments or to accept payment adjustments. The decision shall state the 
amount and justification for refunds of cost-share payments or payment 
adjustments.

                  Subpart E--Monitoring and Evaluation


<R05>
Sec. 634.50  Program and project monitoring and evaluation.

    (a) Comprehensive USDA/EPA joint water quality monitoring, 
evaluation, and analysis. (1) Representative RCWP project areas will be 
selected to evaluate the improvement in water quality in the project 
area and to make projections on a nationwide basis. Water-quality 
monitoring, evaluation, and analysis will be conducted to evaluate the 
overall cost and effectiveness of projects and BMPs to provide 
information on the impact of the program on improved water quality and 
for general RCWP program management.
    (2) Monitoring, evaluation, and analysis is a joint USDA/EPA 
responsibility. Subject to appropriation of funds, the Administrator, 
NRCS, and EPA are jointly to select the project areas to be monitored 
and evaluated based on a list of project areas recommended by the 
NRCWCC.
    (3) The Administrator, NRCS, and Administrator, EPA, are jointly to 
determine the criteria to be used for comprehensive water-quality 
monitoring, evaluation, and analysis in the selected project areas. A 
monitoring and evaluation plan is to be developed and agreed to by NRCS 
and EPA prior to initiating a project selected for monitoring and 
evaluation. The State water-quality agency and other Federal, State, and 
local agencies will be involved in the development of the plan for 
water-quality evaluation. The involvement of concerned agencies in

[[Page 427]]

implementing the plan will be determined at the time the plan is 
prepared.
    (4) The project areas selected for detailed analysis are to be 
representative of agricultural and silvicultural nonpoint source 
pollution problems, categories of agriculture and silvicutural nonpoint 
source pollutants, agricultural enterprises, and BMPs used in the RCWP.
    (5) Preference in the selection of project areas for comprehensive 
evaluation is to be given to those project areas for which long-term 
baseline information exists on land use, hydrologic data, and water 
quality.
    (6) Monitoring and evaluation of selected project areas is to begin 
sufficiently in advance of the installation of BMPs to document, in a 
statistically satisfactory manner, existing land-use practices and 
baseline water-quality problems.
    (7) The water quality monitoring and evaluation plan will provide 
sufficient basic information to adequately describe the land use, 
hydrologic water quality relationship. As a minimum, the plan will 
contain the following components:
    (i) Chemical and physical water quality monitoring,
    (ii) Biological monitoring,
    (iii) Appropriate hydrologic data,
    (iv) Soils properties and characteristics, topographic information,
    (v) Land use and farm inventory.
    (b) Program and project evaluation.
    (1) There will be a continuing evaluation of the Rural Clean Water 
Program to measure its effectiveness and for each project for which 
cost-sharing funds are provided.
    (2) Program and project evaluations will be conducted under the 
direction of the Assistant Secretary for Conservation, Research and 
Education, USDA, the Director of Economics, Policy Analysis, and Budget, 
USDA; and the Assistant Administrator for Water and Waste Management, 
EPA; or their representatives working through NRCWCC.
    (3) Evaluative reports for the program and each project area will be 
submitted annually to the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
Administrator, EPA.
    (c) Funding. (1) Research oriented activities will be from sources 
other than RCWP.
    (2) Funding for program and project monitoring and evaluation will 
be provided through RCWP and other authorizations.

cost-share assistance to achieve the intended goals of the program, as 
determined by the State Conservationist.
    (b) Cost-share payments may be made only upon a determination by the 
NRCS that an eligible practice or an identifiable unit of the practice 
has been established in compliance with appropriate standards and 
specifications. Identified practices may be implemented by the 
participant or other designee.
    (c) Cost-share payments may be made for the establishment and 
installation of additional eligible practices, or the maintenance or 
replacement of an eligible practice, but only if NRCS determines the

    (c) Any modifications made under this section must meet WHIP program 
objectives, and must be in compliance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 636.10  Transfer of interest in a cost-share agreement.

    (a) (1) If the ownership or operation of the land changes during the 
term of the cost-share agreement, NRCS shall modify the cost-share 
agreement to reflect the new interested persons and new divisions of 
payments. NRCS shall

[[Page 431]]

make eligible cost-share payments upon presentation of an assignment of 
rights or other evidence that title had passed.
    (2) With respect to any and all payments owed to participants who 
wish to transfer ownership or control of land subject to a cost-share 
agreement, the division of payment shall be determined by the original 
party and that party's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on 
the distribution of cost-share payments, NRCS may withhold payments 
without the accrual of interest pending a settlement or adjudication on 
the rights to the funds.
    (b) (1) If such new owners or operators are not willing to assume 
the responsibilities posed in an existing WHIP cost-share agreement, 
NRCS shall terminate the cost-share agreement and may require that all 
cost-share payments may be forfeited, refunded, or both.
    (2) The signatories to the cost-share agreement shall be jointly and 
severally responsible for refunding the cost-share payments pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 636.11  Termination of cost-share agreements.

    (a) The State Conservationist may, by mutual agreement with the 
parties to the cost-share agreement, consent to the termination of the 
contract where:
    (1) The parties to the cost-share agreement are unable to comply 
with the terms of the cost-share agreement as the result of conditions 
beyond their control;
    (2) Compliance with the terms of the cost-share agreement would work 
a severe hardship on the parties to the contract; or,
    (3) Termination of the cost-share agreement would, as determined by 
the State Conservationist, be in the public interest.
    (b) If a cost-share agreement is terminated in accordance with the 
provisions of this section, the State Conservationist may allow the 
participants to retain any cost-share payments received under the cost-
share agreement in a porportion appropriate to the effort the 
participant has made to comply with the cost-share agreement, or, in 
cases of hardship, where forces beyond the participant's control 
prevented compliance with the cost-share agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 636.12  Violations and remedies.

    (a) (1) If NRCS determines that a participant is in violation of a 
cost-share agreement or documents incorporated by reference into the 
cost-share agreement, NRCS may give the parties to the cost-share 
agreement reasonable notice and an opportunity to voluntarily correct 
the violation within 30 days of the date of the notice, or such 
additional time as NRCS may allow.
    (2) If the participant fails to cure the violation of a cost-share 
agreement within the period provided under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, NRCS may terminate the agreement and require the participant to 
refund all or part of any assistance earned under that cost-share 
agreement, plus interest, as well as require the participant to forfeit 
all rights for future payment under the agreement.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 636.13  Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

    (a) A person who is determined by NRCS to have erroneously 
represented any fact affecting a program determination made in 
accordance with this part shall not be entitled to cost-share agreement 
payments and must refund all payments, plus interest as determined by 
NRCS.
    (b) A person who is determined to have knowingly:
    (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of 
the program;
    (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or,
    (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination shall 
refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest as determined by NRCS, with 
respect to all NRCS cost-share agreements. The person's interest in all 
NRCS cost-share agreements may be terminated.


<R05>
Sec. 636.14  Offsets and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any payment 
or portion thereof to any person shall be made without regard to 
questions of

[[Page 432]]

title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against 
the land, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any other 
creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations 
governing offsets and withholdings found in part 3 of this title shall 
be applicable to cost-share agreement payments.

            Subpart A--Procedures for NRCS-Assisted Programs

    Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; Executive Order 11514 (Rev.); 16 
U.S.C. 1001-1008; 7 U.S.C. 1010-1011; 16 U.S.C. 590 a-f, q.; 7 CFR 2.62, 
unless otherwise noted.

    Source: 44 FR 50579, Aug. 29, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 650.1  Purpose.

    (a) This rule prescribes procedures by which NRCS is to implement 
the provisions of NEPA. The Natural Resources Conservation Service 
recognizes NEPA as the national charter for protection, restoration, and 
enhancement of the human environment. NEPA establishes policy, sets 
goals (Section 101), and provides means (Section 102) for carrying out 
this policy.
    (b) The procedures included in this rule supplement CEQ's NEPA 
regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508. CEQ regulations that need no 
additional elaboration to address NRCS-assisted actions are not repeated 
in this rule, although the regulations are cited as references. The 
procedures include some overlap with CEQ regulations. This is done to 
highlight items of importance for NRCS. This does not supersede the 
existing body of NEPA regulations.
    (c) These procedures provide that--
    (1) Environmental information is to be available to citizens before 
decisions are made about actions that significantly affect the human 
environment;
    (2) NRCS-assisted actions are to be supported to the extent possible 
by accurate scientific analyses that are technically acceptable to NRCS;
    (3) NRCS-prepared NEPA documents are to be available for public 
scrutiny; and
    (4) Documents are to concentrate on the issues that are timely and 
significant to the action in question rather than amassing needless 
detail.
    (d) Procedures for implementing NEPA are designed to ensure that 
environmental consequences are considered in decisionmaking. They allow 
NRCS to assist individuals and nonfederal public entities to take 
actions that protect, enhance, and restore environmental quality.
    (e) These procedures make possible the early identification of 
actions that have significant effects on the human environment to avoid 
delays in decisionmaking.


<R05>
Sec. 650.2  Applicability.

    This rule applies to all NRCS-assisted programs including the 
uninstalled parts of approved projects that are not covered by 
environmental documents prepared under previous rules for compliance 
with NEPA. It is effective on the date of publication of the final rule. 
NRCS is to consult with CEQ in the manner prescribed by 40 CFR 1506.11 
if it is necessary to take emergency actions.

[[Page 434]]


<R05>
Sec. 650.3  Policy.

    (a) NRCS mission. The NRCS mission is to provide assistance that 
will allow use and management of ecological, cultural, natural, 
physical, social, and economic resources by striving for a balance 
between use, management, conservation, and preservation of the Nation's 
natural resource base. The NRCS mission is reemphasized and expanded to 
carry out the mandate of section 101(b) of NEPA, within other 
legislative constraints, in all its programs of Federal assistance. NRCS 
will continue to improve and coordinate its plans, functions, programs, 
and recommendations on resource use so that Americans, as stewards of 
the environment for succeeding generations--
    (1) Can maintain safe, healthful, productive, and esthetically and 
culturally pleasing surroundings that support diversity of individual 
choices; and
    (2) Are encouraged to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of 
soil, water, and related resources without degradation to the 
environment, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and 
unintended consequences.
    (b) NRCS environmental policy. NRCS is to administer Federal 
assistance within the following overall environmental policies:
    (1) Provide assistance to Americans that will motivate them to 
maintain equilibrium among their ecological, cultural, natural, 
physical, social, and economic resources by striving for a balance 
between conserving and preserving the Nation's natural resource base.
    (2) Provide technical and financial assistance through a systematic 
interdisciplinary approach to planning and decisionmaking to insure a 
balance between the natural, physical, and social sciences.
    (3) Consider environmental quality equal to economic, social, and 
other factors in decisionmaking.
    (4) Insure that plans satisfy identified needs and at the same time 
minimize adverse effects of planned actions on the human environment 
through interdisciplinary planning before providing technical and 
financial assistance.
    (5) Counsel with highly qualified and experienced specialists from 
within and outside NRCS in many technical fields as needed.
    (6) Encourage broad public participation in defining environmental 
quality objectives and needs.
    (7) Identify and make provisions for detailed survey, recovery, 
protection, or preservation of unique cultural resources that otherwise 
may be irrevocably lost or destroyed by NRCS-assisted project actions, 
as required by Historic Preservation legislation and/or Executive Order.
    (8) Encourage local sponsors to review with interested publics the 
operation and maintenance programs of completed projects to insure that 
environmental quality is not degraded.
    (9) Advocate the retention of important farmlands and forestlands, 
prime rangeland, wetlands, or other lands designated by State or local 
governments. Whenever proposed conversions are caused or encouraged by 
actions or programs of a Federal agency, licensed by or require approval 
by a Federal agency, or are inconsistent with local or State government 
plans, provisions are to be sought to insure that such lands are not 
irreversibly converted to other uses unless other national interests 
override the importance of preservation or otherwise outweigh the 
environmental benefits derived from their protection. In addition, the 
preservation of farmland in general provides the benefits of open space, 
protection of scenery, wildlife habitat, and in some cases, recreation 
opportunities and controls on urban sprawl.
    (10) Advocate actions that reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize 
effects of floods on human safety, health, and welfare; and restore and 
preserve the natural and beneficial functions and values of flood 
plains.
    (11) Advocate and assist in the reclamation of abandoned surface-
mined lands and in planning for the extraction of coal and other 
nonrenewable resources to facilitate restoration of the land to its 
prior productivity as mining is completed.
    (12) Advocate the protection of valuable wetlands, threatened and 
endangered animal and plant species and

[[Page 435]]

their habitats, and designated ecosystems.
    (13) Advocate the conservation of natural and manmade scenic 
resources to insure that NRCS-assisted programs or activities protect 
and enhance the visual quality of the landscape.
    (14) Advocate and assist in actions to preserve and enhance the 
quality of the Nation's waters.

Sec. 650.4  Definition of terms.

    Definitions of the following terms or phrases appear in 40 CFR part 
1508, CEQ regulations. These terms are important in the understanding 
and implementation of this rule. These definitions are not repeated in 
the interest of reducing duplication:

Categorical exclusion. (40 CFR 1508.4)
Cooperating agency. (40 CFR 1508.5)
Cumulative impact. (40 CFR 1508.7)
Environmental impact statement (EIS). (40 CFR 1508.11)
Human environment. (40 CFR 1508.14)
Lead agency. (40 CFR 1508.16)
Major Federal action. (40 CFR 1508.18)
Mitigation. (40 CFR 1508.20)
NEPA process. (40 CFR 1508.21)
Scope. (40 CFR 1508.25)
Scoping. (40 CFR 1501.7)
Tiering. (40 CFR 1508.28)

    (a) Channel realignment. Channel realignment includes the 
construction of a new channel or a new alignment and may include the 
clearing, snagging, widening, and/or deepening of the existing channel. 
(Channel Modification Guidelines, 43 FR 8276).
    (b) Environmental assessment (EA). (40 CFR 1508.9)
    (1) An environmental assessment is a concise public document for 
which a Federal agency is responsible that--
    (i) Briefly provides sufficient evidence and analysis for 
determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a 
finding of no significant impact.
    (ii) Aids an agency's compliance with the Act when no environmental 
impact statement is necessary.
    (iii) Facilitates preparation of an environmental impact statement 
when one is necessary.
    (2) An environmental assessment includes brief discussions of the 
need for the proposal, alternatives as required by section of the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a 
list of agencies and persons consulted.
    (c) Environmental evaluation. The environmental evaluation (EE) 
(formerly referred to by NRCS as an environmental assessment) is the 
part of planning that inventories and estimates the potential effects on 
the human environment of alternative solutions to resource problems. A 
wide range of environmental data together with social and economic 
information is considered in determining whether a proposed action is a 
major Federal action significantly affecting the human environment. The 
environmental evaluation for a program, regulation, or individual action 
is used to determine the need for an environmental assessment or an 
environmental impact statement. It also aids in the consideration of 
alternatives and in the identification of available resources.
    (d) Federally-assisted actions. These actions are planned and 
carried out by individuals, groups, or local units of government largely 
on nonfederal land with technical and/or financial assistance provided 
by NRCS.
    (e) Interdisciplinary planning. NRCS uses an interdisciplinary 
environmental evaluation and planning approach in which specialists and 
groups having different technical expertise act as a team to jointly 
evaluate existing and future environmental quality. The 
interdisciplinary group considers structure and function of natural 
resource systems, complexity of problems, and the economic, social, and 
environmental effects of alternative actions. Public participation is an 
essential part of effective interdisciplinary planning. Even if an NRCS 
employee provides direct assistance to an individual land user, the 
basic data used is a result of interdisciplinary development of guide 
and planning criteria.

[[Page 436]]

    (f) Nonproject actions. Nonproject actions consist of technical and/
or financial assistance provided to an individual, group, or local unit 
of government by NRCS primarily through a cooperative agreement with a 
local conservation district, such as land treatment recommended in the 
Conservation Operations, Great Plains Conservation, Rural Abandoned 
Mine, and Rural Clean Water Programs. These actions may include 
consultations, advice, engineering, and other technical assistance that 
land users usually cannot accomplish by themselves. Nonproject technical 
and/or financial assistance may result in the land user installing field 
terraces, waterways, field leveling, onfarm drainage systems, farm 
ponds, pasture management, conservation tillage, critical area 
stablization and other conservation practices.
    (g) Notice of intent (NOI) (40 CFR 1508.22). A notice of intent is a 
brief statement inviting public reaction to the decision by the 
responsible Federal official to prepare an EIS for a major Federal 
action. The notice of intent is to be published in the Federal Register, 
circulated to interested agencies, groups, individuals, and published in 
one or more newspapers serving the area of the proposed action.
    (h) Project actions. A project action is a formally planned 
undertaking that is carried out within a specified area by sponsors for 
the benefit of the general public. Project sponsors are units of 
government having the legal authority and resources to install, operate, 
and/or maintain works of improvement.
    (i) Record of Decision. (ROD) (40 CFR 1505.2). A record of decision 
is a concise written rationale by the RFO regarding implementation of a 
proposed action requiring an environmental impact statement. This was 
previously defined by NRCS as a Statement of Findings (SOF).
    (j) Responsible Federal official (RFO). The NRCS Administrator is 
the responsible Federal official (RFO) for compliance with NEPA 
regarding proposed legislation, programs, legislative reports, 
regulations, and program EIS's. NRCS state conservationists (STC's) are 
the RFO's for compliance with the provisions of NEPA in other NRCS-
assisted actions.
    (k) Significantly. (40 CFR 1508.27) ``Significantly'' as used in 
NEPA requires considerations of both context and intensity:
    (1) Context. This means that the significance of an action must be 
analyzed in several contexts such as society as a whole (human, 
national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the 
locality. Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. 
For instance, for a site-specific action, significance usually depends 
on the effects in the locale rather than in the world as a whole. Both 
short- and long-term effects are relevant.
    (2) Intensity. This refers to the severity of impact. Responsible 
officials must bear in mind that more than one agency may make decisions 
about partial aspects of a major action.

The following should be considered in evaluating intensity:
    (i) Impacts that may be both beneficial and adverse. A significant 
effect may exist even if the Federal agency believes that on balance the 
effect will be beneficial.
    (ii) The degree to which the proposed action affects public health 
or safety.
    (iii) Unique characteristics of the geographic area such as 
proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime 
farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical 
areas.
    (iv) The degree to which the effects on the quality of the human 
environment are likely to be highly controversial.
    (v) The degree to which the possible effects on the human 
environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.
    (vi) The degree to which the action may establish a precedent for 
future actions with significant effects or represents a decision in 
principle about a future consideration.
    (vii) Whether the action is related to other actions with 
individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts. 
Significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively 
significant impact on the environment. Significance cannot be avoided by 
terming an action temporary or by

[[Page 437]]

breaking it down into small component parts.
    (viii) The degree to which the action may adversely affect 
districts, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible 
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or may cause 
loss or destruction of significant scientific, cultural, or historical 
resources.
    (ix) The degree to which the action may adversely affect an 
endangered or threatened species or its habitat that has been determined 
to be critical under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended.
    (x) Whether the action threatens a violation of Federal, State, or 
local law or requirements imposed for the protection of the environment.
    (l) Finding of no significant impact (FNSI). (40 CFR 1508.13) 
``Finding of No Significant Impact'' means a document by a Federal 
agency briefly presenting the reasons why an action not otherwise 
excluded (Sec. 1508.4) will not have a significant effect on the human 
environment, and an environmental impact statement therefore will not be 
prepared. It shall include the environmental assessment or a summary of 
it and shall note any other environmental documents related to it 
(Sec. 1501.7(a)(5)). If the assessment is included, the finding need not 
repeat any of the discussion in the assessment but may incorporate it by 
reference.

<R05>
Sec. 650.5  Environmental evaluation in planning.

    (a) General. Environmental evaluation (EE) integrates environmental 
concerns throughout the planning, installation, and operation of NRCS-
assisted projects. The EE applies to all assistance provided by NRCS, 
but planning intensity, public involvement, and documentation of actions 
vary according to the scope of the action. NRCS begins consideration of 
environmental concerns when information gathered during the 
environmental evaluation is used:
    (1) To identify environmental concerns that may be affected, gather 
baseline data, and predict effects of alternative courses of actions;
    (2) To provide data to applicants for use in establishing objectives 
commensurate with the scope and complexity of the proposed action;
    (3) To assist in the development of alternative courses of action; 
(40 CFR 1502.14). In NRCS-assisted project actions, nonstructural, water 
conservation, and other alternatives that are in keeping with the Water 
Resources Council's Principles and Standards are considered, if 
appropriate.
    (4) To perform other related investigations and analyses as needed, 
including economic evaluation, engineering investigations, etc.
    (5) To assist in the development of detailed plans for 
implementation and operation and maintenance.
    (b) Procedures. NRCS's Guide for Environmental Assessment issued in 
March 1977 and published in the Federal Register on August 8, 1977, 
provides guidance for conducting an environmental evaluation. (42 FR 
40123-40167).
    (c) Decision points. Figure 1 illustrates the decision points for 
compliance with NEPA in NRCS decisionmaking.

[[Page 438]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03SE91.000


<R05>
Sec. 650.6  Categorical exclusions.

    (a) Some NRCS programs or parts of programs do not normally create 
significant individual or cumulative impacts on the human environment. 
Therefore, an EA or EIS is not needed. These are data gathering and 
interpretation programs and include:
    (1) Soil Survey--7 CFR part 611;
    (2) Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasts--7 CFR part 612;
    (3) Plant Materials for Conservation--7 CFR part 613;
    (4) Inventory and Monitoring--Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance--10.908; and
    (5) River Basin Studies under section 6 of Pub. L. 83-566 as 
amended--7 CFR part 621.
    (b) The environmental evaluation performed by the RFO when any new 
action under these programs is planned

[[Page 439]]

is to identify extraordinary circumstances that might lead to 
significant individual or cumulative impacts. Actions that have 
potential for significant impacts on the human environment are not 
categorically excluded.


<R05>
Sec. 650.7  When to prepare an EIS.

    The following are categories of NRCS action used to determine 
whether or not an EIS is to be prepared.
    (a) An EIS is required for:
    (1) Projects that include stream channel realignment or work to 
modify channel capacity by deepening or widening where significant 
aquatic or wildlife habitat exists. The EE will determine if the channel 
supports significant aquatic or wildlife habitat;
    (2) Projects requiring Congressional action;
    (3) Broad Federal assistance programs administered by NRCS when the 
environmental evaluation indicates there may be significant cumulative 
impacts on the human environment (Sec. 650.7(e)); and
    (4) Other major Federal actions that are determined after 
environmental evaluation to affect significantly the quality of the 
human environment (Sec. 650.7(b)). If it is difficult to determine 
whether there is a significant impact on the human environment, it may 
be necessary to complete the EE and prepare an EA in order to decide if 
an EIS is required.
    (b) The RFO is to determine the need for an EIS for each action, 
program, or regulation. An environmental evaluation, using a systematic 
interdisciplinary analysis and evaluation of data and information 
responding to the five provisions of Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, will 
assist the RFO in deciding if the action requires the preparation of an 
EIS. In analyzing and evaluating environmental concerns, the RFO will 
answer the following questions:
    (1) Environmental impact. Will the proposed action significantly 
affect the quality of the human environment (40 CFR 1508.14)? For 
example, will it significantly alter or destroy valuable wetlands, 
important farmlands, cultural resources, or threatened and endangered 
species? Will it affect social values, water quality, fish and wildlife 
habitats, or wilderness and scenic areas?
    (2) Adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided. What are 
the important environmental amenities that would be lost if the proposed 
action were implemented?
    (3) Alternatives. Are there alternatives that would achieve the 
planning objectives but avoid adverse environmental effects?
    (4) Short-term uses versus long-term productivity. Will the proposed 
actions, in combination with other actions, sacrifice the enhancement of 
significant long-term productivity as a tradeoff for short-term uses?
    (5) Commitment of resources. Will the proposed action irreversibly 
and irretrievably commit the use of resources such as important 
farmlands, wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat?
    (c) Criteria for determining the need for a program EIS:
    (1) A program EIS is required if the environmental evaluation 
reveals that actions carried out under the program have individually 
insignificant but cumulatively significant environmental impacts.
    (2) A project EIS, in lieu of a program EIS, is required if the 
environmental evaluation reveals that actions carried out under the 
program will have both individually and cumulatively significant 
environmental impacts. (7 CFR Parts 620 through 623 and 640 through 
643).
    (d) The RFO, through the process of tiering, is to determine if a 
site-specific EA or EIS is required for an individually significant 
action that is included in a program EIS.


<R05>
Sec. 650.8  When to prepare an environmental assessment (EA).

    An environmental assessment (EA) is to be prepared for:
    (a) Land and water resource projects that are not included in 
Sec. 650.7(a) (1) through (4) for which State and local units of 
government receive Federal technical and financial assistance from NRCS 
(7 CFR parts 620 through 623; and 640 through 643); and
    (b) Other actions not included in a program EIS nor categorically 
excluded that the EE reveals may be a

[[Page 440]]

major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment.


<R05>
Sec. 650.9  NEPA and interagency planning.

    (a) Lead agency. (1) NRCS is to be the lead agency for actions under 
programs it administers. If the actions affect more than one State, the 
NRCS Administrator is to designate one NRCS state conservationist as the 
RFO.
    (2) NRCS normally takes the role of lead agency in actions that 
share program responsibilities among USDA agencies if NRCS provides the 
majority of funds for the actions. If the lead agency role is in 
question, the role of NRCS and other USDA agencies is to be determined 
by the USDA Environmental Coordinator, Office of Environmental Quality 
Activities.
    (3) If NRCS and Federal agencies outside USDA cannot agree on which 
will be the lead agency and which will be the cooperating agencies, the 
procedures in 40 CFR 1501.5(e) are to be followed.
    (4) NRCS, as lead agency, is to coordinate the participation of all 
concerned agencies in developing the EIS according to the provisions of 
40 CFR 1501.6(a).
    (b) Cooperating agencies. (1) NRCS is to request, as appropriate, 
the assistance of cooperating agencies in preparing the environmental 
evaluation. This assistance will broaden the expertise in the planning 
and help to avoid future conflict. NRCS is to request assistance in 
determining the scope of issues to be addressed and identifying the 
significant issues related to a proposed action from Federal agencies 
that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise.
    (2) NRCS is to act as a cooperating agency if requested. NRCS may 
request to be designated as a cooperating agency if proposed actions may 
affect areas of NRCS expertise, such as prime farmlands, soils, erosion 
control, and agricultural sources of nonpoint pollution. NRCS, as a 
cooperating agency, is to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 
1501.6(b) to the extent possible depending on funds, personnel, and 
priority. If insufficient funds or other resources prevent NRCS from 
participating fully as a cooperating agency, NRCS is to request the lead 
agency to provide funds or other resources which will allow full 
participation.
    (c) Scoping. See 40 CFR 1501.7 for a definition of scoping.
    (1) NRCS is to use scoping to identify and categorize significant 
environmental issues in its environmental evaluation. Formalized scoping 
is used to insure that an analytical EIS can be prepared that will 
reduce paperwork and avoid delay. Scoping allows NRCS to obtain the 
assistance and consultation of affected agencies that have special 
expertise or legal jurisdiction in the proposed action. If early 
environmental evaluation identifies a need for an EIS, NRCS is to 
publish a notice of intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS. The NOI is to 
request the assistance of all interested agencies, groups, and persons 
in determining the scope of the evaluation of the proposed action.
    (2) Normally a scoping meeting is held and Federal, State, or local 
agencies that have special expertise or legal jurisdiction in resource 
values that may be significantly affected are requested to participate. 
The scoping meeting will identify agencies that may become cooperating 
agencies.
    (3) In the scoping meeting, the range of actions, alternatives, and 
impacts to be evaluated and included in the EIS as defined in (40 CFR 
1508.25) are to be determined. Tiering (40 CFR 1508.28) may be used to 
define the relation of the proposed statement to other statements.
    (4) Periodic meetings of the cooperating agencies are to be held at 
important decisionmaking points to provide timely interagency, 
interdisciplinary participation.
    (5) Scoping is to include the items listed in 40 CFR 1501.7(a) and 
may also include any of the activities in 40 CFR 1501.7(b). Appropriate, 
timely requests and notification are to be made to promote public 
participation in scoping in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (6) The RFO through the scoping process will set time and page 
limits as prescribed in 40 CFR 1501.8. Time and page limits are 
established by NRCS in consultation with sponsors and others according 
to the projected availability

[[Page 441]]

of resources. The RFO is to make the applicant aware of the possible 
need for revising time and page limits because of changes in resources.
    (d) Public participation. (1) General. Public participation 
activities begin early in the EE and are to be appropriate to the 
proposed action. For example, extensive public participation activities 
are required in the implementation of new programs and project actions, 
but limited public participation is appropriate for nonproject technical 
and financial assistance programs on nonfederal land.
    (2) Early public involvement. The public is to be invited and 
encouraged to participate in the early stages of planning, including the 
consideration of the potential effects of NRCS-assisted actions on 
significant environmental resources such as wetlands, flood plains, 
cultural values, endangered species, important farmland.
    (3) Project activities. The following are general considerations for 
providing opportunities for public participation:
    (i) Identification of interested public. The interested public 
consisting of but not limited to individuals, groups, organizations, and 
government agencies are to be identified, sought out, and encouraged to 
participate in and contribute to interdisciplinary planning and 
environmental evaluation.
    (ii) Public notices. (40 CFR 1506.6) If the effects of an action are 
primarily of local concern, notice of each public meeting or hearing 
should be: Submitted to State and areawide clearinghouses pursuant to 
OMB Circular A-95 (revised); submitted to Indian tribes if they are 
interested; published in local newspapers; distributed through other 
local media; provided to potentially interested community organizations 
including small business associations; published in newsletters that may 
be expected to reach potentially interested persons; mailed directly to 
owners and occupants of nearby or affected property; and posted onsite 
and offsite in the area where the action is to be located.
    (iii) State statutes. If official action by the local units of 
government cooperating in the proposal is governed by State statute, the 
public notice and mailing requirement of the statute is to be followed. 
If the effects of an action are of national concern, notice is to be 
published in the Federal Register and mailed to national organizations 
reasonably expected to be interested.
    (iv) Public meetings. The RFO, after consultation with the sponsors, 
is to determine when public meetings or hearings are to be held. Public 
meetings may be in the form of a workshop, tour, open house, etc. Public 
involvement will include early discussion of flood-plain management and 
protection of wetlands, where appropriate. Environmental information is 
to be presented and discussed along with other appropriate information. 
To the extent practical, pertinent information should be made available 
before the meetings.
    (v) Documentation. The RFO is to maintain a reviewable record of 
public participation in the environmental evaluation process.
    (4) Nonproject activities. Public participation in the planning and 
application of conservation practices with individual land users is 
accomplished primarily through conservation districts. These districts 
are governed by boards of supervisors directors, commissioners, etc., 
who are elected and/or appointed to insure that soil, water, related 
resources, and environmental qualities in the district are maintained 
and improved. The public is to be encouraged to participate in the 
development of long-range district programs and district annual plans. 
The district keeps the public informed through public meetings, district 
newsletters, news stories, radio and television programs, and annual 
reports.


<R05>
Sec. 650.10  Adoption of an EIS prepared by a cooperating agency.

    (a) If NRCS adopts an EIS prepared by another Federal or State 
agency, the RFO is to review the document to insure that it meets the 
requirements of the CEQ regulations and NRCS-NEPA procedures.
    (b) If the actions included in the EIS are substantially the same as 
those proposed by NRCS, the RFO is to recirculate the EIS as ``final.'' 
The final EIS is to include an appropriate explanation of the action. If 
these actions are not substantially the same, the EIS

[[Page 442]]

is to be supplemented and recirculated as a draft EIS. The RFO is to 
inform the preparing agency of the proposed action.
    (c) If the adopted EIS is not final, if it is the subject of a 
referral under 40 CFR part 1504, or if the statement's adequacy is in 
litigation, the RFO is to include an appropriate explanation in the EIS.
    (d) The RFO is to take appropriate action to inform the public and 
appropriate agencies of the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 650.11  Environmental documents.

    (a) NRCS is to use the following documents in compliance with NEPA 
(see Sec. 650.4):
    (1) Environmental assessments (EA)
    (2) Environmental impact statements (EIS)
    (3) Notice of intent (NOI)
    (4) Finding of no significant impact (FNSI)
    (5) Record of decision (ROD)
    (b) The format and content of each document is to be appropriate to 
the action being considered and consistent with the CEQ regulations.
    (1) To reduce duplication, NRCS may combine environmental documents 
with other planning documents of the same proposal, as appropriate. For 
example, NRCS, in consultation with CEQ and the office of the Secretary 
of Agriculture, has determined that each EIS is to satisfy the 
requirements for a regulatory impact analysis as required by Executive 
Order 12044. This may necessitate modifying the recommended CEQ format. 
If documents are combined, the RFO is to include the information and 
sections required by the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10). The 
environmental impact statement should indicate those considerations, 
including factors not related to environmental quality, that are likely 
to be relevant to a decision.
    (2) The RFO is to establish the format and content of each document 
giving full consideration to the guidance and requirements of the CEQ 
regulations. The NRCS technical service center director is to provide 
guidance and concurrence on the format and content if the NRCS state 
conservationist is the RFO. The results of scoping are to determine the 
content of the EA or the EIS and the amount of detail needed to analyze 
the impacts.
    (3) In addition to the minimum requirements of the CEQ regulations 
(40 CFR 1502.10), environmental assessments and environmental impact 
statements are to include--
    (i) A brief description of public participation activities of 
agencies, groups, and individuals during the environmental evaluation;
    (ii) A description of the hazard potential of each alternative, 
including an explanation of the rationale for dam classification and the 
risk of dam failure from overtopping for other causes;
    (iii) Information identifying any approved regional plans for water 
resource management in the study area (40 CFR 1506.2(d)) and a statement 
on whether the proposed project is consistent with such plans;
    (iv) All Federal permits, licenses, and other entitlements that must 
be obtained (40 CFR 1502.25(b)); and
    (v) A brief description of major environmental problems, conflicts, 
and disagreements among groups and agencies and how they were resolved. 
Unresolved conflicts and the NRCS's proposal for resolving the 
disagreements before the project is implemented are to be summarized.
    (4) Letters of comment and responses. (40 CFR 1503.4, 1502.9(b)) 
Letters of comment that were received and the responses to these 
comments are to appended to the final EIS. Opposing views and other 
substantive comments that were not adequately discussed in the draft EIS 
are to be incorporated in the final EIS.
    (5) Appendix. The RFO may use an appendix to an EA or EIS. If an 
appendix is too voluminous to be circulated with the EIS, the RFO is to 
make it available on request. If an appendix is included it is to--
    (i) Meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1502.18;
    (ii) Identify any methodologies used (40 CFR 1502.24) and make 
explicit reference to other sources relied on for conclusions; and
    (iii) Briefly describe the relationship between the benefit-cost 
analysis and any analyses of unquantified environmental impacts, values, 
and amenities. ``For purposes of complying with the

[[Page 443]]

Act, the weighing of the merits or drawbacks of the various alternatives 
need not be displayed in a monetary cost benefit and should not be when 
these are important qualitative considerations.'' (40 CFR 1502.23).


<R05>
Sec. 650.12  NRCS decisionmaking.

    (a) General. The purpose of these procedures is to insure that 
environmental information is provided to decision makers in a timely 
manner. The NEPA process is a part of NRCS decisionmaking. The RFO is to 
insure that the policies and purposes of NEPA and CEQ regulations are 
complied with in NRCS decisionmaking by:
    (1) Including in all decision documents and supporting environmental 
documents a discussion of all alternatives considered in the decision. 
Alternatives to be considered in reaching a decision will be available 
to the public.
    (2) Submitting relevant environmental documents, comments, and 
responses with other decision documents through the review process.
    (3) Including in the record of formal rulemaking or adjudicatory 
proceedings relevent environmental documents, comments and responses.
    (4) Providing for pre- and post-project monitoring (40 CFR 
1505.2(c), 1505.3) and evaluation in representative projects to insure 
that planning and evaluation procedures are performed according to sound 
criteria.
    (b) Decision points in NRCS-assisted projects. NRCS administers 
programs that may have a significant effect on the human environment. 
Program procedures incorporate provisions for compliance with NEPA and 
for providing environmental information to the public, other agencies, 
and decision makers in a timely manner. NRCS provides technical and 
financial assistance for projects under the Watershed Protection and 
Flood Prevention and the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) 
programs. These usually require the preparation of project EA's or 
EIS's. The major decisionmaking points and their relation to NEPA 
compliance are as follows:
    (1) For Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention projects:
    (i) Application for assistance by the sponsoring local organization 
(SLO).
    (ii) A preauthorization report identifying goals, alternatives, and 
effects of alternatives (including environmental impacts) prepared by 
the RFO and submitted to the applicant for decision. It is circulated to 
local, State, and Federal agencies and public comment is solicited. A 
decision is made to stop planning assistance or to develop a watershed 
plan.
    (iii) Granting of planning authorization by the Administrator. The 
RFO must provide an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts to 
obtain the authorization.
    (iv) A watershed agreement between the SLO and NRCS. The agreement 
is based on a completed watershed plan and associated environmental 
documents, which have been adequately reviewed within NRCS.
    (v) A project agreement between the SLO and the RFO executed after 
the NEPA process is complete and the watershed plan has been approved 
and final plans and specifications have been developed.
    (2) For RC&D measure plans:
    (i) A request for assistance (measure proposal) is reviewed by the 
RC&D council to insure that the proposal is in accordance with the RC&D 
area plan. The proposal is then referred to NRCS.
    (ii) A preliminary report is prepared by the RFO to identify goals, 
alternatives, and effects (including environmental impacts). The report 
is submitted to the sponsor for review. The sponsor may then apply to 
NRCS for planning assistance for measures considered in the preliminary 
report.
    (iii) An authorization for planning assistance is granted by the 
RFO.
    (iv) The RC&D measure plan is signed by the applicant and the RFO 
after the preparation and review of the measure plan and environmental 
documents.
    (v) A project agreement is signed between the applicant and the RFO 
after the NEPA process is complete, the measure plan has been approved, 
and final plans and specifications have been prepared.
    (c) Record of decision--(1) EIS's. The RFO is to prepare a concise 
record of decision (ROD) for actions requiring an

[[Page 444]]

EIS. The record of decision is to be prepared and signed by the RFO 
following the 30-day administrative action period initiated by the EPA's 
publication of the notice of availability of the final EIS in the 
Federal Register. It is to serve as the public record of decision as 
described in 40 CFR 1505.2 of the CEQ regulations. The ROD is to be 
distributed to all who provided substantive comments on the draft EIS 
and all others who request it. A notice of availability of the ROD will 
be published in the Federal Register and local newspaper(s) serving the 
project area. The RFO may choose to publish the entire ROD.
    (2) Environmental Assessments (EA). If the EA indicates that the 
proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly affecting 
the quality of the human environment, the RFO is to prepare a finding of 
no significant impact (FNSI).
    (3) Distribution and publication of the FNSI (Sec. 1506.6(b)). The 
RFO is to distribute the FNSI to interested agencies and individuals. 
Notice of its availability is to be published in the Federal Register 
and in one or more newspapers serving the area of the proposed action. 
Single copy requests for the document are to be filed without charge. A 
charge may be made for multiple copies. Implementing action is not to be 
initiated for 30 days after the notice of availability of the FNSI has 
been published in the Federal Register.
    (d) Changes in actions. When it appears that a project or other 
action needs to be changed, the RFO will perform an environmental 
evaluation of the authorized action before making a change.


<R05>
Sec. 650.13  Review and comment.

    In addition to the requirements of 40 CFR 1503, 1506.10 and 1506.11, 
NRCS will take the following steps in distributing EIS's for review and 
comment:
    (a) Draft EIS's. Five copies of the draft EIS are to be filed by the 
RFO with the Office of Environmental Review, A-104, Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. At the same time, the RFO is 
to send copies of the draft EIS to the following:
    (1) Other Federal agencies. The regional office of EPA and other 
agencies that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect 
to any environmental effect, other Federal agencies (including 
appropriate field and regional offices), and affected Indian tribes.
    (2) State and local agencies. OMB Circular No. A-95 (Revised), 
through its system of State and areawide clearinghouses, provides a 
means for obtaining the views of State and local environmental agencies 
that can assist in the preparation and review of EIS's
    (3) Organizations, groups, and individuals. A copy of the draft EIS 
is to be sent to the appropriate official of each organization or group 
and each individual of the interested public (Sec. 650.9(d)(3)(i)) and 
to others as requested. A charge may be made for multiple copy requests.
    (b) Time period for comment. The time period for review ends 45 days 
after the date EPA publishes the notice of public availability of the 
draft in the Federal Register. A 15-day-extension of time for review and 
comment is to be considered by the RFO when such requests are submitted 
in writing. If neither comments nor a request for an extension is 
received at the end of the 45-day period, it is to be presumed that the 
agency or party from whom comments were requested has no comments to 
make.
    (c) News releases. In addition to the notice of availability 
published in the Federal Register by EPA, the RFO is to announce the 
availability of the draft EIS in one or more newspapers serving the 
area.
    (d) Revising a draft EIS. If significant changes in the proposed 
action are made as a result of comments on the draft EIS, a revised 
draft EIS may be necessary. The revised draft EIS is to be recirculated 
for comment in the same manner as a draft EIS.
    (e) Final EIS's. After the review period for the draft EIS, the RFO 
is to prepare a final EIS, making adjustments where necessary by taking 
into consideration and responding to significant comments and opposing 
viewpoints received on the draft EIS. The following steps are to be 
taken in filing and distributing the final EIS:

[[Page 445]]

    (1) Letters of comment are to be appended to the final EIS. If 
numerous repetitive responses are received, summaries of the repetitive 
comments and a list of the groups or individuals who commented may be 
appended in lieu of the actual letter.
    (2) The RFO is to send five copies of the final EIS to EPA's Office 
of Environmental Review, and a copy of the final EIS to each State and 
Federal agency, organization, group, and individual who commented on the 
draft EIS. Single copy requests for copies of the final EIS will be 
provided without charge. A charge may be made for multiple copy 
requests.
    (3) During the 30-day administrative action period noted in 
Sec. 650.12(c), NRCS will make its final EIS available to the public (40 
CFR 1506.10).
    (f) Supplements to EIS's. (1) If NRCS determines that it is 
necessary to clarify or amplify a point of concern raised after the 
final EIS is filed, appropriate clarification or amplification is to be 
sent to EPA with information copies furnished to those who received 
copies of the final EIS. The waiting periods do not apply.
    (2) If the RFO determines that the final EIS or supplement to the 
original EIS previously filed becomes inadequate because of a major 
change in the plan for the proposed action that significantly affects 
the quality of the human environment, a new EIS is to be prepared, 
filed, and distributed as described in this section.

<R05>
Sec. 650.20  Reviewing and commenting on EIS's prepared by other agencies.

    (a) NRCS employees assigned to review and comment on EIS's prepared 
by other agencies are to be familiar with NRCS policies and guidelines 
contained in this part, and NEPA.
    (b) EIS's received for review by NRCS for which NRCS has expertise 
or interest shall be responded to promptly. Comments are to be objective 
with the intent to offer suggestions to help minimize adverse impacts of 
the proposed action to ensure the health and welfare of the agricultural 
community. Comments are to be based on knowledge readily available. 
Field office technical guides, soil surveys, field investigation 
reports, and other resource data and reference materials developed by 
NRCS and other agencies should be used and cited. It is not intended 
that special surveys or investigations be conducted to acquire 
additional information for use in preparing comments.
    (c) The NRCS reviewer should consider the following kinds of 
concerns--(1) The suitability or limitations of the soils for the 
proposed action. Would an alternative route, location, or layout 
minimize land use problems and adverse environmental impacts?
    (2) Provisions for control of erosion and management of water during 
construction. Are there resources downstream that would be affected by 
sediment from the construction area, and does the statement provide for 
adequate control measures? Will lack of erosion control cause air 
pollution? Is the stockpiling of topsoil for future use considered in 
the EIS?
    (3) Provisions for soil and water conservation managment measures on 
project lands, rights-of-way, access roads, and borrow areas. Does the 
statement indicate that enduring soil and water practices are to be 
installed and maintained?
    (4) The effect of water discharges from project lands or rights-of-
way onto other properties. Will discharges cause erosion or flooding on 
other lands? Will discharges affect water quality?

[[Page 446]]

    (5) The effects of disruption of the natural drainage patterns and 
severance of private land units. Does the statement indicate that 
natural drainage patterns will be maintained? Will bridges, culverts, 
and other water control structures be located to ensure that adjacent 
lands are not flooded or otherwise restricted in use? Does the EIS 
describe the effects of severance on private land ownerships?
    (6) The impact on existing soil and water conservation management 
systems. To what extent will conservation systems be altered, severed, 
or suffer blocked outlets? Will land use or cover be affected?
    (7) Impacts on prime and unique farmland. Would an alternative 
location or route require less prime farmland? Does the EIS consider 
secondary effects on prime farmland? What benefits are foregone if prime 
farmland is taken?
    (8) Impacts on ecosystems. Does the EIS describe impacts on major 
plant communities, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems?
    (9) Impacts on NRCS-assisted projects. Does the statement reflect 
the effect of the proposed action on present or planned NRCS assisted 
projects?
    (d) EIS's referred to NRCS for departmental comments. EIS's referred 
by the USDA Coordinator for Environmental Quality Activities to the NRCS 
national office may designate NRCS as the lead agency for preparing 
comments for USDA. In this case, the NRCS national office determines 
whether inputs from STC's and other USDA agencies are needed. If so, 
STC's and other USDA agencies are requested to forward comments to the 
Environmental Services Division fo use in preparing the USDA response.
    (e) EIS's referred to NRCS for agency comments. EIS's received by 
the NRCS national office are screeened by the Director, Environmental 
Services Division to determine which office within NRCS will prepare 
comments. If the proposed action is within one State, the draft EIS will 
be forwarded to the appropriate STC and he will reply directly to the 
agency requesting the comments. If the proposed action involves more 
than one State, one STC will be designated to forward NRCS comments 
directly to the agency requesting the comments. In some cases, the 
action may be national or regional in scope, and require inputs from 
several offices within NRCS. In this instance, comments will be 
assembled in the Environmental Services Division for preparation of a 
response to the agency requesting comments. A copy of each response 
prepared by a STC should be sent to the Director, Environmental Services 
Division.
    (f) EIS's sent to NRCS offices other than the national office. If a 
STC receives an EIS from another agency, he is to respond to the 
initiating agency. A copy of his comments should be sent to the 
Director, Environmental Services Division.
    (1) EIS's addressed to NRCS area or field offices. If an EIS is 
received by a field or area office of NRCS, the STC will coordinate the 
response.
    (2) EIS's submitted to conservation districts. NRCS may furnish 
needed soil, water, and related resource information to the district for 
their use in preparing comments.
    (g) Distribution of NRCS comments on other agencies' draft EIS's. 
Five copies of review comments made by NRCS on draft EIS's prepared by 
other Federal agencies are to be sent to CEQ.
    (h) Third party requests for a copy of NRCS comments on another 
agency's EIS will be filled after NRCS has forwarded copies of its 
letter of comments to CEQ.

<R05>
Sec. 650.21  Working relations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and related State environmental agencies.

    (a) Background. The authorities and missions of NRCS, EPA, and state 
environmental agencies make it imperative that an effective cooperative 
and coordinative working relationship be developed and maintained in 
areas of mutual concern. These common areas include air quality, water 
quality, pesticides, waste recycling and disposal, environmental 
considerations in land use, Environmental Impact Statements (EIS's) and 
environmental considerations in the conservation and development of 
natural resources.

[[Page 447]]

    (b) Policy. NRCS will work closely with EPA in accordance with the 
provisions of the EPA-USDA Memorandum of Understanding July 31, 1974, at 
all administrative levels and with related state agencies to meet 
statutory requirements and to achieve harmonious implementation of all 
actions of mutual concern directed to improving or maintaining the 
quality of the environment.
    (c) Responsibility--(1) NRCS national office. The Deputy 
Administrator for Field Services is responsible for overall coordination 
with EPA at the national office level. The Deputy Administrator for 
Water Resources is responsible for contacts with EPA in relation to 
activities of the Water Resources Council on water and related land 
resource planning and for coordinating work with EPA on EIS development.
    (2) Technical service center. The TSC director is responsible for 
contacts and coordination with EPA regional offices within the group of 
states served by the TSC.
    (3) NRCS state office. The state conservationist is responsible for 
contacts and coordination with regional representatives of EPA and state 
environmental agencies in matters of mutual concern within his state.
    (d) Coordination and implementation. (1) The NRCS national office 
will:
    (i) Within the framework of USDA agreements and guidelines, develop 
agreements for undertaking specific activities or projects of national 
significance and mutual advantage.
    (ii) Assist EPA as requested in developing EPA policy, guidelines, 
and standards.
    (iii) Consider EPA needs in soil survey and land, inventory, and 
monitoring activities.
    (iv) Maintain needed liaison and develop mutual guidelines with EPA 
on water resources work and in coordinating EIS's.
    (v) Advise EPA regarding soils, plant materials, and soil and water 
conservation techniques.
    (vi) Establish procedures for periodic review of NRCS national 
standards for treatment systems and practices for agricultural pollution 
abatement, including wind and water erosion and sediment control, 
transport of pesticides, organic matter and fertilizers, and burning of 
residues or clearing debris.
    (2) The TSC director will:
    (i) Within the framework of NRCS memorandums and guidelines 
coordinate with the EPA regional administrator(s) the development of 
needed agreements for undertaking specific activities or projects of 
multistate significance and mutual advantage.
    (3) The state conservationist will:
    (i) Obtain early input of EPA and interested state and local 
environmental agencies in the planning process for projects or measures 
within the state impacting on the environment.
    (ii) Coordinate preparations of NRCS practice standards and 
procedures for agricultural pollution abatement within the state with 
EPA and related state agencies.
    (iii) Encourage the development of a coordinated review and approval 
process within the state with EPA and appropriate state and local 
agencies including conservation districts for actions of mutual concern.
    (iv) Attempt to resolve all EPA areas of concern on NRCS assisted 
project-type actions within the state before a final EIS is prepared.


<R05>
Sec. 650.22  Rare, threatened, and endangered species of plants and animals.

    (a) Background. (1) A variety of plant and animal species of the 
United States are so reduced in numbers that they are threatened with 
extinction. The disappearance of any of these would be a biological, 
cultural, and in some instances an economic loss. Their existence 
contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding, and their 
presence adds interest and variety to life.
    (2) The principal hazard to threatened and endangered species is the 
destruction or deterioration of their habitats by human activities such 
as industrialization, urbanization, agriculture, lumbering, recreation, 
and transportation. These activities of man will continue but the 
necessity of recognizing their adverse impacts and selecting 
alternatives that minimize or eliminate such impacts on threatened and 
endangered species is imperative.
    (3) The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-205, 87 Stat. 884 
(16

[[Page 448]]

U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)) provides a means whereby the ecosystems upon which 
endangered and threatened species depend may be maintained and a program 
for the conservation of such species. The Act also provides that, in 
addition to the Department of the Interior, ``All other federal 
departments and agencies shall, in consultation with and with the 
assistance of the Secretary (of Interior), utilize their authorities for 
the conservation of endangered species and threatened species listed 
pursuant to section 4 of this Act and by taking such action necessary to 
insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not 
jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered species and 
threatened species or result in the destruction or modification of 
habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after 
consultation as appropriate with the affected states, to be critical.'' 
The Act also:
    (i) Defines endangered species as any species in danger of 
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range and 
threatened species as any species likely to become an endangered species 
within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of 
its range. The Act uses the category ``threatened.'' The term ``rare'' 
is not used.
    (ii) Further defines species as including any subspecies of fish or 
wildlife or plants and any other group of fish and wildlife of the same 
species or smaller taxa in common spatial arrangements that interbreed 
when mature.
    (iii) Provides for the Secretary of the Interior to enter into 
cooperative agreements with states for the purpose of implementing state 
programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened fish and 
wildlife. This assistance may include financial grants.
    (iv) Provides national lists of endangered and threatened animal and 
plant species to be maintained by the Secretary of the Interior and 
published in the Federal Register. When resident fish and wildlife are 
added to the list, the affected states are to be consulted by the 
Secretary. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is preparing a 
list of endangered or threatened plant species.
    (b) Policy. The Act gives NRCS additional direction for 
participation in the conservation and protection of endangered and 
threatened species. As the principal federal agency concerned with land 
use planning of privately owned rural land and with professional 
conservation employees headquartered in almost every county, NRCS is 
uniquely capable of playing a vital role. Additional training will be 
provided as needed to meet NRCS responsibilities. NRCS will assist in 
the conservation of threatened and endangered species and consistent 
with legal requirements avoid or prevent activities detrimental to such 
species. NRCS concern for these species will not be limited to those 
listed by the Secretary of the Interior and published in the Federal 
Register, but will include species designated by state agencies as rare, 
threatened, endangered, etc.
    (c) Responsibility--(1) NRCS national office. The Administrator will 
arrange for consultation and coordination of NRCS national office 
activities with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, other federal 
agencies, and national organizations.
    (2) Technical service center. The TSC director will, within the 
group of states served by the TSC arrange for consultation and 
coordination with regional representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, other Federal agencies, and national and regional 
organizations.
    (3) NRCS state office. The state conservationist will arrange for 
consultation and coordination with the state fish and game or 
conservation agency, other state agencies, state organizations and 
foundations, conservation districts, and state representatives of 
federal agencies and national organizations.
    (d) Coordination and implementation. (1) The NRCS national office 
will:
    (i) Within the framework of national legislation, USDA agreements, 
and NRCS objectives, develop NRCS policies and directives for guiding 
agency efforts that will protect threatened and endangered species and 
for avoiding actions that jeopardize the continued existence of such 
species and their critical habitats.

[[Page 449]]

    (ii) Maintain needed liaison and develop mutual understanding with 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other concerned federal agencies.
    (iii) Establish procedures for periodic review of NRCS participation 
in the national effort to conserve these species.
    (2) The TSC director will: (i) Within the framework of NRCS policies 
and guidelines, arrange for needed liaison and understanding with 
regional counterparts of other federal agencies within the group of 
states served by the TSC and keep state conservationists informed of 
developments within such states.
    (ii) Provide guidance and assistance to state conservationists in 
carrying out NRCS policies and guidelines.
    (3) The state conservationist will develop procedures to establish 
working relationships with other concerned federal agencies, state fish 
and wildlife or conservation agencies, conservation districts, concerned 
scientists in state university systems and natural history museums, and 
other informed persons and organizations to offer assistance in:
    (i) Preparing or maintaining lists of the state's threatened and 
endangered species.
    (ii) Determining the geographic occurrence of endangered and 
threatened species, the nature of their habitat, and that portion of the 
habitat that is critical to the survival, maintenance, or increase of 
these species.
    (iii) Discussing the kinds of measures important to preserve their 
habitat.
    (iv) A monitoring program that would obtain advanced warning of 
actions or conditions that could further endanger these species, thereby 
enabling NRCS and others to take appropriate protective action.
    (v) Assisting recovery teams, as appropriate, in preparing species 
recovery plans of those endangered and threatened species included in 
Federal lists.
    (4) The state conservationist will also:
    (i) Keep NRCS area and field offices informed of species listed as 
being threatened or endangered, geographic area in which they are found, 
and information such as their numbers, preferred habitat, and critical 
factors.
    (ii) Review the status of threatened and endangered species each 
December and send a report of the review to the Administrator.
    (5) NRCS district conservationists within the geographic range of 
threatened and endangered species will examine conservation district 
programs and NRCS operations to evaluate their effects on these species, 
and recommend to district officials and the state conservationist any 
action needed for their protection.
    (6) NRCS field employees within the geographic range of threatened 
and endangered species will be continually alert to conditions, actions, 
or trends that may adversely affect the welfare of these species and 
report adverse situations to the state conservationist.


<R05>
Sec. 650.23  Natural areas.

    (a) Background. (1) Natural areas are defined as land or water units 
where natural conditions are maintained insofar as possible. Natural 
conditions usually result from allowing ordinary physical and biological 
processes to operate with a minimum of human intervention. Manipulations 
may be required on natural areas to maintain or restore features that 
the areas were established to protect.
    (2) Natural areas may be designated areas of Federal, non-Federal 
government, or privately controlled land. Designation may be formal as 
provided for under federal regulations for areas of federal land to be 
administered as natural areas or by foundations or conservation 
organizations specifically created to acquire and maintain natural 
areas. Designation may be informal in the case of private landowners who 
designate a specific area as a natural area and manage it accordingly. 
Several professional societies concerned with renewable natural 
resources encourage establishment of natural areas withdrawn from 
economic uses and recognition of natural areas maintained and managed in 
economic enterprises.
    (3) Natural areas are established and maintained for a variety of 
purposes including:

[[Page 450]]

    (i) Furthering science and education. Natural areas provide sites 
for research and outdoor classrooms for study of plant and animal 
communities in environments with particular ecological conditions.
    (ii) Monitoring the surrounding environment. Natural areas serve as 
gauges against which to evaluate changes in land use, vegetation, animal 
life, air quality, or other environmental values.
    (iii) Providing recreation attractions. Natural areas are valued by 
many people for their scenic, wild, and undisturbed character but must 
be protected, as needed, to prevent disturbance or alteration of the 
resources.
    (iv) Preserving unique values. Natural areas may be established to 
protect scenic, biologic, geologic, or paleontologic features.
    (v) Serving as a genetic base for native plants and animals. Natural 
areas may be established to preserve examples of land and water 
ecosystems with their full range of genetic diversity of native plants 
and animals including threatened and endangered species.
    (b) Policy. NRCS will recognize natural areas, if so dedicated, as a 
land use, and will support the designation of appropriate natural areas.
    (c) Responsibility--(1) NRCS national office. The Administrator will 
designate a member of the national office staff to act as NRCS 
representative on the Federal Committee for Ecological Preserves and to 
provide appropriate liaison with other federal agencies and non-Federal 
groups concerned with natural areas.
    (2) Technical service center. The TSC director will designate a TSC 
plant sciences discipline leader to provide leadership, appropriate 
liaison, and assistance on natural areas to NRCS state offices.
    (3) NRCS state office. The state conservationist will designate an 
appropriate NRCS representative to work with other agencies and groups, 
and will coordinate assistance on natural areas needed by area and field 
offices.
    (d) Coordination and implementation. (1) NRCS technical assistance 
will be furnished to representatives of administering agencies, 
foundations, groups, and individuals when requested through conservation 
districts. Conservation district officers will be encouraged to 
recognize appropriate natural areas concepts and programs and to 
participate in them.
    (2) NRCS employees will report to state conservationists abuses and 
potential or actual damages to natural areas that may be found in the 
course of ordinary business.
    (3) NRCS will cooperate with professional societies, groups, and 
individuals in locating areas suitable for and needed as natural areas.
    (4) NRCS employees providing technical assistance to land users must 
inform them about the impact their decisions may have on adjacent or 
nearby natural areas. Land users will be encouraged to consult with 
concerned agencies, societies, and individuals to arrive at mutually 
satisfactory land use and treatment.
    (5) Recommended classification systems for characterizing areas 
designated as ecological preserves or as natural areas are contained in 
the following publications:

Soil Taxonomy, a Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and 
Interpreting Soil Surveys, USDA-NRCS Agricultural Handbook 436.
Forest Cover Types of North America Exclusive of Mexico, Report of the 
Committee on Forest Cover Types, Society of American Foresters, 1964.
Potential Natural Vegetation of Conterminous United States. A. W. 
Kuchler, American Geographical Society Special Publication 36, 1964.
Wetlands classification described by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
in its Circular 39.


NRCS will, to the extent feasible, use these classification systems when 
providing technical assistance on public and private natural areas and 
ecological preserves.
    (6) The NRCS published National List of Scientific Plant Names will 
be used when scientific names or name symbols are needed for automatic 
data processing.

Sec. 650.24  Scenic beauty (visual resource).

    (a) Background. Contributions to scenic beauty are a normal product 
of NRCS work. Strip-cropping, field borders, field windbreaks, and ponds 
are examples. Emphasis is given to those soil and water conservation 
measures

[[Page 451]]

that contribute to a productive and efficient agriculture and increase 
the attractiveness of rural America and are in line with goals and 
objectives of conservation districts. This is best accomplished by 
considering the landscape visual resource when providing planning 
assistance to individual landowners, groups, units of government, and 
watershed and resource conservation development project sponsors. NRCS 
responsibilities in recreation also offer opportunities to develop the 
scenic beauty of the rural landscape. Department of Agriculture 
Secretary's Memorandum 1695, May 28, 1970, ``Protecting and Improving 
The Quality of the Environment,'' includes scenic beauty as an objective 
of the Department's programs.
    (b) Policy. NRCS will: (1) Provide technical assistance with full 
consideration of alternative management and development systems that 
preserve scenic beauty or improve the visual resource; (2) emphasize the 
application of conservation practices having scenic beauty or visual 
resource values particularly in waste management systems; field borders, 
field windbreaks, wetland management, access roads, critical area 
treatment; design and management of ponds, stream margins, odd areas, 
and farmsteads; siting or positioning of structures and buildings to be 
in harmony with the landscape while reducing the potential for erosion; 
using native and other adaptable plants for conservation which enhance 
scenic beauty and create variety while linking beauty with utility; (3) 
promote personal pride in landowners in the installation, maintenance, 
and appearance of conservation practices and their properties; (4) 
select suitable areas for waste products and use of screens to hide 
``eyesore'' areas, and (5) encourage conservation districts to include 
practices which promote scenic beauty in their annual and long-range 
programs.
    (c) Responsibility. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will 
provide technical assistance through conservation districts to 
landowners, operators, communities, and state and local governments in 
developing programs relating to scenic beauty.
    (1) NRCS national office. The Administrator will:
    (i) Assign appropriate NRCS national office leadership to insure 
that enhancement of scenic beauty is included in national information, 
policy, guidelines, standards, guides to specifications for conservation 
practices without impairing basic soil and water conservation functions.
    (ii) Emphasize in plant material center management and in plant 
materials functions that locating and evaluating plants for forage, 
erosion control, and recreation or wildlife uses be carried out with 
full attention to visual resource value.
    (2) NRCS state office. The state conservationist will:
    (i) Assign appropriate staff member(s) to provide leadership in 
carrying out scenic beauty policy and procedure within the state.
    (ii) Develop and keep current a landscape management plan to improve 
and maintain the appearance of all real properties under NRCS control, 
and provide appropriate assistance to owners and managers of properties 
leased or rented by NRCS.
    (iii) Give emphasis to preserving scenic beauty and contributing to 
the visual resource in the NRCS information program whenever 
opportunities exist.
    (d) Coordination and implementation. (1) The governing body of each 
conservation district will be encouraged to revise or update its 
district program to appropriately provide for beautification of the 
countryside through applicable land use changes and effective soil and 
water conservation treatment.
    (2) In providing assistance to watershed and resource conservation 
and development project sponsors and other resource planning groups for 
soil, water, and related resources, emphasis will be given to measures 
that preserve natural beauty or contribute to the quality of the visual 
resource.
    (3) Local organizations and groups interested in scenic beauty will 
be contacted and consulted for cooperation in and coordination with NRCS 
and conservation district efforts.


<R05>
Sec. 650.25  Flood-plain management.

    Through proper planning, flood plains can be managed to reduce the

[[Page 452]]

threat to human life, health, and property in ways that are 
environmentally sensitive. Most flood plains are valuable for 
maintaining agricultural and forest products for food and fiber, fish 
and wildlife habitat, temporary floodwater storage, park and recreation 
areas, and for maintaining and improving environmental values. NRCS 
technical and financial assistance is provided to land users primarily 
on non-Federal land through local conservation districts and other State 
and local agencies. Through its programs, NRCS encourages sound flood-
plain management decisions by land users.
    (a) Policy--(1) General. NRCS provides leadership and takes action, 
where practicable, to conserve, preserve, and restore existing natural 
and beneficial values in base (100-year) flood plains as part of 
technical and financial assistance in the programs it administers. In 
addition, 500-year flood plains are taken into account where there are 
``critical actions'' such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, 
utilities, and facilities producing or storing volatile, toxic, or 
water-reactive materials.
    (2) Technical assistance. NRCS provides leadership, through 
consultation and advice to conservation districts and land users, in the 
wise use, conservation, and preservation of all land, including flood 
plains. Handbooks, manuals, and internal memoranda set forth specific 
planning criteria for addressing flood-plain management in NRCS-assisted 
programs. The general procedures and guidelines in this part comply with 
Executive Order (E.O.) 11988, Floodplain Management, dated May 24, 1977, 
and are consistent with the Water Resources Council's Unified National 
Program for Floodplain Management.
    (3) Compatible land uses. The NRCS Administrator has determined that 
providing technical and financial assistance for the following land uses 
is compatible with E.O. 11988:
    (i) Agricultural flood plains that have been used for producing 
food, feed, forage, fiber, or oilseed for at least 3 of the 5 years 
before the request for assistance; and
    (ii) Agricultural production in accordance with official State or 
designated area water-quality plans.
    (4) Nonproject technical and financial assistance programs. The NRCS 
Administrator has determined that NRCS may not provide technical and 
financial assistance to land users if the results of such assisted 
actions are likely to have significant adverse effects on existing 
natural and beneficial values in the base flood plain and if NRCS 
determines that there are practicable alternatives outside the base 
flood plain. NRCS will make a case-by-case decision on whether to limit 
assistance whenever a land user proposes converting existing 
agricultural land to a significantly more intensive agricultural use 
that could have significant adverse effects on the natural and 
beneficial values or increase flood risk in the base flood plain. NRCS 
will carefully evaluate the potential extent of the adverse effects and 
any increased flood risk.
    (5) Project technical and financial assistance programs. In planning 
and installing land and water resource conservation projects, NRCS will 
avoid to the extent possible the long and short-term adverse effects of 
the occupancy and modification of base flood plains. In addition, NRCS 
also will avoid direct or indirect support of development in the base 
flood plain wherever there is a practicable alternative. As such, the 
environmental evaluation required for each project action (Sec. 650.5 of 
this part) will include alternatives to avoid adverse effects and 
incompatible development in base flood plains. Public participation in 
planning is described in Sec. 650.6 of this part and will comply with 
section 2(a)(4) of E.O. 11988. Flood-plain management requires the 
integration of these concerns into NRCS's National Environmental Policy 
Act (NEPA) process for project assistance programs as described in 
Section 650 of this part.
    (6) Real property and facilities under NRCS ownership or control. 
NRCS owns or controls about 30 properties that are used primarily for 
the evaluation and development of plant materials for erosion control 
and fish and wildlife habitat plantings (7 CFR Part 613, Plant Materials 
Centers, 16 U.S.C. 590 a-e, f, and 7 U.S.C. 1010-1011). If NRCS real 
properties or facilities are located in the base flood plain, NRCS will 
require

[[Page 453]]

an environmental evaluation when new structures and facilities or major 
modifications are proposed. If it is determined that the only 
practicable alternative for siting the proposed action may adversely 
affect the base flood plain, NRCS will design or modify its action to 
minimize potential harm to or within the flood plain and will prepare 
and circulate a notice explaining why the action is proposed to be 
located in the base flood plain. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) flood insurance maps, other available maps, 
information, or an onsite analysis will be used to determine whether the 
proposed NRCS action is in the base flood plain. Public participation in 
the action will be the same as described in Sec. 650.6 of this part.
    (b) Responsibility. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance 
to land users primarily through conservation districts, special purpose 
districts, and other State or local subdivisions of State government. 
Acceptance of this assistance is voluntary on the part of the land user. 
NRCS does not have authority to make land use decisions on non-Federal 
land. NRCS provides the land user with technical flood hazard data and 
information on flood-plain natural values. NRCS informs the land user 
how alternative land use decisions may affect the aquatic and terrestial 
ecosystems, human safety, property, and public welfare. Alternatives to 
flood-plain occupancy, modification, and development are discussed 
onsite with the land user by NRCS.
    (1) NRCS National Office. (Sec. 600.2 of this part). The NRCS 
Administrator, state conservationist, and district conservationist are 
the responsible Federal officials in NRCS for implementing the policies 
expressed in these rules. Any deviation from these rules must be 
approved by the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator for Programs has 
authority to oversee the application of policy in NRCS programs. 
Oversight assistance to state conservationists for flood-plain 
management will be provided by the NRCS technical service centers 
(Sec. 600.3 of this part).
    (2) NRCS state offices. (Sec. 600.4 of this part). Each state 
conservationist is the responsible Federal official in all NRCS-assisted 
programs administered within the State. He or she is also responsible 
for administering the plant materials centers within the State. The 
state conservationist will assign a staff person who has basic knowledge 
of landforms, soils, water, and related plant and animal ecosystems to 
provide technical oversight to ensure that assistance to land users and 
project sponsors on the wise use, conservation, and preservation of 
flood plains is compatible with national policy. For NRCS-assisted 
project actions, the staff person assigned by the state conservationist 
will consult with the local jurisdictions, sponsoring local 
organizations, and land users, on the basis of an environmental 
evaluation, to determine what constitutes significant adverse effects or 
incompatible development in the base flood plain. The state 
conservationist is to prepare and circulate a written notice for NRCS-
assisted actions for which the only practicable alternative requires 
siting in a base flood plain and may result in adverse effects or 
incompatible development. The NRCS NEPA process will be used to 
integrate flood-plain management into project planning and consultations 
on land use decisions by land users and project sponsors.
    (3) NRCS field offices. The district conservationist (Sec. 600.6 of 
this part) is delegated the responsibility for providing technical 
assistance and approving financial assistance to land users in 
nonproject actions, where applicable, and for deciding what constitutes 
an adverse effect or incompatible development of a base flood plain. 
This assistance will be based on official NRCS policy, rules, 
guidelines, and procedures in NRCS handbooks, manuals, memoranda, etc. 
For NRCS-assisted nonproject actions, the district conservationist, on 
the basis of the environmental evaluation, will advise recipients of 
technical and financial assistance about what constitutes a significant 
adverse effect or incompatible development in the base flood plain.
    (c) Coordination and implementation. All planning by NRCS staffs is 
interdisciplinary and encompasses the six NEPA policy statements, the 
WRC Principles and Standards, and an

[[Page 454]]

equivalent of the eight-step decisionmaking process in the WRC's 
February 1978 Floodplain Management Guidelines. NRCS internal handbooks, 
manuals, and memoranda provide detailed information and guidance for 
NRCS planning and environmental evaluation.
    (1) Steps for nonproject technical and financial assistance 
programs. (i) NRCS assistance programs are voluntary and are carried out 
through local conservation districts (State entities) primarily on non-
Federal, privately owned lands.
    (ii) After the land user decides the type, extent, and location of 
the intended action for which assistance is sought, the district 
conservationist will determine if the intended action is in the base 
flood plain by using HUD flood insurance maps, and other available maps 
and information or by making an onsite determination of the approximate 
level of the 100-year flood if maps or other usable information are 
lacking.
    (iii) If the district conservationist determines that the land 
user's proposed location is outside the base flood plain, and would not 
cause potential harm within the base flood plain, NRCS will continue to 
provide assistance, as needed.
    (iv) If the district conservationist determines that the land user's 
proposed action is within the base flood plain and would likely result 
in adverse effects, incompatible development, or an increased flood 
hazard, it is the responsibility of the district conservationist to 
determine and point out to the land user alternative methods of 
achieving the objective, as well as alternative locations outside the 
base flood plain. If the alternative locations are determined to be 
impractical, the district conservationist will decide whether to 
continue providing assistance. If the decision is to terminate 
assistance for the proposed action, the land user and the local 
conservation district, if one exists, will be notified in writing about 
the decision.
    (v) If the district conservationist decides to continue providing 
technical and financial assistance for a proposed action in the base 
flood plain, which is the only practicable alternative, NRCS may require 
that the proposed action be designed or modified so as to minimize 
potential harm to or within the flood plain. The district 
conservationist will prepare and circulate locally a written notice 
explaining why the action is proposed to be located in the base flood 
plain.
    (2) Steps for project assistance programs. (i) NRCS project 
assistance to local sponsoring organizations (conservation districts and 
other legal entities of State government) and land users is carried out 
primarily on non-Federal land in response to requests for assistance. 
NRCS helps the local sponsoring organizations prepare a plan for 
implementing the needed resource measures.
    (ii) NRCS uses an interdisciplinary environmental evaluation 
(Sec. 650.6 of this part) as a basis for providing recommendations and 
alternatives to project sponsors. Flood-plain management is an integral 
part of every NRCS environmental evaluation. NRCS delineates the base 
flood plain by using detailed HUD flood insurance maps and other 
available data, as appropriate, and provides recommendations to sponsors 
on alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible development in 
base flood plains. NRCS will develop, as needed, detailed 100-year and 
500-year flood-plain maps where there are none.
    (iii) NRCS's NEPA process (part 650 of this chapter) is used to 
integrate the spirit and intent of E.O. 11988 Sections 2(a) and 2(c) 
into agency planning and recommendations for land and water use 
decisions by local sponsoring organizations and land users.
    (iv) NRCS will terminate assistance to a local sponsoring 
organization in project programs if it becomes apparent that decisions 
by land users and local jurisdictions concerning flood-plain management 
would likely result in adverse effects or incompatible development and 
the environmental evaluation reveals that there are practicable 
alternatives to the proposed project that would not cause adverse 
effects on the base flood plain.
    (v) In carrying out the planning and installation of land and water 
resource conservation projects, NRCS will avoid, to the extent possible, 
the long-

[[Page 455]]

term and short-term adverse effects associated with the occupancy and 
modification of base flood plains. In addition, NRCS will also avoid 
direct or indirect support of development in the base flood plain 
wherever there is a practicable alternative. Where appropriate, NRCS 
will require design modifications to minimize harm to or within the base 
flood plain. NRCS will provide appropriate public notice and public 
participation in the continuing planning process in accordance with NRCS 
NEPA process.
    (vi) NRCS may require the local government to adopt and enforce 
appropriate flood plain regulations as a condition to receiving project 
financial assistance.
    (3) Actions on property and facilities under NRCS ownership or 
control. For real property and facilities owned by or under the control 
of NRCS, the following actions will be taken:
    (i) Locate new structures, facilities, etc., outside the base flood 
plain if there is a practicable alternate site.
    (ii) Require public participation in decisions to construct 
structures, facilities, etc., in flood plains that might result in 
adverse effects and incompatible development in such areas if no 
practicable alternatives exist.
    (iii) New construction or rehabilitation will be in accordance with 
the standards and criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program and 
will include floodproofing and other flood protection measures as 
appropriate.

Sec. 652.6  Department delivery of technical services.

    (a) The Department may procure the services of certified technical 
service providers through a contract or a contribution agreement to 
assist the Department in providing technical services necessary to 
develop and implement the conservation programs subject to this part. 
The Department shall only enter into a contribution agreement with a 
certified technical service provider if the certified technical service 
provider contributes at least 50 percent of the technical services 
needed to accomplish the goals of the project under which the 
contribution agreement is entered. The Chief may establish minimum 
contribution rates or limit the utilization of contribution agreements.
    (b) The Department may also enter into a cooperative agreement after 
competition as specified by part 3015 of this title if the principal 
purpose of the cooperative agreement is to transfer a thing of value to 
carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by law. 
The Chief or the Administrator, Farm Service Agency (FSA) may limit the 
utilization of cooperative agreements by NRCS or FSA, respectively. Only 
the Chief, NRCS or the Administrator, FSA may make a determination that 
competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction and 
such determination shall only be based where a non-competitive award is 
in the best interest of the Government and necessary to the 
accomplishment of the goals of the program.
    (c) A certified technical service provider, or an individual 
providing technical services under the auspices of a technical service 
provider's certification, shall not be eligible to receive payment under 
a program contract or

[[Page 459]]

agreement for technical services provided directly to a program 
participant if that technical service provider has entered into a 
contract, cooperative agreement, or contribution agreement with NRCS to 
provide technical services to that program participant.
    (d) The Department will, to the extent practicable, ensure that the 
amounts paid for technical service under this part are consistent across 
conservation program areas, unless specific conservation program 
requirements include additional tasks.


<R05>
Sec. 652.7  Quality assurance.

    (a) NRCS will review, in consultation with the Farm Service Agency, 
as appropriate, the quality of the technical services provided by 
technical service providers. As a requirement of certification, 
technical service providers will be required to develop and maintain 
documentation in accordance with Departmental manuals, handbooks, and 
technical guidance for the technical services provided, and furnish this 
documentation to NRCS and the program participant when the particular 
technical service is completed. NRCS may utilize information obtained 
through its quality assurance process, documentation submitted by the 
technical service provider, and other relevant information in 
determining how to improve the quality of technical service, as well as 
determining whether to decertify a technical service provider under 
subpart C of this part.
    (b) Upon discovery of a deficiency in the provision of technical 
service through its quality assurance process or other means, NRCS will, 
to the greatest extent practicable, send a notice to the technical 
service provider detailing the deficiency and requesting remedial action 
by the technical service provider. Failure by the technical service 
provider to promptly remedy the deficiency, or the occurrence of 
repeated deficiencies in providing technical services, may trigger the 
decertification process set forth in subpart C of this part. A failure 
by NRCS to notice any deficiency does not affect any action under the 
decertification process. Technical service providers are solely 
responsible for providing technical services that meet all NRCS 
standards and specifications.

<R04>
                       Subpart C--Decertification


<R05>
Sec. 652.31  Policy.

    In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of NRCS to 
maintain certification of those technical service providers who act 
responsibly in the provision of technical service, including meeting 
NRCS standards and specifications when providing technical service to 
program participants. This section, which provides for the 
decertification of technical service providers, is an appropriate means 
to implement this policy.


<R05>
Sec. 652.32  Causes for decertification.

    A State Conservationist, in whose State a technical service provider 
is certified to provide technical service, may decertify the technical 
service provider, in accordance with these provisions, for the following 
reasons:
    (a) Failure to meet NRCS standards and specifications in the 
provision of technical services rendering to the extent that the 
practice is ineffective or environmentally harmful;
    (b) Violation of the terms of the Certification Agreement, including 
but not limited to, a demonstrated lack of understanding of, or an 
unwillingness or inability to implement, NRCS standards and 
specifications for a particular practice for which the technical service 
provider is certified, or the provision of

[[Page 463]]

technical services for which the technical service provider is not 
certified; and
    (c) Any other cause of a serious or compelling nature as determined 
by NRCS that demonstrates the technical service provider's inability to 
fulfill the terms of the Certification Agreement in providing technical 
service.


<R05>
Sec. 652.33  Notice of proposed decertification.

    The State Conservationist will send by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, to the technical service provider proposed for 
decertification a written Notice of Proposed Decertification, which will 
contain the cause(s) for decertification, as well as any documentation 
supporting decertification. In cases where a private sector entity or 
public agency is being notified of a proposed decertification, any 
certified individuals working under the auspices of such organization 
who are also being considered for decertification will receive a 
separate Notice of Decertification and will be afforded separate appeal 
rights following the process set forth below.


<R05>
Sec. 652.34  Opportunity to contest decertification.

    To contest decertification, the technical service provider must 
submit in writing to the State Conservationist, within 20 calendar days 
from the date of receipt of the Notice of Proposed Decertification, the 
reasons why the State Conservationist should not decertify, including 
any mitigating factors as well as any supporting documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 652.35  State Conservationist decision.

    Within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice of proposed 
decertification, the State Conservationist will issue a written 
determination. If the State Conservationist decides to decertify, the 
decision will set forth the reasons for decertification, the period of 
decertification, and the scope of decertification. If the State 
Conservationist decides not to decertify the technical service provider, 
the technical service provider will be given written notice of that 
determination. The decertification determination will be based on an 
administrative record, which will be comprised of: The Notice of 
Proposed Decertification and supporting documents, and, if submitted, 
the technical service provider's written response and supporting 
documentation. Both a copy of the decision and administrative record 
will be sent promptly by certified mail, return receipt requested, to 
the technical service provider.


<R05>
Sec. 652.36  Appeals of decertification decisions.

    (a) Within 20 calendar days from the date of receipt of the State 
Conservationist's decertification determination, the technical service 
provider may appeal, in writing, to the Chief of NRCS. The written 
appeal must state the reasons for appeal and any arguments in support of 
those reasons. If the technical service provider fails to appeal, the 
decision of the State Conservationist is final.
    (b) Final decision. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the 
technical service provider's written appeal, the Chief or his designee, 
will make a final determination, in writing, based upon the 
administrative record and any additional information submitted to the 
Chief by the technical service provider. The decision of the Chief, or 
his designee, is final and not subject to further administrative review. 
The Chief's determination will include the reasons for decertification, 
the period of decertification, and the scope of decertification.


<R05>
Sec. 652.37  Period of decertification.

    The period of decertification will not exceed three years in 
duration and will be decided by the decertifying official, either the 
State Conservationist or Chief, as applicable, based upon their weighing 
of all relevant facts and the seriousness of the reasons for 
decertification, mitigating factors, if any, and the following general 
guidelines:
    (a) For failures in the provision of technical service for which 
there are no mitigating factors, e.g., no remedial action by the 
technical service provider, a maximum period of three years 
decertification;
    (b) For repeated failures in the provision of technical assistance 
for which

[[Page 464]]

there are mitigating factors, e.g., the technical service provider has 
taken remedial action to the satisfaction of NRCS, a maximum period of 
one to two years decertification; and
    (c) For a violation of certification agreement terms, e.g, failure 
to possess technical competency for a listed practice, a period of one 
year or less, if the technical service provider can master such 
competency within a year period.


<R05>
Sec. 652.38  Scope of decertification.

    (a) When the technical service provider is a private sector entity 
or public agency, the decertifying official may decertify the entire 
organization, including all the individuals identified as authorized to 
provide technical services under the auspices of such organization. The 
decertifying official may also limit the scope of decertification, for 
example, to one or more specifically named individuals identified as 
authorized to provide technical services under the organization's 
auspices or to an organizational element of such private sector entity 
or public agency. The scope of decertification will be set forth in the 
decertification determination and will be based upon the facts of each 
decertification action, including whether actions of particular 
individuals can be imputed to the larger organization.
    (b) In cases where specific individuals are decertified only, an 
entity or public agency must promptly file an amended Certification 
Agreement removing the decertified individual(s) from the Certification 
Agreement. In addition, the entity or public agency must demonstrate, to 
the satisfaction of the State Conservationist, that the entity or public 
agency has taken affirmative steps to ensure that the circumstances 
resulting in decertification have been addressed.


<R05>
Sec. 652.39  Mitigating factors.

    In considering whether to decertify, the period of decertification, 
and scope of decertification, the deciding official will take into 
consideration any mitigating factors. Examples of mitigating factors 
include, but are not limited to the following:
    (a) The technical service provider worked, in a timely manner, to 
correct any deficiencies in the provision of technical service;
    (b) The technical service provider took the initiative to bring any 
deficiency in the provision of their technical services to the attention 
of NRCS and sought NRCS advice to remediate the situation; and
    (c) The technical service provider took affirmative steps to prevent 
any failures in the provision of technical services from occurring in 
the future.


<R05>
Sec. 652.40  Effect of decertification.

    (a) The Department will not make payment under a program contract 
for the technical services of a decertified technical service provider 
that were provided during the period of decertification. Likewise, NRCS 
will not procure the services of a decertified technical service 
provider during the period of decertification.
    (b) National decertification list. NRCS will maintain a list of 
decertified technical service providers. NRCS will remove decertified 
providers from the list of certified providers. Program participants 
must not knowingly hire a decertified technical service provider. It is 
the program participant's responsibility to check the decertified list 
before hiring a technical service provider. Decertification of a 
technical service provider in one State decertifies the technical 
service provider from providing technical services under current 
programs in all States, the Caribbean Area, and the Pacific Basin Area.


<R05>
Sec. 652.41  Effect of filing deadlines.

    A technical service provider's failure to meet the filing deadlines 
under this subpart will result in the forfeiture of appeal rights. All 
filings must be received by NRCS no later than the close of business (5 
p.m.) the last day of the filing period.


<R05>
Sec. 652.42  Recertification.

    A decertified technical service provider may apply to be re-
certified under the certification provisions of this part after the 
period of decertification has expired. A technical service provider may 
not utilize the certification renewal process in an attempt to be 
recertified after being decertified.

            Subpart B--Federal Financially-Assisted Projects


<R05>
Sec. 654.10  Operation and maintenance agreement.

    A duly authorized official of the sponsor(s) must execute an O&M 
agreement with NRCS prior to NRCS furnishing financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 654.11  Sponsor(s)' responsibility.

    (a) On non-Federal land, sponsor(s) are responsible for financing 
and performing without cost to the Federal Government, needed operation 
and maintenance (O&M) of project measures installed with Federal 
financial assistance.
    (b) The Federal agency administering Federal land involving project 
measures is responsible either for performing or requiring the 
performance of O&M on land administered by that agency. If project 
measures benefit both Federal and non-Federal land or interests, the O&M 
may be performed by the Federal agency, the sponsor(s), or both as 
mutually agreed by the Federal agency, sponsor(s), and NRCS. If O&M of 
project measures is performed by mutual agreement, the cost of O&M may 
be shared by the Federal agency and sponsor(s) as agreed.
    (c) The sponsor(s) shall obtain NRCS approval before modifying a 
project measure of changing land use to fulfill a different purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 654.12  Financing operations and maintenance.

    Sources of funds needed to operate and maintain project measures for 
the duration of the O&M agreement shall be identified in the watershed 
or RC&D measure plan.


<R05>
Sec. 654.13  Designating responsibility for operation and maintenance.

    Those organizations or agencies responsible for the O&M of each 
project measure shall be identified in the watershed or RC&D measure 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 654.14  Duration of sponsor(s)' responsibility.

    (a) Sponsor(s)' responsibility for O&M of a completed project 
measure begins when a part of all of the contract installing such 
measure is completed and accepted from the contractor. If the 
installation of the project measure is performed by force account, 
division of work, or performance of work methods, the sponsor(s)' O&M 
responsibilities begin on the date the work or portion thereof is 
completed as determined by NRCS, except for completed work located on 
Federal lands which are subject to special-use permits. The O&M 
agreement shall specify that O&M will continue through: (1) The 
evaluated life of the project, or (2) the evaluated life of measures 
that are economically evaluated as a unit, or (3) the useful life of 
cost-shared measures that are for land conservation or land utilization. 
The sponsor(s)' duties and liabilities for the measures under other 
Federal and State laws are not affected by the expiration of the O&M 
agreement.
    (b) For project measures being installed in segments, the sponsor(s) 
shall be responsible for O&M of completed and accepted segments. 
However, the NRCS may share in the cost of repairing damages to a 
completed segment when the damage is attributed to the continuation of 
work on uncompleted segments of the measure or when due to the fact that 
the measure was only partially completed.


<R05>
Sec. 654.15  Operation and maintenance.

    Sponsor(s) are to operate and maintain completed project measures 
in:
    (a) Compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, 
regulations, and ordinances.
    (b) Compliance with any applicable conditions set forth in the 
instruments by which the landrights were acquired for installing, 
operating, and maintaining the project measures.
    (c) A manner that will not significantly degrade the environment and 
will permit project measures to serve the purpose for which they were 
installed as set forth in the watershed or RC&D measure plan.
    (d) Compliance with the time frames and O&M work items established 
in the plan of O&M and inspection reports.
    (e) Accordance with agreements with NRCS on admission charges and 
user fees for public recreation and/or fish and wildlife facility. 
Admission or user fees shall be charged only as necessary

[[Page 468]]

to produce revenues required to amortize the sponsor(s)' share of 
installation costs and to provide adequate O&M for that portion of the 
project measures pertaining to public recreation and/or fish and 
wildlife facility. Sponsor(s)' admission or user fee charges require 
prior NRCS approval throughout the life of the O&M agreement.
    (f) Accordance with the schedule for withdrawal of water in water 
impounding structures as specified in the watershed or RC&D measure plan 
or other legal documents.
    (g) A manner consistent with the project objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 654.16  Property management.

    Sponsor(s) are to:
    (a) Use real property acquired in whole or in part with Federal 
funds as long as needed for the purpose for which it was acquired and in 
accordance with the O&M agreement. If real property acquired in whole or 
in part with Federal funds is no longer needed for the purpose for which 
it was acquired, the sponsor(s) shall obtain NRCS approval for future 
use or disposition.
    (b) Use nonexpendable personal property acquired in whole or in part 
with Federal funds as long as needed for the purpose for which it was 
acquired in accordance with the rules governing Federal grant property 
(34 CFR part 256).
    (c) Establish, adopt, and comply with a property management system 
which meets the standards governing Federal grant property.


<R05>
Sec. 654.17  Inspection.

    (a) Sponsor(s) are to make periodic and special inspections of 
installed project measures as provided in the plan of O&M. For 
structural measures, inspections are to be made at least annually and 
after each major storm or occurrence of any unusual condition that might 
adversely affect the project measures. At the discretion of the State 
Conservationist, NRCS may assist sponsor(s) with their inspections. NRCS 
or land-administering agencies may make independent inspections at any 
time during the period covered by the O&M agreement.
    (b) Sponsor(s) are to maintain a written record of each inspection 
and furnish NRCS and land-administering agencies a copy of that record. 
The record should indentify items inspected, O&M work that may be 
needed, a time frame to do the work, and the date of the inspection. The 
NRCS and land-administering agencies will provide the sponsor(s) a copy 
of a similar record of independent inspections.
    (c) The sponsor(s) shall perform the O&M work listed as needed in 
the inspection reports within the time frame established for each item 
of work. Failure to perform O&M work will be considered a violation of 
the O&M agreement and will be handled in accordance with Sec. 654.20.
    (d) Sponsor(s) are to maintain a written record of work performed 
which is listed in the inspection report and a record of other 
significant O&M activity. The record will identify the measure, item of 
work, cost of performance, and date completed.
    (e) Sponsor(s)' records relative to the project shall be made 
available to NRCS for examination.


<R05>
Sec. 654.18  Natural Resources Conservation Service responsibility.

    The Natural Resources Conservation Service will assist the 
sponsor(s) in developing a watershed or RC&D measure plan which includes 
a description of O&M work and estimated cost, assist in the preparation 
of O&M agreements and plans of O&M, enter into O&M agreements with the 
sponsor(s), and notify the sponsor(s) of observed failures to comply 
with the O&M agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 654.19  Plan of operation and maintenance.

    (a) The plan for O&M shall be incorporated into and made a part of 
the O&M agreement. A separate plan of O&M shall be prepared for each 
project measure that is expected to a have a unique O&M need. Two or 
more measures with similar O&M needs may be included in a single plan 
for O&M.
    (b) The plan of O&M shall include the known and anticipated items of 
O&M, an explanation of how the O&M activities may be carried out, a 
general time frame for making O&M inspections and

[[Page 469]]

for completing the needed O&M work, and the records and reports deemed 
appropriate by the sponsor(s) and NRCS.


<R05>
Sec. 654.20  Violations of operation and maintenance agreement.

    (a) The State Conservationist shall investigate alleged sponsor 
violations of the O&M agreement. If the State Conservationist determines 
that a violation has occurred that may prevent the project measure from 
functioning as intended, create a health or safety hazard, or prevent 
the accrual of project benefits, he shall provide sponsor(s) written 
notification.
    (b) If the sponsor(s) fail to comply with the O&M agreement or fail 
to take corrective action, NRCS may notify authorities having 
appropriate jurisdiction, withhold further assistance to the project, 
require the sponsor(s) to reimburse the government for the NRCS share of 
the cost of the project, and/or pursue other action authorized by the 
O&M agreement or law.


<R04>
                   Subpart C--Conservation Operations


<R05>
Sec. 654.30  Responsibility for operation and maintenance.

    The land user is responsible for O&M of soil and water conservation 
measures installed with NRCS assistance provided through soil, water, 
and other conservation districts.


<R05>
Sec. 654.31  Performing operation and maintenance.

    The method of performing O&M is to be at the option of the land 
user. The NRCS, working through districts, will furnish information and 
technical assistance as needed and requested to the extent NRCS 
resources permit.


<R04>
                Subpart D--Emergency Watershed Protection


<R05>
Sec. 654.40  Responsibility for operation and maintenance.

    (a) Non-Federal lands. The need for an O&M agreement will be 
determined by the State Conservationist. Where an O&M agreement is 
necessary, the sponsor(s) will provide the O&M and adopt standards for 
Federal grant property (34 CFR part 256). Where no O&M agreement is 
necessary, other arrangements will be made for complying with Federal 
property management.
    (b) Federal lands. The Federal agency administering the Federal land 
is responsible for operating and maintaining emergency measures 
installed on Federal land.


<R05>
Sec. 654.41  Performance of operation and maintenance.

    (a) Arrangement. O&M is a prerequisite for approval of Federal 
emergency assistance when:
    (1) The emergency measure needs to be operated and maintained in 
order to serve its intended purpose, or
    (2) The emergency measure needs to be operated and maintained to 
insure that it will not become hazardous.
    (b) Time of operation and maintenance. The sponsor(s)' obligations 
for O&M begin when the measure is installed and extend for the duration 
of the time required for the emergency measure to serve the purpose for 
which it is installed.
    (c) Performance. Operation and maintenance is to be performed in a 
manner that will protect the environment and otherwise comply with NRCS, 
State, and local requirements. The method of performing O&M is at the 
option of the sponsor(s).

<R05>
Sec. 656.2  Archeological and historical laws and Executive orders applicable to NRCS-assisted programs.

    (a) The Act of June 27, 1960, relating to the preservation of 
historical and archeological data, Pub. L. 86-523, 74 Stat. 220, as 
amended May 24, 1974; Pub. L. 93-291, 88 Stat. 174 (16 U.S.C. 469 et 
seq.), provides for the preservation of historical and archeological 
materials or data, including relics and specimens, that might otherwise 
be lost or destroyed as a result of any Federal or federally-assisted or 
licensed project, activity, or program.
    (b) The National Historic Preservation Act, Pub. L. 89-665, 80 Stat. 
915, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), authorizes the Secretary of 
the Interior to maintain and expand a National Register of Historic 
Places (NRHP), including historic districts, sites, buildings, 
structures, and objects that are significant in American history, 
architecture, archeology, and culture. This law also establishes the 
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), to be appointed by the 
President. Section 106 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 470f), requires that prior 
to the approval of any Federal or federally-assisted or licensed 
undertaking, the Federal agency shall afford the ACHP a reasonable 
opportunity to comment, if properties listed in or eligible for listing

Sec. 656.3  Policy.

    (a) NRCS recognizes that significant historical, archeological, and 
architectural resources are an important part of our national heritage, 
the protection of which requires careful consideration in this agency's 
project planning and implementation process.
    (b) NRCS will take reasonable precautions to avoid damaging any 
significant historic, cultural, or natural aspects of our national 
heritage and will work with the National Park Service (NPS) and the 
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) in identifying and 
seeking to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of NRCS-assisted projects 
on the Nation's significant cultural resources. The procedures contained 
in this part have been developed to comply with sections 1(3) and 2(c)

<R04>
                Subpart A--Important Farmlands Inventory


<R05>
Sec. 657.1  Purpose.

    NRCS is concerned about any action that tends to impair the 
productive capacity of American agriculture. The Nation needs to know 
the extent and location of the best land for producing food, feed, fiber 
forage, and oilseed crops. In addition to prime and unique farmlands, 
farmlands that are of statewide and local importance for producing these 
crops also need to be identified.


<R05>
Sec. 657.2  Policy.

    It is NRCS policy to make and keep current an inventory of the prime 
farmland and unique farmland of the Nation. This inventory is to be 
carried out in cooperation with other interested agencies at the 
National, State, and local levels of government. The objective of the 
inventory is to identify the extent and location of important rural 
lands needed to produce food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops.


<R05>
Sec. 657.3  Applicability.

    Inventories made under this memorandum do not constitute a 
designation of any land area to a specific land use. Such designations 
are the responsibility of appropriate local and State officials.


<R05>
Sec. 657.4  NRCS responsibilities.

    (a) State Conservationist. Each NRCS State Conservationist is to:
    (1) Provide leadership for inventories of important farmlands for 
the State, county, or other subdivision of the State. Each is to work 
with appropriate agencies of State government and others to establish 
priorities for making these inventories.
    (2) Identify the soil mapping units within the State that qualify as 
prime. In doing this, State Conservationists, in consultation with the 
cooperators of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, have the 
flexibility to make local deviation from the permeability criterion or 
to be more restrictive for other specific criteria in order to assure 
the most accurate identification of prime farmlands for a State. Each is 
to invite representatives of the Governor's office, agencies of the 
State government, and others to identify farmlands of statewide 
importance and unique farmlands that are to be inventoried within the 
framework of this memorandum.
    (3) Prepare a statewide list of:
    (i) Soil mapping units that meet the criteria for prime farmland;
    (ii) Soil mapping units that are farmlands of statewide importance 
if the criteria used were based on soil information; and
    (iii) Specific high-value food and fiber crops that are grown and, 
when combined with other favorable factors, qualify lands to meet the 
criteria for unique farmlands. Copies are to be furnished to NRCS Field 
Offices and to National Soil Survey Center. (see 7 CFR 600.2(c), 600.6)
    (4) Coordinate soil mapping units that qualify as prime farmlands 
with adjacent States, including Major Land Resource Area Offices (see 7 
CFR 600.4, 600.7) responsible for the soil series. Since farmlands of 
statewide importance and unique farmlands are designated by others at 
the State level, the soil mapping units and areas identified need not be 
coordinated among States.
    (5) Instruct NRCS District Conservationists to arrange local review 
of lands identified as prime, unique, and additional farmlands of 
statewide importance by Conservation Districts and representatives of 
local agencies. This review is to determine if additional farmland 
should be identified to meet local decisionmaking needs.
    (6) Make and publish each important farmland inventory on a base map 
of national map accuracy at an intermediate scale of 1:50,000 or 
1:100,000. State Conservationists who need base maps of other scales are 
to submit their requests with justification to the Chief for 
consideration.
    (b) National Soil Survey Center. The National Soil Survey Center is 
to provide requested technical assistance to State Conservationists and 
Major Land Resource Area Offices in inventorying prime and unique 
farmlands (see 7 CFR 600.2(c)(1), 600.4, 600.7). This includes reviewing 
statewide lists of soil mapping units that meet the criteria for prime 
farmlands and resolving coordination

[[Page 472]]

problems that may occur among States for specific soil series or soil 
mapping units.
    (c) National Office. The Deputy Chief for Soil Survey and Resource 
Assessment (see 7 CFR 600.2(b)(3)) is to provide national leadership in 
preparing guidelines for inventorying prime farmlands and for national 
statistics and reports of prime farmlands.

[43 FR 4031, Jan. 31, 1978, as amended at 65 FR 57538, Sept. 25, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 657.5  Identification of important farmlands.

    (a) Prime farmlands--(1) General. Prime farmland is land that has 
the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for 
producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops, and is also 
available for these uses (the land could be cropland, pastureland, 
rangeland, forest land, or other land, but not urban built-up land or 
water). It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply 
needed to economically produce sustained high yields of crops when 
treated and managed, including water management, according to acceptable 
farming methods. In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and 
dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable 
temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity, 
acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are 
permeable to water and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible 
or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do 
not flood frequently or are protected from flooding. Examples of soils 
that qualify as prime farmland are Palouse silt loam, 0 to 7 percent 
slopes; Brookston silty clay loam, drained; and Tama silty clay loam, 0 
to 5 percent slopes.
    (2) Specific criteria. Prime farmlands meet all the following 
criteria: Terms used in this section are defined in USDA publications: 
``Soil Taxonomy, Agriculture Handbook 436''; ``Soil Survey Manual, 
Agriculture Handbook 18''; ``Rainfall-erosion Losses From Cropland, 
Agriculture Handbook 282''; ``Wind Erosion Forces in the United States 
and Their Use in Predicting Soil Loss, Agriculture Handbook 346''; and 
``Saline and Alkali Soils, Agriculture Handbook 60.''
    (i) The soils have:
    (A) Aquic, udic, ustic, or xeric moisture regimes and sufficient 
available water capacity within a depth of 40 inches (1 meter), or in 
the root zone (root zone is the part of the soil that is penetrated or 
can be penetrated by plant roots) if the root zone is less than 40 
inches deep, to produce the commonly grown cultivated crops (cultivated 
crops include, but are not limited to, grain, forage, fiber, oilseed, 
sugar beets, sugarcane, vegetables, tobacco, orchard, vineyard, and bush 
fruit crops) adapted to the region in 7 or more years out of 10; or
    (B) Xeric or ustic moisture regimes in which the available water 
capacity is limited, but the area has a developed irrigation water 
supply that is dependable (a dependable water supply is one in which 
enough water is available for irrigation in 8 out of 10 years for the 
crops commonly grown) and of adequate quality; or,
    (C) Aridic or torric moisture regimes and the area has a developed 
irrigation water supply that is dependable and of adequate quality; and,
    (ii) The soils have a temperature regime that is frigid, mesic, 
thermic, or hyperthermic (pergelic and cryic regimes are excluded). 
These are soils that, at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm), have a mean 
annual temperature higher than 32 deg. F (0 deg. C). In addition, the 
mean summer temperature at this depth in soils with an O horizon is 
higher than 47 deg. F (8 deg. C); in soils that have no O horizon, the 
mean summer temperature is higher than 59 deg. F (15 deg. C); and,
    (iii) The soils have a pH between 4.5 and 8.4 in all horizons within 
a depth of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is 
less than 40 inches deep; and,
    (iv) The soils either have no water table or have a water table that 
is maintained at a sufficient depth during the cropping season to allow 
cultivated crops common to the area to be grown; and,
    (v) The soils can be managed so that, in all horizons within a depth 
of 40 inches (1 meter) or in the root zone if the root zone is less than 
40 inches

[[Page 473]]

deep, during part of each year the conductivity of the saturation 
extract is less than 4 mmhos/cm and the exchangeable sodium percentage 
(ESP) is less than 15; and,
    (vi) The soils are not flooded frequently during the growing season 
(less often than once in 2 years); and,
    (vii) The product of K (erodibility factor) x percent slope is less 
than 2.0, and the product of I (soils erodibility) x C (climatic factor) 
does not exceed 60; and
    (viii) The soils have a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch 
(0.15 cm) per hour in the upper 20 inches (50 cm) and the mean annual 
soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches (50 cm) is less than 59 deg. F 
(15 deg. C); the permeability rate is not a limiting factor if the mean 
annual soil temperature is 59 deg. F (15 deg. C) or higher; and,
    (ix) Less than 10 percent of the surface layer (upper 6 inches) in 
these soils consists of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches (7.6 cm).
    (b) Unique farmland--(1) General. Unique farmland is land other than 
prime farmland that is used for the production of specific high value 
food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality, 
location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to economically 
produce sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop 
when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. 
Examples of such crops are citrus, tree nuts, olives, cranberries, 
fruit, and vegetables.
    (2) Specific characteristics of unique farmland. (i) Is used for a 
specific high-value food or fiber crop; (ii) Has a moisture supply that 
is adequate for the specific crop; the supply is from stored moisture, 
precipitation, or a developed-irrigation system; (iii) Combines 
favorable factors of soil quality, growing season, temperature, 
humidity, air drainage, elevation, aspect, or other conditions, such a 
nearness to market, that favor the growth of a specific food or fiber 
crop.
    (c) Additional farmland of statewide importance. This is land, in 
addition to prime and unique farmlands, that is of statewide importance 
for the production of food, feed, fiber, forage, and oil seed crops. 
Criteria for defining and delineating this land are to be determined by 
the appropriate State agency or agencies. Generally, additional 
farmlands of statewide importance include those that are nearly prime 
farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated 
and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as 
high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. In some 
States, additonal farmlands of statewide importance may include tracts 
of land that have been designated for agriculture by State law.
    (d) Additional farmland of local importance. In some local areas 
there is concern for certain additional farmlands for the production of 
food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops, even though these lands 
are not identified as having national or statewide importance. Where 
appropriate, these lands are to be identified by the local agency or 
agencies concerned. In places, additional farmlands of local importance 
may include tracts of land that have been designated for agriculture by 
local ordinance.

Sec. 658.1  Purpose.

    This part sets out the criteria developed by the Secretary of 
Agriculture, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, pursuant to 
section 1541(a) of the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA or the Act) 
7 U.S.C. 4202(a). As required by section 1541(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 
4202(b), Federal agencies are (a) to use the criteria to identify and 
take into account the adverse effects of their programs on the 
preservation of farmland, (b) to consider alternative

[[Page 474]]

actions, as appropriate, that could lessen adverse effects, and (c) to 
ensure that their programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible 
with State and units of local government and private programs and 
policies to protect farmland. Guidelines to assist agencies in using the 
criteria are included in this part. The Department of Agriculture 
(hereinafter USDA) may make available to States, units of local 
government, individuals, organizations, and other units of the Federal 
Government, information useful in restoring, maintaining, and improving 
the quantity and quality of farmland.


<R05>
Sec. 658.2  Definitions.

    (a) Farmland means prime or unique farmlands as defined in section 
1540(c)(1) of the Act or farmland that is determined by the appropriate 
state or unit of local government agency or agencies with concurrence of 
the Secretary to be farmland of statewide of local importance. 
``Farmland'' does not include land already in or committed to urban 
development or water storage. Farmland ``already in'' urban development 
or water storage includes all such land with a density of 30 structures 
per 40-acre area. Farmland already in urban development also includes 
lands identified as ``urbanized area'' (UA) on the Census Bureau Map, or 
as urban area mapped with a ``tint overprint'' on the USGS topographical 
maps, or as ``urban-built-up'' on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. 
Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not 
``farmland'' and, therefore, are not subject to the Act. Farmland 
``committed to urban development or water storage'' includes all such 
land that receives a combined score of 160 points or less from the land 
evaluation and site assessment criteria.
    (b) Federal agency means a department, agency, independent 
commission, or other unit of the Federal Government.
    (c) Federal program means those activities or responsibilities of a 
Federal agency that involve undertaking, financing, or assisting 
construction or improvement projects or acquiring, managing, or 
disposing of Federal lands and facilities.
    (1) The term ``Federal program'' does not include:
    (i) Federal permitting, licensing, or rate approval programs for 
activities on private or non-Federal lands; and
    (ii) Construction or improvement projects that were beyond the 
planning stage and were in either the active design or construction 
state on August 4, 1984.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, a project is considered to be 
``beyond the planning stage and in either the active design or 
construction state on August 4, 1984'' if, on or before that date, 
actual construction of the project had commenced or:
    (i) Acquisition of land or easements for the project had occurred or 
all required Federal agency planning documents and steps were completed 
and accepted, endorsed, or approved by the appropriate agency;
    (ii) A final environmental impact statement was filed with the 
Environmental Protection Agency or an environmental assessment was 
completed and a finding of no significant impact was executed by the 
appropriate agency official; and
    (iii) The engineering or architectural design had begun or such 
services had been secured by contract. The phrase ``undertaking, 
financing, or assisting construction or improvement projects'' includes 
providing loan guarantees or loan insurance for such projects and 
includes the acquisition, management and disposal of land or facilities 
that a Federal agency obtains as the result of foreclosure or other 
actions taken under a loan or other financial assistance provided by the 
agency directly and specifically for that property. For the purposes of 
this section, the phrase ``acquiring, managing, or disposing of Federal 
lands and facilities'' refers to lands and facilities that are acquired, 
managed, or used by a Federal agency specifically in support of a 
Federal activity or program, such as national parks, national forests, 
or military bases, and does not refer to lands and facilities that are 
acquired by a Federal agency as the incidental result of actions by the 
agency that give the agency temporary custody or ownership of the lands 
or facilities, such as

[[Page 475]]

acquisition pursuant to a lien for delinquent taxes, the exercise of 
conservatorship or receivership authority, or the exercise of civil or 
criminal law enforcement forfeiture or seizure authority.
    (d) State or local government policies or programs to protect 
farmland include: Zoning to protect farmland; agricultural land 
protection provisions of a comprehensive land use plan which has been 
adopted or reviewed in its entirety by the unit of local government in 
whose jurisdiction it is operative within 10 years preceding proposed 
implementation of the particular Federal program; completed purchase or 
acquisition of development rights; completed purchase or acquisition of 
conservation easements; prescribed procedures for assessing agricultural 
viability of sites proposed for conversion; completed agricultural 
districting and capital investments to protect farmland.
    (e) Private programs to protect farmland means programs for the 
protection of farmland which are pursuant to and consistent with State 
and local government policies or programs to protect farmland of the 
affected State and unit of local government, but which are operated by a 
nonprofit corporation, foundation, association, conservancy, district, 
or other not-for-profit organization existing under State or Federal 
laws. Private programs to protect farmland may include: (1) Acquiring 
and holding development rights in farmland and (2) facilitating the 
transfer of development rights of farmland.
    (f) Site means the location(s) that would be converted by the 
proposed action(s).
    (g) Unit of local government means the government of a county, 
municipality, town, township, village, or other unit of general 
government below the State level, or a combination of units of local 
government acting through an areawide agency under a State law or an 
agreement for the formulation of regional development policies and 
plans.

Sec. 658.3  Applicability and exemptions.

    (a) Section 1540(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4201(b), states that the 
purpose of the Act is to minimize the extent to which Federal programs 
contribute to the unnecessary and irreversible conversion of farmland to 
nonagricultural uses. Conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses 
does not include the construction of on-farm structures necessary for 
farm operations. Federal agencies can obtain assistance from USDA in 
determining whether a proposed location or site meets the Act's 
definition of farmland. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service 
(NRCS) field office serving the area will provide the assistance. Many 
State or local government planning offices can also provide this 
assistance.
    (b) Acquisition or use of farmland by a Federal agency for national 
defense purposes is exempted by section 1547(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 
4208(b).
    (c) The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal 
Government in any way to regulate the use of private or non-Federal 
land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. 
In cases where either a private party or a non-Federal unit of 
government applies for Federal assistance to convert farmland to a 
nonagricultural use, the Federal agency should use the criteria set 
forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse effects 
on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions 
that would avoid or mitigate such adverse effects. If, after 
consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the 
landowners want to proceed with conversion, the Federal agency, on the 
basis of the analysis set forth in Sec. 658.4 and any agency policies or 
procedures for implementing the Act, may provide or deny the requested 
assistance. Only assistance and actions that would convert farmland to 
nonagricultural uses are subject to this Act. Assistance and actions 
related to the purchase, maintenance, renovation, or replacement of 
existing structures and sites converted prior to the time of an 
application for assistance from a Federal agency, including assistance 
and actions related to the construction of minor new ancillary 
structures (such as garages or sheds), are not subject to the Act.
    (d) Section 1548 of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 4209, states that 
the Act

[[Page 476]]

shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any action, either legal or 
equitable, by any person or class of persons challenging a Federal 
project, program, or other activity that may affect farmland. Neither 
the Act nor this rule, therefore, shall afford any basis for such an 
action. However, as further provided in section 1548, the governor of an 
affected state, where a state policy or program exists to protect 
farmland, may bring an action in the Federal district court of the 
district where a Federal program is proposed to enforce the requirements 
of section 1541 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202, and regulations issued 
pursuant to that section.

<R05>
Sec. 658.4  Guidelines for use of criteria.

    As stated above and as provided in the Act, each Federal agency 
shall use the criteria provided in Sec. 658.5 to identify and take into 
account the adverse effects of Federal programs on the protection of 
farmland. The agencies are to consider alternative actions, as 
appropriate, that could lessen such adverse effects, and assure that 
such Federal programs, to the extent practicable, are compatible with 
State, unit of local government and private programs and policies to 
protect farmland. The following are guidelines to assist the agencies in 
these tasks:
    (a) An agency may determine whether or not a site is farmland as 
defined in Sec. 658.2(a) or the agency may request that NRCS make such a 
determination. If an agency elects not to make its own determination, it 
should make a request to NRCS on Form AD-1006, the Farmland Conversion 
Impact Rating Form, available at NRCS offices, for determination of 
whether the site is farmland subject to the Act. If neither the entire 
site nor any part of it are subject to the Act, then the Act will not 
apply and NRCS will so notify the agency. If the site is determined by 
NRCS to be subject to the Act, then NRCS will measure the relative value 
of the site as farmland on a scale of 0 to 100 according to the 
information sources listed in Sec. 658.5(a). NRCS will respond to these 
requests within 10 working days of their receipt except that in cases 
where a site visit or land evaluation system design is needed, NRCS will 
respond in 30 working days. In the event that NRCS fails to complete its 
response within the required period, if further delay would interfere 
with construction activities, the agency should proceed as though the 
site were not farmland.
    (b) The Form AD 1006, returned to the agency by NRCS will also 
include the following incidental information: The total amount of 
farmable land (the land in the unit of local government's jurisdiction 
that is capable of producing the commonly grown crop); the percentage of 
the jurisdiction that is farmland covered by the Act; the percentage of 
farmland in the jurisdiction that the project would convert; and the 
percentage of farmland in the local government's jurisdiction with the 
same or higher relative value than the land that the project would 
convert. These statistics will not be part of the criteria scoring 
process, but are intended simply to furnish additional background 
information to Federal agencies to aid them in considering the effects 
of their projects on farmland.
    (c) After the agency receives from NRCS the score of a site's 
relative value as described in Sec. 658.4(a) and then applies the site 
assessment criteria which are set forth in Sec. 658.5 (b) and (c), the 
agency will assign to the site a combined score of up to 260 points, 
composed of up to 100 points for relative value and up to 160 points for 
the site assessment. With this score the agency will be able to identify 
the effect of its programs on farmland, and make a determination as to 
the suitability of the site for protection as farmland. Once this score 
is computed, USDA recommends:
    (1) Sites with the highest combined scores be regarded as most 
suitable for protection under these criteria and sites with the lowest 
scores, as least suitable.
    (2) Sites receiving a total score of less than 160 need not be given 
further consideration for protection and no additional sites need to be 
evaluated.
    (3) Sites receiving scores totaling 160 or more be given 
increasingly higher levels of consideration for protection.
    (4) When making decisions on proposed actions for sites receiving 
scores

[[Page 477]]

totaling 160 or more, agency personnel consider:
    (i) Use of land that is not farmland or use of existing structures;
    (ii) Alternative sites, locations and designs that would serve the 
proposed purpose but convert either fewer acres of farmland or other 
farmland that has a lower relative value;
    (iii) Special siting requirements of the proposed project and the 
extent to which an alternative site fails to satisfy the special siting 
requirements as well as the originally selected site.
    (d) Federal agencies may elect to assign the site assessment 
criteria relative weightings other than those shown in Sec. 658.5 (b) 
and (c). If an agency elects to do so, USDA recommends that the agency 
adopt its alternative weighting system (1) through rulemaking in 
consultation with USDA, and (2) as a system to be used uniformly 
throughout the agency. USDA recommends that the weightings stated in 
Sec. 658.5 (b) and (c) be used until an agency issues a final rule to 
change the weightings.
    (e) It is advisable that evaluations and analyses of prospective 
farmland conversion impacts be made early in the planning process before 
a site or design is selected, and that, where possible, agencies make 
the FPPA evaluations part of the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) process. Under the agency's own NEPA regulations, some categories 
of projects may be excluded from NEPA which may still be covered under 
the FPPA. Section 1540(c)(4) of the Act exempts projects that were 
beyond the planning stage and were in either the active design or 
construction state on the effective date of the Act. Section 1547(b) 
exempts acquisition or use of farmland for national defense purposes. 
There are no other exemptions of projects by category in the Act.
    (f) Numerous States and units of local government are developing and 
adopting Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) systems to evaluate 
the productivity of agricultural land and its suitability for conversion 
to nonagricultural use. Therefore, States and units of local government 
may have already performed an evaluation using criteria similar to those 
contained in this rule applicable to Federal agencies. USDA recommends 
that where sites are to be evaluated within a jurisdiction having a 
State or local LESA system that has been approved by the governing body 
of such jurisdiction and has been placed on the NRCS State 
conservationist's list as one which meets the purpose of the FPPA in 
balance with other public policy objectives, Federal agencies use that 
system to make the evaluation.
    (g) To meet reporting requirements of section 1546 of the Act, 7 
U.S.C. 4207, and for data collection purposes, after the agency has made 
a final decision on a project in which one or more of the alternative 
sites contain farmland subject to the FPPA, the agency is requested to 
return a copy of the Form AD-1006, which indicates the final decision of 
the agency, to the NRCS field office.
    (h) Once a Federal agency has performed an analysis under the FPPA 
for the conversion of a site, that agency's, or a second Federal 
agency's determination with regard to additional assistance or actions 
on the same site do not require additional redundant FPPA analysis.

Sec. 658.5  Criteria.

    This section states the criteria required by section 1541(a) of the 
Act, 7 U.S.C. 4202(a). The criteria were developed by the Secretary of 
Agriculture in cooperation with other Federal agencies. They are in two 
parts, (1) the land evaluation criterion, relative value, for which NRCS 
will provide the rating or score, and (2) the site assessment criteria, 
for which each Federal agency must develop its own ratings or scores. 
The criteria are as follows:
    (a) Land Evaluation Criterion--Relative Value. The land evaluation 
criterion is based on information from several sources including 
national cooperative soil surveys or other acceptable soil surveys, NRCS 
field office technical guides, soil potential ratings or soil 
productivity ratings, land capability classifications, and important 
farmland determinations. Based on this information, groups of soils 
within a local government's jurisdiction will be

[[Page 478]]

evaluated and assigned a score between 0 to 100, representing the 
relative value, for agricultural production, of the farmland to be 
converted by the project compared to other farmland in the same local 
government jurisdiction, This score will be the Relative Value Rating on 
Form AD 1006.
    (b) Site Assessment Criteria. Federal agencies are to use the 
following criteria to assess the suitability of each proposed site or 
design alternative for protection as farmland along with the score from 
the land evaluation criterion described in Sec. 658.5(a). Each criterion 
will be given a score on a scale of 0 to the maximum points shown. 
Conditions suggesting top, intermediate and bottom scores are indicated 
for each criterion. The agency would make scoring decisions in the 
context of each proposed site or alternative action by examining the 
site, the surrounding area, and the programs and policies of the State 
or local unit of government in which the site is located. Where one 
given location has more than one design alternative, each design should 
be considered as an alternative site. The site assessment criteria are:
    (1) How much land is in nonurban use within a radius of 1.0 mile 
from where the project is intended?

More than 90 percent--15 points
90 to 20 percent--14 to 1 point(s)
Less than 20 percent--0 points

    (2) How much of the perimeter of the site borders on land in 
nonurban use?

More than 90 percent--10 points
90 to 20 percent--9 to 1 point(s)
Less than 20 percent--0 points

    (3) How much of the site has been farmed (managed for a scheduled 
harvest or timber activity) more than 5 of the last 10 years?
More than 90 percent--20 points
90 to 20 percent--19 to 1 points(s)
Less than 20 percent--0 points

    (4) Is the site subject to State or unit of local government 
policies or programs to protect farmland or covered by private programs 
to protect farmland?

Site is protected--20 points
Site is not protected--0 points

    (5) How close is the site to an urban built-up area?

The site is 2 miles or more from an urban built-up area--15 points
The site is more than 1 mile but less than 2 miles from an urban built-
up area--10 points
The site is less than 1 mile from, but is not adjacent to an urban 
built-up area--5 points
The site is adjacent to an urban built-up area--0 points

    (6) How close is the site to water lines, sewer lines and/or other 
local facilities and services whose capacities and design would promote 
nonagricultural use?

None of the services exist nearer than 3 miles from the site--15 points
Some of the services exist more than 1 but less than 3 miles from the 
site--10 points
All of the services exist within \1/2\ mile of the site--0 points

    (7) Is the farm unit(s) containing the site (before the project) as 
large as the average-size farming unit in the county? (Average farm 
sizes in each county are available from the NRCS field offices in each 
State. Data are from the latest available Census of Agriculture, Acreage 
of Farm Units in Operation with $1,000 or more in sales.)

As large or larger--10 points
Below average--deduct 1 point for each 5 percent below the average, down 
to 0 points if 50 percent or more below average--9 to 0 points

    (8) If this site is chosen for the project, how much of the 
remaining land on the farm will become non-farmable because of 
interference with land patterns?

Acreage equal to more than 25 percent of acres directly converted by the 
project--10 points
Acreage equal to between 25 and 5 percent of the acres directly 
converted by the project--9 to 1 point(s)
Acreage equal to less than 5 percent of the acres directly converted by 
the project--0 points

    (9) Does the site have available adequate supply of farm support 
services and markets, i.e., farm suppliers, equipment dealers, 
processing and storage facilities and farmer's markets?

All required services are available--5 points

[[Page 479]]

Some required services are available--4 to 1 point(s)
No required services are available--0 points

    (10) Does the site have substantial and well-maintained on-farm 
investments such as barns, other storage buildings, fruit trees and 
vines, field terraces, drainage, irrigation, waterways, or other soil 
and water conservation measures?

High amount of on-farm investment--20 points
Moderate amount of on-farm investment--19 to 1 point(s)
No on-farm investment--0 points

    (11) Would the project at this site, by converting farmland to 
nonagricultural use, reduce the demand for farm support services so as 
to jeopardize the continued existence of these support services and 
thus, the viability of the farms remaining in the area?

Substantial reduction in demand for support services if the site is 
converted--10 points
Some reduction in demand for support services if the site is converted--
9 to 1 point(s)
No significant reduction in demand for support services if the site is 
converted--0 points

    (12) Is the kind and intensity of the proposed use of the site 
sufficiently incompatible with agriculture that it is likely to 
contribute to the eventual conversion of surrounding farmland to 
nonagricultural use?

Proposed project is incompatible with existing agricultural use of 
surrounding farmland--10 points
Proposed project is tolerable to existing agricultural use of 
surrounding farmland--9 to 1 point(s)
Proposed project is fully compatible with existing agricultural use of 
surrounding farmland--0 points

    (c) Corridor-type Site Assessment Criteria. The following criteria 
are to be used for projects that have a linear or corridor-type site 
configuration connecting two distant points, and crossing several 
different tracts of land. These include utility lines, highways, 
railroads, stream improvements, and flood control systems. Federal 
agencies are to assess the suitability of each corridor-type site or 
design alternative for protection as farmland along with the land 
evaluation information described in Sec. 658.4(a). All criteria for 
corridor-type sites will be scored as shown in Sec. 658.5(b) for other 
sites, except as noted below:
    (1) Criteria 5 and 6 will not be considered.
    (2) Criterion 8 will be scored on a scale of 0 to 25 points, and 
criterion 11 will be scored on a scale of 0 to 25 points.


<R05>
Sec. 658.6  Technical assistance.

    (a) Section 1543 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4204 states, ``The Secretary 
is encouraged to provide technical assistance to any State or unit of 
local government, or any nonprofit organization, as determined by the 
Secretary, that desires to develop programs or policies to limit the 
conversion of productive farmland to nonagricultural uses.'' In 
Sec. 2.62, of 7 CFR part 2, subtitle A, NRCS is delegated leadership 
responsibility within USDA for the activities treated in this part.
    (b) In providing assistance to States, local units of government, 
and nonprofit organizations, USDA will make available maps and other 
soils information from the national cooperative soil survey through NRCS 
field offices.
    (c) Additional assistance, within available resources, may be 
obtained from local offices of other USDA agencies. The Agricultural 
Stabilization and Conservation Service and the Forest Service can 
provide aerial photographs, crop history data, and related information. 
A reasonable fee may be charged. In many States, the Cooperative 
Extension Service can provide help in understanding and identifying 
farmland protection issues and problems, resolving conflicts, developing 
alternatives, deciding on appropriate actions, and implementing those 
decisions.
    (d) Officials of State agencies, local units of government, 
nonprofit organizations, or regional, area, State-level, or field 
offices of Federal agencies may obtain assistance by contacting the 
office of the NRCS State conservationist. A list of Natural Resources 
Conservation Service State office locations appears in Appendix A, 
Sec. 661.6 of this title. If further assistance is needed, requests

[[Page 480]]

should be made to the Assistant Secretary for Natural Resources and 
Environment, Office of the Secretary, Department of Agriculture, 
Washington, DC 20250.


<R05>
Sec. 658.7  USDA assistance with Federal agencies' reviews of policies and procedures.

    (a) Section 1542(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203, states, ``Each 
department, agency, independent commission or other unit of the Federal 
Government, with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, shall 
review current provisions of law, administrative rules and regulations, 
and policies and procedures applicable to it to determine whether any 
provision thereof will prevent such unit of the Federal Government from 
taking appropriate action to comply fully with the provisions of this 
subtitle.''
    (b) Section 1542(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203, requires, as 
appropriate, each department, agency, independent commission, or other 
unit of the Federal Government, with the assistance of the Department of 
Agriculture, to develop proposals for action to bring its programs, 
authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the 
purpose and policy of the Act.
    (c) USDA will provide certain assistance to other Federal agencies 
for the purposes specified in section 1542 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 4203. If 
a Federal agency identifies or suggests changes in laws, administrative 
rules and regulations, policies, or procedures that may affect the 
agency's compliance with the Act, USDA can advise the agency of the 
probable effects of the changes on the protection of farmland. To 
request this assistance, officials of Federal agencies should correspond 
with the Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service, P.O. Box 2890, 
Washington, DC 20013.
    (d) To meet the reporting requirements of section 1546 of the Act, 7
