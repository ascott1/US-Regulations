                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 2.1  Statutory authority for confidentiality of drug abuse patient records.

    The restrictions of these regulations upon the disclosure and use of 
drug abuse patient records were initially authorized by section 408 of 
the Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act (21 U.S.C. 
1175). That

the patient with respect to whom such record is maintained, but only to 
such extent, under such circumstances, and for such purposes as may be 
allowed under regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (g) of this 
section.
    (2) Whether or not the patient, with respect to whom any given 
record referred to in subsection (a) of this section is maintained,

research, management audits, financial audits, or program evaluation, 
but such personnel may not identify, directly or indirectly, any 
individual patient in any report of such research, audit, or evaluation, 
or otherwise disclose patient identities in any manner.
    (C) If authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent 
jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause therefor. In 
assessing good cause the court shall weigh the public interest and the 
need for disclosure against the injury to the patient, to the physician-
patient relationship, and to the treatment services. Upon the granting 
of such order, the court, in determining the extent to which any 
disclosure of all or any part of any record is necessary, shall impose 
appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.
    (c) Prohibition against use of record in making criminal charges or 
investigation of patient
    Except as authorized by a court order granted under subsection 
(b)(2)(C) of this section, no record referred to in subsection (a) of 
this section may be used to initiate or substantiate any criminal 
charges against a patient or to conduct any investigation of a patient.
    (d) Continuing prohibition against disclosure irrespective of status 
as patient

    (2) between such components and the Armed Forces.
    The prohibitions of this section do not apply to the reporting under 
State law of incidents of suspected child abuse and neglect to the 
appropriate State or local authorities.
    (f) Penalty for first and subsequent offenses
    Any person who violates any provision of this section or any 
regulation issued pursuant to this section shall be fined not more than 
$500 in the case of a first offense, and not nore than $5,000 in the 
case of each subsequent offense.
    (g) Regulations; interagency consultations; definitions, safeguards, 
and procedures, including procedures and criteria for issuance and scope 
of orders
    Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary, 
after consultation with the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs and the 
heads of other Federal departments and agencies substantially affected 
thereby, shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this 
section. These regulations may contain such definitions, and may provide 
for such safeguards and procedures, including procedures and criteria 
for the issuance and scope of orders under subsection (b)(2)(C) of this 
section, as in the judgment of the Secretary are necessary or proper to 
effectuate the purposes of this section, to prevent circumvention or

[[Page 10]]


<R05>
Sec. 2.3  Purpose and effect.

    (a) Purpose. Under the statutory provisions quoted in Secs. 2.1 and 
2.2, these regulations impose restrictions upon the disclosure and use 
of alcohol and drug abuse patient records which are maintained in 
connection with the performance of any federally assisted alcohol and 
drug abuse program. The regulations specify:
    (1) Definitions, applicability, and general restrictions in subpart 
B (definitions applicable to Sec. 2.34 only appear in that section);
    (2) Disclosures which may be made with written patient consent and 
the form of the written consent in subpart C;
    (3) Disclosures which may be made without written patient consent or 
an authorizing court order in subpart D; and
    (4) Disclosures and uses of patient records which may be made with 
an authorizing court order and the procedures and criteria for the entry 
and scope of those orders in subpart E.
    (b) Effect. (1) These regulations prohibit the disclosure and use of 
patient records unless certain circumstances exist. If any circumstances 
exists under which disclosure is permitted, that circumstance acts to 
remove the prohibition on disclosure but it does not compel disclosure. 
Thus, the regulations do not require disclosure under any circumstances.
    (2) These regulations are not intended to direct the manner in which 
substantive functions such as research, treatment, and evaluation are 
carried out. They are intended to insure that an alcohol or drug abuse 
patient in a federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program is not 
made more vulnerable by reason of the availability of his or her patient 
record than an individual who has an alcohol or drug problem and who 
does not seek treatment.
    (3) Because there is a criminal penalty (a fine--see 42 U.S.C. 
290ee-3(f), 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3(f) and 42 CFR 2.4) for violating the 
regulations, they are to be construed strictly in favor of the potential 
violator in the same manner as a criminal statute (see M. Kraus & 
Brothers v. United States, 327 U.S. 614, 621-22, 66 S. Ct. 705, 707-08 
(1946)).


<R05>
Sec. 2.4  Criminal penalty for violation.

    Under 42 U.S.C. 290ee-3(f) and 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3(f), any person who 
violates any provision of those statutes or these regulations shall be 
fined not more than $500 in the case of a first offense, and not more 
than $5,000 in the case of each subsequent offense.


<R05>
Sec. 2.5  Reports of violations.

    (a) The report of any violation of these regulations may be directed 
to the United States Attorney for the judicial district in which the 
violation occurs.
    (b) The report of any violation of these regulations by a methadone 
program may be directed to the Regional Offices of the Food and Drug 
Administration.

disclosure in

[[Page 12]]

these regulations apply to any information, whether or not recorded,

directly, by reference to other publicly available information, or 
through verification of such an identification by another person; and
    (ii) Is drug abuse information obtained by a federally assisted drug 
abuse program after March 20, 1972, or is alcohol abuse information 
obtained by a federally assisted alcohol abuse program after May 13, 
1974 (or if obtained before the pertinent date, is maintained by a 
federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program after that date as part 
of an ongoing treatment episode which extends past that date) for the 
purpose of treating alcohol or drug abuse, making a diagnosis for that 
treatment, or making a referral for that treatment.
    (2) Restriction on use. The restriction on use of information to 
initiate or substantiate any criminal charges against a patient or to 
conduct any criminal investigation of a patient (42 U.S.C. 290ee-3(c), 
42 U.S.C. 290dd-3(c)) applies to any information, whether or not 
recorded which is drug abuse information obtained by a federally 
assisted drug abuse program after March 20, 1972, or is alcohol abuse 
information obtained by a federally assisted alcohol abuse program after 
May 13, 1974 (or if obtained before the pertinent date, is maintained by 
a federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program after that date as 
part of an ongoing treatment episode which extends past that date), for 
the purpose of treating alcohol or drug abuse, making a diagnosis for 
the treatment, or making a referral for the treatment.
    (b) Federal assistance. An alcohol abuse or drug abuse program is 
considered to be federally assisted if:
    (1) It is conducted in whole or in part, whether directly or by 
contract or otherwise by any department or agency of the United States 
(but see paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section relating to the 
Veterans' Administration and the Armed Forces);
    (2) It is being carried out under a license, certification, 
registration, or other authorization granted by any department or agency

    (3) It is supported by funds provided by any department or agency of 
the United States by being:

including financial assistance which does not directly pay for the 
alcohol or drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral activities; or
    (ii) Conducted by a State or local government unit which, through 
general or special revenue sharing or other forms of assistance, 
receives Federal funds which could be (but are not necessarily) spent 
for the alcohol or drug abuse program; or
    (4) It is assisted by the Internal Revenue Service of the Department 
of the Treasury through the allowance of income tax deductions for 
contributions to the program or through the granting of tax exempt 
status to the program.
    (c) Exceptions--(1) Veterans' Administration. These regulations do 
not apply to information on alcohol and drug abuse patients maintained 
in connection with the Veterans' Administraton provisions of hospital 
care, nursing home care, domiciliary care, and medical services under 
title 38, United States Code. Those records are governed by 38 U.S.C.

    (i) Any interchange of that information within the Armed Forces; and
    (ii) Any interchange of that information between the Armed Forces 
and

[[Page 13]]

those components of the Veterans Administration furnishing health care 
to veterans.
    (3) Communication within a program or between a program and an 
entity having direct administrative control over that program. The 
restrictions on disclosure in these regulations do not apply to 
communications of information between or among personnel having a need 
for the information in connection with their duties that arise out of 
the provision of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of 
alcohol or drug abuse if the communications are
    (i) Within a program or
    (ii) Between a program and an entity that has direct administrative 
control over the program.
    (4) Qualified Service Organizations. The restrictions on disclosure

premises of the program or against program personnel or to a threat to 
commit such a crime; and

on disclosure and use in these regulations do not apply to the reporting 
under State law of incidents of suspected child abuse and neglect to the 
appropriate State or local authorities. However, the restrictions 
continue to apply to the original alcohol or drug abuse patient records 
maintained by the program including their disclosure and use for civil 
or criminal proceedings which may arise out of the report of suspected 
child abuse and neglect.
    (d) Applicability to recipients of information--(1) Restriction on 
use of information. The restriction on the use of any information 
subject to these regulations to initiate or substantiate any criminal 
charges against a patient or to conduct any criminal investigation of a 
patient applies to any person who obtains that information from a 
federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program, regardless of the 
status of the person obtaining the information or of whether the 
information was obtained in accordance with these regulations. This 
restriction on use bars, among other things, the introduction of that 
information as evidence in a criminal proceeding and any other use of 
the information to investigate or prosecute a patient with respect to a 
suspected crime. Information obtained by undercover agents or informants 
(see Sec. 2.17) or through patient access (see Sec. 2.23) is subject to 
the restriction on use.
    (2) Restrictions on disclosures--Third party payers, administrative

assisted alcohol or drug abuse program and who are notified of the 
restrictions on redisclosure of the records in accordance with Sec. 2.32 
of these regulations.
    (e) Explanation of applicability--(1) Coverage. These regulations 
cover any information (including information on referral and intake) 
about alcohol and drug abuse patients obtained by a program (as the 
terms ``patient'' and ``program'' are defined in Sec. 2.11) if the 
program is federally assisted in any manner described in Sec. 2.12(b). 
Coverage includes, but is not limited to, those treatment or 
rehabilitation programs, employee assistance programs, programs within 
general hospitals, school-

[[Page 14]]

based programs, and private practitioners who hold themselves out as 
providing, and provide alcohol or drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or 
referral for treatment. However, these regulations would not apply, for 
example, to emergency room personnel who refer a patient to the 
intensive care unit for an apparent overdose, unless the primary 
function of such personnel is the provision of alcohol or drug abuse 
diagnosis, treatment or referral and they are identified as providing 
such services or the emergency room has promoted itself to the community 
as a provider of such services.
    (2) Federal assistance to program required. If a patient's alcohol 
or drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment is not 
provided by a program which is federally conducted, regulated or 
supported in a manner which constitutes Federal assistance under 
Sec. 2.12(b), that patient's record is not covered by these regulations. 
Thus, it is possible for an individual patient to benefit from Federal 
support and not be covered by the confidentiality regulations because 
the program in which the patient is enrolled is not federally assisted 
as defined in Sec. 2.12(b). For example, if a Federal court placed an 
individual in a private for-profit program and made a payment to the 
program on behalf of that individual, that patient's record would not be 
covered by these regulations unless the program itself received Federal 
assistance as defined by Sec. 2.12(b).
    (3) Information to which restrictions are applicable. Whether a 
restriction is on use or disclosure affects the type of information 
which may be available. The restrictions on disclosure apply to any 
information which would identify a patient as an alcohol or drug abuser. 
The restriction on use of information to bring criminal charges against 
a patient for a crime applies to any information obtained by the program 
for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of 
alcohol or drug abuse. (Note that restrictions on use and disclosure 
apply to recipients of information under Sec. 2.12(d).)
    (4) How type of diagnosis affects coverage. These regulations cover 
any record of a diagnosis identifying a patient as an alcohol or drug 
abuser which is prepared in connection with the treatment or referral 
for treatment of alcohol or drug abuse. A diagnosis prepared for the 
purpose of treatment or referral for treatment but which is not so used 
is covered by these regulations. The following are not covered by these 
regulations:
    (i) Diagnosis which is made solely for the purpose of providing 
evidence for use by law enforcement authorities; or
    (ii) A diagnosis of drug overdose or alcohol intoxication which 
clearly shows that the individual involved is not an alcohol or drug 
abuser (e.g., involuntary ingestion of alcohol or drugs or reaction to a 
prescribed dosage of one or more drugs).

<R05>
Sec. 2.13  Confidentiality restrictions.

    (a) General. The patient records to which these regulations apply 
may be disclosed or used only as permitted by these regulations and may 
not otherwise be disclosed or used in any civil, criminal, 
administrative, or legislative proceedings conducted by any Federal, 
State, or local authority. Any disclosure made under these regulations 
must be limited to that information which is necessary to carry out the 
purpose of the disclosure.
    (b) Unconditional compliance required. The restrictions on 
disclosure and use in these regulations apply whether the holder of the 
information believes that the person seeking the information already has 
it, has other means of obtaining it, is a law enforcement or other 
official, has obtained a subpoena, or asserts any other justification 
for a disclosure or use which is not permitted by these regulations.
    (c) Acknowledging the presence of patients: Responding to requests. 
(1) The presence of an identified patient in a facility or component of 
a facility which is publicly identified as a place where only alcohol or 
drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral is provided may be 
acknowledged only if the patient's written consent is obtained in 
accordance with subpart C of these regulations or if an authorizing 
court order is entered in accordance with subpart E of these 
regulations. The regulations permit acknowledgement

[[Page 15]]

of the presence of an identified patient in a facility or part of a 
facility if the facility is not publicy identified as only an alcohol or 
drug abuse diagnosis, treatment or referral facility, and if the 
acknowledgement does not reveal that the patient is an alcohol or drug 
abuser.
    (2) Any answer to a request for a disclosure of patient records 
which is not permissible under these regulations must be made in a way 
that will not affirmatively reveal that an identified individual has 
been, or is being diagnosed or treated for alcohol or drug abuse. An 
inquiring party may be given a copy of these regulations and advised 
that they restrict the disclosure of alcohol or drug abuse patient 
records, but may not be told affirmatively that the regulations restrict 
the disclosure of the records of an identified patient. The regulations 
do not restrict a disclosure that an identified individual is not and 
never has been a patient.


<R05>
Sec. 2.14  Minor patients.

    (a) Definition of minor. As used in these regulations the term 
``minor'' means a person who has not attained the age of majority 
specified in the applicable State law, or if no age of majority is 
specified in the applicable State law, the age of eighteen years.
    (b) State law not requiring parental consent to treatment. If a 
minor patient acting alone has the legal capacity under the applicable 
State law to apply for and obtain alcohol or drug abuse treatment, any 
written consent for disclosure authorized under subpart C of these 
regulations may be given only by the minor patient. This restriction 
includes, but is not limited to, any disclosure of patient identifying 
information to the parent or guardian of a minor patient for the purpose 
of obtaining financial reimbursement. These regulations do not prohibit 
a program from refusing to provide treatment until the minor patient 
consents to the disclosure necessary to obtain reimbursement, but 
refusal to provide treatment may be prohibited under a State or local 
law requiring the program to furnish the service irrespective of ability 
to pay.
    (c) State law requiring parental consent to treatment. (1) Where 
State law requires consent of a parent, guardian, or other person for a 
minor to obtain alcohol or drug abuse treatment, any written consent for 
disclosure authorized under subpart C of these regulations must be given 
by both the minor and his or her parent, guardian, or other person 
authorized under State law to act in the minor's behalf.
    (2) Where State law requires parental consent to treatment the fact 
of a minor's application for treatment may be communicated to the 
minor's parent, guardian, or other person authorized under State law to 
act in the minor's behalf only if:
    (i) The minor has given written consent to the disclosure in 
accordance with subpart C of these regulations or
    (ii) The minor lacks the capacity to make a rational choice 
regarding such consent as judged by the program director under paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (d) Minor applicant for services lacks capacity for rational choice. 
Facts relevant to reducing a threat to the life or physical well being 
of the applicant or any other individual may be disclosed to the parent, 
guardian, or other person authorized under State law to act in the 
minor's behalf if the program director judges that:
    (1) A minor applicant for services lacks capacity because of extreme 
youth or mental or physical condition to make a rational decision on 
whether to consent to a disclosure under subpart C of these regulations 
to his or her parent, guardian, or other person authorized under State 
law to act in the minor's behalf, and
    (2) The applicant's situation poses a substantial threat to the life 
or physical well being of the applicant or any other individual which 
may be reduced by communicating relevant facts to the minor's parent, 
guardian, or other person authorized under State law to act in the 
minor's behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 2.15  Incompetent and deceased patients.

    (a) Incompetent patients other than minors--(1) Adjudication of 
incompetence. In the case of a patient who has been adjudicated as 
lacking the capacity, for any reason other than insufficient age, to 
manage his or her own affairs,

[[Page 16]]

any consent which is required under these regulations may be given by 
the guardian or other person authorized under State law to act in the 
patient's behalf.
    (2) No adjudication of incompetency. For any period for which the 
program director determines that a patient, other than a minor or one 
who has been adjudicated incompetent, suffers from a medical condition 
that prevents knowing or effective action on his or her own behalf, the 
program director may exercise the right of the patient to consent to a 
disclosure under subpart C of these regulations for the sole purpose of 
obtaining payment for services from a third party payer.
    (b) Deceased patients--(1) Vital statistics. These regulations do 
not restrict the disclosure of patient identifying information relating 
to the cause of death of a patient under laws requiring the collection 
of death or other vital statistics or permitting inquiry into the cause 
of death.
    (2) Consent by personal representative. Any other disclosure of 
information identifying a deceased patient as an alcohol or drug abuser 
is subject to these regulations. If a written consent to the disclosure 
is required, that consent may be given by an executor, administrator, or 
other personal representative appointed under applicable State law. If 
there is no such appointment the consent may be given by the patient's 
spouse or, if none, by any responsible member of the patient's family.


<R05>
Sec. 2.16  Security for written records.

    (a) Written records which are subject to these regulations must be 
maintained in a secure room, locked file cabinet, safe or other similar 
container when not in use; and
    (b) Each program shall adopt in writing procedures which regulate 
and control access to and use of written records which are subject to 
these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 2.17  Undercover agents and informants.

    (a) Restrictions on placement. Except as specifically authorized by 
a court order granted under Sec. 2.67 of these regulations, no program 
may knowingly employ, or enroll as a patient, any undercover agent or 
informant.
    (b) Restriction on use of information. No information obtained by an 
undercover agent or informant, whether or not that undercover agent or 
informant is placed in a program pursuant to an authorizing court order, 
may be used to criminally investigate or prosecute any patient.

[52 FR 21809, June 9, 1987; 52 FR 42061, Nov. 2, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 2.18  Restrictions on the use of identification cards.

    No person may require any patient to carry on his or her person 
while away from the program premises any card or other object which 
would identify the patient as an alcohol or drug abuser. This section 
does not prohibit a person from requiring patients to use or carry cards 
or other identification objects on the premises of a program.


<R05>
Sec. 2.19  Disposition of records by discontinued programs.

    (a) General. If a program discontinues operations or is taken over 
or acquired by another program, it must purge patient identifying 
information from its records or destroy the records unless--
    (1) The patient who is the subject of the records gives written 
consent (meeting the requirements of Sec. 2.31) to a transfer of the 
records to the acquiring program or to any other program designated in 
the consent (the manner of obtaining this consent must minimize the 
likelihood of a disclosure of patient identifying information to a third 
party); or
    (2) There is a legal requirement that the records be kept for a 
period specified by law which does not expire until after the 
discontinuation or acquisition of the program.
    (b) Procedure where retention period required by law. If paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section applies, the records must be:
    (1) Sealed in envelopes or other containers labeled as follows: 
``Records of [insert name of program] required to be maintained under 
[insert citation to statute, regulation, court order or other legal 
authority requiring that records be kept] until a date not later than 
[insert appropriate date]''; and

[[Page 17]]

    (2) Held under the restrictions of these regulations by a 
responsible person who must, as soon as practicable after the end of the 
retention period specified on the label, destroy the records.


<R05>
Sec. 2.20  Relationship to State laws.

    The statutes authorizing these regulations (42 U.S.C. 290ee-3 and 42 
U.S.C. 290dd-3) do not preempt the field of law which they cover to the 
exclusion of all State laws in that field. If a disclosure permitted 
under these regulations is prohibited under State law, neither these 
regulations nor the authorizing statutes may be construed to authorize 
any violation of that State law. However, no State law may either 
authorize or compel any disclosure prohibited by these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 2.21  Relationship to Federal statutes protecting research subjects against compulsory disclosure of their identity.

    (a) Research privilege description. There may be concurrent coverage 
of patient identifying information by these regulations and by 
administrative action taken under: Section 303(a) of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242a(a) and the implementing regulations at 42 
CFR part 2a); or section 502(c) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 
U.S.C. 872(c) and the implementing regulations at 21 CFR 1316.21). These 
``research privilege'' statutes confer on the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services and on the Attorney General, respectively, the power to 
authorize researchers conducting certain types of research to withhold 
from all persons not connected with the research the names and other 
identifying information concerning individuals who are the subjects of 
the research.
    (b) Effect of concurrent coverage. These regulations restrict the 
disclosure and use of information about patients, while administrative 
action taken under the research privilege statutes and implementing 
regulations protects a person engaged in applicable research from being 
compelled to disclose any identifying characteristics of the individuals 
who are the subjects of that research. The issuance under subpart E of 
these regulations of a court order authorizing a disclosure of 
information about a patient does not affect an exercise of authority 
under these research privilege statutes. However, the research privilage 
granted under 21 CFR 291.505(g) to treatment programs using methadone 
for maintenance treatment does not protect from compulsory disclosure 
any imformation which is permitted to be disclosed under those 
regulations. Thus, if a court order entered in accordance with subpart E 
of these regulations authorizes a methadone maintenance treatment 
program to disclose certain information about its patients, that program 
may not invoke the research privilege under 21 CFR 291.505(g) as a 
defense to a subpoena for that information.


<R05>
Sec. 2.22  Notice to patients of Federal confidentiality requirements.

    (a) Notice required. At the time of admission or as soon threreafter 
as the patient is capable of rational communication. each program shall:
    (1) Communicate to the patient that Federal law and regulations 
protect the confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records; 
and
    (2) Give to the patient a summary in writing of the Federal law and 
regulations.
    (b) Required elements of written summary. The written summary of the 
Federal law and regulations must include:
    (1) A general description of the limited circumstances under which a 
program may acknowledge that an individual is present at a facility or 
disclose outside the program information identifying a patient as an 
alcohol or drug abuser.
    (2) A statement that violation of the Federal law and regulations by 
a program is a crime and that suspected violations may be reported to 
appropriate authorities in accordance with these regulations.
    (3) A statement that information related to a patient's commission 
of a crime on the premises of the program or against personnel of the 
program is not protected.
    (4) A statement that reports of suspected child abuse and neglect 
made under State law to appropriate State or local authorities are not 
protected.

[[Page 18]]

    (5) A citation to the Federal law and regulations.
    (c) Program options. The program may devise its own notice or may 
use the sample notice in paragraph (d) to comply with the requirement to 
provide the patient with a summary in writing of the Federal law and 
regulations. In addition, the program may include in the written summary 
information concerning State law and any program policy not inconsistent 
with State and Federal law on the subject of confidentiality of alcohol 
and drug abuse patient records.
    (d) Sample notice.

        Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records

    The confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records 
maintained by this program is protected by Federal law and regulations. 
Generally, the program may not say to a person outside the program that 
a patient attends the program, or disclose any information identifying a 
patient as an alcohol or drug abuser Unless:
    (1) The patient consents in writing:
    (2) The disclosure is allowed by a court order; or
    (3) The disclosure is made to medical personnel in a medical 
emergency or to qualified personnel for research, audit, or program 
evaluation.
    Violation of the Federal law and regulations by a program is a 
crime. Suspected violations may be reported to appropriate authorities 
in accordance with Federal regulations.
    Federal law and regulations do not protect any information about a 
crime committed by a patient either at the program or against any person 
who works for the program or about any threat to commit such a crime.
    Federal laws and regulations do not protect any information about 
suspected child abuse or neglect from being reported under State law to 
appropriate State or local authorities.

(See 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3 and 42 U.S.C. 290ee-3 for Federal laws and 42 CFR 
part 2 for Federal regulations.)

<R05>
Sec. 2.23  Patient access and restrictions on use.

    (a) Patient access not prohibited. These regulations do not prohibit 
a program from giving a patient access to his or her own records, 
including the opportunity to inspect and copy any records that the 
program maintains about the patient. The program is not required to 
obtain a patient's written consent or other authorization under these 
regulations in order to provide such access to the patient.
    (b) Restriction on use of information. Information obtained by 
patient access to his or her patient record is subject to the 
restriction on use of his information to initiate or substantiate any 
criminal charges against the patient or to conduct any criminal 
investigation of the patient as provided for under Sec. 2.12(d)(1).


<R04>
              Subpart C--Disclosures With Patient's Consent


<R05>
Sec. 2.31  Form of written consent.

    (7) The date on which the consent is signed.
    (8) A statement that the consent is subject to revocation at any 
time except to the extent that the program or person which is to make 
the disclosure has already acted in reliance on it. Acting in reliance 
includes the provision of treatment services in reliance on a valid 
consent to disclose information to a third party payer.
    (9) The date, event, or condition upon which the consent will expire 
if not revoked before. This date, event, or condition must insure that 
the consent will last no longer than reasonably necessary to serve the 
purpose for which it is given.

[[Page 19]]

    (b) Sample consent form. The following form complies with paragraph 
(a) of this section, but other elements may be added.

<R05>
Sec. 2.32  Prohibition on redisclosure.

    Notice to accompany disclosure. Each disclosure made with the 
patient's written consent must be accompanied by the following written 
statement:

    This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by 
Federal confidentiality rules (42 CFR part 2). The Federal rules 
prohibit you from making any further disclosure of this information 
unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent 
of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR 
part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other 
information is NOT sufficient for this purpose. The Federal rules 
restrict any use of the information to criminally investigate or 
prosecute any alcohol or drug abuse patient.

<R05>
Sec. 2.33  Disclosures permitted with written consent.

    If a patient consents to a disclosure of his or her records under 
Sec. 2.31, a program may disclose those records in accordance with that 
consent to any individual or organization named in the consent, except 
that disclosures to central registries and in connection with criminal 
justice referrals must meet the requirements of Secs. 2.34 and 2.35, 
respectively.


<R05>
Sec. 2.34  Disclosures to prevent multiple enrollments in detoxification and maintenance treatment programs.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    Central registry means an organization which obtains from two or 
more member progams patient identifying information about individuals 
applying for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment for the 
purpose of avoiding an individual's concurrent enrollment in more than 
one program.
    Detoxification treatment means the dispensing of a narcotic drug in 
decreasing doses to an individual in order to reduce or eliminate 
adverse physiological or psychological effects incident to withdrawal 
from the sustained use of a narcotic drug.
    Maintenance treatment means the dispensing of a narcotic drug in the 
treatment of an individual for dependence upon heroin or other morphine-
like drugs.
    Member program means a detoxification treatment or maintenance 
treatment program which reports patient identifying information to a 
central registry and which is in the same State as that central registry 
or is not more than 125 miles from any border of the State in which the 
central registry is located.
    (b) Restrictions on disclosure. A program may disclose patient 
records to a central registry or to any detoxification or maintenance 
treatment program not more than 200 miles away for

[[Page 20]]

the purpose of preventing the multiple enrollment of a patient only if:
    (1) The disclosure is made when:
    (i) The patient is accepted for treatment;
    (ii) The type or dosage of the drug is changed; or
    (iii) The treatment is interrupted, resumed or terminated.
    (2) The disclosure is limited to:
    (i) Patient identifying information:
    (ii) Type and dosage of the drug; and
    (iii) Relevant dates.
    (3) The disclosure is made with the patient's written consent 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 2.31, except that:
    (i) The consent must list the name and address of each central 
registry and each known detoxification or maintenance treatment program 
to which a disclosure will be made; and
    (ii) The consent may authorize a disclosure to any detoxification or 
maintenance treatment program established within 200 miles of the 
program after the consent is given without naming any such program.
    (c) Use of information limited to prevention of multiple 
enrollments. A central registry and any detoxification or maintenance 
treatment program to which information is disclosed to prevent multiple 
enrollments may not redisclose or use patient identifying information 
for any purpose other than the prevention of multiple enrollments unless 
authorized by a court order under subpart E of these regulations.
    (d) Permitted disclosure by a central registry to prevent a multiple 
enrollment. When a member program asks a central registry if an 
identified patient is enrolled in another member program and the 
registry determines that the patient is so enrolled, the registry may 
disclose--
    (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the member program(s) 
in which the patient is already enrolled to the inquiring member 
program; and
    (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the inquiring member 
program to the member program(s) in which the patient is already 
enrolled. The member programs may communicate as necessary to verify 
that no error has been made and to prevent or eliminate any multiple 
enrollment.
    (e) Permitted disclosure by a detoxification or maintenance 
treatment program to prevent a multiple enrollment. A detoxification or 
maintenance treatment program which has received a disclosure under this 
section and has determined that the patient is already enrolled may 
communicate as necessary with the program making the disclosure to 
verify that no error has been made and to prevent or eliminate any 
multiple enrollment.


<R05>
Sec. 2.35  Disclosures to elements of the criminal justice system which have referred patients.

    (a) A program may disclose information about a patient to those 
persons within the criminal justice system which have made participation 
in the program a condition of the disposition of any criminal 
proceedings against the patient or of the patient's parole or other 
release from custody if:
    (1) The disclosure is made only to those individuals within the 
criminal justice system who have a need for the information in 
connection with their duty to monitor the patient's progress (e.g., a 
prosecuting attorney who is withholding charges against the patient, a 
court granting pretrial or posttrial release, probation or parole 
officers responsible for supervision of the patient); and
    (2) The patient has signed a written consent meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 2.31 (except paragraph (a)(8) which is inconsistent 
with the revocation provisions of paragraph (c) of this section) and the 
requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Duration of consent. The written consent must state the period 
during which it remains in effect. This period must be reasonable, 
taking into account:
    (1) The anticipated length of the treatment;
    (2) The type of criminal proceeding involved, the need for the 
information in connection with the final disposition of that proceeding, 
and when the final disposition will occur; and
    (3) Such other factors as the program, the patient, and the 
person(s) who will receive the disclosure consider pertinent.

[[Page 21]]

    (c) Revocation of consent. The written consent must state that it is 
revocable upon the passage of a specified amount of time or the 
occurrence of a specified, ascertainable event. The time or occurrence 
upon which consent becomes revocable may be no later than the final 
disposition of the conditional release or other action in connection 
with which consent was given.
    (d) Restrictions on redisclosure and use. A person who receives 
patient information under this section may redisclose and use it only to 
carry out that person's official duties with regard to the patient's 
conditional release or other action in connection with which the consent 
was given.


<R04>
             Subpart D--Disclosures Without Patient Consent


<R05>
Sec. 2.51  Medical emergencies.

    (a) General Rule. Under the procedures required by paragraph (c) of 
this section, patient identifying information may be disclosed to 
medical personnel who have a need for information about a patient for 
the purpose of treating a condition which poses an immediate threat to 
the health of any individual and which requires immediate medical 
intervention.
    (b) Special Rule. Patient identifying information may be disclosed 
to medical personnel of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who 
assert a reason to believe that the health of any individual may be 
threatened by an error in the manufacture, labeling, or sale of a 
product under FDA jurisdiction, and that the information will be used 
for the exclusive purpose of notifying patients or their physicians of 
potential dangers.
    (c) Procedures. Immediately following disclosure, the program shall 
document the disclosure in the patient's records, setting forth in 
writing:
    (1) The name of the medical personnel to whom disclosure was made 
and their affiliation with any health care facility;
    (2) The name of the individual making the disclosure;
    (3) The date and time of the disclosure; and
    (4) The nature of the emergency (or error, if the report was to 
FDA).

Sec. 2.52  Research activities.

    (a) Patient identifying information may be disclosed for the purpose 
of conducting scientific research if the program director makes a 
determination that the recipient of the patient identifying information:
    (1) Is qualified to conduct the research;
    (2) Has a research protocol under which the patient identifying 
information:
    (i) Will be maintained in accordance with the security requirements 
of Sec. 2.16 of these regulations (or more stringent requirements); and
    (ii) Will not be redisclosed except as permitted under paragraph (b) 
of this section; and
    (3) Has provided a satisfactory written statement that a group of 
three or more individuals who are independent of the research project 
has reviewed the protocol and determined that:
    (i) The rights and welfare of patients will be adequately protected; 
and
    (ii) The risks in disclosing patient identifying information are 
outweighed by the potential benefits of the research.
    (b) A person conducting research may disclose patient identifying 
information obtained under paragraph (a) of this section only back to 
the program from which that information was obtained and may not 
identify any individual patient in any report of that research or 
otherwise disclose patient identities.

Sec. 2.53  Audit and evaluation activities.

    (a) Records not copied or removed. If patient records are not copied 
or removed, patient identifying information may be disclosed in the 
course of a review of records on program premises to any person who 
agrees in writing to comply with the limitations on redisclosure and use 
in paragraph (d) of this section and who:

[[Page 22]]

    (1) Performs the audit or evaluation activity on behalf of:
    (i) Any Federal, State, or local governmental agency which provides 
financial assistance to the program or is authorized by law to regulate 
its activities; or
    (ii) Any private person which provides financial assistance to the 
program, which is a third party payer covering patients in the program, 
or which is a peer review organization performing a utilization or 
quality control review; or
    (2) Is determined by the program director to be qualified to conduct 
the audit or evaluation activities.
    (b) Copying or removal of records. Records containing patient 
identifying information may be copied or removed from program premises 
by any person who:
    (1) Agrees in writing to:
    (i) Maintain the patient identifying information in accordance with 
the security requirements provided in Sec. 2.16 of these regulations (or 
more stringent requirements);
    (ii) Destroy all the patient identifying information upon completion 
of the audit or evaluation; and
    (iii) Comply with the limitations on disclosure and use in paragraph 
(d) of this section; and
    (2) Performs the audit or evaluation activity on behalf of:
    (i) Any Federal, State, or local governmental agency which provides 
financial assistance to the program or is authorized by law to regulate 
its activities; or
    (ii) Any private person which provides financial assistance to the 
program, which is a third part payer covering patients in the program, 
or which is a peer review organization performing a utilization or 
quality control review.
    (c) Medicare or Medicaid audit or evaluation. (1) For purposes of 
Medicare or Medicaid audit or evaluation under this section, audit or 
evaluation includes a civil or administrative investigation of the 
program by any Federal, State, or local agency responsible for oversight 
of the Medicare or Medicaid program and includes administrative 
enforcement, against the program by the agency, of any remedy authorized 
by law to be imposed as a result of the findings of the investigation.
    (2) Consistent with the definition of program in Sec. 2.11, program 
includes an employee of, or provider of medical services under, the 
program when the employee or provider is the subject of a civil 
investigation or administrative remedy, as those terms are used in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) If a disclosure to a person is authorized under this section for 
a Medicare or Medicaid audit or evaluation, including a civil 
investigation or administrative remedy, as those terms are used in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then a peer review organization which 
obtains the information under paragraph (a) or (b) may disclose the 
information to that person but only for purposes of Medicare or Medicaid 
audit or evaluation.
    (4) The provisions of this paragraph do not authorize the agency, 
the program, or any other person to disclose or use patient identifying 
information obtained during the audit or evaluation for any purposes 
other than those necessary to complete the Medicare or Medicaid audit or 
evaluation activity as specified in this paragraph.
    (d) Limitations on disclosure and use. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, patient identifying information disclosed 
under this section may be disclosed only back to the program from which 
it was obtained and used only to carry out an audit or evaluation 
purpose or to investigate or prosecute criminal or other activities, as 
authorized by a court order entered under Sec. 2.66 of these 
regulations.


<R04>
         Subpart E--Court Orders Authorizing Disclosure And Use


<R05>
Sec. 2.61  Legal effect of order.

    (a) Effect. An order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered 
under this subpart is a unique kind of court order. Its only purpose is 
to authorize a disclosure or use of patient information which would 
otherwise be prohibited by 42 U.S.C. 290ee-3, 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3 and 
these regulations. Such an order does not compel disclosure. A subpoena 
or a similar legal mandate must be issued in order to compel disclosure. 
This mandate may be entered at the same

[[Page 23]]

time as and accompany an authorizing court order entered under these 
regulations.
    (b) Examples. (1) A person holding records subject to these 
regulations receives a subpoena for those records: a response to the 
subpoena is not permitted under the regulations unless an authorizing 
court order is entered. The person may not disclose the records in 
response to the subpoena unless a court of competent jurisdiction enters 
an authorizing order under these regulations.
    (2) An authorizing court order is entered under these regulations, 
but the person authorized does not want to make the disclosure. If there 
is no subpoena or other compulsory process or a subpoena for the records 
has expired or been quashed, that person may refuse to make the 
disclosure. Upon the entry of a valid subpoena or other compulsory 
process the person authorized to disclose must disclose, unless there is 
a valid legal defense to the process other than the confidentiality 
restrictions of these regulations.

[52 FR 21809, June 9, 1987; 52 FR 42061, Nov. 2, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 2.62  Order not applicable to records disclosed without consent to researchers, auditors and evaluators.

    A court order under these regulations may not authorize qualified 
personnel, who have received patient identifying information without 
consent for the purpose of conducting research, audit or evaluation, to 
disclose that information or use it to conduct any criminal 
investigation or prosecution of a patient. However, a court order under 
Sec. 2.66 may authorize disclosure and use of records to investigate or 
prosecute qualified personnel holding the records.


<R05>
Sec. 2.63  Confidential communications.

    (a) A court order under these regulations may authorize disclosure 
of confidential communications made by a patient to a program in the 
course of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment only if:
    (1) The disclosure is necessary to protect against an existing 
threat to life or of serious bodily injury, including circumstances 
which constitute suspected child abuse and neglect and verbal threats 
against third parties;
    (2) The disclosure is necessary in connection with investigation or 
prosecution of an extremely serious crime, such as one which directly 
threatens loss of life or serious bodily injury, including homicide, 
rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, or child 
abuse and neglect; or
    (3) The disclosure is in connection with litigation or an 
administrative proceeding in which the patient offers testimony or other 
evidence pertaining to the content of the confidential communications.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 2.64  Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosures for noncriminal purposes.

    (a) Application. An order authorizing the disclosure of patient 
records for purposes other than criminal investigation or prosecution 
may be applied for by any person having a legally recognized interest in 
the disclosure which is sought. The application may be filed separately 
or as part of a pending civil action in which it appears that the 
patient records are needed to provide evidence. An application mst use a 
fictitious name, such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may not 
contain or otherwise disclose any patient identifying information unless 
the patient is the applicant or has given a written consent (meeting the 
requirements of these regulations) to disclosure or the court has 
ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public scrunity.
    (b) Notice. The patient and the person holding the records from whom 
disclosure is sought must be given:
    (1) Adequate notice in a manner which will not disclose patient 
identifying information to other persons: and
    (2) An opportunity to file a written response to the application, or 
to appear in person, for the limited purpose of providing evidence on 
the statutory and regulatory criteria for the issuance of the court 
order.
    (c) Review of evidence: Conduct of hearing. Any oral argument, 
review of evidence, or hearing on the application must be held in the 
judge's chambers or in some manner which ensures that patient 
identifying information is not

[[Page 24]]

disclosed to anyone other than a party to the proceeding, the patient, 
or the person holding the record, unless the patient requests an open 
hearing in a manner which meets the written consent requirements of 
these regulations. The proceeding may include an examination by the 
judge of the patient records referred to in the application.
    (d) Criteria for entry of order. An order under this section may be 
entered only if the court determines that good cause exists. To make 
this determination the court must find that:
    (1) Other ways of obtaining the information are not available or 
would not be effective; and
    (2) The public interest and need for the disclosure outweigh the 
potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient relationship and 
the treatment services.
    (e) Content of order. An order authorizing a disclosure must:
    (1) Limit disclosure to those parts of the patient's record which 
are essential to fulfill the objective of the order.
    (2) Limit disclosure to those persons whose need for information is 
the basis for the order; and
    (3) Include such other measures as are necessary to limit disclosure 
for the protection of the patient, the physician-patient relationship 
and the treatment services; for example, sealing from public scrutiny 
the record of any proceeding for which disclosure of a patient's record 
has been ordered.


<R05>
Sec. 2.65  Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosure and use of records to criminally investigate or prosecute patients.

    (a) Application. An order authorizing the disclosure or use of 
patient records to criminally investigate or prosecute a patient may be 
applied for by the person holding the records or by any person 
conducting investigative or prosecutorial activities with respect to the 
enforcement of criminal laws. The application may be filed separately, 
as part of an application for a subpoena or other compulsory process, or 
in a pending criminal action. An application must use a fictitious name 
such as John Doe, to refer to any patient and may not contain or 
otherwise disclose patient identifying information unless the court has 
ordered the record of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny.
    (b) Notice and hearing. Unless an order under Sec. 2.66 is sought 
with an order under this section, the person holding the records must be 
given:
    (1) Adequate notice (in a manner which will not disclose patient 
identifying information to third parties) of an application by a person 
performing a law enforcement function;
    (2) An opportunity to appear and be heard for the limited purpose of 
providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the 
issuance of the court order; and
    (3) An opportunity to be represented by counsel independent of 
counsel for an applicant who is a person performing a law enforcement 
function.
    (c) Review of evidence: Conduct of hearings. Any oral argument, 
review of evidence, or hearing on the application shall be held in the 
judge's chambers or in some other manner which ensures that patient 
identifying information is not disclosed to anyone other than a party to 
the proceedings, the patient, or the person holding the records. The 
proceeding may include an examination by the judge of the patient 
records referred to in the application.
    (d) Criteria. A court may authorize the disclosure and use of 
patient records for the purpose of conducting a criminal investigation 
or prosecution of a patient only if the court finds that all of the 
following criteria are met:
    (1) The crime involved is extremely serious, such as one which 
causes or directly threatens loss of life or serious bodily injury 
including homicide, rape, kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a 
deadly weapon, and child abuse and neglect.
    (2) There is a reasonable likelihood that the records will disclose 
information of substantial value in the investigation or prosecution.
    (3) Other ways of obtaining the information are not available or 
would not be effective.
    (4) The potential injury to the patient, to the physician-patient 
relationship and to the ability of the program to provide services to 
other patients is outweighed by the public interest and the need for the 
disclosure.

[[Page 25]]

    (5) If the applicant is a person performing a law enforcement 
function that:
    (i) The person holding the records has been afforded the opportunity 
to be represented by independent counsel; and
    (ii) Any person holding the records which is an entity within 
Federal, State, or local government has in fact been represented by 
counsel independent of the applicant.
    (e) Content of order. Any order authorizing a disclosure or use of 
patient records under this section must:
    (1) Limit disclosure and use to those parts of the patient's record 
which are essential to fulfill the objective of the order;
    (2) Limit disclosure to those law enforcement and prosecutorial 
officials who are responsible for, or are conducting, the investigation 
or prosecution, and limit their use of the records to investigation and 
prosecution of extremely serious crime or suspected crime specified in 
the application; and
    (3) Include such other measures as are necessary to limit disclosure 
and use to the fulfillment of only that public interest and need found 
by the court.

[52 FR 21809, June 9, 1987; 52 FR 42061, Nov. 2, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 2.66  Procedures and criteria for orders authorizing disclosure and use of records to investigate or prosecute a program or the person holding the records.

    (a) Application. (1) An order authorizing the disclosure or use of 
patient records to criminally or administratively investigate or 
prosecute a program or the person holding the records (or employees or 
agents of that program or person) may be applied for by any 
administrative, regulatory, supervisory, investigative, law enforcement, 
or prosecutorial agency having jurisdiction over the program's or 
person's activities.
    (2) The application may be filed separately or as part of a pending 
civil or criminal action against a program or the person holding the 
records (or agents or employees of the program or person) in which it 
appears that the patient records are needed to provide material 
evidence. The application must use a fictitious name, such as John Doe, 
to refer to any patient and may not contain or otherwise disclose any 
patient identifying information unless the court has ordered the record 
of the proceeding sealed from public scrutiny or the patient has given a 
written consent (meeting the requirements of Sec. 2.31 of these 
regulations) to that disclosure.
    (b) Notice not required. An application under this section may, in 
the discretion of the court, be granted without notice. Although no 
express notice is required to the program, to the person holding the 
records, or to any patient whose records are to be disclosed, upon 
implementation of an order so granted any of the above persons must be 
afforded an opportunity to seek revocation or amendment of that order, 
limited to the presentation of evidence on the statutory and regulatory 
criteria for the issuance of the court order.
    (c) Requirements for order. An order under this section must be 
entered in accordance with, and comply with the requirements of, 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec. 2.64 of these regulations.
    (d) Limitations on disclosure and use of patient identifying 
information: (1) An order entered under this section must require the 
deletion of patient identifying information from any documents made 
available to the public.
    (2) No information obtained under this section may be used to 
conduct any investigation or prosecution of a patient, or be used as the 
basis for an application for an order under Sec. 2.65 of these 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 2.67  Orders authorizing the use of undercover agents and informants to criminally investigate employees or agents of a program.

    (a) Application. A court order authorizing the placement of an 
undercover agent or informant in a program as an employee or patient may 
be applied for by any law enforcement or prosecutorial agency which has 
reason to believe that employees or agents of the program are engaged in 
criminal misconduct.
    (b) Notice. The program director must be given adequate notice of 
the application and an opportunity to appear and be heard (for the 
limited purpose of

[[Page 26]]

providing evidence on the statutory and regulatory criteria for the 
issuance of the court order), unless the application asserts a belief 
that:
    (1) The program director is involved in the criminal activities to 
be investigated by the undercover agent or informant; or
    (2) The program director will intentionally or unintentionally 
disclose the proposed placement of an undercover agent or informant to 
the employees or agents who are suspected of criminal activities.
    (c) Criteria. An order under this section may be entered only if the 
court determines that good cause exists. To make this determination the 
court must find:
    (1) There is reason to believe that an employee or agent of the 
program is engaged in criminal activity;
    (2) Other ways of obtaining evidence of this criminal activity are 
not available or would not be effective; and
    (3) The public interest and need for the placement of an undercover 
agent or informant in the program outweigh the potential injury to 
patients of the program, physician-patient relationships and the 
treatment services.
    (d) Content of order. An order authorizing the placement of an 
undercover agent or informant in a program must:
    (1) Specifically authorize the placement of an undercover agent or 
an informant;
    (2) Limit the total period of the placement to six months;
    (3) Prohibit the undercover agent or informant from disclosing any 
patient identifying information obtained from the placement except as 
necessary to criminally investigate or prosecute employees or agents of 
the program; and
    (4) Include any other measures which are appropriate to limit any 
potential disruption of the program by the placement and any potential 
for a real or apparent breach of patient confidentiality; for example, 
sealing from public scrutiny the record of any proceeding for which 
disclosure of a patient's record has been ordered.
    (e) Limitation on use of information. No information obtained by an 
undercover agent or informant placed under this section may be used to 
criminally investigate or prosecute any patient or as the basis for an 
application for an order under Sec. 2.65 of these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 2a.1  Applicability.

    (a) Section 303(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
242a(a)) provides that ``[t]he Secretary [of Health and Human Services] 
may authorize persons engaged in research on mental health, including 
research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs, 
to protect the privacy of individuals who are the subject of such 
research by withholding from all persons not connected with the conduct 
of such research the names or other identifying characteristics of such 
individuals. Persons so authorized to protect the privacy of such 
individuals may not be compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, 
criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to identify 
such individuals.'' The regulations in this part establish procedures 
under which any person engaged in research on mental health including 
research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs 
(whether or not the research is federally funded) may, subject to the 
exceptions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, apply for such an 
authorization of confidentiality.
    (b) These regulations do not apply to:

[[Page 27]]

    (1) Authorizations of confidentiality for research requiring an 
Investigational New Drug exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) or to approved new 
drugs, such as methadone, requiring continuation of long-term studies, 
records, and reports. Attention is called to 21 CFR 291.505(g) relating 
to authorizations of confidentiality for patient records maintained by 
methadone treatment programs.
    (2) Authorizations of confidentiality for research which are related 
to law enforcement activities or otherwise within the purview of the 
Attorney General's authority to issue authorizations of confidentiality 
pursuant to section 502(c) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 
872(c)) and 21 CFR 1316.21.
    (c) The Secretary's regulations on confidentiality of alcohol and 
drug abuse patient records (42 CFR part 2) and the regulations of this 
part may, in some instances, concurrently cover the same transaction. As 
explained in 42 CFR 2.24 and 2.24-1, 42 CFR part 2 restricts voluntary 
disclosures of information from applicable patient records while a 
Confidentiality Certificate issued pursuant to the regulations of this 
part protects a person engaged in applicable research from being 
compelled to disclose identifying characteristics of individuals who are 
the subject of such research.


<R05>
Sec. 2a.2  Definitions.

    (a) Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and 
any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human 
Services to whom the authority involved has been delegated.
    (b) Person means any individual, corporation, government, or 
governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, partnership, 
association, or other legal entity.
    (c) Research means systematic study directed toward new or fuller 
knowledge and understanding of the subject studied. The term includes, 
but is not limited to, behavioral science studies, surveys, evaluations, 
and clinical investigations.
    (d) Drug has the meaning given that term by section 201(g)(1) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).
    (e) Controlled drug means a drug which is included in schedule I, 
II, III, IV, or V of part B of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 
811-812).
    (f) Administer refers to the direct application of a drug to the 
body of a human research subject, whether such application be by 
injection, inhalation, ingestion, or any other means, by (1) a qualified 
person engaged in research (or, in his or her presence, by his or her 
authorized agent), or (2) a research subject in accordance with 
instructions of a qualified person engaged in research, whether or not 
in the presence of a qualified person engaged in research.
    (g) Identifying characteristics refers to the name, address, any 
identifying number, fingerprints, voiceprints, photographs or any other 
item or combination of data about a research subject which could 
reasonably lead directly or indirectly by reference to other information 
to identification of that research subject.
    (h) Psychoactive drug means, in addition to alcohol, any drug which 
has as its principal action an effect on thought, mood, or behavior.


<R05>
Sec. 2a.3  Application; coordination.

    (a) Any person engaged in (or who intends to engage in) the research 
to which this part applies, who desires authorization to withhold the 
names and other identifying characteristics of individuals who are the 
subject of such research from any person or authority not connected with 
the conduct of such research may apply to the Office of the Director, 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Office of the Director, National 
Institute of Mental Health, or the Office of the Director, National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, 
Maryland 20857 for an authorization of confidentiality.
    (b) If there is uncertainty with regard to which Institute is 
appropriate or if the research project falls within the purview of more 
than one Institute, an application need be submitted only to one 
Institute. Persons who are uncertain with regard to the applicability of 
these regulations to a particular

[[Page 28]]

type of research may apply for an authorization of confidentiality under 
the regulations of this part to one of the Institutes. Requests which 
are within the scope of the authorities described in Sec. 2a.1(b) will 
be forwarded to the appropriate agency for consideration and the person 
will be advised accordingly.
    (c) An application may accompany, precede, or follow the sumission 
of a request for DHHS grant or contract assistance, though it is not 
necessary to request DHHS grant or contract assistance in order to apply 
for a Confidentiality Certificate. If a person has previously submitted 
any information required in this part in connection with a DHHS grant or 
contract, he or she may substitute a copy of information thus submitted, 
if the information is current and accurate. If a person requests a 
Confidentiality Certificate at the same time he or she submits an 
application for DHHS grant or contract assistance, the application for a 
Confidentiality Certificate may refer to the pertinent section(s) of the 
DHHS grant or contract application which provide(s) the information 
required to be submitted under this part. (See Secs. 2a.4 and 2a.5.)
    (d) A separate application is required for each research project for 
which an authorization of confidentiality is requested.


<R05>
Sec. 2a.4  Contents of application; in general.

    In addition to any other pertinent information which the Secretary 
may require, each application for an authorization of confidentiality 
for a research project shall contain:
    (a) The name and address of the individual primarily responsible for 
the conduct of the research and the sponsor or institution with which he 
or she is affiliated, if any. Any application from a person affiliated 
with an institution will be considered only if it contains or is 
accompanied by documentation of institutional approval. This 
documentation may consist of a written statement signed by a responsible 
official of the institution or of a copy of or reference to a valid 
certification submitted in accordance with 45 CFR part 46.
    (b) The location of the research project and a description of the 
facilities available for conducting the research, including the name and 
address of any hospital, institution, or clinical laboratory facility to 
be utilized in connection with the research.
    (c) The names, addresses, and summaries of the scientific or other 
appropriate training and experience of all personnel having major 
responsibilities in the research project and the training and experience 
requirements for major positions not yet filled.
    (d) An outline of the research protocol for the project including a 
clear and concise statement of the purpose and rationale of the research 
project and the general research methods to be used.
    (e) The date on which research will begin or has begun and the 
estimated date for completion of the project.
    (f) A specific request, signed by the individual primarily 
responsible for the conduct of the research, for authority to withhold 
the names and other identifying characteristics of the research subjects 
and the reasons supporting such request.
    (g) An assurance (1) From persons making application for a 
Confidentiality Certificate for a research project for which DHHS grant

    (2) Whether the project constitutes bona fide ``research'' which is 
within the scope of the regulations of this part; and
    (3) Such other factors as he or she may consider necessary and 
appropriate. All applications for Confidentiality Certificates shall be 
evaluated by the Secretary through such officers and employees of the 
Department and such experts or consultants engaged for this purpose as 
he or she determines to be appropriate.
    (b) After consideration and evaluation of an application for an 
authorization of confidentiality, the Secretary will either issue a 
Confidentiality Certificate or a letter denying a Confidentiality 
Certificate, which will set forth the reasons for such denial, or will 
request additional information from the person making application. The 
Confidentiality Certificate will include:
    (1) The name and address of the person making application;
    (2) The name and address of the individual primarily responsible for 
conducting the research, if such individual is not the person making 
application;
    (3) The location of the research project;
    (4) A brief description of the research project;
    (5) A statement that the Certificate does not represent an 
endorsement of the research project by the Secretary;
    (6) The Drug Enforcement Administration registration number for the 
project, if any; and
    (7) The date or event upon which the Confidentiality Certificate 
becomes effective, which shall not be before the later of either the 
commencement of the research project or the date of issuance of the 
Certificate, and the date or event upon which the Certificate will 
expire.
    (c) A Confidentiality Certificate is not transferable and is 
effective only with respect to the names and other identifying 
characteristics of those individuals who are the subjects of the single 
research project specified in the Confidentiality Certificate. The 
recipient of a Confidentiality Certificate shall, within 15 days of any 
completion or discontinuance of the research project which occurs prior 
to the expiration date set forth in the Certificate, provide written 
notification to the Director of the Institute to which application was 
made. If the recipient determines that the research project will not be 
completed by the expiration date set forth in the Confidentiality 
Certificate he or she may submit a written request for an extension of 
the expiration date which shall include a justification for such 
extension and a revised estimate of the date for completion of the 
project. Upon approval of such a request, the Secretary will issue an 
amended Confidentiality Certificate.
    (d) The protection afforded by a Confidentiality Certificate does 
not extend to significant changes in the research project as it is 
described in the application for such Certificate (e.g., changes in the 
personnel having major responsibilities in the research project, major 
changes in the scope or direction of the research protocol, or changes 
in the drugs to be administered and the persons who will administer 
them). The recipient of a Confidentiality Certificate shall notify the 
Director of the Institute to which application was made of any proposal 
for such a significant change by submitting an amended application for a 
Confidentiality Certificate in the same form and manner as an original 
application. On the basis of such application and other pertinent 
information the Secretary will either:
    (1) Approve the amended application and issue an amended 
Confidentiality Certificate together with a Notice of Cancellation 
terminating original the Confidentiality Certificate in accordance with 
Sec. 2a.8; or
    (2) Disapprove the amended application and notify the applicant in 
writing that adoption of the proposed significant changes will result in 
the issuance of a Notice of Cancellation terminating the original 
Confidentiality Certificate in accordance with Sec. 2a.8.

<R05>
Sec. 2a.7  Effect of Confidentiality Certificate.

    (a) A Confidentiality Certificate authorizes the withholding of the 
names and other identifying characteristics of individuals who 
participate as subjects in the research project specified in the 
Certificate while the Certificate is in effect. The authorization 
applies to all persons who, in the performance of their duties in 
connection with the research project, have access to information which 
would identify the subjects of the research. Persons so authorized may 
not, at any time, be compelled in any Federal, State, or local civil, 
criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings to identify 
the research subjects encompassed by the Certificate, except in those 
circumstances specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) A Confidentiality Certificate granted under this part does not 
authorize any person to refuse to reveal the name or other identifying 
characteristics of any research subject in the following circumstances:
    (1) The subject (or, if he or she is legally incompetent, his or her 
guardian) consents, in writing, to the disclosure of such information,
    (2) Authorized personnel of DHHS request such information for audit 
or program evaluation of a research project funded by DHHS or for 
investigation of DHHS grantees or contractors and their employees or 
agents carrying out such a project. (See 45 CFR 5.71 for confidentiality 
standards imposed on such DHHS personnel), or
    (3) Release of such information is required by the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301) or the regulations promulgated 
thereunder (title 21, Code of Federal Regulations).
    (c) Neither a Confidentiality Certificate nor the regulations of 
this part govern the voluntary disclosure of identifying characteristics 
of research subjects.


<R05>
Sec. 2a.8  Termination.

    (a) A Confidentiality Certificate is in effect from the date of its 
issuance until the effective date of its termination. The effective date 
of termination shall be the earlier of:
    (1) The expiration date set forth in the Confidentiality 
Certificate; or
    (2) Ten days from the date of mailing a Notice of Cancellation to 
the applicant, pursuant to a determination by the Secretary that the 
research project has been completed or discontinued or that retention of 
the Confidentiality Certificate is otherwise no longer necessary or 
desirable.
    (b) A Notice of Cancellation shall include: an identification of the 
Confidentiality Certificate to which it applies; the effective date of 
its termination; and the grounds for cancellation. Upon receipt of a 
Notice of Cancellation the applicant shall return the Confidentiality 
Certificate to the Secretary.
    (c) Any termination of a Confidentiality Certificate pursuant to 
this section is operative only with respect to the names and other 
identifying characteristics of individuals who begin their participation 
as research subjects after the effective date of such termination. (See 
Sec. 2a.4(k) requiring researchers to notify subjects who enter the 
project after the termination of the Confidentiality Certificate of 
termination of the Certificate). The protection afforded by a 
Confidentiality Certificate is permanent with respect to subjects who 
participated in research during any time the authorization was in 
effect.

to review the listings for their State, correct any errors of which they 
are aware, and offer their recommendations, if any, within 90 days, as 
to which geographic areas, population groups, and facilities in areas 
under their jurisdiction should be designated. An information copy of 
these listings will also be made available, upon request, to interested 
parties for their use in providing comments or recommendations to the 
Secretary and/or to the appropriate HSA, SHPDA, or Governor.
    (b) In addition, any agency or individual may request the Secretary 
to designate (or withdraw the designation of) a particular geographic 
area, population group, or facility as a health professional(s) shortage 
area. Each request will be forwarded by the Secretary to the appropriate 
HSA, SHPDA, and Governor, who will be asked to review it and offer their 
recommendations, if any, within 30 days. An information copy will also 
be made available to other interested parties, upon request, for their

chief administrative officer of the facility, who will be asked to 
review it and offer their recommendations, if any, within 30 days.
    (d) After review of the available information and consideration of 
the comments and recommendations submitted, the Secretary will designate 
health professional(s) shortage areas and withdraw the designation of 
any areas which have been determined no longer to have a shortage of 
health professional(s).

[[Page 36]]


<R05>
Sec. 5.4  Notification and publication of designations and withdrawals.

    (a) The Secretary will give written notice of the designation (or

for each type of professional(s) shortage will be published at least 
once annually.
    (c) The effective date of the designation of an area shall be the 
date of the notification letter to the individual or agency which 
requested the designation, or the date of publication in the Federal 
Register, whichever comes first.
    (d) Once an area is listed in the Federal Register as a designated 
health professional(s) shortage area, the effective date of any later 
withdrawal of the area's designation shall be the date when notification 
of the withdrawal, or an updated list of designated areas which does not

    (b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of 
FTE primary care physicians serving the institution is at least 1,000:1.
    Here the number of internees is defined as follows:
    (i) If the number of new inmates per year and the average length-of-
stay are not specified, or if the information provided does not indicate 
that intake medical examinations are routinely performed upon entry, 
then--Number of internees=average number of inmates.
    (ii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as one year or more, 
and intake medical examinations are routinely performed upon entry, 
then--Number of internees=average number of inmates+(0.3) x number of 
new inmates per year.
    (iii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as less than one 
year, and intake examinations are routinely performed upon entry, then--
Number of internees=average number of inmates+(0.2) x (1+ALOS/
2) x number of new inmates per year where ALOS=average length-of-stay 
(in fraction of year). (The number of FTE primary care physicians is 
computed as in part I, section B, paragraph 3 above.)
    2. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Designated correctional institutions will be assigned to degree-of-
shortage groups based on the number of inmates and/or the ratio (R) of 
internees to primary care physicians, as follows:
    Group 1--Institutions with 500 or more inmates and no physicians.
    Group 2--Other institutions with no physicians and institutions with 
R greater than (or equal to) 2,000:1.
    Group 3--Institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 1,000:1 but 
less than 2,000:1.
    B. Methodology.

[[Page 37]]

    In determining whether an area meets the criteria established by 
paragraph A of this part, the following methodology will be used:
    1. Rational Areas for the Delivery of Primary Medical Care Services.
    (a) The following areas will be considered rational areas for the 
delivery of primary medical care services:
    (i) A county, or a group of contiguous counties whose population 
centers are within 30 minutes travel time of each other.
    (ii) A portion of a county, or an area made up of portions of more 
than one county, whose population, because of topography, market or 
transportation patterns, distinctive population characteristics or other 
factors, has limited access to contiguous area resources, as measured 
generally by a travel time greater than 30 minutes to such resources.
    (iii) Established neighborhoods and communities within metropolitan 
areas which display a strong self-identity (as indicated by a 
homogeneous socioeconomic or demographic structure and/or a tradition of 
interaction or interdependency), have limited interaction with 
contiguous areas, and which, in general, have a minimum population of 
20,000.
    (b) The following distances will be used as guidelines in 
determining distances corresponding to 30 minutes travel time:
    (i) Under normal conditions with primary roads available: 20 miles.
    (ii) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads 
available: 15 miles.
    (iii) In flat terrain or in areas connected by interstate highways: 
25 miles.
    Within inner portions of metropolitan areas, information on the 
public transportation system will be used to determine the distance 
corresponding to 30 minutes travel time.
    2. Population Count.
    The population count used will be the total permanent resident 
civilian population of the area, excluding inmates of institutions, with 
the following adjustments, where appropriate:
    (a) Adjustments to the population for the differing health service 
requirements of various age-sex population groups will be computed using 
the table below of visit rates for 12 age-sex population cohorts. The 
total expected visit rate will first be obtained by multiplying each of 
the 12 visit rates in the table by the size of the area population 
within that particular age-sex cohort and adding the resultant 12 visit 
figures together. This total expected visit rate will then be divided by 
the U.S. average per capita visit rate of 5.1, to obtain the adjusted 
population for the area.

                                            Under 5      5-14        15-24       25-44       45-64       over   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The effect of transient populations on the need of an area for 
primary care professional(s) will be taken into account as follows:
    (i) Seasonal residents, i.e., those who maintain a residence in the 
area but inhabit it for only 2 to 8 months per year, may be included but 
must be weighted in proportion to the fraction of the year they are 
present in the area.
    (ii) Other tourists (non-resident) may be included in an area's 
population but only with a weight of 0.25, using the following formula: 
Effective tourist contribution to population=0.25 x (fraction of year 
tourists are present in area) x (average daily number of tourists during 
portion of year that tourists are present).
    (iii) Migratory workers and their families may be included in an 
area's population, using the following formula: Effective migrant 
contribution to population=(fraction of year migrants are present in 
area) x (average daily number of migrants during portion of year that 
migrants are present).
    3. Counting of Primary Care Practitioners.
    (a) All non-Federal doctors of medicine (M.D.) and doctors of 
osteopathy (D.O.) providing direct patient care who practice principally 
in one of the four primary care specialities--general or family 
practice, general internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and 
gynecology--will be counted. Those physicians engaged solely in 
administration, research, and teaching will be excluded. Adjustments for 
the following factors will be made in computing the number of full-time-
equivalent (FTE) primary care physicians:
    (i) Interns and residents will be counted as 0.1 full-time 
equivalent (FTE) physicians.
    (ii) Graduates of foreign medical schools who are not citizens or 
lawful permanent residents of the United States will be excluded from 
physician counts.
    (iii) Those graduates of foreign medical schools who are citizens or 
lawful permanent residents of the United States, but do not

[[Page 38]]

have unrestricted licenses to practice medicine, will be counted as 0.5 
FTE physicians.
    (b) Practitioners who are semi-retired, who operate a reduced 
practice due to infirmity or other limiting conditions, or who provide 
patient care services to the residents of the area only on a part-time 
basis will be discounted through the use of full-time equivalency 
figures. A 40-hour work week will be used as the standard for 
determining full-time equivalents in these cases. For practitioners 
working less than a 40-hour week, every four (4) hours (or \1/2\ day) 
spent providing patient care, in either ambulatory or inpatient 
settings, will be counted as 0.1 FTE (with numbers obtained for FTE's 
rounded to the nearest 0.1 FTE), and each physician providing patient 
care 40 or more hours a week will be counted as 1.0 FTE physician. (For 
cases where data are available only for the number of hours providing 
patient care in office settings, equivalencies will be provided in 
guidelines.)
    (c) In some cases, physicians located within an area may not be 
accessible to the population of the area under consideration. Allowances 
for physicians with restricted practices can be made, on a case-by-case 
basis. However, where only a portion of the population of the area 
cannot access existing primary care resources in the area, a population 
group designation may be more appropriate (see part II of this 
appendix).
    (d) Hospital staff physicians involved exclusively in inpatient care 
will be excluded. The number of full-time equivalent physicians 
practicing in organized outpatient departments and primary care clinics 
will be included, but those in emergency rooms will be excluded.
    (e) Physicians who are suspended under provisions of the Medicare-
Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Act for a period of eighteen months or 
more will be excluded.
    4. Determination of Unusually High Needs for Primary Medical Care 
Services.
    An area will be considered as having unusually high needs for 
primary health care services if at least one of the following criteria 
is met:
    (a) The area has more than 100 births per year per 1,000 women aged 
15-44.
    (b) The area has more than 20 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
    (c) More than 20% of the population (or of all households) have 
incomes below the poverty level.
    5. Determination of Insufficient Capacity of Existing Primary Care 
Providers. 
    An area's existing primary care providers will be considered to have 
insufficient capacity if at least two of the following criteria are met:
    (a) More than 8,000 office or outpatient visits per year per FTE 
primary care physician serving the area.
    (b) Unusually long waits for appointments for routine medical 
services (i.e., more than 7 days for established patients and 14 days 
for new patients).
    (c) Excessive average waiting time at primary care providers (longer 
than one hour where patients have appointments or two hours where 
patients are treated on a first-come, first-served basis).
    (d) Evidence of excessive use of emergency room facilities for 
routine primary care.
    (e) A substantial proportion (2/3 or more) of the area's physicians 
do not accept new patients.
    (f) Abnormally low utilization of health services, as indicated by 
an average of 2.0 or less office visits per year on the part of the 
area's population.
    6. Contiguous Area Considerations. 
    Primary care professional(s) in areas contiguous to an area being 
considered for designation will be considered excessively distant, 
overutilized or inaccessible to the population of the area under 
consideration if one of the following conditions prevails in each 
contiguous area:
    (a) Primary care professional(s) in the contiguous area are more 
than 30 minutes travel time from the population center(s) of the area 
being considered for designation (measured in accordance with paragraph 
B.1(b) of this part).
    (b) The contiguous area population-to-full-time-equivalent primary 
care physician ratio is in excess of 2000:1, indicating that 
practitioners in the contiguous area cannot be expected to help 
alleviate the shortage situation in the area being considered for 
designation.
    (c) Primary care professional(s) in the contiguous area are 
inaccessible to the population of the area under consideration because 
of specified access barriers, such as:
    (i) Significant differences between the demographic (or socio-
economic) characteristics of the area under consideration and those of 
the contiguous area, indicating that the population of the area under 
consideration may be effectively isolated from nearby resources. This 
isolation could be indicated, for example, by an unusually high 
proportion of non-English-speaking persons.
    (ii) A lack of economic access to contiguous area resources, as 
indicated particularly where a very high proportion of the population of 
the area under consideration is poor (i.e., where more than 20 percent 
of the population or the households have incomes below the poverty 
level), and Medicaid-covered or public primary care services are not 
available in the contiguous area.
    C. Determination of Degree of Shortage. 
    Designated areas will be assigned to degree-of-shortage groups, 
based on the ratio (R) of population to number of full-time equivalent 
primary care physicians and the presence or absence of unusually high 
needs

[[Page 39]]

for primary health care services, according to the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    High needs not        High needs    
                                       indicated           indicated    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Group 1.........................  No physicians.....  No physicians; or 
                                                       R5,000           
Group 2.........................  R5,000............  5,000>R4,000      
Group 3.........................  5,000>R4,000......  4,000>R3,500      
Group 4.........................  4,000>R3,500......  3,500>R3,000      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    D. Determination of size of primary care physician shortage. Size of 
Shortage (in number of FTE primary care physicians needed) will be 
computed using the following formulas:
    (1) For areas without unusually high need or insufficient capacity:
Primary care physician shortage=area population/3,500-number of FTE 
primary care physicians
    (2) For areas with unusually high need or insufficient capacity:
Primary care physician shortage=area population/3,000-number of FTE 
primary care physicians

                       Part II--Population Groups

    A. Criteria.
    1. In general, specific population groups within particular 
geographic areas will be designated as having a shortage of primary 
medical care professional(s) if the following three criteria are met:
    (a) The area in which they reside is rational for the delivery of 
primary medical care services, as defined in paragraph B.1 of part I of 
this appendix.
    (b) Access barriers prevent the population group from use of the 
area's primary medical care providers. Such barriers may be economic, 
linguistic, cultural, or architectural, or could involve refusal of some 
providers to accept certain types of patients or to accept Medicaid 
reimbursement.
    (c) The ratio of the number of persons in the population group to 
the number of primary care physicians practicing in the area and serving 
the population group is at least 3,000 : 1.
    2. Indians and Alaska Natives will be considered for designation as 
having shortages of primary care professional(s) as follows:
    (a) Groups of members of Indian tribes (as defined in section 4(d) 
of Pub. L. 94-437, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976) are 
automatically designated.
    (b) Other groups of Indians or Alaska Natives (as defined in section 
4(c) of Pub. L. 94-437) will be designated if the general criteria in 
paragraph A are met.
    B. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Each designated population group will be assigned to a degree-of-
shortage group, based on the ratio (R) of the group's population to the 
number of primary care physicians serving it, as follows:

Group 1--No physicians or R>5,000.
Group 2--5,000>R<gr-thn-eq>4,000.
Group 3--4,000>R<gr-thn-eq>3,500.
Group 4--3,500>R<gr-thn-eq>3,000.

    Population groups which have received ``automatic'' designation will 
be assigned to degree-of-shortage group 4 if no information on the ratio 
of the number of persons in the group to the number of FTE primary care 
physicians serving them is provided.
    C. Determination of size of primary care physician shortage. Size of 
shortage (in number of primary care physicians needed) will be computed 
as follows:
    Primary care physician shortage=number of persons in population 
group/3,000-number of FTE primary care physicians

                          Part III--Facilities

    A. Federal and State Correctional Institutions.
    1. Criteria.
    Medium to maximum security Federal and State correctional 
institutions and youth detention facilities will be designated as having 
a shortage of primary medical care professional(s) if both the following 
criteria are met:
    (a) The institution has at least 250 inmates.
    (b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of 
FTE primary care physicians serving the institution is at least 1,000:1. 
(Here the number of internees is the number of inmates present at the 
beginning of the year plus the number of new inmates entering the 
institution during the year, including those who left before the end of 
the year; the number of FTE primary care physicians is computed as in 
part I, section B, paragraph 3 above.)
    2. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Designated correctional institutions will be assigned to degree-of-
shortage groups based on the number of inmates and/or the ratio (R) of 
internees to primary care physicians, as follows:

Group 1--Institutions with 500 or more inmates and no physicians.
Group 2--Other institutions with no physicians and institutions with 
R<gr-thn-eq>2,000.
Group 3--Institutions with 2,000>R<gr-thn-eq>1,000.

    B. Public or Non-Profit Medical Facilities.
    1. Criteria.
    Public or non-profit private medical facilities will be designated 
as having a shortage of primary medical care professional(s) if:
    (a) the facility is providing primary medical care services to an 
area or population group designated as having a primary care 
professional(s) shortage; and
    (b) the facility has insufficient capacity to meet the primary care 
needs of that area or population group.
    2. Methodology

[[Page 40]]

    In determining whether public or nonprofit private medical 
facilities meet the criteria established by paragraph B.1 of this Part, 
the following methodology will be used:
    (a) Provision of Services to a Designated Area or Population Group.
    A facility will be considered to be providing services to a 
designated area or population group if either:
    (i) A majority of the facility's primary care services are being 
provided to residents of designated primary care professional(s) 
shortage areas or to population groups designated as having a shortage 
of primary care professional(s); or
    (ii) The population within a designated primary care shortage area 
or population group has reasonable access to primary care services 
provided at the facility. Reasonable access will be assumed if the area 
within which the population resides lies within 30 minutes travel time 
of the facility and non-physical barriers (relating to demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics of the population) do not prevent the 
population from receiving care at the facility.
    Migrant health centers (as defined in section 319(a)(1) of the Act) 
which are located in areas with designated migrant population groups and 
Indian Health Service facilities are assumed to be meeting this 
requirement.
    (b) Insufficient capacity to meet primary care needs.
    A facility will be considered to have insufficient capacity to meet 
the primary care needs of the area or population it serves if at least 
two of the following conditions exist at the facility:
    (i) There are more than 8,000 outpatient visits per year per FTE 
primary care physician on the staff of the facility. (Here the number of 
FTE primary care physicians is computed as in Part I, Section B, 
paragraph 3 above.)
    (ii) There is excessive usage of emergency room facilities for 
routine primary care.
    (iii) Waiting time for appointments is more than 7 days for 
established patients or more than 14 days for new patients, for routine 
health services.
    (iv) Waiting time at the facility is longer than 1 hour where 
patients have appointments or 2 hours where patients are treated on a 
first-come, first-served basis.
    3. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Each designated medical facility will be assigned to the same 
degree-of-shortage group as the designated area or population group 
which it serves.

Appendix B to Part 5--Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages 
                        of Dental Professional(s)

                        Part I--Geographic Areas

    A. Federal and State Correctional Institutions.
    1. Criteria
    Medium to maximum security Federal and State correctional 
institutions and youth detention facilities will be designated as having 
a shortage of dental professional(s) if both the following criteria are 
met:
    (a) The institution has at least 250 inmates.
    (b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of 
FTE dentists serving the institution is at least 1,500:1.
    Here the number of internees is defined as follows:
    (i) If the number of new inmates per year and the average length-of-
stay are not specified, or if the information provided does not indicate 
that intake dental examinations are routinely performed by dentists upon 
entry, then--Number of internees=average number of inmates.
    (ii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as one year or more, 
and intake dental examinations are routinely performed upon entry, 
then--Number of internees=average number of inmates+number of new 
inmates per year.
    (iii) If the average length-of-stay is specified as less than one 
year, and intake dental examinations are routinely performed upon entry, 
then--Number of internees=average number of inmates+\1/
3\ x (1+2 x ALOS) x number of new inmates per year where ALOS=average 
length-of-stay (in fraction of year).

    (The number of FTE dentists is computed as in part I, section B, 
paragraph 3 above.)

    2. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Designated correctional institutions will be assigned to degree-of-
shortage groups based on the number of inmates and/or the ratio (R) of 
internees to dentists, as follows:
    Group 1--Institutions with 500 or more inmates and no dentists.
    Group 2--Other institutions with no dentists and institutions with R 
greater than (or equal to) 3,000:1.
    Group 3--Institutions with R greater than (or equal to) 1,500:1 but 
less than 3,000:1.
    B. Methodology.
    In determining whether an area meets the criteria established by 
paragraph A of this part, the following methodology will be used:
    1. Rational Area for the Delivery of Dental Services.
    (a) The following areas will be considered rational areas for the 
delivery of dental health services:

[[Page 41]]

    (i) A county, or a group of several contiguous counties whose 
population centers are within 40 minutes travel time of each other.
    (ii) A portion of a county (or an area made up of portions of more 
than one county) whose population, because of topography, market or 
transportation patterns, distinctive population characteristics, or 
other factors, has limited access to contiguous area resources, as 
measured generally by a travel time of greater than 40 minutes to such 
resources.
    (iii) Established neighborhoods and communities within metropolitan 
areas which display a strong self-identity (as indicated by a homogenous 
socioeconomic or demographic structure and/or a traditional of 
interaction or intradependency), have limited interaction with 
contiguous areas, and which, in general, have a minimum population of 
20,000.
    (b) The following distances will be used as guidelines in 
determining distances corresponding to 40 minutes travel time:
    (i) Under normal conditions with primary roads available: 25 miles.
    (ii) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads 
available: 20 miles.
    (iii) In flat terrain or in areas connected by interstate highways: 
30 miles.
    Within inner portions of metropolitan areas, information on the 
public transportation system will be used to determine the distance 
corresponding to 40 minutes travel time.
    2. Population Count.
    The population count use will be the total permanent resident 
civilian population of the area, excluding inmates of institutions, with 
the following adjustments:
    (a) Seasonal residents, i.e., those who maintain a residence in the 
area but inhabit it for only 2 to 8 months per year, may be included but 
must be weighted in proportion to the fraction of the year they are 
present in the area.
    (b) Migratory workers and their families may be included in an 
area's population using the following formula: Effective migrant 
contribution to population=(fraction of year migrants are present in 
area) x (average daily number of migrants during portion of year that 
migrants are present).
    3. Counting of Dental Practitioners.
    (a) All non-Federal dentists providing patient care will be counted, 
except in those areas where it is shown that specialists (those dentists 
not in general practice or pedodontics) are serving a larger area and 
are not addressing the general dental care needs of the area under 
consideration.
    (b) Full-time equivalent (FTE) figures will be used to reflect 
productivity differences among dental practices based on the age of the 
dentists, the number of auxiliaries employed, and the number of hours 
worked per week. In general, the number of FTE dentists will be computed 
using weights obtained from the matrix in Table 1, which is based on the 
productivity of dentists at various ages, with different numbers of 
auxiliaries, as compared with the average productivity of all dentists. 
For the purposes of these determinations, an auxiliary is defined as any 
non-dentist staff employed by the dentist to assist in operation of the 
practice.

     Table 1--Equivalency Weights, by Age and Number of Auxiliaries     
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            <55    55-59   60-64    65+ 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
No auxiliaries..........................     0.8     0.7     0.6     0.5
One auxiliary...........................     1.0     0.9     0.8     0.7
Two auxiliaries.........................     1.2     1.0     1.0     0.8
Three auxiliaries.......................     1.4     1.2     1.0     1.0
Four or more auxiliaries................     1.5     1.5     1.3     1.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If information on the number of auxiliaries employed by the dentist 
is not available, Table 2 will be used to compute the number of full-
time equivalent dentists.

                  Table 2--Equivalency Weights, by Age                  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            55     55-59   60-64    65+ 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equivalency weights.....................     1.2     0.9     0.8     0.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The number of FTE dentists within a particular age group (or age/
auxiliary group) will be obtained by multiplying the number of dentists 
within that group by its corresponding equivalency weight. The total 
supply of FTE dentists within an area is then computed as the sum of 
those dentists within each age (or age/auxiliary) group.
    (c) The equivalency weights specified in tables 1 and 2 assume that 
dentists within a particular group are working full-time (40 hours per 
week). Where appropriate data are available, adjusted equivalency 
figures for dentists who are semi-retired, who operate a reduced 
practice due to infirmity or other limiting conditions, or who are 
available to the population of an area only on a part-time basis will be 
used to reflect the reduced availability of these dentists. In computing 
these equivalency figures, every 4 hours (or \1/2\ day) spent in the 
dental practice will be counted as 0.1 FTE except that each dentist 
working more than 40 hours a week will be counted as 1.0. The count 
obtained for a particular age group of dentists will then be multiplied 
by the appropriate equivalency weight from table 1 or 2 to obtain a 
full-time equivalent figure for dentists within that particular age or 
age/auxiliary category.
    4. Determination of Unusually High Needs for Dental Services.
    An area will be considered as having unusually high needs for dental 
services if at least one of the following criteria is met:

[[Page 42]]

    (a) More than 20% of the population (or of all households) has 
incomes below the poverty level.
    (b) The majority of the area's population does not have a 
fluoridated water supply.
    5. Determination of Insufficient Capacity of Existing Dental Care 
Providers.
    An area's existing dental care providers will be considered to have 
insufficient capacity if at least two of the following criteria are met:
    (a) More than 5,000 visits per year per FTE dentist serving the 
area.
    (b) Unusually long waits for appointments for routine dental 
services (i.e., more than 6 weeks).
    (c) A substantial proportion (\2/3\ or more) of the area's dentists 
do not accept new patients.
    6. Contiguous Area Considerations.
    Dental professional(s) in areas contiguous to an area being 
considered for designation will be considered excessively distant, 
overutilized or inaccessible to the population of the area under 
consideration if one of the following conditions prevails in each 
contiguous area:
    (a) Dental professional(s) in the contiguous area are more than 40 
minutes travel time from the center of the area being considered for 
designation (measured in accordance with Paragraph B.1.(b) of this 
part).
    (b) Contiguous area population-to-(FTE) dentist ratios are in excess 
of 3,000 : 1, indicating that resources in contiguous areas cannot be 
expected to help alleviate the shortage situation in the area being 
considered for designation.
    (c) Dental professional(s) in the contiguous area are inaccessible 
to the population of the area under consideration because of specified 
access barriers, such as:
    (i) Significant differences between the demographic (or 
socioeconomic) characteristics of the area under consideration and those 
of the contiguous area, indicating that the population of the area under 
consideration may be effectively isolated from nearby resources. Such 
isolation could be indicated, for example, by an unusually high 
proportion of non-English-speaking persons.
    (ii) A lack of economic access to contiguous area resources, 
particularly where a very high proportion of the population of the area 
under consideration is poor (i.e., where more than 20 percent of the 
population or of the households have incomes below the poverty level) 
and Medicaid-covered or public dental services are not available in the 
contiguous area.
    C. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    The degree of shortage of a given geographic area, designated as 
having a shortage of dental professional(s), will be determined using 
the following procedure:
    Designated areas will be assigned to degree-of-shortage groups, 
based on the ratio (R) of population to number of full-time-equivalent 
dentists and the presence or absence of unusually high needs for dental 
services, or insufficient capacity of existing dental care providers 
according to the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     High needs or                      
                                     insufficient        High needs or  
                                     capacity not        insufficient   
                                       indicated      capacity indicated
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Group 1.........................  No dentists.......  No dentists or    
                                                       R8,000.          
Group 2.........................  R8,000............  8,000>R6,000.     
Group 3.........................  8,000>R6,000......  6,000>R5,000.     
Group 4.........................  6,000>R5,000......  5,000>R4,000.     
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    D. Determination of size of dental shortage. Size of Dental Shortage 
(in number of FTE dental practitioners needed) will be computed using 
the following formulas:
    (1) For areas without unusually high need:
Dental shortage=area population/5,000-number of FTE dental practitioners
    (2) For areas with unusually high need:
Dental shortage=area population/4,000-number of FTE dental practitioners

                       Part II--Population Groups

    A. Criteria.
    1. In general, specified population groups within particular 
geographic areas will be designated as having a shortage of dental care 
professional(s) if the following three criteria are met:
    a. The area in which they reside is rational for the delivery of 
dental care services, as defined in paragraph B.1 of part I of this 
appendix.
    b. Access barriers prevent the population group from use of the 
area's dental providers.
    c. The ratio (R) of the number of persons in the population group to 
the number of dentists practicing in the area and serving the population 
group is at least 4,000:1.
    2. Indians and Alaska Natives will be considered for designation as 
having shortages of dental professional(s) as follows:
    (a) Groups of members of Indian tribes (as defined in section 4(d) 
of Pub. L. 94-437, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976) are 
automatically designated.
    (b) Other groups of Indians or Alaska Natives (as defined in section 
4(c) of Pub. L. 94-437) will be designated if the general criteria in 
paragraph 1 are met.
    B. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Each designated population group will be assigned to a degree-of-
shortage group as follows:

Group 1--No dentists or R<gr-thn-eq>8,000.
Group 2--8,000>R<gr-thn-eq>6,000.
Group 3--6,000>R<gr-thn-eq>5,000.

[[Page 43]]

Group 4--5,000>R<gr-thn-eq>4,000.

Population groups which have received ``automatic'' designation will be 
assigned to degree-of-shortage group 4 unless information on the ratio 
of the number of persons in the group to the number of FTE dentists 
serving them is provided.
    C. Determination of size of dental shortage. Size of dental shortage 
will be computed as follows:
Dental shortage=number of persons in population group/4,000-number of 
FTE dental practitioners

                          Part III--Facilities

    A. Federal and State Correctional Institutions.
    1. Criteria.
    Medium to maximum security Federal and State correctional 
institutions and youth detention facilities will be designated as having 
a shortage of dental professional(s) if both the following criteria are 
met:
    (a) The institution has at least 250 inmates.
    (b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of 
FTE dentists serving the institution is at least 1,500:1. (Here the 
number of internees is the number of inmates present at the beginning of 
the year plus the number of new inmates entering the institution during 
the year, including those who left before the end of the year; the 
number of FTE dentists is computed as in part I, section B, paragraph 3 
above.)
    2. Determination of Degree-of-Shortage.
    Designated correctional institutions will be assigned to degree-of-
shortage groups as follows, based on number of inmates and/or the ratio 
(R) of internees to dentists:

Group 1--Institutions with 500 or more inmates and no dentists.
Group 2--Other institutions with no dentists and institutions with R 
<SUP>> 3,000.
Group 3--Institutions with 3,000 <SUP>> R <SUP>> 1,500.

    B. Public or Non-Profit Private Dental Facilities.
    1. Criteria.
    Public or nonprofit private facilties providing general dental care 
services will be designated as having a shortage of dental 
professional(s) if both of the following criteria are met:
    (a) The facility is providing general dental care services to an 
area or population group designated as having a dental professional(s) 
shortage; and
    (b) The facility has insufficent capacity to meet the dental care 
needs of that area or population group.
    2. Methodology.
    In determining whether public or nonprofit private facilities meet 
the criteria established by paragraph B.1. of this part, the following 
methodology will be used:
    (a) Provision of Services to a Designated Area or Population Group.
    A facility will be considered to be providing services to an area or 
population group if either:
    (i) A majority of the facility's dental care services are being 
provided to residents of designated dental professional(s) shortage 
areas or to population groups designated as having a shortage of dental 
professional(s); or
    (ii) The population within a designated dental shortage area or 
population group has reasonable access to dental services provided at 
the facility. Reasonable access will be assumed if the population lies 
within 40 minutes travel time of the facility and non-physical barriers 
(relating to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the 
population) do not prevent the population from receiving care at the 
facility.
    Migrant health centers (as defined in section 319(a)(1) of the Act) 
which are located in areas with designated migrant population groups and 
Indian Health Service facilities are assumed to be meeting this 
requirement.
    (b) Insufficient Capacity To Meet Dental Care Needs.
    A facility will be considered to have insufficient capacity to meet 
the dental care needs of a designated area or population group if either 
of the following conditions exists at the facility.
    (i) There are more than 5,000 outpatient visits per year per FTE 
dentist on the staff of the facility. (Here the number of FTE dentists 
is computed as in part I, section B, paragraph 3 above.)
    (ii) Waiting time for appointments is more than 6 weeks for routine 
dental services.
    3. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Each designated dental facility will be assigned to the same degree-
of-shortage group as the designated area or population group which it 
serves.

Appendix C to Part 5--Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages 
                     of Mental Health Professionals

                        Part I--Geographic Areas

    A. Criteria. A geographic area will be designated as having a 
shortage of mental health professionals if the following four criteria 
are met:
    1. The area is a rational area for the delivery of mental health 
services.
    2. One of the following conditions prevails within the area:
    (a) The area has--
    (i) A population-to-core-mental-health-professional ratio greater 
than or equal to

[[Page 44]]

6,000:1 and a population-to-psychiatrist ratio greater than or equal to 
20,000:1, or
    (ii) A population-to-core-professional ratio greater than or equal 
to 9,000:1, or
    (iii) A population-to-psychiatrist ratio greater than or equal to 
30,000:1;
    (b) The area has unusually high needs for mental health services, 
and has--
    (i) A population-to-core-mental-health-professional ratio greater 
than or equal to 4,500:1 and
    A population-to-psychiatrist ratio greater than or equal to 
15,000:1, or
    (ii) A population-to-core-professional ratio greater than or equal 
to 6,000:1, or
    (iii) A population-to-psychiatrist ratio greater than or equal to 
20,000:1;
    3. Mental health professionals in contiguous areas are overutilized, 
excessively distant or inaccessible to residents of the area under 
consideration.

    B. Methodology.
    In determining whether an area meets the criteria established by 
paragraph A of this part, the following methodology will be used:
    1. Rational Areas for the Delivery of Mental Health Services.
    (a) The following areas will be considered rational areas for the 
delivery of mental health services:
    (i) An established mental health catchment area, as designated in 
the State Mental Health Plan under the general criteria set forth in 
section 238 of the Community Mental Health Centers Act.
    (ii) A portion of an established mental health catchment area whose 
population, because of topography, market and/or transportation patterns 
or other factors, has limited access to mental health resources in the 
rest of the catchment area, as measured generally by a travel time of 
greater than 40 minutes to these resources.
    (iii) A county or metropolitan area which contains more than one 
mental health catchment area, where data are unavailable by individual 
catchment area.
    (b) The following distances will be used as guidelines in 
determining distances corresponding to 40 minutes travel time:
    (i) Under normal conditions with primary roads available: 25 miles.
    (ii) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads 
available: 20 miles.
    (iii) In flat terrain or in areas connected by interstate highways: 
30 miles.
    Within inner portions of metropolitan areas, information on the 
public transportation system will be used to determine the distance 
corresponding to 40 minutes travel time.
    2. Population Count.
    The population count used will be the total permanent resident 
civilian population of the area, excluding inmates of institutions.
    3. Counting of mental health professionals. (a) All non-Federal core 
mental health professionals (as defined below) providing mental health 
patient care (direct or other, including consultation and supervision) 
in ambulatory or other short-term care settings to residents of the area 
will be counted. Data on each type of core professional should be 
presented separately, in terms of the number of full-time-equivalent 
(FTE) practitioners of each type represented.
    (b) Definitions:
    (i) Core mental health professionals or core professionals includes 
those psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, 
psychiatric nurse specialists, and marriage and family therapists who 
meet the definitions below.
    (ii) Psychiatrist means a doctor of medicine (M.D.) or doctor of 
osteopathy (D.O.) who
    (A) Is certified as a psychiatrist or child psychiatrist by the 
American Medical Specialities Board of Psychiatry and Neurology or by 
the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry, or, if not 
certified, is ``broad-eligible'' (i.e., has successfully completed an 
accredited program of graduate medical or osteopathic education in 
psychiatry or child psychiatry); and
    (B) Practices patient care psychiatry or child psychiatry, and is 
licensed to do so, if required by the State of practice.
    (iii) Clinical psychologist means an individual (normally with a 
doctorate in psychology) who is practicing as a clinical or counseling 
psychologist and is licensed or certified to do so by the State of 
practice; or, if licensure or certification is not required in the State 
of practice, an individual with a doctorate in psychology and two years 
of supervised clinical or counseling experience. (School psychologists 
are not included.)
    (iv) Clinical social worker means an individual who--
    (A) Is certified as a clinical social worker by the American Board 
of Examiners in Clinical Social Work, or is listed on the National 
Association of Social Workers' Clinical Register, or has a master's 
degree in social work and two years of supervised clinical experience; 
and
    (B) Is licensed to practice as a social worker, if required by the 
State of practice.
    (v) Psychiatric nurse specialist means a registered nurse (R.N.) 
who--
    (A) Is certified by the American Nurses Association as a psychiatric 
and mental health clinical nurse specialist, or has a master's degree in 
nursing with a specialization in psychiatric/mental health and two years 
of supervised clinical experience; and
    (B) Is licensed to practice as a psychiatric or mental health nurse 
specialist, if required by the State of practice.
    (vi) Marriage and family therapist means an individual (normally 
with a master's or doctoral degree in marital and family therapy

[[Page 45]]

and at least two years of supervised clinical experience) who is 
practicing as a marital and family therapist and is licensed or 
certified to do so by the State of practice; or, if licensure or 
certification is not required by the State of practice, is eligible for 
clinical membership in the American Association for Marriage and Family 
Therapy.
    (c) Practitioners who provide patient care to the population of an 
area only on a part-time basis (whether because they maintain another 
office elsewhere, spend some of their time providing services in a 
facility, are semi-retired, or operate a reduced practice for other 
reasons), will be counted on a partial basis through the use of full-
time-equivalency calculations based on a 40-hour week. Every 4 hours (or 
\1/2\ day) spent providing patient care services in ambulatory or 
inpatient settings will be counted as 0.1 FTE, and each practitioner 
providing patient care for 40 or more hours per week as 1.0 FTE. Hours 
spent on research, teaching, vocational or educational counseling, and 
social services unrelated to mental health will be excluded; if a 
practitioner is located wholly or partially outside the service area, 
only those services actually provided within the area are to be counted.
    (d) In some cases, practitioners located within an area may not be 
accessible to the general population of the area under consideration. 
Practitioners working in restricted facilities will be included on an 
FTE basis based on time spent outside the facility. Examples of 
restricted facilities include correctional institutions, youth detention 
facilities, residential treatment centers for emotionally disturbed or 
mentally retarded children, school systems, and inpatient units of State 
or county mental hospitals.
    (e) In cases where there are mental health facilities or 
institutions providing both inpatient and outpatient services, only 
those FTEs providing mental health services in outpatient units or other 
short-term care units will be counted.
    (f) Adjustments for the following factors will also be made in 
computing the number of FTE providers:
    (i) Practitioners in residency programs will be counted as 0.5 FTE.
    (ii) Graduates of foreign schools who are not citizens or lawful 
permanent residents of the United States will be excluded from counts.
    (iii) Those graduates of foreign schools who are citizens or lawful 
permanent residents of the United States, and practice in certain 
settings, but do not have unrestricted licenses to practice, will be 
counted on a full-time-equivalency basis up to a maximum of 0.5 FTE.
    (g) Practitioners suspended for a period of 18 months or more under 
provisions of the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Act will not be 
counted.
    4. Determination of unusually high needs for mental health services. 
An area will be considered to have unusually high needs for mental 
health services if one of the following criteria is met:
    (a) 20 percent of the population (or of all households) in the area 
have incomes below the poverty level.
    (b) The youth ratio, defined as the ratio of the number of children 
under 18 to the number of adults of ages 18 to 64, exceeds 0.6.
    (c) The elderly ratio, defined as the ratio of the number of persons 
aged 65 and over to the number of adults of ages 18 to 64, exceeds 0.25.
    (d) A high prevalence of alcoholism in the population, as indicated 
by prevalence data showing the area's alcoholism rates to be in the 
worst quartile of the nation, region, or State.
    (e) A high degree of substance abuse in the area, as indicated by 
prevalence data showing the area's substance abuse to be in the worst 
quartile of the nation, region, or State.
    5. Contiguous area considerations. Mental health professionals in 
areas contiguous to an area being considered for designation will be 
considered excessively distant, overutilized or inaccessible to the 
population of the area under consideration if one of the following 
conditions prevails in each contiguous area:
    (a) Core mental health professionals in the contiguous area are more 
than 40 minutes travel time from the closest population center of the 
area being considered for designation (measured in accordance with 
paragraph B.1(b) of this part).
    (b) The population-to-core-mental-health-professional ratio in the 
contiguous area is in excess of 3,000:1 and the population-to-
psychiatrist ratio there is in excess of 10,000:1, indicating that core 
mental health professionals in the contiguous areas are overutilized and 
cannot be expected to help alleviate the shortage situation in the area 
for which designation is being considered. (If data on core mental 
health professionals other than psychiatrists are not available for the 
contiguous area, a population-to-psychiatrist ratio there in excess of 
20,000:1 may be used to demonstrate overutilization.)
    (c) Mental health professionals in contiguous areas are inaccessible 
to the population of the requested area due to geographic, cultural, 
language or other barriers or because of residency restrictions of 
programs or facilities providing such professionals.
    C. Determination of degree of shortage. Designated areas will be 
assigned to degree-of-shortage groups according to the following table, 
depending on the ratio (R<INF>C) of population to number of FTE core-
mental-health-service providers (FTE<INF>C); the ratio (R<INF>P) of 
population to number of FTE psychiatrists

[[Page 46]]

(FTE<INF>P); and the presence or absence of high needs:

                        High Needs Not Indicated

Group 1--FTE<INF>C=0 and FTE<INF>P=0
Group 2--R<INF>C gte * 6,000:1 and FTE<INF>P=0
Group 3--R<INF>C gte 6,000:1 and R<INF>P gte 20,000
Group 4(a)--For psychiatrist placements only: All other areas with 
FTE<INF>P=0 or R<INF>P gte 30,000
Group 4(b)--For other mental health practitioner placements: All other 
areas with R<INF>C gte 9,000:1.

    * Note: ``gte'' means ``greater than or equal to''.

                          High Needs Indicated

Group 1--FTE<INF>C=0 and FTE<INF>P=0
Group 2--R<INF>C gte 4,500:1 and FTE<INF>P=0
Group 3--R<INF>C gte 4,500:1 and R<INF>P gte 15,000
Group 4(a)--For psychiatrist placements only: All other areas with 
FTE<INF>P=0 or R<INF>P gte 20,000
Group 4(b)--For other mental health practitioner placements: All other 
areas with R<INF>C gte 6,000:1.
    D. Determination of Size of Shortage. Size of Shortage (in number of 
FTE professionals needed) will be computed using the following formulas:
    (1) For areas without unusually high need:

Core professional shortage=area population/6,000-number of FTE core 
professionals
Psychiatrist shortage=area population/20,000-number of FTE psychiatrists

    (2) For areas with unusually high need:

Core professional shortage=area population/4,500-number of FTE core 
professionals
Psychiatrist shortage=area population/15,000-number of FTE psychiatrists

                       Part II--Population Groups

    A. Criteria. Population groups within particular rational mental 
health service areas will be designated as having a mental health 
professional shortage if the following criteria are met:
    1. Access barriers prevent the population group from using those 
core mental health professionals which are present in the area; and
    2. One of the following conditions prevails:
    (a) The ratio of the number of persons in the population group to 
the number of FTE core mental health professionals serving the 
population group is greater than or equal to 4,500:1 and the ratio of 
the number of persons in the population group to the number of FTE 
psychiatrists serving the population group is greater than or equal to 
15,000:1; or,
    (b) The ratio of the number of persons in the population group to 
the number of FTE core mental health professionals serving the 
population group is greater than or equal to 6,000:1; or,
    (c) The ratio of the number of persons in the population group to 
the number of FTE psychiatrists serving the population group is greater 
than or equal to 20,000:1.
    B. Determination of degree of shortage. Designated population groups 
will be assigned to the same degree-of-shortage groups defined in part 
I.C of this appendix for areas with unusually high needs for mental 
health services, using the computed ratio (R<INF>C) of the number of 
persons in the population group to the number of FTE core mental health 
service providers (FTE<INF>C) serving the population group, and the 
ration (R<INF>P) of the number of persons in the population group to the 
number of FTE psychiatrists (FTE<INF>P) serving the population group.
    C. Determination of size of shortage. Size of shortage will be 
computed as follows:
Core professional shortage=number of persons in population group/
4,500-number of FTE core professionals
Psychiatrist shortage=number of persons in population group/
15,000-number of FTE psychiatrists

                          Part III--Facilities

    A. Federal and State Correctional Institutions
    1. Criteria.
    Medium to maximum security Federal and State correctional 
institutions for adults or youth, and youth detention facilities, will 
be designated as having a shortage of psychiatric professional(s) if 
both of the following criteria are met:
    (a) The institution has more than 250 inmates, and
    (b) The ratio of the number of internees per year to the number of 
FTE psychiatrists serving the institution is at least 2,000:1. (Here the 
number of internees is the number of inmates or residents present at the 
beginning of the year, plus the number of new inmates or residents 
entering the institution during the year, including those who left 
before the end of the year; the number of FTE psychiatrists is computed 
as in part I, section B, paragraph 3 above.)
    2. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Correctional facilities and youth detention facilities will be 
assigned to degree-of-shortage groups, based on the number of inmates 
and/or the ratio (R) of internees to FTE psychiatrists, as follows:

    Group 1--Facilities with 500 or more inmates or residents and no 
psychiatrist.
    Group 2--Other facilities with no psychiatrists and facilities with 
500 or more inmates or residents and R>3,000.
    Group 3--All other facilities.

    B. State and County Mental Hospitals.
    1. Criteria.
    A State or county hospital will be designated as having a shortage 
of psychiatric professional(s) if both of the following criteria are 
met:

[[Page 47]]

    (a) The mental hospital has an average daily inpatient census of at 
least 100; and
    (b) The number of workload units per FTE psychiatrists available at 
the hospital exceeds 300, where workload units are calculated using the 
following formula:
    Total workload units = average daily inpatient census + 2  x  
(number of inpatient admissions per year) + 0.5  x  (number of 
admissions to day care and outpatient services per year).
    2. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    State or county mental hospitals will be assigned to degree-of-
shortage groups, based on the ratio (R) of workload units to number of 
FTE psychiatrists, as follows:

    Group 1--No psychiatrists, or R>1,800.
    Group 2--1,800>R>1,200.
    Group 3--1,200>R>600.
    Group 4--600>R>300.

    C. Community Mental Health Centers and Other Public or Nonprofit 
Private Facilities.
    1. Criteria.
    A community mental health center (CMHC), authorized by Pub. L. 94-
63, or other public or nonprofit private facility providing mental 
health services to an area or population group, may be designated as 
having a shortage of psychiatric professional(s) if the facility is 
providing (or is responsible for providing) mental health services to an 
area or population group designated as having a mental health 
professional(s), and the facility has insufficient capacity to meet the 
psychiatric needs of the area or population group.
    2. Methodology.
    In determining whether CMHCs or other public or nonprofit private 
facilities meet the criteria established in paragraph C.1 of this Part, 
the following methodology will be used.
    (a) Provision of Services to a Designated Area or Population Group.
    The facility will be considered to be providing services to a 
designated area or population group if either:
    (i) A majority of the facility's mental health services are being 
provided to residents of designated mental health professional(s) 
shortage areas or to population groups designated as having a shortage 
of mental health professional(s); or
    (ii) The population within a designated psychiatric shortage area or 
population group has reasonable access to mental health services 
provided at the facility. Such reasonable access will be assumed if the 
population lies within 40 minutes travel time of the facility and 
nonphysical barriers (relating to demographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics of the population) do not prevent the population from 
receiving care at the facility.
    (b) Responsibility for Provision of Services.
    This condition will be considered to be met if the facility, by 
Federal or State statute, administrative action, or contractual 
agreement, has been given responsibility for providing and/or 
coordinating mental health services for the area or population group, 
consistent with applicable State plans.
    (c) Insufficient capacity to meet mental health service needs. A 
facility will be considered to have insufficient capacity to meet the 
mental health service needs of the area or population it serves if:
    (i) There are more than 1,000 patient visits per year per FTE core 
mental health professional on staff of the facility, or
    (ii) There are more than 3,000 patient visits per year per FTE 
psychiatrist on staff of the facility, or
    (iii) No psychiatrists are on the staff and this facility is the 
only facility providing (or responsible for providing) mental health 
services to the designated area or population.
    3. Determination of Degree-of-Shortage.
    Each designated facility will be assigned to the same degree-of-
shortage group as the designated area or population group which it 
serves.

Appendix D to Part 5--Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages 
                     of Vision Care Professional(s)

                        Part I--Geographic Areas

    A. Criteria.
    A geographic area will be designated as having a shortage of vision 
care professional(s) if the following three criteria are met:
    1. The area is a rational area for the delivery of vision care 
services.
    2. The estimated number of optometric visits supplied by vision care 
professional(s) in the area is less than the estimated requirements of 
the area's population for these visits, and the computed shortage is at 
least 1,500 optometric visits.
    3. Vision care professional(s) in contiguous areas are excessively 
distant, overutilized, or inaccessible to the population of the area 
under consideration.
    B. Methodology.
    In determining whether an area meets the criteria established by 
paragraph A of this part, the following methodology will be used:
    1. Rational Areas for the Delivery of Vision Care Services.
    (a) The following areas will be considered rational areas for the 
delivery of vision care services:
    (i) A county, or a group of contiguous counties whose population 
centers are within 40 minutes travel time of each other;

[[Page 48]]

    (ii) A portion of a county (or an area made up of portions of more 
than one county) whose population, because of topography, market or 
transportation patterns, or other factors, has limited access to 
contiguous area resources, as measured generally by a travel time of 
greater than 40 minutes to these resources.
    (b) The following distances will be used as guidelines in 
determining distances corresponding to 40 minutes travel time:
    (i) Under normal conditions with primary roads available: 25 miles.
    (ii) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads 
available: 20 miles.
    (iii) In flat terrain or in areas connected by interstate highways: 
30 miles.
    Within inner portions of metropolitan areas, information on the 
public transportation system will be used to determine the distance 
corresponding to 40 minutes travel time.
    2. Determination of Estimated Requirement for Optometric Visits.
    The number of optometric visits required by an area's population 
will be estimated by multiplying each of the following visit rates by 
the size of the population within that particular age group and then 
adding the figures obtained together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              Annual number of optometric visits required per person, by age    
                                         -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Age                                                                                  60 and  
                                           Under 20      20-29       30-39       40-49       50-59       over   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of visits........................        0.11        0.20        0.24        0.35        0.41        0.48
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For geographic areas where the age distribution of the population is 
not known, it will be assumed that the percentage distribution, by age 
groups, for the area is the same as the distribution for the county of 
which it is a part.
    (3) Determination of Estimated Supply of Optometric Visits.
    The estimated supply of optometric services will be determined by 
use of the following formula:

    Optometric visits supplied = 3,000  x  (number of optometrists under 
65)
    Optometric visits supplied + 2,000  x  (number of optometrists 65 
and over)
    Optometric visits supplied + 1,500  x  (number of ophthamologists)

    (4) Determination of Size of Shortage.
    Size of shortage (in number of optometric visits) will be computed 
as follows:
    Optometric visit shortage = visits required - visits supplied
    (5) Contiguous Area Considerations.
    Vision care professional(s) in area contiguous to an area being 
considered for designation will be considered execessively distant, 
overutilized or inaccessible to the population of the area if one of the 
following conditions prevails in each contiguous area:
    (a) Vision care professional(s) in the contiguous area are more than 
40 minutes travel time from the center of the area being considered for 
designation (measured in accordance with paragraph B.1(b) of this part).
    (b) The estimated requirement for vision care services in the 
contiguous area exceeds the estimated supply of such services there, 
based on the requirements and supply calculations previously described.
    (c) Vision care professional(s) in the contiguous area are 
inaccessible to the population of the area because of specified access 
barriers (such as economic or cultural barriers).
    C. Determination of Degree-of-Shortage.
    Designated areas (and population groups) will be assigned to degree-
of-shortage groups, based on the ratio of optometric visits supplied to 
optometric visits required for the area (or group), as follows:

    Group 1--Areas (or groups) with no optometric visits being supplied 
(i.e., with no optometrists or ophthalmologists).
    Group 2--Areas (or groups) where the ratio of optometric visits 
supplied to optometric visits required is less than 0.5.
    Group 3--Areas (or groups) where the ratio of optometric visits 
supplied to optometric visits required is between 0.5 and 1.0.

                       Part II--Population Groups

    A. Criteria.
    Population groups within particular geographic areas will be 
designated if both the following criteria are met:
    (1) Members of the population group do not have access to vision 
care resources within the area (or in contiguous areas) because of non-
physical access barriers (such as economic or cultural barriers).
    (2) The estimated number of optometric visits supplied to the 
population group (as determined under paragraph B.3 of part I of this 
Appendix) is less than the estimated number of visits required by that 
group (as determined under paragraph B.2 of part I of this Appendix), 
and the computed shortage is at least 1,500 optometric visits.
    B. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    The degree of shortage of a given population group will be 
determined in the same way as described for areas in paragraph C of part 
I of this appendix.

[[Page 49]]



Appendix E to Part 5--Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages 
                      of Podiatric Professional(s)

                        Part I--Geographic Areas

    A. Criteria.
    A geographic area will be designated as having a shortage of 
podiatric professional(s) if the following three criteria are met:
    1. The area is a rational area for the delivery of podiatric 
services.
    2. The area's ratio of population to foot care practitioners is at 
least 28,000:1, and the computed podiatrist shortage to meet this ratio 
is at least 0.5.
    3. Podiatric professional(s) in contiguous areas are overutilized, 
excessively distant, or inaccessible to the population of the area under 
consideration.
    B. Methodology.
    In determining whether an area meets the criteria established by 
paragraph A of this Part, the following methodology will be used:
    1. Rational Areas for the Delivery of Podiatric Services.
    (a) The following areas will be considered rational areas for the 
delivery of podiatric services:
    (i) A county or a group of contiguous counties whose population 
centers are within 40 minutes travel time of each other.
    (ii) A portion of a county, or an area made up of portions of more 
than one county, whose population, because of topography, market and/or 
transportation patterns or other factors, has limited access to 
contiguous area resources, as measured generally by a travel time of 
greater than 40 minutes from its population center to these resources.
    (b) The following distances will be used as guidelines in 
determining distances corresponding to 40 minutes travel time:
    (i) Under normal conditions with primary roads available: 25 miles.
    (ii) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads 
available: 20 miles.
    (iii) In flat terrain or in areas connected by interstate highways: 
30 miles.
    Within inner portions of metropolitan areas, information on the 
public transportation system will be used to determine the area 
corresponding to 40 minutes travel time.
    2. Population Count.
    The population count used will be the total permanent resident 
civilian population of the area, excluding inmates of institutions, 
adjusted by the following formula to take into account the differing 
utilization rates of podiatric services by different age groups within 
the population:

Adjusted population=total population  x  (1 + 2.2  x  (percent of 
          population 65 and over) - 0.44  x  (percent of population 
          under 17)).

    3. Counting of Foot Care Practitioners.
    (a) All podiatrists providing patient care will be counted. However, 
in order to take into account productivity differences in podiatric 
practices associated with the age of the podiatrists, the following 
formula will be utilized:

Number of FTE podiatrists = 1.0  x  (podiatrists under age 55)
+ .8  x  (podiatrists age 55 and over)

    (b) In order to take into account the fact that orthopedic surgeons 
and general and family practitioners devote a percentage of their time 
to foot care, the total available foot care practitioners will be 
computed as follows:

Number of foot care practitioners = number of FTE podiatrists
+ .15  x  (number of orthopedic surgeons)
+ .02  x  (number of general and family practioners).

    4. Determination of Size of Shortage.
    Size of shortage (in number of FTE podiatrists) will be computed as 
follows:

Podiatrist shortage = adjusted population/28,000 - number of FTE foot 
          care practitioners.

    5. Contiguous Area Considerations.
    Podiatric professional(s) in areas contiguous to an area being 
considered for designation will be considered excessively distant, 
overutilized or inaccessible to the population of the area under 
consideration if one of the following conditions prevails in each 
contiguous area:
    (a) Podiatric professional(s) in the contiguous area are more than 
40 minutes travel time from the center of the area being considered for 
designation.
    (b) The population-to-foot care practitioner ratio in the contiguous 
areas is in excess of 20,000 : 1, indicating that contiguous area 
podiatric professional(s) cannot be expected to help alleviate the 
shortage situation in the area for which designation is requested.
    (c) Podiatric professional(s) in the contiguous area are 
inaccessible to the population of the area under consideration because 
of specified access barriers (such as economic or cultural barriers).
    C. Determination of Degree of Shortage.
    Designated areas will be assigned to groups, based on the ratio (R) 
of adjusted population to number of foot care practitioners, as follows:

Group 1 Areas with no foot care practitioners, and areas with R > 50,000 
          and no podiatrists.

[[Page 50]]

Group 2 Other areas with R > 50,000.
Group 3 Areas with 50,000 > R > 28,000.

Appendix F to Part 5--Criteria for Designation of Areas Having Shortages 
                       of Pharmacy Professional(s)

                        Part I--Geographic Areas

    A. Criteria.
    A geographic area will be designated as having a shortage of 
pharmacy professional(s) if the following three criteria are met:
    1. The area is a rational area for the delivery of pharmacy 
services.
    2. The number of pharmacists serving the area is less than the 
estimated requirement for pharmacists in the area, and the computed 
pharmacist shortage is at least 0.5.
    3. Pharmacists in contiguous areas are overutilized or excessively 
distant from the population of the area under consideration.
    B. Methodology.
    In determining whether an area meets the criteria established by 
paragraph A of this Part, the following methodology will be used:
    1. Rational Areas for the Delivery of Pharmacy Services.
    (a) The following areas will be considered rational areas for the 
delivery of pharmacy services:
    (i) A county, or a group of contiguous counties whose population 
centers are within 30 minutes travel time of each other; and
    (ii) A portion of a county, or an area made up of portions of more 
than one county, whose population, because of topography, market or 
transportation patterns or other factors, has limited access to 
contiguous area resources, as measured generally by a travel time of 
greater than 30 minutes to these resources.
    (b) The following distances will be used as guidelines in 
determining distances corresponding to 30 minutes travel time:
    (i) Under normal conditions with primary roads available: 20 miles.
    (ii) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads 
available: 15 miles.
    (iii) In flat terrain or in areas connected by interstate highways: 
25 miles.
    Within inner portions of metropolitan areas, information on the 
public transportation system will be used to determine the area 
corresponding to 30 minutes travel time.
    2. Counting of Pharmacists.
    All active pharmacists within the area will be counted, except those 
engaged in teaching, administration, or pharmaceutical research.
    3. Determination of Estimated Requirement for Pharmacists.
    (a) Basic estimate. The basic estimated requirement for pharmacists 
will be calculated as follows:

Basic pharmacist requirement = .15  x  (resident civilian population/
          1,000) + .035  x  (total number of physicians engaged in 
          patient care in the area).

    (b) Adjusted estimate. For areas with less than 20,000 persons, the 
following adjustment is made to the basic estimate to compensate for the 
lower expected productivity of small practices.

Estimated pharmacist requirement = (2 - population/20,000)  x  basic 
          pharmacist requirement.

    4. Size of Shortage Computation.
    The size of the shortage will be computed as follows:

Pharmacist shortage = estimated pharmacist requirement - number of 
          pharmacists available.
    5. Contiguous Area Considerations.
    Pharmacists in areas contiguous to an area being considered for 
designation will be considered excessively distant or overutilized if 
either:
    (a) Pharmacy professional(s) in contiguous areas are more than 30 
minutes travel time from the center of the area under consideration, or
    (b) The number of pharmacists in each contiguous area is less than 
or equal to the estimated requirement for pharmacists for that 
contiguous area (as computed above).
    C. Determination of Degree-of-Shortage.
    Designated areas will be assigned to degree-of-shortage groups, 
based on the proportion of the estimated requirement for pharmacists 
which is currently available in the area, as follows:

    Group 1--Areas with no pharmacists.
    Group 2--Areas where the ratio of available pharmacists to 
pharmacists required is less than 0.5.
    Group 3--Areas where the ratio of available pharmacists to 
pharmacists required is between 0.5 and 1.0.

   Appendix G to Part 5--Criteria for the Designation of Areas Having 
                 Shortages of Veterinary Professional(s)

                        Part I--Geographic Areas

    A. Criteria for Food Animal Veterinary Shortage.
    A geographic area will be designated as having a shortage of food 
animal veterinary professional(s) if the following three criteria are 
met:
    1. The area is a rational area for the delivery of veterinary 
services.
    2. The ratio of veterinary livestock units to food animal 
veterinarians in the area is at

[[Page 51]]

least 10,000 : 1, and the computed food animal veterinarian shortage to 
meet this ratio is at least 0.5.
    3. Food animal veterinarians in contiguous areas are overutilized or 
excessively distant from the population of the area under consideration.
    B. Criteria for Companion Animal Veterinary Shortage.
    A geographic area will be designated as having a shortage of 
companion animal veterinary professional(s) if the following three 
criteria are met:
    1. The area is a rational area for the delivery of veterinary 
services.
    2. The ratio of resident civilian population to number of companion 
animal veterinarians in the area is at least 30,000 : 1 and the computed 
companion animal veterinary shortage to meet this ratio is at least 0.5.
    3. Companion animal veterinarians in contiguous areas are 
overutilized or excessively distant from the population of the area 
under consideration.
    C. Methodology.
    In determining whether an area meets the criteria established by 
paragraphs A and B of this part, the following methodology will be used:
    1. Rational Areas for the Delivery of Veterinary Services.
    (a) The following areas will be considered rational areas for the 
delivery of veterinary services:
    (i) A county, or a group of contiguous counties whose population 
centers are within 40 minutes travel time of each other.
    (ii) A portion of a county (or an area made up of portions of more 
than one county) which, because of topography, market and/or 
transportation patterns or other factors, has limited access to 
contiguous area resources, as measured generally by a travel time of 
greater than 40 minutes to these resources.
    (b) The following distances will be used as guidelines in 
determining distances corresponding to 40 minutes travel time:
    (i) Under normal conditions with primary roads available: 25 miles.
    (ii) In mountainous terrain or in areas with only secondary roads 
available: 20 miles.
    (iii) In flat terrain or in areas connected by interstate highways: 
30 miles.
    2. Determination of Number of Veterinary Livestock Units (VLU) 
Requiring Care.
    Since various types of food animals require varying amounts of 
veterinary care, each type of animal has been assigned a weight 
indicating the amount of veterinary care it requires relative to that 
required by a milk cow. Those weights are used to compute the number of 
``Veterinary Livestock Units'' (VLU) for which veterinary care is 
required.
    The VLU is computed as follows:

Veterinary Livestock Units (VLU)=(number of milk cows)
+.2 x (number of other cattle and calves)
+.05 x (number of hogs and pigs)
+.05 x (number of sheep)
+.002 x (number of poultry).

    3. Counting of Food Animal Veterinarians.
    The number of food animal veterinarians is determined by weighting 
the number of veterinarians within each of several practice categories 
according to the average fraction of practice time in that category 
which is devoted to food animal veterinary care, as follows:

Number of Food Animal Veterinarians=(number of veterinarians in large 
          animal practice, exclusively)
+(number of veterinarians in bovine practice, exclusively)
+(number of veterinarians in poultry practice, exclusively)
+.75 x (mixed practice veterinarians with greater than 50% of practice 
          in large animal care)
+.5 x (mixed practice veterinarians with approximately 50% of practice 
          in large animal care)
+.25 x (mixed practice veterinarians with less than 50% of practice in 
          large animal care).

    4. Counting of Companion Animal Veterinarians (that is, those who 
provide services for dogs, cats, horses, and any other animals 
maintained as companions to the owner rather than as food animals).
    The number of full-time equivalent companion animal veterinarians is 
determined by weighting the number of veterinarians within each of 
several practice categories by the average portion of their practice 
which is devoted to companion animal care by the practitioners within 
that category, as follows:

Number of Companion Animal Veterinarians=(number of veterinarians in 
          large animal practice, exclusively)
+(number of veterinarians in equine practice, exclusively)
+.75 x (mixed practice veterinarians with greater than 50% of practice 
          in small animal care)
+.5 x (mixed practice veterinarians with approximately 50% of practice 
          in small animal care)
+.25 x (mixed practice veterinarians with less than 50% of practice in 
          small animal care).

    5. Size of Shortage Computation.
    The size of shortage will be computed as follows:
    (a) Food animal veterinarian shortage=(VLU/10,000)-(number of food 
animal veterinarians).

[[Page 52]]

    (b) Companion animal veterinarian shortage=(resident civilian pop./
30,000)-(number of companion animal veterinarians).
    6. Contiguous Area Considerations.
    Veterinary professional(s) in areas contiguous to an area being 
considered for designation will be considered excessively distant from 
the population of the area or overutilized if one of the following 
conditions prevails in each contiguous area:
    (a) Veterinary professional(s) in the contiguous area are more than 
60 minutes travel time from the center of the area being considered for 
designation (measured in accordance with paragraph C.1.(b) of this 
part).
    (b) In the case of food animal veterinary professional(s), the VLU-
to-food animal veterinarian ratio in the contiguous area is in excess of 
5,000 : 1.
    (c) In the case of companion animal veterinary professional(s), the 
population-to-companion animal veterinarian ratio in the contiguous area 
is in excess of 15,000 : 1.
    C. Determination of Degree-of-Shortage.
    Designated areas will be assigned to degree-of-shortage groups as 
follows:

    Group 1--Areas with a food animal veterinarian shortage and no 
veterinarians.
    Group 2--Areas (not included above) with a food animal veterinarian 
shortage and no food animal veterinarians.
    Group 3--All other food animal veterinarian shortage areas.
    Group 4--All companion animal shortage areas (not included above) 
having no veterinarians.
    Group 5--All other companion animal shortage areas.

an eligible grantee and only for those services carried out under the 
grant funded project.

<R05>
Sec. 6.4  Covered individuals.

    (a) Officers and employees of a covered entity are eligible for 
coverage under this part.
    (b) Contractors of a covered entity who are physicians or other 
licensed or certified health care practitioners are eligible for 
coverage under this part if they meet the requirements of section 
224(g)(5) of the Act.
    (c) An individual physician or other licensed or certified health 
care practitioner who is an officer, employee, or contractor of a 
covered entity will not be covered for acts or omissions occurring after 
receipt by the entity employing such individual of notice of a final 
determination by the Attorney General that he or she is no longer 
covered by this part, in accordance with section 224(i) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 6.5  Deeming process for eligible entities.

    Eligible entities will be covered by this part only on and after the 
effective date of a determination by the Secretary that they meet the 
requirements of section 224(h) of the Act. In making such determination, 
the Secretary will receive such assurances and conduct such 
investigations as he or she deems necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 6.6  Covered acts and omissions.

    (a) Only acts and omissions occurring on and after the effective 
date of the Secretary's determination under Sec. 6.5 and before the 
later date specified in section 224(g)(3) of the Act are covered by this 
part.
    (b) Only claims for damage for personal injury, including death, 
resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related 
functions are covered by this part.
    (c) With respect to covered individuals, only acts and omissions 
within the scope of their employment (or contract for services) are 
covered. If a covered individual is providing services which are not on 
behalf of the covered entity, such as on a volunteer basis or on behalf 
of a third-party (except as described in paragraph (d) of this section), 
whether for pay or otherwise, acts and omissions which are related to 
such services are not covered.
    (d) Only acts and omissions related to the grant-supported activity 
of entities are covered. Acts and omissions related to services provided 
to individuals who are not patients of a covered entity will be covered 
only if the Secretary determines that:
    (1) The provision of the services to such individuals benefits 
patients of the entity and general populations that could be served by 
the entity through community-wide intervention efforts within the 
communities served by such entity;
    (2) The provision of the services to such individuals facilitates 
the provision of services to patients of the entity; or
    (3) Such services are otherwise required to be provided to such 
individuals under an employment contract or similar arrangement between 
the entity and the covered individual.
    (e) Examples. The following are examples of situations within the 
scope of paragraph (d) of this section:
    (1) A community health center deemed to be a covered entity 
establishes a school-based or school-linked health program as part of 
its grant supported activity. Even though the students treated are not 
necessarily registered patients of the center, the center and its health 
care practitioners will be covered for services provided, if the 
Secretary makes the determination in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (2) A migrant health center requires its physicians to obtain staff 
privileges at a community hospital. As a condition of obtaining such 
privileges, and thus being able to admit the center's patients to the 
hospital, the physicians must agree to provide occasional coverage of 
the hospital's emergency room. The Secretary would be authorized to 
determine that this coverage is necessary to facilitate the provision of 
services to the grantee's patients, and that it would therefore be 
covered by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (3) A homeless health services grantee makes arrangements with local 
community providers for after-hours coverage of its patients. The 
grantee's physicians are required by their employment contracts to 
provide periodic cross-coverage for patients of these

[[Page 54]]

providers, in order to make this arrangement feasible. The Secretary may 
determine that the arrangement is within the scope of paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section.

direct costs (such as salaries and equipment), indirect costs (such as 
rent, telephone service, and a proportionate share of management and 
administrative costs), and the costs of particular ingredients. Charges 
may vary over time and between different biological standards or 
biological preparations, depending upon the cost of ingredients and the 
complexity of production. An up-to-date schedule of charges is available

active duty, he may, prior to being appointed or called to active duty,

Corps may be required to perform successfully a clinical or other 
practical demonstration which, if required, shall constitute a part of 
the professional examination.


<R05>
Sec. 21.45   Rating values.

    The examination of every candidate for appointment to any grade in 
the Regular Corps shall be rated by a board appointed pursuant to 
Sec. 21.30 in accordance with such relative values for each part of the 
examination as are prescribed by the Surgeon General. No candidate who 
receives a final rating below 80 shall be appointed in the Regular 
Corps.


<R05>
Sec. 21.46   Merit roll.

    Each board appointed pursuant to Sec. 21.30 to consider the 
qualifications of candidates for appointment as officers shall assign a 
numerical rating to each candidate for appointment in the Regular Corps 
who passes the examination, and shall submit a report to the Surgeon 
General of the ratings and the relative standing of all such candidates 
for each grade in each profession or specialty within a profession. The 
Surgeon General shall submit each such report with his recommendations 
to the Secretary, and, if approved by the Secretary, the report shall 
constitute a merit roll from which the Secretary shall, in accordance 
with relative standing, recommend available persons to the President for 
nomination as commissioned officers of the Regular Corps. A board may 
consider any newly discovered evidence relating to the physical, 
professional, or personal qualifications of any candidate examined for 
appointment. Upon recommendation of such board after review of such 
evidence, the Surgeon General, with the approval of the Secretary, may 
correct the rating of a candidate or may qualify or disqualify a 
candidate. The placing of a candidate's name on a merit roll shall give 
no assurance of an appointment. A merit roll shall expire when a new 
merit roll in the same profession or specialty within a profession and 
grade has been established, but no merit roll shall continue in effect 
longer than two years after its approval by the Secretary. Every 
candidate who has not been nominated by the President for appointment 
prior to the expiration of a merit roll on which his name appears, 
shall, unless he requests the opportunity to be reexamined, be rated 
with the next group of candidates of the same profession or specialty 
within a profession for appointment in the same grade and shall be given 
the same rating he had on the expired merit roll. If two candidates who 
were examined at the same time receive the same numerical rating the 
elder candidate shall assume relative standing on the merit roll over 
the younger candidate. If a candidate whose name is being transferred 
from an expired to a new merit roll has the same numerical rating as a 
candidate whose name is being placed on the new merit roll for the first 
time, the former shall assume relative standing on the merit roll over 
the latter. The name of a candidate may be removed from a merit roll in 
the event that he refuses an appointment when offered. No candidate's 
eligibility for appointment shall exceed two years unless he again 
becomes eligible as the result of another examination.

Sec. 21.47   Examination; anticipation of meeting qualifications.

    A potential candidate for appointment in any grade in the Regular 
Corps may be examined within a period of nine months prior to the date 
upon which it is anticipated that he will qualify for appointment under 
this subpart. Upon successful completion of the examination, his name 
will be entered on a merit roll. In the event that his name, in order of 
relative standing among all candidates, precedes that of fully qualified 
candidates, his name, for purpose of appointment, shall be passed over 
in favor of fully qualified candidates until such time as he becomes 
fully qualified, but in no event shall he otherwise lose his relative 
standing on the merit roll, except as provided in Sec. 21.46. If the 
candidate fails to qualify for appointment at the time that it was 
anticipated that he would qualify, his name shall be removed from the 
merit roll.

administration and management relating to the functions of the Service. 
All such candidates shall be subject to the same eligibility 
requirements for original appointment as are applicable to other 
candidates, except that such a candidate may substitute experience in 
administration or management for the requirement of professional 
training or experience.


<R05>
Sec. 21.52   Waiver of entrance qualifications for original appointment in time of war or national emergency.

    If, in time of war or national emergency proclaimed by the 
President, the Secretary determines that there is need for commissioned 
personnel to meet the needs of the Service, other than persons eligible 
for examination for original appointment under the eligibility 
requirements prescribed in this subpart, he may prescribe standards of 
eligibility for examination for the original appointment of officers in 
the Reserve Corps without regard to such eligibility requirements. Such 
standards shall, however, authorize the examination only of candidates 
with specialized experience in administration or management or 
candidates with training or experience in fields relating to public 
health. The permanent grade of an officer who becomes eligible for 
examination for appointment pursuant to such standards and who becomes 
eligible for appointment after passage of an examination shall be 
limited to the junior assistant or the assistant grade, except that, if 
upon examination a candidate is found to be exceptionally qualified for 
the performance of highly specialized duties with the Service pursuant 
to Sec. 21.55, he may be recommended for appointment to any grade up to 
and including the director grade.

<R05>
Sec. 21.53   Examination.

    The examination of candidates for original appointment as officers 
to any grade in the Reserve Corps shall consist of a review and 
evaluation of their academic and other education and their training and 
experience. In the discretion of the Surgeon General the examination of 
any such candidate may include an oral interview, a written examination, 
or both.


<R05>
Sec. 21.54   Students.

    A potential candidate for appointment in the Regular Corps who is 
pursuing a course of instruction which, upon completion, would qualify 
him under Sec. 21.25 or Sec. 21.26 for examination for appointment in 
the junior assistant or assistant grade may be examined for and 
appointed in the Reserve Corps in the junior assistant grade but shall 
not be called to extended active duty until the successful completion of 
such course of instruction, except that: (a) He may be called to active 
duty for purposes of training for periods not to exceed 120 days during 
any fiscal year, and (b) those students who have completed at least 3 
years of collegiate or professional study leading to the qualifying 
degree for appointment may be called to active duty for the purpose of 
completing the requirements of Sec. 21.25(a)(3). An appointment made 
under this subpart shall be terminated upon the officer's failure to 
continue a full-time course of study or failure to meet the requirements 
of Sec. 21.25(a)(3) within 18 months after entering on active duty.

[34 FR 706, Jan. 17, 1969]


<R05>
Sec. 21.55   Appointment to higher grades; candidates exceptionally qualified in specialized fields.

    Any candidate eligible for examination for appointment in the grade 
of assistant pursuant to Sec. 21.26 who, upon examination for such 
purpose, is found

[[Page 61]]

exceptionally qualified for the performance of duties requiring highly 
specialized training or experience may be recommended for appointment in 
the Reserve Corps in any grade up to and including the director grade 
without regard to the additional years of postgraduate training or 
experience prescribed for grades above the assistant grade.


<R05>
Sec. 21.56   Reappointment.

    An officer of the Reserve Corps, after being examined and found 
qualified for reappointment, may be recommended for reappointment to the 
same grade in the event that his commission expires before he becomes 
eligible for reappointment to a higher grade, or may be recommended for 
reappointment to a higher grade to be effective on or after the date on 
which he meets the qualifications prescribed in this subpart for 
original appointment to such higher grade.


<R05>
Sec. 21.57   Examination for reappointment.

    The examination of an officer of the Reserve Corps on active duty 
who is being considered for reappointment in such corps shall consist of 
a review and evaluation of his record with the Service. The examination 
of an officer of the Reserve Corps on inactive duty who is being 
considered for reappointment in such corps shall consist of (a) a review 
and evaluation of his record with the Service while on active duty, if 
any, and (b) the record of his training or experience during the period 
of his inactive duty preceding such examination. In the discretion of 
the Surgeon General the examination for reappointment of an officer, 
whether on active or inactive duty, may include an oral interview.


<R05>
Sec. 21.58   Physical examination for reappointment.

    Every officer of the Reserve Corps being considered for 
reappointment shall undergo such physical examination as the Surgeon 
General may direct. An officer on active duty may be recommended for 
reappointment unless he is found to have a physical disability which is 
determined to render him physically unfit to perform the duties of his 
office under section 402 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, as 
amended. An officer may be recommended for promotion only if he meets 
the physical qualifications for original appointment. If an officer is 
not available to be physically examined because of circumstances which 
make it impracticable for the Service to require such examination, he 
may, in the discretion of the Surgeon General, be reappointed without 
such examination, but shall be examined as soon thereafter as 
practicable and his physical qualification or disqualification for 
continued or future active service shall be determined on the same basis 
as if the physical examination had been given prior to reappointment.

<R05>
Sec. 21.73  Policy.

    (a) It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services 
to withhold allotments from pay and allowances of commissioned officers 
on active duty in the Service to make involuntary allotments from pay 
and allowances as payment of child, or child and spousal, support 
payments when the officer has failed to make periodic payments under a 
support order in a total amount equal to the support payable for two 
months or longer. Failure to make such payments shall be established by 
notice from an authorized person to the designated official of the 
Department. Such notice shall specify the name and address of the payee 
to whom the allotment is payable. The amount of the allotment shall be 
the amount necessary to comply with the support order including amounts 
for arrearages as well as for current support. However the amount of the 
allotment, when added to any other amounts withheld from the officer's 
pay pursuant to a support order, shall not exceed the limits for 
involuntary allotments from pay as prescribed in section 303 (b) and (c) 
of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 1673. An allotment 
under this Subpart shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from 
any authorized person.
    (b) Notwithstanding the above, no action shall be taken to withhold 
an allotment from the pay and allowances of any officer until such 
officer has had an opportunity to consult with a legal officer of the 
Department to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect 
to the officer's support obligation and his or her failure to make 
payments. The Department shall exercise continuing good faith efforts to 
arrange such a consultation, but must begin to withhold allotments on 
the first end-of-month payday after 30 days have elapsed since notice of 
an opportunity to consult was sent to the officer.


<R05>
Sec. 21.74  Responsibilities.

    (a) The General Counsel, Office of the Secretary, Department of 
Health and Human Services, shall be the Designated Official for the 
Department and shall provide guidance to the Service regarding 
administration of the provisions of these regulations.
    (b) The Commissioned Personnel Operations Division, Office of 
Personnel

[[Page 63]]

Management, Office of Management, Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Health, shall implement the provisions of these regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 21.75  Procedures.

    (a) Service of notice. (1) An authorized person shall serve on the 
designated official of the Department a signed notice including:
    (i) Full name of the officer;
    (ii) Social security number of the officer;
    (iii) Duty station location of the officer, if known.
    (iv) A statement that support payments are delinquent by an amount 
at least equal to the amount of support payable for two months;
    (v) A photocopy, along with any modifications, of the underlying 
support order;
    (vi) A statement of the amount of arrearages provided for in the 
court order and the amount which is to be applied each month toward 
liquidation of the arrearages, if applicable;
    (vii) The full name and address of the payee to whom the allotment 
will be payable;
    (viii) Any limitations on the duration of the support allotment.
    (2) The service of notice shall be accomplished by certified or 
registered mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service, upon 
the appropriate designated official of the Department. The designated 
official shall note the date and time of receipt on the notice.
    (3) Valid service is not accomplished until the notice is received 
in the office of the designated official.
    (4) If the order of a court or duly authorized administrative agency 
seeks collection of arrearages, the notice must state that the support 
allotment qualifies for the additional 5 percent in excess of the 
maximum percentage limitations found in 15 U.S.C. 1673. Supporting 
evidence must be submitted to the Department establishing that the 
support order is 12 or more weeks in arrears.
    (5) When the information submitted is not sufficient to identify the 
officer the notice shall be returned directly to the authorized person 
with an explanation of the deficiency. However, before returning the 
notice, an attempt should be made to inform the authorized person who 
caused the notice to be served that it will not be honored unless 
adequate information is supplied.
    (6) Upon proper service of notice of delinquent support payments and 
together with all required supplementary documents and information, the 
Service shall identify the officer from whom moneys are due and payable. 
The pay of the officer shall be reduced by the amount necessary to 
comply with the support order and liquidate arrearages if any, if 
provided by order of a court or duly authorized administrative agency. 
The maximum amount to be alloted under the provision together with any 
other moneys withheld from the officer for support pursuant to a court 
order may not exceed:
    (i) 50 percent of the officer's disposable earnings for any month 
when the officer asserts by affidavit or other acceptable evidence that 
he or she is supporting a spouse or dependent child or both, other than 
a party in the support order. When the officer submits evidence, copies 
shall be sent to the authorized person, together with notification that 
the officer's support claim will be honored. If the support claim is 
contested by the authorized person, the authorized person may refer it 
to the appropriate court or other authority for resolution. Pending 
resolution of a contested support claim, the allotment shall be made but 
the amount of such allotment may not exceed 50 percent of the officer's 
disposable earnings;
    (ii) 60 percent of the officer's disposable earnings for any month 
when the officer fails to assert by affidavit or other acceptable 
evidence, that he or she is supporting a spouse or dependent child or 
both;
    (iii) Regardless of the limitations above, an additional five 
percent of the officer's disposable earnings shall be withheld when it 
is stated in the notice that the officer is in arrears in an amount 
equivalent to 12 or more weeks' support.
    (b) Disposable earnings. (1) The following moneys, as defined in the

Social Security Act when the withholding is required by law;
    (ii) FICA.
    (3) Properly withheld for Federal and State income tax purposes if 
the withholding of the amounts is authorized or required by law and if 
amounts withheld are not greater than would be the case if the 
individual claimed all dependents to which he or she were entitled. The 
withholding of additional amounts pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 3402(i) may be 
permitted only when the officer presents evidence of a tax obligation 
which supports the additional withholding.
    (4) Deducted for the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance coverage.
    (5) Advances of pay that may be due and payable by the officer in 
the future.
    (d) Officer Notification. (1) As soon as possible, but not later

his or her duty station, written notice:
    (i) That notice has been served, including a copy of the documents 
submitted;
    (ii) Of the maximum limitations set forth, with a request that the 
officer submit supporting affidavits or other documentation necessary 
for determining the applicable percentage limitation;
    (iii) That by submitting supporting affidavits or other necessary 
documentation, the officer consents to the disclosure of such 
information to the party requesting the support allotment;
    (iv) Of the amount of percentage that will be deducted if the 
officer fails to submit the documentation necessary to enable the 
designated official of the Service to respond to the legal process 
within the time limits set forth;
    (v) That a consultation with a legal officer is authorized and will 
be provided by the Department. The name, address, and telephone number 
of the legal officer will be provided;
    (vi) That the officer may waive the personal consultation with a 
legal officer; however if consultation is waived action will be taken to 
initiate the allotment by the first end-of-month payday after 
notification is received that the officer has waived his/her 
consultation.
    (vii) That the allotment will be initiated without the officer 
having received a personal consultation with a legal officer if the 
legal officer provides documentation that consultation could not be 
arranged even though good faith attempts to do so had been made; and
    (viii) Of the date that the allotment is scheduled to begin.
    (2) The Commissioned Personnel Operations Division shall inform the 
appropriate legal officer of the need for consultation with the officer 
and shall provide the legal officer with a copy of the notice and other 
legal documentation served on the designated official.
    (3) If possible, the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division 
shall provide the officer with the following:

Commissioned Personnel Operations Division within 30 days of notice that 
the officer received a consultation concerning the

[[Page 65]]

officer's support obligation and the consequences of failure to make 
payments. The legal officer concerned must advise the Commissioned 
Personnel Operations Division of the inability to arrange such 
consultation and the status of continuing efforts to contact the 
officer.
    (e) Lack of money. (1) When notice is served and the identified 
officer is found not to be entitled to any moneys due from or payable by 
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Commissioned Personnel 
Operations Division shall return the notice to the authorized person, 
and advise in writing that no moneys are due from or payable by the 
Department of Health and Human Services to the named individual.
    (2) Where it appears that moneys are only temporarily exhausted or 
otherwise unavailable, the Commissioned Personnel Operations Division 
shall advise the authorized person in writing on a timely basis as to 
why, and for how long, the moneys will be unavailable.
    (3) In instances where the officer separates from active duty, the 
authorized person shall be informed in writing on a timely basis that 
the allotment is discontinued.
    (f) Effective date of allotment. Allotments shall be withheld 
beginning on the first end-of-month payday after the Commissioned 
Personnel Operations Division is notified that the officer has had a 
consultation with a legal officer, has waived his/her right to such 
consultation, or the legal officer has submitted documentation that a 
consultation with the officer could not be arranged after good faith 
attempts to do so were made by the legal officer. The Service shall not 
be required to vary its normal allotment payment cycle to comply with 
the notice.

this subparagraph shall not be less that 12 times the monthly special 
pay then paid to Commissioned Officers entitled to special pay for duty 
involving intimate

[[Page 66]]

contact with persons who have Hansen's disease. (As of October 24, 1985, 
that monthly rate was $110.)
    (c) An officer or employee may be paid special pay for any pay 
period, under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, only to the extent 
that it does not cause his or her aggregate pay for that pay period to 
exceed the biweekly rate of basic pay for Level V of the Executive 
Schedule. As used in this paragraph, ``aggregate pay'' comprises basic 
pay, this special pay, and premiums for overtime, nightwork, irregular

which will not be effective until approval has been obtained from the 
Office of Management and Budget. A notice will be published in the 
Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 23.5  What are the criteria for deciding which applications for assignment will be approved?

    (a) In approving or disapproving an application for assignment of

[45 FR 12790, Feb. 27, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 31948, Sept. 8, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 23.8  What operational requirements apply to an entity to which National Health Service Corps personnel are assigned?

    Each National Health Service Corps site must:
    (a) Operate a health care delivery system within a planned or 
existing community structure to assure:
    (1) The provision of high quality comprehensive health care;
    (2) To the extent feasible, full professional health care coverage 
for the health manpower shortage area;
    (3) Continuum of care, and
    (4) The availability and accessibility of secondary and tertiary 
health care (the two more sophisticated levels of health care beyond 
primary care);
    (b) Establish and maintain a patient record system;
    (c) Implement a system for maintaining the confidentiality of 
patient records;
    (d) Meet the requirements of applicable fire and safety codes;
    (e) Develop, to the extent feasible, linkages with other health care 
facilities for the provision of services which supplement or complement

assurance system in a community health center; and
    (g) Establish basic data, cost accounting, and management 
information and reporting systems as prescribed by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 23.9  What must an entity to which National Health Service Corps personnel are assigned (i.e., a National Health Service Corps site) charge for the 
          provision of health services by assigned personnel?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, individuals 
receiving services from assigned National Health Service Corps personnel 
must

[[Page 70]]

be charged on a fee-for-service or other basis at a rate which is 
computed to permit recovery of the value of the services and is approved 
by the Secretary.
    (b) In determining whether to approve fees to be charged for health 
services, the Secretary will consider: The costs to the National Health 
Service Corps of providing the health services; the costs to the health 
manpower shortage area for providing the services; and the charges for 
similar services by other practitioners or facilities in or nearby the 
health manpower shortage area. However, if assigned National Health 
Service Corps personnel are providing services within the framework of 
an established health services delivery system, the Secretary may 
approve the fees charged under that system without regard to the 
foregoing factors.
    (c)(1) No charge or a nominal charge will be made for health 
services provided by assigned National Health Service Corps personnel to 
individuals within the health manpower shortage area with annual incomes 
at or below the ``CSA Income Poverty Guidelines'' (45 CFR 1060.2). 
However, no individual will be denied health services based upon 
inability to pay for the services. Any individual who has an annual 
income above the ``CSA Income Poverty Guidelines,'' but whose income 
does not exceed 200 percent of the CSA levels, will receive health 
services at a nominal charge. However, charges will be made for services 
to the extent that payment will be made by a third party which is 
authorized or under legal obligation to pay the charges.
    (2) The provisions of this paragraph also apply with respect to 
services provided by an individual who is fulfilling an NHSC scholarship 
obligation under section 753 or who received a special grant under 
section 755.


<R05>
Sec. 23.10  Under what circumstances may a National Health Service Corps site's reimbursement obligation to the Federal Government be waived?

    (a) The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement 
requirements of section 334(a)(3) of the Act if he determines that:
    (1) The National Health Service Corps site is financially unable to 
meet the reimbursement requirements or that compliance with those 
requirements will unreasonably limit the ability of the site to 
adequately support the provision of services by assigned Corps 
personnel. In making these determinations, the Secretary will consider--
    (i) The costs necessary to adequately support the health services 
provided by the assigned National Health Service Corps personnel and the 
income and financial resources available to meet the costs;
    (ii) The ability of the applicant to obtain credit from suppliers, 
lending institutions, private organizations and individuals;
    (iii) The need of the health manpower shortage area for health 
services; and
    (iv) The extent to which the National Health Service Corps site 
utilizes health professions personnel.
    (2) A significant percentage of the individuals who are located in 
the health manpower shortage area and are receiving the health services 
of the assigned National Health Service Corps personnel are elderly, 
living in poverty, or have other characteristics which indicate an 
inability to pay. For purposes of this section, ``elderly'' means 
persons 65 years or older and the ``CSA Income Poverty Guidelines'' will 
be used as the standard for determining whether individuals are living 
in poverty. Other characteristics indicating inability to pay include, 
but are not to be limited to, the ratio of unemployment in the health 
manpower shortage area and the area's cost-of-living index.
    (b) The Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement 
requirements of section 334(f)(1) of the Act if he or she determines 
that the National Health Service Corps site is a small health center (as 
defined by section 334(f)(5) of the Act) that needs all or part of the 
amount otherwise payable to--
    (1) Expand or improve its provision of health services;
    (2) Increase the number of individuals served;
    (3) Renovate or modernize facilities for its provision of health 
services;

[[Page 71]]

    (4) Improve the administration of its health service programs; or
    (5) Establish a financial reserve to assure its ability to continue 
providing health services;
    (c) Where the Secretary determines that a National Health Service 
Corps site is eligible for a waiver under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of 
this section. the Secretary may waive the application of the 
reimbursement requirements of section 334(a)(3) of the Act and apply the 
reimbursement requirements of section 334(f)(1) of the Act. The 
Secretary may waive in whole or in part the reimbursement requirements 
of section 334(f)(1) for such a site if he or she determines that the 
National Health Service Corps site meets the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. Funds retained by a National Health Service 
Corps site as a result of such waiver must be used for the purposes set 
forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (d) Requests for a prospective or retrospective waiver must be made 
at the time and in the manner and contain the documentation prescribed 
by the Secretary.

[45 FR 12790, Feb. 27, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 31948, Sept. 8, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 23.11  Under what circumstances may the Secretary sell equipment or other property of the United States used by the National Health Service Corps site?

    (a) Upon expiration of the assignment of all Corps personnel to a 
health manpower shortage area, the Secretary may sell equipment and 
other property of the United States used by the assigned personnel. The 
equipment may be sold at the fair market value or less than the fair 
market value to any entity providing health services in or to a health 
manpower shortage area if the Secretary determines that an entity is 
unable to pay the fair market value. In determining whether an entity is 
financially unable to purchase equipment or property at fair market 
value, the Secretary will consider (1) the present financial resources 
of the entity available to purchase the equipment or property based upon 
its current liabilities, and (2) the entity's ability to obtain the 
funds necessary to purchase the equipment or property. However, the 
Secretary will not sell the equipment or property for less than fair 
market value to a profitmaking organization unless the organization 
gives reasonable assurance that it will use the equipment or property to 
provide health services in or to the health manpower shortage area.
    (b) The Secretary will give priority to sales to an entity providing 
reasonable assurance that it will use the equipment or property for the 
purpose of retaining within the health manpower shortage area National 
Health Service Corps personnel who have completed their assignments.


<R05>
Sec. 23.12  Who will supervise and control the assigned personnel?

    Assigned National Health Service Corps personnel will at all times 
remain under the direct supervision and control of the Secretary. 
Observance of institutional rules and regulations by the assigned 
personnel is a mere incident of the performance of their Federal 
functions and does not alter their direct professional and 
administrative responsibility to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 23.13  What nondiscrimination requirements apply to National Health Service Corps sites?

    National Health Service Corps sites are advised that in addition to 
complying with the terms and conditions of this regulation, the 
following laws and regulations are applicable--
    (a) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (43 U.S.C. 2000d et 
seq.) and its implementing regulations, 45 CFR part 80 (prohibiting 
discrimination in federally assisted programs on the grounds of race, 
color, or national origin); and
    (b) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) 
and its implementing regulations, 45 CFR part 84 (prohibiting 
discrimination in federally assisted programs on the basis of handicap).
    (c) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.) and 
its implementing regulations, 45 CFR part 91 (prohibiting

<R05>
Sec. 24.1  Establishment.

    There is established in the Public Health Service (PHS) a Senior 
Biomedical Research Service (SBRS) consisting of members the maximum 
number of which is prescribed by law.


<R05>
Sec. 24.2  Allocation.

    (a) The Secretary, within the number authorized in the PHS Act, 
shall determine the number of SBRS slots to be allocated to each 
participating Operating Division.
    (b) The SBRS Policy Board may advise the Secretary to make 
adjustments to the allocation at any time.
    (c) The majority of the SBRS allocation is to be reserved for 
recruitment. The remaining SBRS allocation may be used for the retention 
of current employees.
    (d) SBRS slots will be used judiciously, resulting in SBRS 
appointments only where other senior-level appointing authorities are 
not sufficient to recruit or retain scientific talent.
    (e) The Secretary will ensure that SBRS slots are used in support of 
high priority programs authorized by Congress and which directly support 
the research goals and priorities of the Department.

[[Page 76]]


<R05>
Sec. 24.3  Policy Board.

    The Secretary or his/her designee shall establish an SBRS Policy 
Board to serve in an advisory capacity, recommending SBRS allocations 
among the participating Operating Divisions, reviewing the operations of 
the SBRS and ensuring consistent application of regulations, policies, 
and procedural guidelines, and recommending changes to the Secretary as 
necessary. Membership, to the extent possible, will include SBRS 
eligibles nominated by their respective Operating Divisions, will be 
weighted in proportion to Operating Divisions' SBRS allocations, and 
will include representation from the Office of the Secretary. The 
Secretary or his/her designee will select the board membership and the 
Chair.


<R05>
Sec. 24.4  Eligibility.

    To be eligible for appointment to the Service an individual must 
have a doctoral-level degree in biomedicine or a related field and must 
meet the qualification standards prescribed by the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management for appointment to a position at GS-15 of the 
General Schedule. In addition, the individual must be outstanding in the 
field of biomedical research or clinical research evaluation. 
Appointment to the Service will be made only to individuals actively 
engaged in either biomedical research or clinical research evaluation.
    (a) Outstanding in the field of biomedical research means an 
individual who is actively engaged in peer-reviewed original biomedical 
research and whose work in this area is considered by his or her peers 
to be outstanding. In order to meet the eligibility criteria, an 
individual must have conducted original peer-reviewed biomedical 
research resulting in major accomplishments reflected by a steady and 
current record of highly cited publications in peer-reviewed journals of 
high stature. In addition, the individual should be the recipient of 
major prizes and awards (such as visiting professorships and named 
lectureships) in recognition of original contributions to research.
    (b) Outstanding in the field of clinical research evaluation means 
that an individual is actively engaged in clinical research evaluation 
and is considered by his or her peers to be outstanding. In order to 
meet the eligibility criteria, an individual, by force of his or her own 
technical expertise, must be in a position to shape the course of drug 
or device evaluation or exert a similar influence on the PHS handling of 
other agents that may affect the public health. The individual would 
normally have dealt with complex, precedent-setting evaluation issues 
that involved significant scientific controversy, had far reaching 
implications for clinical research or resulted in a widespread economic 
effect in the health-care delivery system. In addition, the individual 
should have been involved in the development of scientific or regulatory 
guidelines for clinical research and been the recipient of invitations 
to speak at or to chair major national or international meetings and 
symposia.


<R05>
Sec. 24.5  Peer review.

    An individual may not be considered for appointment into the SBRS 
unless his/her qualifications have been reviewed by a PHS peer review 
committee and the committee has recommended appointment to the Service.


<R05>
Sec. 24.6  Pay and compensation.

    The SBRS is an ungraded system, with a single, flexible pay range to 
include all members.
    (a) Pay of the members of the Service shall be determined by the 
Secretary or his/her designee.
    (b) The pay of a member of the Service shall be not less than the 
minimum rate payable for GS-15 of the General Schedule and shall not 
exceed:
    (1) The rate payable for level I of the Executive Schedule unless a 
higher rate of pay is expressly approved on an individual basis by the 
President, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5377(d)(2), or
    (2) The rate payable for level II of the Executive Schedule unless a 
higher rate of pay is expressly approved on an individual basis by the 
Secretary.
    (c) While the full pay range will be used, individual pay at the 
higher end of the range will be used only as needed to recognize 
individual scientific value and as necessary to recruit or retain an 
exceptionally well-qualified scientist.

[[Page 77]]

    (d) The following factors will be used in establishing appropriate 
pay rates for individual members:
    (1) Impact of the individual on the scientific field;
    (2) Recognition of the individual by the scientific community;
    (3) Originality of the individual's ideas/work products;
    (4) Specific ``clinical'' or highly technical skills of the 
individual which are of benefit to the agency and which are in addition 
to requirements of the basic scientific assignment;
    (5) The individual's earnings and monetary benefits;
    (6) Salary surveys of similar skills in pertinent labor markets; and
    (7) Other relevant factors.
    (e) Annual adjustments to pay rates may be made effective on the 
first day of the first pay period on or after January 1 of each calendar 
year. The rate of such adjustments will be at the discretion of the 
Secretary or his/her designee, except that the minimum rate payable in 
the SBRS will be increased to the amount of the minimum rate of the GS-
15 of the General Schedule.
    (f) Other pay adjustments will be made on an individual basis by the 
Secretary or his/her designee.
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, new 
appointees to the Service, who are not covered by the Civil Service 
Retirement System, will be covered by the Federal Employees Retirement 
System.
    (h) Upon the request of a member who performed service in the employ 
of an institution of higher education immediately prior to his 
appointment as a member of the Service, and retains the right to make 
contributions to the retirement system of such institution, the 
Department of Health and Human Services may contribute an amount not to 
exceed ten percent per annum of the member's basic pay to such 
institution's retirement system on behalf of such member. A member who 
participates in this program shall not be covered by any retirement 
system established for employees of the United States under title 5, 
United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 24.7  Performance appraisal system.

    The members of the Service shall be subject to a performance 
appraisal system which shall be designed to encourage excellence in 
performance and shall provide for a periodic and systematic appraisal of 
the performance of the members.

determined by the Secretary or his/her designee.


<R05>
Sec. 24.9  Removal from the Service.

    (a) A member of the Service may be subject to disciplinary action, 
including removal from the Service, for substandard performance of duty 
as a member of the service, for misconduct, for reasons of national 
security or for other reasons as determined by the Secretary.
    (b) A member for whom disciplinary action is proposed is entitled 
to:
    (1) Written notice of the proposed action and the basis therefor;
    (2) A reasonable opportunity to answer the notice of proposed action 
both orally and in writing;
    (3) The right to be represented by an attorney or other

    (d) A member who is separated from the Service involuntarily and 
without cause and who, immediately prior to his appointment to the 
Service, was a career appointee in the civil service or the Senior 
Executive Service, may be appointed to a position in the competitive

    (b) In every such case of treatment or hospitalization, a full 
report thereof shall be submitted to the Surgeon General through Coast

    If a person is separated while undergoing treatment by the Service,

permit interruption of treatment, in which case the treatment shall be 
discontinued as soon as practicable and the condition of the patient 
permits. At that time he shall be discharged from treatment and shall 
not thereafter be afforded medical relief by the Service by reason of 
his previous service.

<R05>
Sec. 34.3  Scope of examinations.

    (a) General. In performing examinations, medical examiners shall 
consider those matters that relate to:
    (1) A communicable disease of public health significance;
    (2)(i) A physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with 
the disorder that may pose, or has posed, a threat to the property,

associated with the disorder, which behavior has posed a threat to the

    (3) Drug abuse or addiction; and
    (4) Any other physical abnormality, disease, or disability serious 
in degree or permanent in nature amounting to a substantial departure 
from normal well-being.

The scope of the examination shall include any laboratory or additional 
studies that are deemed necessary, either as a result of the physical 
examination or pertinent information elicited from the alien's medical 
history, for the examining physician to reach a conclusion about the 
presence or absence of a physical or mental abnormality, disease, or 
disability.
    (b) Persons subject to requirement for chest X-ray examination and 
serologic testing. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this 
section, a chest X-ray examination, serologic testing for syphilis and 
serologic testing for HIV of persons 15 years of age and older shall be 
required as part of the examination of:
    (i) Applicants for immigrant visas;
    (ii) Students, exchange visitors, and other applicants for a 
nonimmigrant visa who are required by a consular authority to have a 
medical examination;
    (iii) Aliens outside the United States who apply for refugee status;
    (iv) Applicants in the United States who apply for adjustment of 
status under the immigration statute and regulations;
    (v) Exceptions. Neither a chest X-ray examination nor serologic 
testing for syphilis and HIV shall be required if the alien is under the 
age of 15. Provided, a tuberculin skin test shall be required if there 
is evidence of contact with a person known to have tuberculosis or other 
reason to suspect tuberculosis, and a chest X-ray examination shall be 
required in the event of a positive tuberculin reaction, and serologic 
testing where there is reason to suspect infection with syphilis or HIV. 
Additional exceptions to the requirement for a chest X-ray examination 
may be authorized for good cause upon application approved by the 
Director.
    (2) Tuberculin skin test examination. (i) All aliens 2 years of age 
or older in the United States who apply for adjustment of status to 
permanent residents, under the immigration laws and regulations, or 
other aliens in the United States who are required by the INS to have a 
medical examination in connection with a determination of their 
admissibility, shall be required to have a tuberculin skin test. 
Exceptions to this requirement may be authorized for good cause upon 
application approved by the Director. In the event of a positive 
tuberculin reaction, a chest X-ray examination shall be required. If the 
chest radiograph is consistent with tuberculosis, the alien shall be 
referred to the local health authority for evaluation. Evidence of this 
evaluation shall be provided to the civil surgeon before a medical 
notification may be issued.
    (ii) Aliens less than 2 years old shall be required to have a 
tuberculin skin test if there is evidence of contact with a person known 
to have tuberculosis or other reason to suspect tuberculosis. In the 
event of a positive tuberculin reaction, a chest X-ray examination shall 
be required. If the chest radiograph is consistent with tuberculosis, 
the alien shall be referred to the local health authority for 
evaluation. Evidence of this evaluation shall be provided to the

[[Page 88]]

civil surgeon before a medical notification may be issued.
    (3) Sputum smear examination. All aliens subject to the chest X-ray 
examination requirement and for whom the radiograph shows an abnormality 
consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis shall be required to have a 
sputum smear examination for acid-fast bacilli.
    (4) How and where performed. All chest X-ray films used in medical 
examinations performed under the regulations in this part shall be large 
enough to encompass the entire chest (approximately 14 by 17 inches; 
35.6 x 43.2 cm.). Serologic testing for HIV shall be a sensitive and 
specific test, confirmed when positive by a test such as the Western 
blot test or an equally reliable test. For aliens examined abroad, the 
serologic testing for HIV must be completed abroad, except that the 
Attorney General after consultation with the Secretary of State and the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services may in emergency circumstances 
permit serologic testing of refugees for HIV to be completed in the 
United States.
    (5) Chest X-ray, laboratory, and treatment reports. The chest X-ray 
reading and serologic test results for syphilis and HIV shall be 
included in the medical notification. When the medical examiner's 
conclusions are based on a study of more than one chest X-ray film, the 
medical notification shall include at least a summary statement of 
findings of the earlier films, followed by a complete reading of the 
last film, and dates and details of any laboratory tests and treatment 
for tuberculosis.
    (c) Procedure for transmitting records. For aliens issued immigrant 
visas, the medical notification and chest X-ray film, if any, shall be 
placed in a separate envelope which shall be sealed and attached to the 
alien's visa in such a manner as to be readily detached at the U.S. port 
of entry. When more than one chest X-ray film is used as a basis for the 
examiner's conclusions, all films shall be included.
    (d) Failure to present records. When a determination of 
admissibility is to be made at the U.S. port of entry, a medical hold 
document shall be issued pending completion of any necessary examination 
procedures. A medical hold document may be issued for aliens who:
    (1) Are not in possession of a valid medical notification, if 
required;
    (2) Have a medical notification which is incomplete;
    (3) Have a medical notification which is not written in English;
    (4) Are suspected to have an excludable medical condition.
    (e) The Attorney General, after consultation with the Secretary of 
State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, may in emergency 
circumstances permit the medical examination of refugees to be completed 
in the United States.
    (f) All medical examinations shall be carried out in accordance with 
such technical instructions for physicians conducting the medical 
examination of aliens as may be issued by the Director. Copies of such 
technical instructions are available upon request to the Director, 
Division of Quarantine, Mailstop E03, CDC, Atlanta GA 30333.

    (ii)(A) A physical or mental disorder, and behavior associated with 
the disorder that may pose, or has posed, a threat to the property, 
safety, or welfare of the alien or others; or

associated with the disorder, which behavior has posed a threat to the 
property, safety, or welfare of the alien or others and which behavior 
is likely to recur or lead to other harmful behavior;
    (iii) Drug abuse or addition.

Provided, however, That a Class A medical notification of a physical or 
mental

[[Page 89]]

disorder, and behavior associated with that disorder that may pose, or 
has posed, a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the alien or 
others, shall in no case be issued with respect to an alien having only 
mental shortcomings due to ignorance, or suffering only from a condition 
attributable to remediable physical causes or of a temporary nature, 
caused by a toxin, medically prescribed drug, or disease.
    (2) The medical notification shall state the nature and extent of 
the abnormality; the degree to which the alien is incapable of normal 
physical activity; and the extent to which the condition is remediable. 
The medical examiner shall indicate the likelihood, that because of the 
condition, the applicant will require extensive medical care or 
institutionalization.
    (c) Class B medical notifications. (1) If an alien is found to have 
a physical or mental abnormality, disease, or disability serious in 
degree or permanent in nature amounting to a substantial departure from 
normal well-being, the medical examiner shall report his/her findings to 
the consular or INS officer by Class B medical notification which lists 
the specific conditions found by the medical examiner. Provided, 
however, that a Class B medical notification shall in no case be issued 
with respect to an alien having only mental shortcomings due to 
ignorance, or suffering only from a condition attributable to remediable 
physical causes or of a temporary nature, caused by a toxin, medically 
prescribed drug, or disease.
    (2) The medical notification shall state the nature and extent of 
the abnormality, the degree to which the alien is incapable of normal 
physical activity, and the extent to which the condition is remediable. 
The medical examiner shall indicate the likelihood, that because of the 
condition, the applicant will require extensive medical care or 
institutionalization.
    (d) Other medical notifications. If as a result of the medical 
examination, the medical examiner does not find a Class A or Class B 
condition in an alien, the medical examiner shall so indicate on the 
medical notification form and shall report his findings to the consular 
or INS officer.

<R05>
Sec. 34.5  Postponement of medical examination.

    Whenever, upon an examination, the medical examiner is unable to 
determine the physical or mental condition of an alien, completion of 
the medical examination shall be postponed for such observation and 
further examination of the alien as may be reasonably necessary to 
determine his/her physical or mental condition. The examination shall be 
postponed for aliens who have an acute infectious disease until the 
condition is resolved. The alien shall be referred for medical care as 
necessary.

the extent deemed practical by the attending physician and if considered 
to be in need of further care, may be referred to the INS along with the 
physician's recommendations concerning such further care.
    (b) In case of the death of an alien, the body shall be delivered to 
the consular or immigration authority concerned. If such death occurs in 
the United States, or in a territory or possession thereof, public

<R05>
Sec. 35.1   Hospital and station rules.

    The officer in charge of a station or hospital of the Service is 
authorized to adopt such rules and issue such instructions, not 
inconsistent with the regulations in this part and other provisions of 
law, as he deems necessary for the efficient operation of the station or 
hospital and for the proper and humane care and treatment of all 
patients therein. All general rules governing the conduct and privileges 
of patients, and of members of the public

[[Page 92]]

while on the premises, shall be posted in prominent places.


<R05>
Sec. 35.2   Compliance with hospital rules.

    All patients and visitors in stations and hospitals of the Service 
are expected to comply with the rules and instructions issued under the 
authority of the officer in charge.


<R05>
Sec. 35.3   Noncompliance; deprivation of privileges.

    Any patient who wilfully fails or refuses to comply with rules or 
instructions of a hospital or station or with regulations of the 
Service, may, by the direction of the officer in charge, be deprived of 
recreational or other privileges accorded patients. Any visitor who 
wilfully fails or refuses to comply with any such rules, instructions, 
or regulations may, by direction of the officer in charge, be denied 
visiting privileges.


<R05>
Sec. 35.4   Noncompliance; discharge or transfer.

    (a) If the officer in charge finds, upon investigation, that a 
patient other than a leprosy patient, by willful and persistent failure 
or refusal to comply with such rules, instructions, or regulations is 
seriously impeding the course of his own care and treatment, or that of 
other patients, he may (1) discharge the patient, or (2) if the patient 
is not a voluntary patient, arrange for his transfer to the custody of 
the authority responsible for his admission to the station or hospital. 
No patient shall be discharged or transferred on account of 
noncompliance if to do so would seriously endanger his life or health, 
nor shall any patient be discharged if his failure to comply is due, in 
the opinion of the officer in charge, to a mental disease or disorder.
    (b) If the discharge or transfer of a patient is likely to endanger 
the health of persons other than the patient or officers or employees of 
the station or hospital, the officer in charge shall give advance notice 
to appropriate State, county, or municipal authorities of the discharge 
or transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 35.5   Entitlement to care after discharge or transfer by reason of noncompliance.

    No person otherwise entitled to care, treatment, or hospitalization 
at Service facilities, or in other facilities at the expense of the

for treatment. Such determinations shall be subject to review by the

been denied care or treatment.


<R05>

Sec. 35.8   Safekeeping of money and effects; withdrawals.

    (a) A place for the safekeeping of money and effects of patients 
shall be provided at each station or hospital, and an itemized receipt

places money or effects therein for the benefit of the patient.
    (b) Money and effects may be withdrawn only by or on behalf of the 
patient, by his legally appointed representative authorized to receive

custody of the station or hospital), or by a person who is authorized, 
under the law of the

[[Page 93]]

State in which the station or hospital is located, to receive or dispose 
of the patient's money and effects. In any case in which the officer in 
charge has had actual notice of the appointment of a legal 
representative, withdrawals may be made only by such representative or 
in accordance with his written directions. No delivery shall be made 
under this paragraph unless (1) the person receiving the money or 
effects shall sign an itemized receipt therefor, or (2) the delivery is 
witnessed by two persons. The provisions of this paragraph do not 
prohibit withdrawals made necessary by the provisions of this part for 
the disposition of money and effects left by patients on death or on 
departure from the station or hospital, or by the provisions of 
Sec. 35.10.


<R05>
Sec. 35.9   Disposition of money and effects left by other than deceased patients.

    Money and effects left on the premises by a patient shall be 
forwarded promptly to him. If because his whereabouts are unknown his 
money and effects cannot be delivered to him within 120 days after his 
departure, his money shall be deposited into the Treasury and credited 
to the account entitled ``Money and Effects of Former Patients (PHS (T) 
name of patient),'' and his effects shall be held for him for six months

or visitors therein and cannot otherwise be safely disposed of or 
rendered harmless by disinfection or other means. The destruction of 
effects shall be witnessed by at least one officer or employee 
designated for that purpose by the officer in charge, and appropriate 
records of the destruction shall be maintained.


<R05>
Sec. 35.11   Clinical records; confidential.

    A complete clinical record shall be maintained for each patient 
admitted to a station or hospital of the Service. Such records shall be 
confidential and shall not be disclosed except as may be provided 
elsewhere in regulations of the Service.


<R05>
Sec. 35.12   Solicitation of legal business prohibited.

the Service for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or obtaining a 
general or special release or statement from any patient with reference 
to any illness or personal injury for which the patient is receiving 
care or treatment, or for the purpose of conferring with him as an 
attorney or representative of an attorney with reference to such illness 
or injury, unless the patient has signified his willingness to have such 
person enter for such purpose and, in the judgment of the officer in 
charge, the physical or mental condition of the patient will not thereby 
be impaired.
    (b) Any person entering a station or hospital for a purpose 
enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section shall register in the manner 
prescribed by the officer in charge, and shall furnish for the records 
of the station or hospital the name of each patient by whom he has been 
received for such a purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 35.14   Solicitation of legal business; negotiation of release or settlement; assistance prohibited.

    All employees of the Service and all persons attached in any 
capacity to a station or hospital, including patients, are forbidden to

aiding in the solicitation of legal business or in the negotiation of a 
settlement or the obtaining of a general or special release or statement 
from any patient with reference to any

[[Page 94]]

illness or personal injury for which the patient is receiving care or 
treatment therein. No patient is prohibited by this section from 
communicating on his own behalf with an attorney of his choice or with 
other persons.


<R05>
Sec. 35.15   Consent to operative procedures.

    Except in emergencies when the patient is physically or mentally 
incapable of consenting and the delay required to obtain the consent of 
his natural or legal guardian would seriously endanger the patient's 
health, no operative procedure shall be undertaken unless the patient 
or, in the case of a minor or incompetent, his natural or legal guardian 
gives his consent, nor shall any major operative procedure or the 
administration of a general anaesthetic be undertaken unless such 
consent has been obtained in writing. The consent or refusal of consent 
shall be made a part of the clinical record.


<R05>
Sec. 35.16   Autopsies and other post-mortem operations.

    Autopsies, or other post-mortem operations, including removal of 
tissue for transplanting, may be performed on the body of a deceased 
patient only by direction of the officer in charge and only if consented 
to in writing by a person authorized under the law of the State in which 
the station or hospital is located to permit an autopsy or such other 
post-mortem operation under the circumstances of the particular death 
involved. Restrictions or limitations imposed by the person consenting 
thereto on the extent of the autopsy or other post-mortem operation 
shall be observed. Documents embodying consent shall be made a part of

otherwise disposed of, such used toilet articles of the patient as 
appear to have no commercial or other value.


<R05>
Sec. 35.46   Conflicting claims.

    In any case in which conflicting claims are filed or the officer in

<R05>
Sec. 35.47   Disposition of Government checks.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, immediately 
upon completion of the inventory, checks drawn on the Treasurer of the 
United States shall be sent by safe means to the department, agency, or

reasons therefor and of all available information which may aid the 
issuing unit in the disposition of the check transmitted. Notice of the

entitled ``Money and Effects of Deceased Patients, Public Health 
Service.'' If, within six months after the death of a patient, no claim 
has been filed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 35.43, his effects

shall be sold at public auction or by sealed bids to the highest bidder 
and the proceeds deposited to the credit of the trust-fund account 
entitled ``Money and Effects of Deceased Patients, Public Health 
Service.'' Postal Savings Certificates and other evidences of 
indebtedness of the United States shall be transmitted to the issuing 
department or agency with a statement of the occasion therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 35.49   Sale of unclaimed effects; procedures.

    The following provisions shall govern the sale of effects:
    (a) Notice. Reasonable advance notice of proposed sales shall be 
posted at such prominent places in the station or hospital area as the 
officer in charge may designate. In addition, a notice shall be posted 
at the nearest post office, and notices shall be sent by mail to all 
known persons to whom delivery of money and effects of the patient may 
be made under the provisions of this subpart. The officer or employee 
who posts or sends notices of sales shall make an appropriate affidavit 
on a copy of the notice as to his action in that respect, including in 
his affidavit the names of persons to whom copies of the notices were 
mailed and the mailing dates. The copy of the notice on which the 
affidavit appears shall be retained in the files of the station or 
hospital.

[[Page 98]]

the inspection of articles if sold by sealed bid; a statement that the 
sale is to be held pursuant to the provisions of the regulations in this 
part, that, if the articles are to be sold by sealed bid, the right to 
reject all bids is reserved, and that, if otherwise authorized, delivery 
will be made of effects or proceeds of sales to persons filing claims 
prior to the sale of effects or prior to the transmittal of proceeds to 
the Surgeon General.
    (c) Time and place of sales. All sales shall be held at reasonable 
hours and at such places within the station or hospital area as the 
officer in charge may designate.
    (d) Who shall conduct sales. All sales shall be conducted by the

Sec. 35.50   Disposition of unsold effects.

    The officer in charge shall dispose of effects offered for sale but

practicable, such effects shall be used for the benefit of other 
patients of the Service.


<R05>
Sec. 35.51   Manner of delivery; costs, receipts.

    (a) If a person entitled under this subpart to receive the money and 
effects of a patient is unable to take possession thereof at the station 
or hospital, they shall be sent to him at the expense of the United 
States in the most economical manner available. The records of the 
station or hospital shall show the names and addresses of persons to 
whom money or effects have been sent, the date of sending, the means 
used, an itemized list of the money or effects sent, and a statement by 
a witnessing officer or employee verifying the foregoing from his own 
observation.

of the Service, money, evidences of indebtedness, and other valuable 
papers and documents shall be sent by registered mail (or other safe 
means).
    (c) Persons receiving the money and effects of a patient shall be 
required to execute an itemized receipt therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 35.52   Delivery of possession only; title unaffected.

    Except for delivery of effects to purchasers at sales held in 
accordance with Sec. 35.49, delivery or deposit under this subpart of 
the money or effects, or the proceeds of a sale of the effects, of a 
deceased patient constitutes only a transfer of possession and is not 
intended to affect in any manner the title to such money, effects, or 
proceeds.

    This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures governing the 
acceptance and administration of contributions of money or property 
intended solely for the benefit of all patients in a ward or unit or a 
particular hospital or station of the Public Health Service, excluding 
outpatient clinics. Such contributions are distinguishable from (a) 
monies or other valuables belonging to specific patients which are 
accepted and held in custody for the convenience of the patient until 
such time as he or she wishes to withdraw them, and (b) gifts to the 
United States to support Public Health Service functions under section 
501 of the Public Health Service Act or other statutory provisions, 
which may be accepted and administered only in accordance with such 
statutory provisions or other applicable laws.

Sec. 35.62  Acceptance of contributions.

    (a) The officer in charge of a hospital or station or his delegate 
may accept contributions of money or personal property which are donated 
for the

[[Page 99]]

general benefit of all patients within the hospital or station (or a 
ward or unit thereof) without further specification or conditions as to 
use. Contributions tendered subject to conditions by the donor, such as 
expenditure or use only on behalf of certain patients or for specific 
purposes, may not be accepted.
    (b) Contribution of money or property shall be accepted in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 35.63  Report of and accounting for contributions.

    (a) Contributions of money accepted pursuant to Sec. 35.62 
(hereinafter referred to as ``patient fund'') will be treated 
consistently with Federal deposit rules and as supplemented with 
appropriate procedures of the facility. This regulation is not intended 
to exclude contributions for the benefit of patients from proper 
accountability and control of funds and property.
    (b) Contributions of property accepted pursuant to Sec. 35.62 shall 
be recorded and accounted for in the same manner as other property of a 
similar kind maintained in the hospital or station, but with suitable 
identification so that it can be distinguished from government-owned 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 35.64  Donors.

    Authorized contributions may be accepted from patients, employees 
and other individuals, and agencies and organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 35.65  Acceptable personal property.

    Contributions of personal property which may be accepted pursuant to 
Sec. 35.62 include, but are not limited to, recreational equipment, 
furniture, radios and television sets. After its useful life, any cash 
proceeds realized upon disposition of such property shall be deposited 
to the credit of the patient fund and shall be available for expenditure 
pursuant to Sec. 35.66(c).


<R05>
Sec. 35.66  Expenditure of cash contributions.

    (a) Officials authorized to accept contributions shall not maintain 
control over the actual obligation or expenditure of such monies.
    (b) Only those officers or employees specifically designated in 
writing by the officer in charge for such purpose may obligate and 
expend monies from the patient fund. The names of officials so 
designated shall be provided to the relevant fiscal control office.
    (c) Subject to availability of sufficient funds, monies in the 
patient fund may be expended for materials, services or activities which 
contribute to the well-being or morale of patients, including but not 
limited to provision of reading and entertainment materials, recreation 
activities, and, in appropriate cases, necessary financial support 
(including travel expenses, meals, and lodging) of relatives, guardians, 
or friends of patients to enable such persons to be available for the 
patient's comfort and support.
    (d) Officers in charge may issue such additional instructions, not 
inconsistent with this subpart, as may be necessary to implement its 
provisions.

    (a) Subject to the requirements of this subpart, the Indian Health

health services, as medically indicated, and to the extent that funds 
and resources allocated to the particular Health Service Delivery Area 
permit, to persons of Indian or Alaska Native descent who:
    (1) Are members of a federally recognized Indian tribe; and
    (2) reside within a Health Service Delivery Area designated under 
Sec. 36.15; or
    (3) Are not members of a federally recognized Indian tribe but are 
the natural minor children (18 years old or under) of a member of a 
Federally recognized tribe and reside within a Health Service Delivery 
Area designated under Sec. 36.15.
    (b) Subject to the requirements of this subpart, the Indian Health 
Service will also provide direct services at its facilities and, except 
where otherwise provided, contract health services, as medically 
indicated and to the extent that funds and resources allocated to the 
particular Health Service Delivery Area permit, to people in the 
circumstances listed below:
    (1) To persons who meet the eligibility criteria in paragraph (a) of 
this section except for the residency requirement, who formerly resided 
within a Health Service Delivery area designated under Sec. 36.15, and 
who present

[[Page 103]]

themselves to any Indian Health Service or Indian Health Service funded 
facility (and to minor children of such persons if the children meet the 
eligibility criteria in paragraph (a) of this section except for the 
residency requirement). Contract health services may not be authorized 
for these individuals;
    (2) To a non-Indian woman pregnant with an eligible Indian's child 
but only during the period of her pregnancy through post-partum 
(generally about 6 weeks after delivery). In cases where the woman is 
not married to the eligible Indian under applicable state or tribal law, 
paternity must be acknowledged in writing by the Indian or determined by 
order of a court of competent jurisdiction;
    (3) To non-Indian members of an eligible Indian's household if the 
medical officer in charge determines that the health services are 
necessary to control acute infectious disease or a public health hazard; 
and
    (4) To an otherwise eligible person for up to 90 days after the 
person ceases to reside in a Health Service Delivery Area when the 
Service Unit Director has been notified of the move.
    (c) Contract health services will not be authorized when and to the 
extent that Indian Health Service or Indian Health Service funded 
facilities are available to provide the needed care. When funds are 
insufficient to provide the volume of contract health services needed by 
the service population, the Indian Health Service shall determine 
service priorities on the basis of medical need.
    (d) The Indian Health Service may provide direct services at its 
facilities on a fee-for-service basis to persons who are not 
beneficiaries under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section under a 
number of authorities including the following:
    (1) In emergencies under section 322(b) of the Public Health Service 
Act, 42 U.S.C. 249(b), and 42 CFR 32.111 of the regulations;
    (2) To Public Health Service and other Federal beneficiaries under 
Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) arrangements to the extent that providing 
services does not interfere with or restrict the provision of services 
to Indian and Alaska Native beneficiaries; and
    (3) To non-beneficiaries residing within the Health Service Delivery 
Area when approved by the tribe or tribes located on the reservation but 
only to the extent that providing services does not interfere with or 
restrict the provision of services to Indian and Alaska Native 
beneficiaries.

<R05>
Sec. 36.13  Authorization for contract health services.

    (a) No payment will be made for medical care and services obtained 
from non-Service providers or in non-Service facilities unless the 
applicable requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) below have been met 
and a purchase order for the care and services has been issued by the 
appropriate ordering official to the medical care provider.
    (b) In non-emergency cases, a sick or disabled Indian, or an 
individual or agency acting on behalf of the Indian, or the medical care 
provider shall, prior to the provision of medical care and services, 
notify the appropriate ordering official of the need for services and 
supply information that the ordering official deems necessary to 
determine the relative medical need for the services and the 
individual's eligibility. The requirement for notice prior to providing 
medical care and services under this paragraph may be waived by the 
ordering official if:
    (1) Such notice and information is provided within 72 hours after 
the beginning of treatment or admission to a health care facility; and
    (2) The ordering official determines that giving of notice prior to 
obtaining the medical care and services was impracticable or that other

Sec. 36.15  Health Service Delivery Areas.

    (a) The Indian Health Service will designate and publish as a notice 
in the Federal Register specific geographic areas within the United 
States including Federal Indian reservations and areas surrounding those 
reservations as Health Service Delivery Areas.
    (b) The Indian Health Service may, after consultation with all the 
Indian tribes affected, redesignate the boundaries of any Health Service 
Delivery Area followed by publication of a notice in the Federal 
Register. Any redesignation of a Health Service Delivery area will 
include the reservation, and those areas close to the reservation 
boundaries which can reasonably be considered part of the reservation 
service area based on consideration of the following factors:
    (1) The number of persons residing in the off-reservation area who 
would be eligible under Sec. 36.12(a) (1) and (3).
    (2) The number of persons residing in the off-reservation area who 
have traditionally received health services from the Indian Health 
Service and whose eligibility for services would be affected;
    (3) The geographic proximity of the off-reservation area to the 
reservation; and
    (4) Whether the Indians residing in the off-reservation area can be 
expected to need and to use health services provided by the Indian 
Health Service given the alternate resources (health facilities and 
payment sources) available and accessible to them.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the 
Indian Health Service may designate States, subdivisions of States such 
as counties or towns, or other identifiable geographic areas such as 
census divisions or zip code areas, as Health Service Delivery Areas 
where reservations are nonexistent, or so small and scattered and the 
eligible Indian population so widely dispersed that it is inappropriate 
to use reservations as the basis for defining the Health Service 
Delivery Area.
    (d) Any Indian tribal government may request a change in the 
boundaries of the Health Service Delivery Area. Such a request should be 
supported by documentation related to the factors for consideration set 
out in paragraph (b) of this section and shall include documentation of 
any consultation with or notification of other

[[Page 105]]

affected or nearby tribes. The request shall be submitted to the 
appropriate Area Director(s) who shall afford all Indian tribes affected 
the opportunity to express their views orally and in writing. The Area 
Director(s) shall then submit the request, including all comments, 
together with the Area's recommendation and independent findings or 
verification of the factors set out in paragraph (b) of this section, to 
the Indian Health Service Director or to the Director's designee for the 
Indian Health Service decision. The decision of the Indian Health 
Service Director or the Director's designee shall constitute final 
agency action on the tribe's request. Changes in the boundaries of 
Health Service Delivery Areas will be published in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 36.16  Beneficiary Identification Cards and verification of tribal membership.

    (a) The Indian Health Service will issue Beneficiary Identification 
Cards as evidence of beneficiary status to persons who are currently 
eligible for services under Sec. 36.12(a). Persons requesting 
Beneficiary Identification Cards must submit or have on file evidence 
satisfactory to the Indian Health Service of tribal membership and 
residence within a Health Service Delivery Area. The absence of a 
Beneficiary Identification Card will not preclude an otherwise eligible 
Indian from obtaining services though it may delay the administrative 
determination that an individual is eligible for services on a no charge 
basis.
    (b) For establishing eligibility or obtaining a Beneficiary 
Identification Card, applicants must demonstrate that they are members 
of a federally recognized tribe. Membership in a federally recognized 
tribe is to be determined by the individual tribe or the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs. Therefore, the Indian Health Service will recognize two 
methods of demonstrating tribal membership:
    (1) Documentation that the applicant meets the requirements of 
tribal membership as prescribed by the charter, articles of 
incorporation, or other legal instruments or traditional processes of 
the tribe and has been officially designated a tribal member by an 
authorized tribal official or body; or
    (2) Certification of tribal enrollment or membership by the 
Secretary of the Interior acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    (c) Demonstrating membership in a federally recognized tribe is the 
responsibility of the applicant. However, the Indian Health Service may 
consult with the appropriate tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs on 
outstanding questions regarding an applicant's tribal membership if the 
Indian Health Service has some documentation that it believes may be 
helpful to the tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs in making their 
determination.

    (3) Those under treatment for chronic degenerative conditions may be 
provided additional treatment at Indian Health Service expense for no

priorities.
    (b) All patients receiving care under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be notified in writing that, after discharge from care provided 
under any of the above circumstances, they will no longer be eligible

Sec. 36.106   Grant award and evaluation.

    (a) Within the limits of funds determined by the Secretary to be 
available for such purpose, the Secretary may award grants under this 
subpart to applicants whose project will, in the judgment of the 
Secretary, best promote the purposes of the Act, and the regulations of 
this subpart, taking into account:
    (1) The apparent capability of the applicant to organize and manage 
the proposed project successfully considering, among other things the 
adequacy of staff, management systems, equipment and facilities.
    (2) The soundness of the applicant's plan for conducting the project 
and for assuring effective utilization of grant funds.
    (3) The adequacy of the budget in relation to the scope of the 
project and available funds.

for a one-year budget period, any subsequent award will also be a one-
year budget period. A grantee must submit a separate application for 
each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the 
funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of such 
factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds.

[[Page 111]]

In all cases, awards require a determination by the Secretary that 
funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.

such determination and will request that the grantee take such 
corrective action, within such period of time, as the Secretary may 
prescribe.
    (b) When the Secretary determines that a grantee has not taken 
corrective action (as prescribed by him under paragraph (a) of this 
section) to his satisfaction, he may, after providing the grantee an 
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section, rescind the grant in whole or in part and if he deems it 
appropriate, assume or resume control or operation of the program, 
activity, or service involved.
    (c) When the Secretary has made a determination described in 
paragraph (b) of this section, he shall in writing notify the grantee of 
such determination and of the grantee's right to request a review of 
such determination (and of the determination described in paragraph (a) 
of this section) under the Public Health Service Grant Appeals Procedure 
(42 CFR part 50, subpart D). Such notification by the Secretary shall 
set forth the reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to 
enable the grantee to respond and shall

[[Page 113]]

inform the grantee of its opportunity for review under such subpart D.

grantee's position, the grantee shall be informed of its right to have a 
hearing before the Department Grant Appeals Board, pursuant to 45 CFR 
part 16.
    (d) Where the Secretary determines that a grantee's performance

the safety of any person, he may immediately rescind the grant in whole 
or in part and if he deems it appropriate, assume or resume control or 
operation of the program, activity, or service involved. Upon such 
recission he will immediately notify the grantee of such action and the

to rescind the grant under this paragraph may be designated to serve on 
the hearing panel.
    (1) The hearing shall be commenced within 10 days after the 
recission of the grant, shall be held on the record and shall afford the 
grantee the right:
    (i) To notice of the issues to be considered;
    (ii) To be represented by counsel;
    (iii) To present witnesses on grantee's behalf; and
    (iv) To cross-examine other witnesses either orally or through

paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, he may decline to enter into a new 
grant agreement with the grantee until such time as he is satisfied that 
the basis for the recission has been corrected. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed as contravening the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1590), as amended (29 U.S.C. 651).
    (f) In any case where the Secretary has rescinded a grant for the

<R05>
Sec. 36.201   Policy and applicability.

    (a) Policy. (1) The Congress has recognized the obligation of the 
United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people 
for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the 
direction of educational as well as other Federal services to Indian 
communities so as to render such services more responsive to the needs 
and desires of those communities.
    (2) The Congress has declared its commitment to the maintenance of 
the Federal Government's unique and continuing relationship with the 
responsibilities to the Indian people through the establishment of a 
meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly 
transition from Federal domination of programs for and services to 
Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people 
in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and 
services.
    (3) It is the policy of the Secretary of the Department of Health 
and Human

[[Page 115]]

Services to facilitate the efforts of Indian tribes to plan, conduct, 
and administer programs, or portions thereof, which the Indian Health 
Service is authorized to administer for the benefit of Indians.
    (4) It is the policy of the Secretary to continually encourage 
Indian tribes to become increasingly knowledgeable about Indian Health 
Service programs and the opportunities Indian tribes have regarding 
them; however, it is the policy of the Indian Health Service to leave to 
Indian tribes the initiative in making requests for contracts and to 
regard self-determination as including the decision of an Indian tribe 
not to request contracts.
    (5) It is the policy of the Indian Health Service not to impose 
sanctions on Indian tribes with regard to contracting or not 
contracting; however, the special resources made available to facilitate 
the efforts of those Indian tribes which do wish to contract should be 
made known to all tribes, as should the current realities of funding and 
Federal personnel limitations.
    (6) Contracting is one of several mechanisms by which Indian tribes 
can exercise their right to plan, conduct, and administer programs or 
portions thereof which the Secretary is authorized to administer for the 
benefit of Indians. Another mechanism afforded Indian tribes is the use 
of a grant, as provided in subpart H of this part, or other resources, 
to plan the manner in which it wishes the Indian Health Service to 
operate a program or portion thereof.
    (7) The regulations in this subpart are not meant to and do not 
change the eligibility criteria which individuals must meet to be 
eligible for any program currently operated by the Indian Health 
Service.
    (b) The regulations of this subpart are applicable to contracts 
awarded pursuant to section 103 of Pub. L. 93-638, 25 U.S.C. 450g to 
carry out any or all of the functions, authorities, and responsibilities 
of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Act of August 5,

immunity from suit enjoyed by an Indian tribe.
    (b) Authorize, require or permit the termination of any existing 
trust responsibility of the United States with respect to the Indian 
people.
    (c) Permit significant reduction in services to Indian people as a 
result of this subpart.
    (d) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to require a 
tribe to apply for a contract or contracts with the Secretary to carry 
out under the Indian Self-Determination Act any of the Secretary's 
functions, authorities and responsibilities under the Act of August 5, 
1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2001, et seq. Such applications under these 
regulations are voluntary.
    (e) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to preclude the 
making of contracts under any other authority of law nor to restrict 
contracts with Indian tribes or tribal organizations to contracts 
entered into under section 103 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 36.203   Amendment of regulations.

each tribal governing body must be obtained before submitting the 
application to IHS for approval. A tribal governing body may pass a 
single resolution authorizing a tribal organization to apply for, 
negotiate, and execute more than one contract if the resolution 
specifies for each contract the same information required in paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) The resolution of the tribal governing body shall authorize the 
applicant tribal organization to apply for, negotiate and contract with 
the IHS subject to the specific terms, conditions and limitations of the 
resolution and applicable tribal laws, codes, and regulations and 
custom. The resolution shall include the date the resolution was 
approved, and signature of the person authorized to certify the accuracy 
of the information contained in the resolution.
    (c) The tribal governing body's request (resolution) should include 
the following:
    (1) When the tribal organization is the tribal governing body:
    (i) A brief statement of the contract scope.
    (ii) The tribal official authorized to negotiate the contract and 
any amendments thereto.
    (iii) The tribal official authorized to execute the contract and any 
amendments thereof.
    (iv) The expiration date of the authorities granted by the 
resolution.

body:
    (i) The name of the tribal organization.
    (ii) A brief statement of the contract scope.
    (iii) The extent and procedure, if any, for review by the tribal 
governing body of the contract and any amendments thereto prior to 
execution by the tribal organization.

copies of contract documents and correspondence.
    (v) The proposed term of the contract.
    (vi) The proposed date for contract commencement.

organization.
    (d) Any procedures specified in this section concerning the manner

Sec. 36.207   Tribal clearances--renewal contracts.

    The Secretary may renew a contract for the same function(s) or 
programs as the original contract at the written request of the tribal 
organization designated in the tribal resolution. Requests for contract 
renewals shall be made as follows:
    (a) If the original contract provided services to only one Indian 
tribe, written applications for renewal shall be sent by the tribal 
organization to the Area Office as follows:
    (1) Directly, when the tribal organization involved is the governing 
body of the tribe.
    (2) Through the governing body of the tribe for review when the 
tribal organization is not the governing body of the tribe. Submission 
shall be made to the governing body at least 75 calendar days before the 
original contract expires. The tribal organization shall promptly notify 
the IHS Area Office in writing of the date the tribal governing body 
received the application. If, within 45 calendar days after receiving 
the application, the tribal governing body does not provide the IHS Area 
Director with a formal resolution objecting to the application for 
renewal, the absence of receipt of such a resolution shall constitute 
the tribe's request for renewal of the contract.
    (b) If the original contract provided services to more than one 
Indian tribe, the tribal organization must give a copy of the written 
application for renewal to each tribal governing body at least 75 
calendar days before the original contract expires. The tribal 
organization shall promptly notify the IHS Area Office where the 
application is to be submitted in writing, of the date the tribal 
governing bodies received copies of the application. If, within 45 
calendar days after receiving copies of the application none of the 
tribal governing bodies provide the appropriate IHS Area Office with a 
formal resolution objecting to the application for renewal, the absence 
of receipt of such resolutions shall constitute the tribes' request for 
renewal of the contract. If one or more of the tribal governing bodies 
involved object to the renewal, the contract will not be made until all 
the tribal governing bodies have approved the request or the matter is 
otherwise resolved.


<R05>
Sec. 36.208   Evaluation criteria.

    (a) Indian Self-Determination Contract Proposals will be evaluated 
to determine:
    (1) If the service to be rendered to Indian people by the proposed 
contract will be satisfactory;
    (2) If the proposed contract will assure that trust resources are 
protected; and
    (3) If the proposed contract will ensure proper completion and 
maintenance of the project or function involved. Failure to meet any of 
the above, may be cause for declination of the Indian Self-Determination 
Contract Proposal. However, the burden of proof to show cause for 
declination lies with the approving official.
    (b) To determine if an Indian Self-Determination Contract Proposal 
meets the above criteria, the Area Director and his staff will consider 
whether the tribal organization would be deficient in performance under 
the contract with respect to the factors listed in this paragraph.
    (1) Equipment, buildings and facilities. No higher standards with 
regard to buildings, facilities, or equipment shall be applied to tribal 
organizations than have previously been applied to IHS. The Indian 
Health Service shall make available the use of all equipment which has 
been allocated to the operation of the program by the IHS in the past, 
unless the IHS determines that the provision of such equipment will 
seriously interfere with the IHS's ability to provide services to Indian 
people in noncontracted programs. Where equipment is shared by the 
programs to be contracted and other non-contracted programs, equipment-
sharing or other suitable arrangements will be reflected in the 
contract.
    (2) Bookkeeping and accounting procedures. It must be clearly 
established by the Indian Health Service that the tribal organization 
which will undertake the contract does have an adequate accounting and 
bookkeeping system. IHS may assist the contractor in establishing an 
acceptable bookkeeping and accounting system.

[[Page 120]]

    (3) Substantive knowledge of the program to be contracted. The 
tribal organization shall be presumed to have substantive knowledge of 
the program to be contracted if it meets one or more of the following 
conditions:
    (i) The tribal organization has successfully managed a similar 
program before through grant or contract for which standards have been 
established.
    (ii) The members of the tribal organization have been consumers of 
such services in the past and have developed an understanding of the 
program sufficient to enable the tribal organization to effectively 
carry out the contract operation.
    (iii) The tribal organization has made arrangements to obtain and to 
develop its knowledge of the program.
    (4) Community support. Before the IHS can enter into a contract 
there must be a request made in accordance with Sec. 36.206. The tribal 
governing body's resolution under Sec. 36.206 shall be presumed to 
demonstrate that there is community support for the proposed contract. 
Any assertion of a lack of community support by persons to be served 
under the contract, is subject to exhaustion of tribal remedies by those 
making such assertions.
    (5) Adequacy of trained personnel. The adequacy of trained personnel 
available to the tribal organization to carry out the proposed contract 
will be presumed if any of the following conditions exists:
    (i) If the tribal organization has a personnel system that 
prescribes minimum occupational qualification standards, which shall be 
not less than minimum Civil Service standards where applicable and 
procedures for the selection of personnel on the basis of such 
qualifications, and the personnel to be used under the proposed contract 
are to be employed under the personnel system.
    (ii) If there is no tribal personnel system, it will be assumed that 
the personnel to be employed under the proposed contract are adequately 
trained if the tribal organization has established position descriptions 
for key personnel to be employed under the contract and will establish 
within a reasonable time a personnel system similar to the one described 
in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.
    (6) Other necessary components of contract performance. (i) The 
contractor's proposal must demonstrate the capacity to meet minimum 
health program and professional standards established by IHS for each 
major health service activity of the IHS. The Director will establish 
and make available to any prospective contractor the minimum standards 
for each major health service activity of the Indian Health Service. In 
evaluating the contractor's proposal, the IHS will take into account the 
prevailing health program and professional standards of IHS for the 
health service activity in the location concerned.
    (ii) The contractor's proposal will be evaluated to determine the 
contractor's ability to meet the Uniform Administrative Standards 
published as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in February 10, 1975, 40 FR 
6304.
    (iii) The ability of the contractor to carry out the contract in 
accordance with IHS policy, the applicable regulations of this part, and 
the Act.
    (iv) No other components shall be prescribed as a basis for 
declination unless such components are added to the regulations in this 
subpart by revision or amendment of regulations.
    (7) IHS officials may not decline to enter into a contract with a 
tribal organization because of any objection that would be overcome 
through the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 36.209   Government property.

    (a) In carrying out a contract made under this part, the Director 
will wherever possible, permit a tribal contractor to use buildings, 
facilities, and related equipment and other personal property owned by 
the IHS within his jurisdiction. Arrangements on the use of IHS property 
shall be provided for in the contract or other agreement as appropriate. 
In determining whether real or personal property can be provided, he 
shall determine whether the IHS can provide comparable services for any 
of the uncontracted part of the program.
    (b) Requests for the use of IHS property which arise after signing 
of the

[[Page 121]]

contract shall be submitted to the relevant IHS official by the tribal 
organization. Such requests should be granted unless such a use would 
seriously interfere with the administration of existing IHS programs. 
The property must conform to the minimum standards established pursuant 
to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651).


<R05>
Sec. 36.210   Submitting contract proposals.

    (a) When services under the proposed contract will be provided to

completed contract proposal with documentation of the tribal request(s) 
and approvals of each such tribe effected shall be delivered or mailed 
to the Area Director of that Area Office.
    (b) When services will be provided to tribes within the jurisdiction 
of more than one IHS Area Office, a copy of such proposals and 
documentation shall be forwarded to each of the Area Offices affected.

as requested, to overcome such deficiencies.
    (g) Approve or disapprove the proposal after fully reviewing and 
assessing it and any additional information submitted by the tribal 
organization provided, however, that no action to disapprove shall be 
taken during the period of provision of technical assistance.
    (h) Promptly notify the tribal organization in writing of the 
decision to approve or disapprove the proposal. If the proposal is 
disapproved, the notice shall contain but need not be limited to the 
following:

applicable program or administrative standards or fund restrictions, 
which preclude acceptance of the Indian Self-Determination Contract 
Proposal;

    (b) Special Bank Account. Until all advance payments made hereunder 
are liquidated and the Administering Office approves in writing the 
release of any funds due and payable to the Contractor, all advance 
payments and all other payments under the contract shall be made by 
check payable to the Contractor, and be marked for deposit only in a 
Special Bank Account with the bank designated in paragraph (k)(2) of 
this section. No part of the funds in the Special Bank Account shall be 
mingled with other funds of the contractor prior to withdrawal thereof 
from the Special Bank Account as hereinafter provided. Except as 
hereinafter provided, each withdrawal shall be made only by check of the 
Contractor

[[Page 126]]

countersigned on behalf of the Government by the Contracting Officer or 
such other person or persons as he may designate in writing (hereinafter 
called the ``Countersigning Agent''). Until otherwise determined by the 
Administering Office, countersignature on behalf of the Government will 
not be required.
    (c) Use of funds. The funds in the Special Bank Account may be 
withdrawn by the Contractor solely for the purposes of making payments 
for items of allowable cost or to reimburse the Contractor for such 
items of allowable cost, and for such other purposes as the 
Administering Office may approve in writing. Any interpretation required 
as to the proper use of funds shall be made in writing by the 
Administering Office.
    (d) Return of funds. The Contractor may at any time repay all or any 
part of the funds advanced hereunder. Whenever so requested in writing 
by the Administering Office, the Contractor shall repay to the 
Government such part of the unliquidated balance of advance payments as 
shall in the opinion of the Administering Office be in excess of current 
requirements, or (when added to total advance previously made and 
liquidated) in excess of the amount specified in paragraph (k)(1) of 
this section. In the event the Contractor fails to repay such part of 
the unliquidated balance of advance payments when so requested by the 
Administering Office, all or any part thereof may be withdrawn from the 
Special Bank Account by checks payable to the Treasurer of the United 
States signed solely by the Countersigning Agent and applied in 
reduction of advance payments then outstanding hereunder.
    (e) Liquidation. If not otherwise liquidated, the advance payments 
made hereunder shall be liquidated as herein provided. When the sum of 
all payments under this contract, other than advance payments, plus the 
unliquidated amount of advance payments are equal to the total estimated 
cost for the work under this contract or such lesser amount to which the 
total estimated cost under this contract may have been reduced, plus 
increases, if any, in this total estimated cost not exceeding, in the 
aggregate (including, without limitation, reimbursable costs incident to 
termination for cause and retrocession as estimated by the Contracting 
Officer), the Government shall thereafter withhold further payments to 
the Contractor and apply the amounts withheld against the Contractor's 
obligation to repay such advance payments until such advance payments 
shall have been fully liquidated. If upon completion, termination, or 
retrocession of the contract all advance payments have not been fully 
liquidated, the balances therefore shall be deducted from any sums 
otherwise due or which may become due to the Contractor from the 
Government, and any deficiency shall be paid by the Contractor to the 
Government upon demand.
    (f) Bank Agreement. Before an advance payment is made hereunder, the 
Contractor shall transmit to the Administering Office, in the form 
prescribed by such office, an Agreement in triplicate from the bank in 
which the Special Bank Account is established, clearly setting forth the 
special character of the account and the responsibilities of the bank 
thereunder. Wherever possible, such bank shall be a member bank of the 
Federal Reserve System, or an ``insured'' bank within the meaning of the 
Act creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Act of August 23, 
1935, 49 Stat. 685, as amended (12 U.S.C. 264).
    (g) Lien on Special Bank Account. The Government shall have a lien 
upon any balance in the Special Bank Account paramount to all other 
liens, which lien shall secure the repayment of any advance payments 
made hereunder.
    (h) Lien on property under contract. Any and all advance payments 
made under this contract shall be secured, when made, by a lien in favor 
of the Government, paramount to all other liens, upon the supplies or 
other things covered by this contract and on all material and other 
property acquired for or allocated to the performance of this contract, 
except to the extent that the Government by virtue of any other 
provision of this contract, or otherwise, shall have valid title to such 
supplies, materials, or other property as against other creditors of the 
Contractor. The Contractor shall identify, by marking or segregation, 
all property which is

[[Page 127]]

subject to a lien in favor of the Government by virtue of any provision 
of this contract in such a way as to indicate that it is subject to such 
lien and that it has been acquired for or allocated to the performance 
of this contract. If for any reason such supplies, materials, or other 
property are not identified by marking or segregation, the Government 
shall be deemed to have a lien to the extent of the Government's 
interest under this contract on any mass of property with which such 
supplies, materials, or other property are commingled. The Contractor 
shall maintain adequate accounting control over such property on his 
books and records. If at time during the progress of the work on the 
contract it becomes necessary to deliver any item or items and materials 
upon which the Government has a lien as aforesaid to a third person, the 
Contractor shall notify such third person of the lien herein provided 
and shall obtain from such third person a receipt, in duplicate, 
acknowledging, inter alia the existence of such lien. A copy of each 
receipt shall be delivered by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer. 
If this contract is terminated in whole or in part and the Contractor is 
authorized to sell or retain termination inventory acquired for or 
allocated to this contract, such sale or retention shall be made only if 
approved by the Contracting Officer, which approval shall constitute a 
release of the Government's lien hereunder to the extent that such 
termination inventory is sold or retained, and to the extent that the 
proceeds of the sale, or the credit allowed for such retention on the 
Contractor's termination claim, is applied in reduction of advance 
payments then outstanding hereunder.
    (i) Insurance. The Contractor represents and warrants that he is now 
maintaining with responsible insurance carriers, (1) insurance upon his 
own plant and equipment against fire and other hazards to the extent 
that like properties are usually insured by others operating plants and 
properties of similar character in the same general locality; (2) 
adequate insurance against liability on account of damage to persons or 
property; and (3) adequate insurance under all applicable workmen's 
compensation laws. The Contractor agrees that, until work under this 
contract has been completed and all advance payments made hereunder have 
been liquidated, he will (i) maintain such insurance; (ii) maintain 
adequate insurance upon any materials, parts, assemblies, subassemblies, 
supplies, equipment and other property acquired for or allocable to this 
contract and subject to the Government lien hereunder; and (iii) furnish 
such certificates with respect to his insurance as the Administering 
Office may from time to time require.
    (j) Prohibition against assignment. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this contract, the Contractor shall not transfer, pledge, 
or otherwise assign this contract, or any interest therein, or any claim 
arising thereunder, to any party or parties, bank, trust company, or 
other financing institution.
    (k) Designations and determinations--(1) Amount. The amount of 
advance payments at any time outstanding hereunder shall not exceed $--
----.
    (2) Depository. The bank designated for the deposit of payments made 
hereunder shall be:
    (3) Interest charge. No interest shall be charged for advance 
payments made hereunder. The Contractor shall charge interest at the 
rate of 6 percent per annum on subadvances or down payments to 
subcontractors, and such interest will be credited to the account of the 
Government. However, interest need not be charged on subadvances on 
nonprofit subcontracts with nonprofit educational or research 
institutions for experimental, research or development work.
    (4) Administering Office. The office administering advance payments 
shall be the office designated as having responsibility for awarding the 
contract.
    (l) Other security. The terms of this contract shall be considered 
adequate security for advance payments hereunder, except that if at any 
time the administering Office deems the security furnished by the 
Contractor to be inadequate, the Contractor shall furnish such 
additional security as may be satisfactory to the Administering Office, 
to the extent that such additional security is available.

an accounting of the amounts and purposes for which the contract funds 
were expended and information on the conduct of the program or services 
involved. The report shall include any other information requested by 
the Area Director and shall be submitted as follows:
    (i) When the contract is with the governing body of an Indian tribe, 
the tribe shall submit the report to the Area Director.
    (ii) When the contract is with a tribal organization other than the 
governing body of the tribe, the tribe has the option of having the 
tribal organization prepare the report and submit it to the tribe for 
review and approval before the tribe submits it to the Area Director.
    (iii) When the contract benefits more than one tribe, the tribal 
organization shall prepare and submit the report to each of the tribes 
benefiting under the contract. Each tribe shall endorse the report 
before submitting it to the Area Director.
    (2) The annual report shall be submitted to the Area Director within 
60 days of the end of the fiscal year in which the contract was

furnish other reports required by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 36.228   Availability of information.

and information concerning the contract available to the Indian people 
served or represented by the contractor.
    (b) A contractor shall hold confidential all information obtained by 
personnel under the contract from persons receiving services under the

individual, or as may be necessary to monitor the operations of the 
program or otherwise protect the Public Health. Information may be 
disclosed in a form which does not identify particular individuals.

subpart.

welfare or any persons, or (2) gross negligence or the mismanagement in 
the handling or use of funds under the contract, he will, in writing, 
notify the contractor of such determination and will request that the 
contractor take such corrective action within such period of time as the 
Director or his delegate may prescribe.
    (b) When the Director or his delegate determines that a contractor 
has not taken corrective action (as prescribed by him under paragraph

of the program, activity, or service involved.

described in paragraph (b) of this section, he shall in writing notify 
the contractor of such determination and of the contractor's right to 
request a review of such determination and of the determination 
described in paragraph (a) of this section. Such notification by the 
Director or his delegate shall set forth the reasons for the 
determination in sufficient detail to enable the contractor to respond 
and shall inform the contractor of its right to a hearing on the record 
before a Contract Appeals Board described in paragraph (d) of this

immediately rescind the contract in whole or in part and, if he deems it 
appropriate, assume or resume control or operation of the program, 
activity, or service involved. Upon such a decision he will immediately 
notify the contractor of such action and the basis therefor; and offer 
the contractor an opportunity for a hearing on the record before the 
Contract Appeals Board established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section to be held within 10 days of each action.
    (d)(1) The Contract Appeals Board shall be composed of 3 persons 
appointed by the Director, Indian Health Service. Such persons may not 
be selected from the immediate office of any person participating in the 
determinations at issue. The Board shall afford the contractor the 
right:
    (i) To notice of the issues to be considered;
    (ii) To be represented by counsel;

served by a

[[Page 131]]

retroceded or reassumed contract not less than the same quantity and 
quality of service it would have provided if there had been no contract.
    (b) The IHS shall endeavor to provide to the tribe(s) and Indians 
served by a retroceded or reassumed contract not less than the same 
quantity and quality of permanent and temporary personnel that meet the 
U.S. Civil Service qualifications, it would have provided if there has 
been no contract.
    (c) IHS officials cannot decline to accept a retroceded contract or 
to reassume a contract because they are unable to provide the quality

<R05>
Sec. 36.235   Contract funds.

Sec. 36.236   Unexpended funds under contract.

    (a) If it becomes apparent during the contract term that the

actual expenditures under the contract, the identified unexpended funds 
will be used to provide additional services or benefits within the scope 
or limitations of the contract.
    (b) When both the tribal organization and the IHS agree that it is 
not practicable to spend all contract funds during the contract term, to

the contract commenced, that are included in the contract amount are 
subject to the availability of appropriations from Congress and there 
shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government in regard to 
such funds unless and until they are appropriated. Funds appropriated 
during the fiscal year in which the contract commenced that are included 
in the contract amount but not expended at the end of such fiscal year 
may be carried over and used for contract purposes in the succeeding 
fiscal year of the contracts operation or, may be used to provide 
additional services upon modifications of the contract to include such 
services therein.
    Each succeeding year of the contract may be renegotiated prior to 
the end of the then current fiscal year in order to reflect changes that 
have taken place beyond the control of the contractor since the contract 
was originally negotiated or last renegotiated as is applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 37.3  Chest roentgenograms required for miners.

    (a) Voluntary examinations. Every operator shall provide to each 
miner who is employed in or at any of its underground coal mines and who 
was employed in underground coal mining prior to December 30, 1969, or 
who has completed the required examinations under Sec. 37.3(b) an 
opportunity for a chest roentgenogram in accordance with this subpart:
    (1) Following August 1, 1978 ALOSH will notify the operator of each 
underground coal mine of a period within which the operator may provide 
examinations to each miner employed at its coal mine. The period shall 
begin no sooner than the effective date of these regulations and end no 
later than a date specified by ALOSH separately for each coal mine. The 
termination date of the period will be approximately 5 years from the 
date of the first examination which was made on a miner employed by the 
operator in its coal mine under the former regulations of this subpart 
adopted July 27, 1973. Within the period specified by ALOSH for each 
mine, the operator may select a 6-month period within which to provide 
examinations in accordance with a plan approved under Sec. 37.5.


[[Page 146]]


    Example: ALOSH finds that between July 27, 1973, and March 31, 1975, 
the first roentgenogram for a miner who was employed at mine Y and who 
was employed in underground coal mining prior to December 30, 1969, was 
made on January 1, 1974. ALOSH will notify the operator of mine Y that 
the operator may select and designate on its plan a 6-month period 
within which to offer its examinations to its miners employed at mine Y. 
The 6-month period shall be scheduled between August 1, 1978 and January 
1, 1979 (5 years after January 1, 1974).

    (2) For all future voluntary examinations, ALOSH will notify the 
operator of each underground coal mine when sufficient time has elapsed 
since the end of the previous 6-month period of examinations. ALOSH will 
specify to the operator of each mine a period within which the operator 
may provide examinations to its miners employed at its coal mine. The 
period shall begin no sooner than 3\1/2\ years and end no later than 
4\1/2\ years subsequent to the ending date of the previous 6-month 
period specified for a coal mine either by the operator on an approved 
plan or by ALOSH if the operator did not submit an approved plan. Within 
the period specified by ALOSH for each mine, the operator may select a 
6-month period within which to provide examinations in accordance with a 
plan approved under Sec. 37.5.

    Example: ALOSH finds that examinations were previously provided to 
miners employed at mine Y in a 6-month period from July 1, 1979, to 
December 31, 1979. ALOSH notifies the operator at least 3 months before 
July 1, 1983 (3\1/2\ years after December 31, 1979) that the operator 
may select and designate on its plan the next 6-month period within 
which to offer examinations to its miners employed at mine Y. The 6-
month period shall be scheduled between July 1, 1983, and July 1, 1984 
(between 3\1/2\ and 4\1/2\ years after December 31, 1979).

    (3) Within either the next or future period(s) specified by ALOSH to 
the operator for each of its coal mines, the operator of the coal mine 
may select a different 6-month period for each of its mines within which 
to offer examinations. In the event the operator does not submit an 
approved plan, ALOSH will specify a 6-month period to the operator 
within which miners shall have the opportunity for examinations.
    (b) Mandatory examinations. Every operator shall provide to each 
miner who begins working in or at a coal mine for the first time after 
December 30, 1969:
    (1) An initial chest roentgenogram as soon as possible, but in no 
event later than 6 months after commencement of employment. A 
preemployment physical examination which was made within the 6 months 
prior to the date on which the miner started to work will be considered 
as fulfilling this requirement. An initial chest roentgenogram given to 
a miner according to former regulations for this subpart prior to August 
1, 1978 will also be considered as fulfilling this requirement.
    (2) A second chest roentgenogram, in accordance with this subpart, 3 
years following the initial examination if the miner is still engaged in 
underground coal mining. A second roentgenogram given to a miner 
according to former regulations under this subpart prior to August 1, 
1978 will be considered as fulfilling this requirement.
    (3) A third chest roentgenogram 2 years following the second chest 
roentgenogram if the miner is still engaged in underground coal mining 
and if the second roentgenogram shows evidence of category 1, category 
2, category 3 simple pneumoconioses, or complicated pneumoconioses (ILO 
Classification).
    (c) ALOSH will notify the miner when he or she is due to receive the 
second or third mandatory examination under (b) of this section. 
Similarly, ALOSH will notify the coal mine operator when the miner is to 
be given a second examination. The operator will be notified concerning 
a miner's third examination only with the miner's written consent, and 
the notice to the operator shall not state the medical reason for the 
examination nor that it is the third examination in the series. If the 
miner is notified by ALOSH that the third mandatory examination is due 
and the operator is not so notified, availability of the 
roentgenographic examination under the operator's plan shall constitute 
the operator's compliance with the requirement to provide a third 
mandatory examination even if the miner refuses to take the examination.
    (d) The opportunity for chest roentgenograms to be available by an 
operator for purposes of this subpart shall be

[[Page 147]]

provided in accordance with a plan which has been submitted and approved 
in accordance with this subpart.
    (e) Any examinations conducted by the Secretary in the National 
Study of Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis after January 1, 1977, but before 
August 1, 1978 shall satisfy the requirements of this section with 
respect to the specific examination given (see Sec. 37.6(d)).

interpret and classify the chest roentgenograms.
    (7) Assurances that: (i) The operator will not solicit a physician's 
roentgenographic or other findings concerning any miner employed by the 
operator,
    (ii) Instructions have been given to the person(s) giving the 
examinations that duplicate roentgenograms or copies of roentgenograms 
will not be made and that (except as may be necessary for the purpose of 
this subpart) the physician's roentgenographic and other findings, as 
well as the occupational history information obtained from a miner 
unless obtained prior to employment in a preemployment examination, and 
disclosed prior to employment, will not be disclosed in a manner which 
will permit identification of the employee with the information about 
him, and
    (iii) The roentgenographic examinations will be made at no charge to 
the miner.
    (b) Operators may provide for alternate facilities and ``A'' or 
``B'' readers in plans submitted for approval.
    (c) The change of operators of any mine operating under a plan 
approved pursuant to Sec. 37.5 shall not affect the plan of the operator 
which has transferred responsibility for the mine. Every plan shall be 
subject to revision in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) The operator shall advise ALOSH of any change in its plan. Each 
change

[[Page 148]]

in an approved plan is subject to the same review and approval as the 
originally approved plan.
    (e) The operator shall promptly display in a visible location on the 
bulletin board at the mine its proposed plan or proposed change in plan 
when it is submitted to ALOSH. The proposed plan or change in plan shall 
remain posted in a visible location on the bulletin board until ALOSH 
either grants or denies approval of it at which time the approved plan 
or denial of approval shall be permanently posted. In the case of an 
operator who is a construction contractor and who does not have a 
bulletin board, the construction contractor must otherwise notify its 
employees of the examination arrangements. Upon request, the contractor 
must show ALOSH written evidence that its employees have been notified.
    (f) Upon notification from ALOSH that sufficient time has elapsed 
since the previous period of examinations, the operator will resubmit 
its plan for each of its coal mines to ALOSH for approval for the next 
period of examinations (see Sec. 37.3(a)(2)). The plan shall include the 
proposed beginning and ending dates of the next period of examinations 
and all information required by paragraph (a) of this section.

the film surface and impinges on the center of the film;
    (9) A formal quality assurance program shall be established at each 
facility.
    (i) Radiographic processing:
    (1) Either automatic or manual film processing is acceptable. A 
constant time-temperature technique shall be meticulously employed for 
manual processing.
    (2) If mineral or other impurities in the processing water introduce 
difficulty in obtaining a high-quality roentgenogram, a suitable filter 
or purification system shall be used.
    (j) Before the miner is advised that the examination is concluded, 
the roentgenogram shall be processed and inspected and accepted for 
quality by the physician, or if the physician is not available, 
acceptance may be made by the radiologic technologist. In a case of a 
substandard roentgenogram, another shall be immediately made. All 
substandard roentgenograms shall be clearly marked as rejected and 
promptly sent to ALOSH for disposal.
    (k) An electric power supply shall be used which complies with the 
voltage,

[[Page 151]]

current, and regulation specified by the manufacturer of the machine.
    (l) A densitometric test object may be required on each 
roentgenogram for an objective evaluation of film quality at the 
discretion of ALOSH.
    (m) Each roentgenogram made hereunder shall be permanently and 
legibly marked with the name and address or ALOSH approval number of the 
facility at which it is made, the social security number of the miner, 
and the date of the roentgenogram. No other identifying markings shall 
be recorded on the roentgenogram.

Sec. 37.42   Approval of roentgenographic facilities.


    (a) Approval of roentgenographic facilities given prior to January 
1, 1976, shall terminate upon August 1, 1978 unless each of the 
following conditions have been met:
    (1) The facility must verify that it still meets the requirements 
set forth in the regulations for the second round of roentgenographic 
examinations (38 FR 20076) and it has not changed equipment since it was 
approved by NIOSH.
    (2) From July 27, 1973, to January 1, 1976, the facility submitted 
to ALOSH at least 50 roentgenograms which were interpreted by one or 
more ``B'' readers not employed by the facility who found no more than 5 
percent of all the roentgenograms unreadable.
    (b) Other facilities will be eligible to participate in this program 
when they demonstrate their ability to make high quality diagnostic 
chest roentgenograms by submitting to ALOSH six or more sample chest 
roentgenograms made and processed at the applicant facility and which 
are of acceptable quality to the Panel of ``B'' readers. Applicants 
shall also submit a roentgenogram of a plastic step-wedge object 
(available on loan from ALOSH) which was made and processed at the same 
time with the same technique as the roentgenograms submitted and 
processed at the facility for which approval is sought. At least one 
chest roentgenogram and one test object roentgenogram shall have been 
made with each unit to be used hereunder. All roentgenograms shall have 
been made within 15 calendar days prior to submission and shall be 
marked to identify the facility where each roentgenogram was made, the 
X-ray machine used, and the date each was made. The chest roentgenograms 
will be returned and may be the same roentgenograms submitted pursuant 
to Sec. 37.51.

    Note: The plastic step-wedge object is described in an article by E. 
Dale Trout and John P. Kelley appearing in ``The American Journal of 
Roentgenology, Radium Therapy and Nuclear Medicine,'' Vol. 117, No. 4, 
April 1973.

    (c) Each roentgenographic facility submitting chest roentgenograms 
for approval under this section shall complete and include an X-ray 
facility document describing each X-ray unit to be used to make chest 
roentgenograms under the act. The form shall include: (1) The date of 
the last radiation safety inspection by an appropriate licensing agency 
or, if no such agency exists, by a qualified expert as defined in NCRP 
Report No. 33 (see Sec. 37.43); (2) the deficiencies found; (3) a 
statement that all the deficiencies have been corrected; and (4) the 
date of acquisition of the X-ray unit. To be acceptable, the radiation 
safety inspection shall have been made within 1 year preceding the date 
of application.
    (d) Roentgenograms submitted with applications for approval under 
this section will be evaluated by the panel of ``B'' Readers or by a 
qualified radiological physicist or consultant. Applicants will be 
advised of any reasons for denial of approval.
    (e) ALOSH or its representatives may make a physical inspection of 
the applicant's facility and any approved roentgenographic facility at 
any reasonable time to determine if the requirements of this subpart are 
being met.
    (f) ALOSH may require a facility periodically to resubmit 
roentgenograms of a plastic step-wedge object, sample roentgenograms, or 
a Roentgenographic Facility Document for quality control purposes. 
Approvals granted hereunder may be suspended or withdrawn by notice in 
writing when in the opinion of ALOSH the quality of

[[Page 152]]

roentgenograms or information submitted under this section warrants such 
action. A copy of a notice withdrawing approval will be sent to each 
operator who has listed the facility as its facility for giving chest 
roentgenograms and shall be displayed on the mine bulletin board 
adjacent to the operator's approved plan. The approved plan will be 
reevaluated by ALOSH in light of this change.

Sec. 37.52  Method of obtaining definitive interpretations.

    (a) All chest roentgenograms which are first interpreted by an ``A'' 
or ``B'' reader will be submitted by ALOSH to a ``B'' reader qualified 
as described in Sec. 37.51. If there is agreement between the two 
interpreters as defined in paragraph (b) of this section the result 
shall be considered final and reported to MSHA for transmittal to the 
miner. When in the opinion of ALOSH substantial agreement is lacking, 
ALOSH shall obtain additional interpretations from the Panel of ``B'' 
readers. If interpretations are obtained from two or more ``B'' readers, 
and if two or more are in agreement then the highest major category 
shall be reported.
    (b) Two interpreters shall be considered to be in agreement when 
they both find either stage A, B, or C complicated pneumoconiosis, or 
their findings with regard to simple pneumoconiosis are both in the same 
major category, or (with one exception noted below) are within one minor 
category (ILO Classification 12-point scale) of each other. In the last 
situation, the higher of the two interpretations shall be reported. The 
only exception to the one minor category principle is a reading sequence 
of 0/1, 1/0, or 1/0, 0/1. When such a sequence occurs, it shall not be 
considered agreement, and a third (or more) interpretation shall be 
obtained until a consensus involving two or more readings in the same 
major category is obtained.

Sec. 37.53  Notification of abnormal roentgenographic findings.

    (a) Findings of, or findings suggesting, enlarged heart, 
tuberculosis, lung cancer, or any other significant abnormal findings 
other than pneumoconiosis shall be communicated by the first physician 
to interpret and classify the roentgenogram to the designated physician 
of the miner indicated on the miner's identifcation document. A copy of 
the communication shall be submitted to ALOSH. ALOSH will notify the 
miner to contact his or her physician when any physician who interprets 
and classifies the miner's

[[Page 154]]

roentgenogram reports significant abnormal findings other than 
pneumoconiosis.
    (b) In addition, when ALOSH has more than one roentgenogram of a 
miner in its files and the most recent examination was interpreted to 
show enlarged heart, tuberculosis, cancer, complicated pneumoconiosis, 
and any other significant abnormal findings, ALOSH will submit all of 
the miner's roentgenograms in its files with their respective 
interprtations to a ``B'' reader. The ``B'' reader will report any 
significant changes or progression of disease or other comments to ALOSH 
and ALOSH shall submit a copy of the report to the miner's designated 
physician.
    (c) All final findings regarding pneumoconiosis will be sent to the 
miner by MSHA in accordance with section 203 of the act (see 30 CFR part 
90). Positive findings with regard to pneumoconiosis will be reported to 
the miner's designated physician by ALOSH.
    (d) ALOSH will make every reasonable effort to process the findings 
described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of receipt of 
the information described in Sec. 37.60 in a complete and acceptable 
form. The information forwarded to MSHA will be in a form intended to 
facilitate prompt dispatch of the findings to the miner. The results of 
an examination made of a miner will not be processed by ALOSH if the 
examination was made within 6 months of the date of a previous 
acceptable examination.

together with the completed roentgenographic interpretation form and the 
completed miner identification document, shall be sumitted together for 
each miner to ALOSH within 14 calendar days after the roentgenographic 
examination is given and become the property of ALOSH.
    (b) If ALOSH deems any part submitted under paragraph (a) of this 
section inadequate, it will notify the operator of the deficiency. The 
operator shall promptly make appropriate arrangements for the necessary 
reexamination.
    (c) Failure to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be cause to revoke approval of a plan or any other approval as may 
be appropriate. An approval which has been revoked may be reinstated at 
the discretion of ALOSH after it receives satisfactory assurances and 
evidence that all deficiencies have been corrected and that effective 
controls have been instituted to prevent a recurrence.
    (d) Chest roentgenograms and other required documents shall be 
submitted only for miners. Results of preemployment physical 
examinations of persons who are not hired shall not be submitted.
    (e) If a miner refuses to participate in all phases of the 
examination prescribed in this subpart, no report need be made. If a 
miner refuses to participate in any phase of the examination prescribed 
in this subpart, all the forms shall be submitted with his or her name 
and social security account number on each. If any of the forms cannot 
be completed because of the miner's refusal, it shall be marked ``Miner 
Refuses,'' and shall be submitted. No submission shall be made, however,

with ALOSH that his or her roentgenogram be reevaluated. If the 
interpretation was based on agreement between an ``A'' reader and a 
``B'' reader, ALOSH will obtain one or more additional interpretations 
by ``B'' readers as necessary to obtain agreement in accord with 
Sec. 37.52(b), and MSHA shall report the results to the miner together 
with any rights which may accrue to the miner in accordance with 
Sec. 37.7. If the reported interpretation was based on agreement between 
two (or more) ``B'' readers, the reading will be accepted as conclusive 
and the miner shall be so informed by MSHA.

subsequent to August 1, 1978, may file a written request with ALOSH to 
review its findings. The standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section apply and the operator and miner will be notified by MSHA 
whether the miner is entitled to the option to transfer.

Sec. 50.101  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to each entity which applies for a research, 
research-training, or research-related grant or cooperative agreement 
under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. It requires each such entity 
to establish uniform policies and procedures for investigating and 
reporting instances of alleged or apparent misconduct involving research 
or research training, applications for support of research or research 
training, or related research activities that are supported with funds 
made available under the PHS Act.

[[Page 162]]

This subpart does not supersede and is not intended to set up an 
alternative to established procedures for resolving fiscal 
improprieties, issues concerning the ethical treatment of human or 
animal subjects, or criminal matters.

Sec. 50.102  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Act means the Public Health Service Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 201 
et seq.).
    Inquiry means information gathering and initial factfinding to 
determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct 
warrants an investigation.
    Institution means the public or private entity or organization 
(including federal, state, and other agencies) that is applying for 
financial assistance from the PHS, e.g., grant or cooperative 
agreements, including continuation awards, whether competing or 
noncompeting. The organization assumes legal and financial 
accountability for the awarded funds and for the performance of the 
supported activities.
    Investigation means the formal examination and evaluation of all 
relevant facts to determine if misconduct has occurred.
    Misconduct or Misconduct in Science means fabrication, 
falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that seriously deviate 
from those that are commonly accepted within the scientific community 
for proposing, conducting, or reporting research. It does not include 
honest error or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of 
data.
    OSI means the Office of Scientific Integrity, a component of the 
Office of the Director of the National Institutes for Health (NIH), 
which oversees the implementation of all PHS policies and procedures 
related to scientific misconduct; monitors the individual investigations 
into alleged or suspected scientific misconduct conducted by 
institutions that receive PHS funds for biomedical or behavioral 
research projects or programs; and conducts investigations as necessary.
    OSIR means the Office of Scientific Integrity Review, a component of 
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, which is responsible 
for establishing overall PHS policies and procedures for dealing with 
misconduct in science, overseeing the activities of PHS research 
agencies to ensure that these policies and procedures are implemented, 
and reviewing all final reports of investigations to assure that any 
findings and recommendations are sufficiently documented. The OSIR also 
makes final recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Health on 
whether any sanctions should be imposed and, if so, what they should be 
in any case where scientific misconduct has been established.
    PHS means the Public Health Service, an operating division of the 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). References to PHS include 
organizational units within the PHS that have delegated authority to 
award financial assistance to support scientific activities, e.g., 
Bureaus, Institutes, Divisions, Centers or Offices.

Sec. 50.103  Assurance--Responsibilities of PHS awardee and applicant institutions.

    (a) Assurances. Each institution that applies for or receives 
assistance under the Act for any project or program which involves the 
conduct of biomedical or behavioral research must have an assurance 
satisfactory to the Secretary that the applicant:
    (1) Has established an administrative process, that meets the 
requirements of this Subpart, for reviewing, investigating, and 
reporting allegations of misconduct in science in connection with PHS-
sponsored biomedical and behavioral research conducted at the applicant 
institution or sponsored by the applicant; and
    (2) Will comply with its own administrative process and the 
requirements of this Subpart.
    (b) Annual Submission. An applicant or recipient institution shall 
make an annual submission to the OSI as follows:
    (1) The institution's assurance shall be submitted to the OSI, on a 
form prescribed by the Secretary, as soon as

[[Page 163]]

possible after November 8, 1989, but no later than January 1, 1990, and 
updated annually therefter on a date specified by OSI. Copies of the 
form may be requested through the Director, OSI.
    (2) An institution shall submit, along with its annual assurance, 
such aggregate information on allegations, inquiries, and investigations 
as the Secretary may prescribe.
    (c) General Criteria. In general, an applicant institution will be 
considered to be in compliance with its assurance if it:
    (1) Establishes, keeps current, and upon request provides the OSIR, 
the OSI, and other authorized Departmental officials the policies and 
procedures required by this subpart.
    (2) Informs its scientific and administrative staff of the policies 
and procedures and the importance of compliance with those policies and 
procedures.
    (3) Takes immediate and appropriate action as soon as misconduct on 
the part of employees or persons within the organization's control is 
suspected or alleged.
    (4) Informs, in accordance with this subpart, and cooperates with 
the OSI with regard to each investigation of possible misconduct.
    (d) Inquiries, Investigations, and Reporting--Specific Requirements. 
Each applicant's policies and procedures must provide for:
    (1) Inquiring immediately into an allegation or other evidence of 
possible misconduct. An inquiry must be completed within 60 calendar 
days of its initiation unless circumstances clearly warrant a longer 
period. A written report shall be prepared that states what evidence was 
reviewed, summarizes relevant interviews, and includes the conclusions 
of the inquiry. The individual(s) against whom the allegation was made 
shall be given a copy of the report of inquiry. If they comment on that 
report, their comments may be made part of the record. If the inquiry 
takes longer than 60 days to complete, the record of the inquiry shall 
include documentation of the reasons for exceeding the 60-day period.
    (2) Protecting, to the maximum extent possible, the privacy of those 
who in good faith report apparent misconduct.
    (3) Affording the affected individual(s) confidential treatment to 
the maximum extent possible, a prompt and thorough investigation, and an 
opportunity to comment on allegations and findings of the inquiry and/or 
the investigation.
    (4) Notifying the Director, OSI, in accordance with Sec. 50.104(a) 
when, on the basis of the initial inquiry, the institution determines 
that an investigation is warranted, or prior to the decision to initiate 
an investigation if the conditions listed in Sec. 50.104(b) exist.
    (5) Notifying the OSI within 24 hours of obtaining any reasonable 
indication of possible criminal violations, so that the OSI may then 
immediately notify the Department's Office of Inspector General.
    (6) Maintaining sufficiently detailed documentation of inquiries to 
permit a later assessment of the reasons for determining that an 
investigation was not warranted, if necessary. Such records shall be 
maintained in a secure manner for a period of at least three years after 
the termination of the inquiry, and shall, upon request, be provided to 
authorized HHS personnel.
    (7) Undertaking an investigation within 30 days of the completion of 
the inquiry, if findings from that inquiry provide sufficient basis for 
conducting an investigation. The investigation normally will include 
examination of all documentation, including but not necessarily limited 
to relevant research data and proposals, publications, correspondence, 
and memoranda of telephone calls. Whenever possible, interviews should 
be conducted of all individuals involved either in making the allegation 
or against whom the allegation is made, as well as other individuals who 
might have information regarding key aspects of the allegations; 
complete summaries of these interviews should be prepared, provided to 
the interviewed party for comment or revision, and included as part of 
the investigatory file.
    (8) Securing necessary and appropriate expertise to carry out a 
thorough and authoritative evaluation of the relevant evidence in any 
inquiry or investigation.

[[Page 164]]

    (9) Taking precautions against real or apparent conflicts of 
interest on the part of those involved in the inquiry or investigation.
    (10) Preparing and maintaining the documentation to substantiate the 
investigation's findings. This documentation is to be made available to 
the Director, OSI, who will decide whether that Office will either 
proceed with its own investigation or will act on the institution's 
findings.
    (11) Taking interim administrative actions, as appropriate, to 
protect Federal funds and insure that the purposes of the Federal 
financial assistance are carried out.
    (12) Keeping the OSI apprised of any developments during the course 
of the investigation which disclose facts that may affect current or 
potential Department of Health and Human Services funding for the 
individual(s) under investigation or that the PHS needs to know to 
ensure appropriate use of Federal funds and otherwise protect the public 
interest.
    (13) Undertaking diligent efforts, as appropriate, to restore the 
reputations of persons alleged to have engaged in misconduct when 
allegations are not confirmed, and also undertaking diligent efforts to 
protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good 
faith, make allegations.
    (14) Imposing appropriate sanctions on individuals when the 
allegation of misconduct has been substantiated.
    (15) Notifying the OSI of the final outcome of the investigation.


<R05>
Sec. 50.104  Reporting to the OSI.

    (a)(1) An institution's decision to initiate an investigation must 
be reported in writing to the Director, OSI, on or before the date the 
investigation begins. At a minimum, the notification should include the 
name of the person(s) against whom the allegations have been made, the 
general nature of the allegation, and the PHS application or grant 
number(s) involved. Information provided through the notification will 
be held in confidence to the extent permitted by law, will not be 
disclosed as part of the peer review and Advisory Committee review 
processes, but may be used by the Secretary in making decisions about 
the award or continuation of funding.
    (2) An investigation should ordinarily be completed within 120 days 
of its initiation. This includes conducting the investigation, preparing 
the report of findings, making that report available for comment by the 
subjects of the investigation, and submitting the report to the OSI. If 
they can be identified, the person(s) who raised the allegation should 
be provided with those portions of the report that address their role 
and opinions in the investigation.
    (3) Institutions are expected to carry their investigations through 
to completion, and to pursue diligently all significant issues. If an 
institution plans to terminate an inquiry or investigation for any 
reason without completing all relevant requirements under 
Sec. 50.103(d), a report of such planned termination, including a 
description of the reasons for such termination, shall be made to OSI, 
which will then decide whether further investigation should be 
undertaken.
    (4) The final report submitted to the OSI must describe the policies 
and procedures under which the investigation was conducted, how and from 
whom information was obtained relevant to the investigation, the 
findings, and the basis for the findings, and include the actual text or 
an accurate summary of the views of any individual(s) found to have 
engaged in misconduct, as well as a description of any sanctions taken 
by the institution.
    (5) If the institution determines that it will not be able to 
complete the investigation in 120 days, it must submit to the OSI a 
written request for an extension and an explanation for the delay that 
includes an interim report on the progress to date and an estimate for 
the date of completion of the report and other necessary steps. Any 
consideration for an extension must balance the need for a thorough and 
rigorous examination of the facts versus the interests of the subject(s) 
of the investigation and the PHS in a timely resolution of the matter. 
If the request is granted, the institution must file periodic progress 
reports as requested by the OSI. If satisfactory progress is not made in 
the institution's investigation,

[[Page 165]]

the OSI may undertake an investigation of its own.
    (6) Upon receipt of the final report of investigation and supporting 
materials, the OSI will review the information in order to determine 
whether the investigation has been performed in a timely manner and with 
sufficient objectivity, thoroughness and competence. The OSI may then 
request clarification or additional information and, if necessary, 
perform its own investigation. While primary responsibility for the 
conduct of investigations and inquiries lies with the institution, the 
Department reserves the right to perform its own investigation at any 
time prior to, during, or following an institution's investigation.
    (7) In addition to sanctions that the institution may decide to 
impose, the Department also may impose sanctions of its own upon 
investigators or institutions based upon authorities it possesses or may 
possess, if such action seems appropriate.
    (b) The institution is responsible for notifying the OSI if it 
ascertains at any stage of the inquiry or investigation, that any of the 
following conditions exist:
    (1) There is an immediate health hazard involved;
    (2) There is an immediate need to protect Federal funds or 
equipment;
    (3) There is an immediate need to protect the interests of the 
person(s) making the allegations or of the individual(s) who is the 
subject of the allegations as well as his/her co-investigators and 
associates, if any;
    (4) It is probable that the alleged incident is going to be reported 
publicly.
    (5) There is a reasonable indication of possible criminal violation. 
In that instance, the institution must inform OSI within 24 hours of 
obtaining that information. OSI will immediately notify the Office of 
the Inspector General.


<R05>
Sec. 50.105  Institutional compliance.

    Institutions shall foster a research environment that discourages 
misconduct in all research and that deals forthrightly with possible 
misconduct associated with research for which PHS funds have been 
provided or requested. An institution's failure to comply with its 
assurance and the requirements of this subpart may result in enforcement 
action against the institution, including loss of funding, and may lead 
to the OSI's conducting its own investigation.

         Appendix to Subpart B of Part 50--Required Consent Form

    Notice: YOUR DECISION AT ANY TIME NOT TO BE STERILIZED WILL NOT 
RESULT IN THE WITHDRAWAL OR WITHHOLDING OF ANY BENEFITS PROVIDED BY 
PROGRAMS OR PROJECTS RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDS.

                        Consent to Sterilization

    I have asked for and received information about sterilization from 
-------------- (doctor or clinic). When I first asked for the 
information, I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely 
up to me. I was told that I could decide not to be sterilized. If I 
decide not to be sterilized, my decision will not affect my right to 
future care or treatment. I will not lose any help or benefits from 
programs receiving Federal funds, such as A.F.D.C. or medicaid that I am 
now getting or for which I may become eligible.
    I UNDERSTAND THAT THE STERILIZATION MUST BE CONSIDERED PERMANENT AND 
NOT REVERSIBLE. I HAVE DECIDED THAT I DO NOT WANT TO BECOME PREGNANT, 
BEAR CHILDREN OR FATHER CHILDREN.
    I was told about those temporary methods of birth control that are 
available and could be provided to me which will allow me to bear or 
father a child in the future. I have rejected these alternatives and 
chosen to be sterilized.
    I understand that I will be sterilized by an operation known as a --
------------. The discomforts, risks and benefits associated with the 
operation have been explained to me. All my questions have been answered 
to my satisfaction.
    I understand that the operation will not be done until at least 30 
days after I sign this form. I understand that I can change my

[[Page 169]]

mind at any time and that my decision at any time not to be sterilized 
will not result in the withholding of any benefits or medical services 
provided by federally funded programs.
    I am at least 21 years of age and was born on -- (day), ---------- 
(month), ---- (year).
    I, --------------, hereby consent of my own free will to be 
sterilized by -------------- by a method called --------------. My 
consent expires 180 days from the date of my signature below.
    I also consent to the release of this form and other medical records 
about the operation to:
    Representatives of the Department of Health and Human Services or
    Employees of programs or projects funded by that Department but only 
for determining if Federal laws were observed.
    I have received a copy of this form.

U.S.C. 216); 45 CFR 16.3(c).

    Source: 54 FR 34770, Aug. 22, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 50.401  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes an informal procedure for the resolution of 
certain postaward grant and cooperative agreement disputes within PHS.


<R05>
Sec. 50.402  To what programs do these regulations apply?

    This subpart applies to all grant and cooperative agreement 
programs, except block grants, which are administered by the U.S. Public 
Health Service, including those administered by the National Institutes 
of Health; the Health Resources and Services Administration; the Centers 
for Disease Control; the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry; the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration; the 
Food and Drug Administration; the Indian Health Service; the Office of 
the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH); and the PHS regional offices.


<R05>
Sec. 50.403  What is the policy basis for these procedures?

    The Secretary of Health and Human Services has established a 
Departmental Appeals Board for the purpose of providing a fair and 
flexible process for the appeal of written final decisions involving 
certain grant and cooperative agreement programs administered by 
constituent agencies of the Department. The regulatory provision which 
establishes the circumstances under which the Board will accept an 
appeal (45 CFR 16.3) provides, among other things, that the appellant 
must have exhausted any preliminary appeal process required by 
regulation before a formal appeal to the Departmental Board will be 
allowed. These regulations provide such an informal preliminary 
procedure for resolution of disputes within PHS in order to preclude 
submission of cases to the Departmental Appeals Board before PHS has

[[Page 172]]

had an opportunity to review decisions of its officials and to settle 
disputes with grantees.


<R05>
Sec. 50.404  What disputes are covered by these procedures?

    (a) These procedures are applicable to the following adverse 
determinations under PHS discretionary project grants and cooperative 
agreements (hereinafter both referred to as grants):
    (1) Termination, in whole or in part, of a grant for failure of the 
grantee to carry out its approved project in accordance with the 
applicable law and the terms and conditions of such assistance or for 
failure of the grantee otherwise to comply with any law, regulation, 
assurance, term, or condition applicable to the grant.
    (2) A determination that an expenditure not allowable under the 
grant has been charged to the grant or that the grantee has otherwise 
failed to discharge its obligation to account for grant funds.
    (3) A determination that a grant is void.
    (4) A denial of a noncompeting continuation award under the project 
period system of funding where the denial is for failure to comply with 
the terms of a previous award.
    (b) A determination subject to this subpart may not be reviewed by 
the review committee described in Sec. 50.405 unless an officer or 
employee of the agency, OASH, or the regional office has notified the 
grantee in writing of the adverse determination. The notification must 
set forth the reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to 
enable the grantee to respond and must inform the grantee of the 
opportunity for review under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 50.405  What is the structure of review committees?

    The head of each agency or his/her designee shall appoint review 
committees to review appeals of adverse determinations made by 
headquarters officials for programs under the jurisdiction of that 
agency. The Assistant Secretary for Health, or his/her designee, shall 
appoint review committees to review adverse determinations made by OASH 
officials and regional officials for programs under their jurisdiction. 
A minimum of three employees shall be appointed (one of whom shall be 
designated as chairperson) either on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis, or 
as regular members of review committees for such terms as may be 
designated. None of the members of the review committee reviewing any 
given appeal may be from the office of the responsible official whose 
adverse determination is being appealed (e.g., project officer, grants 
specialist, program manager, grants management officer).


<R05>
Sec. 50.406  What are the steps in the process?

    (a) A grantee with respect to whom an adverse determination 
described in Sec. 50.404(a) above has been made and who desires a review 
of that determination must submit a request for such review to the head 
of the appropriate agency or his/her designee (or in the case of an OASH 
program or regional office determination, to the Assistant Secretary for 
Health or his/her designee) no later than 30 days after the written 
notification of the determination is received, except that if the 
grantee shows good cause why an extension of time should be granted, the 
head of the appropriate agency or his/her designee (or in the case of an 
OASH program or regional office determination, the Assistant Secretary 
for Health or his/her designee) may grant an extension of time.
    (b) The request for review must include a copy of the adverse 
determination, must identify the issue(s) in dispute, and must contain a 
full statement of the grantee's position with respect to such issue(s) 
and the pertinent facts and reasons in support of the grantee's 
position. In addition to the required written statement, the grantee 
shall provide copies of any documents supporting its claim.
    (c) When a request for review has been filed under this subpart with 
respect to an adverse determination, no action may be taken by the 
awarding agency, OASH, or regional office pursuant to such determination 
until the request has been disposed of, except that the filing of the 
request shall not affect any authority which the agency, OASH, or 
regional office may have to suspend assistance or otherwise to withhold 
or defer payments under the

[[Page 173]]

grant during proceedings under this subpart. This paragraph does not 
require the awarding agency, OASH, or regional office to provide 
continuation funding during the appeal process to a grantee whose 
noncompeting continuation award has been denied.
    (d) Upon receipt of a request for review, the head of the agency or 
his/her designee (or, if the adverse determination was made in an OASH 
program or regional office, the Assistant Secretary for Health or his/
her designee) will make a decision as to whether the dispute is 
reviewable under this subpart and will promptly notify the grantee and 
the office responsible for the adverse determination of this decision. 
If the head of the agency or his/her designee (or, if applicable, the 
Assistant Secretary for Health or his/her designee) determines that the 
dispute is reviewable, he/she will forward the matter to the review 
committee appointed under Sec. 50.405.
    (e) The agency, OASH, or regional office involved will provide the 
review committee appointed under Sec. 50.405 with copies of all relevant 
background materials (including application(s), award(s), summary 
statement(s), and correspondence) and any additional pertinent 
information available. These materials must be tabbed and organized 
chronologically and accompanied by an indexed list identifying each 
document.
    (f) The grantee shall be given an opportunity to provide the review 
committee with additional statements and documentation not provided in 
the request for review described in paragraph (b) of this section. This 
additional submission, which must be organized and indexed as indicated 
under paragraph (e) of this section, should provide only material that 
is relevant to the review committee's deliberation of the issues in the 
case.
    (g) The review committee may, at its discretion, invite the grantee 
and/or the agency/OASH/regional office staff to discuss the pertinent 
issues with the committee and to submit such additional information as 
the committee deems appropriate.
    (h) Based on its review, the review committee will prepare a written 
decision to be signed by the chairperson and each of the other committee 
members. The review committee shall send the written decision with a 
transmittal letter to the grantee and shall send a copy of both to the 
official responsible for the adverse determination. If the decision is 
adverse to the grantee's position, the transmittal letter must state the 
grantee's right to appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board under 45 CFR 
part 16.

<R05>
Sec. 50.503   Policy.

    It is the policy of the Secretary that program funds which are 
utilized for the acquisition of drugs be expended in the most economical 
manner feasible. In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary has 
established, in 45 CFR part 19, a procedure for determining the Maximum 
Allowable Cost for drugs which are purchased with program funds.


<R05>
Sec. 50.504   Allowable cost of drugs.

    (a) The maximum amount which may be expended from program funds for 
the acquisition of any drug shall be the lowest of
    (1) The maximum allowable cost (MAC) of the drug, if any, 
established in accordance with 45 CFR part 19, plus a dispensing fee 
determined by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, to be reasonable;
    (2) The acquisition cost of the drug plus a dispensing fee 
determined by the Secretary, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section, to be reasonable; or
    (3) The provider's usual and customary charge to the public for the 
drug; Provided, That the MAC established for any drug shall not apply to 
a brand of that drug prescribed for a patient which the prescriber has 
certified, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, is 
medically necessary for that patient; And Provided further, That where 
compensation for drug dispensing is included in other costs allowable 
under the applicable program statute and regulations, the terms and 
conditions of the grant or contract, and the applicable cost principles 
prescribed in 45 CFR part 74, no separate dispensing fee will be 
recognized.
    (b) In determining whether a dispensing fee is reasonable, the 
Secretary will take into account:
    (1) Cost components such as overhead, professional services, and 
profits,
    (2) Payment practices of third-party payment organizations, 
including other Federal programs such as titles XVIII and XIX of the 
Social Security Act; and

particular patient shall be in the prescriber's own handwriting, in such 
form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe. An example of an 
acceptable certification is the notation ``brand necessary''. A 
procedure for checking a box on a form will not constitute an acceptable 
certification.

<R05>
Sec. 51b.406  How will grant applications be evaluated and the grants awarded?

     (a) Within the limits of funds available, the Secretary may award a 
grant to assist in meeting the cost of a venereal disease control 
program. Before awarding a grant to a political subdivision of a State, 
the Secretary will consult with the State health authority.
     (b) Priorities for funding will be based on the following factors:
     (1) The relative extent of the venereal disease problem in the area 
served by the applicant.
     (2) The design of the venereal disease prevention and control 
program.
     (3) The general quality of the applicant's plan of operation and 
objectives in accordance with the requirements in these regulations. 
Emphasis will be placed on determining the extent to which services are 
coordinated among health care providers in the area served and 
integrated into a cohesive plan for delivery of service to groups having 
the highest incidence of venereal disease.
     (4) The capacity of the applicant to make effective use of Federal 
funds.
    (5) The commitment of the applicant to the control of venereal 
disease as reflected in the commitment of applicant resources to the 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 51b.407  How can grant funds be used?

    Grant funds awarded under this subpart may be used only for programs 
approved under section 318(c), and with respect to public information 
and education, those programs approved under section 318(b) of the Act. 
Unless specifically approved, grant funds shall not be used for 
performing diagnostic tests (other than gonorrhea screening tests), 
maintaining central registries, purchasing data processing equipment, or 
providing diagnostic and treatment facilities and services. The 
applicant must provide assurances, however, that these services will be 
available as needed as an adjunct to control program activities 
supported with grant funds. To obtain special approval for grant support 
of such activities, the grantee shall justify the exception to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary that funds for

[[Page 184]]

this purpose are necessary for the proper conduct of the program and are 
otherwise unavailable. Support of these services will generally be 
approved only in the following situations:
    (a) Special studies or demonstrations, (b) the support of 
developmental or start-up activity, or (c) the support of an essential 
service which will result in a savings to a detection or prevention 
activity supported by the grant. Unless otherwise approved, exceptions 
based on paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are only allowed during 
one funding period. The grantee is expected to support these activities 
in subsequent funding periods.

the evaluation of the project, and specify the measures and instruments 
of measurement to be used?
    (6) Is the budget request reasonable and consistent with the 
intended use of grant funds?
    (7) If the applicant intends only to evaluate an existing disease 
prevention and control approach, are the objectives substantially 
different from those which could be met by routine program evaluation?


<R05>
Sec. 51b.606  How can grant funds be used?

    (a) Grant funds may be used for the costs associated with planning, 
organizing, and conducting applied research, demonstrations, and public 
information and education programs.

indirect costs, if any, which will be calculated by the Secretary 
either:

[[Page 189]]

    (1) On the basis of the estimate of the actual indirect costs 
reasonably related to the project; or
    (2) On the basis of a percentage of all, or a portion of, the 
estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable 
assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the 
approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an estimated 
provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs 
(such as fringe benefit rates) subject to upward (within the limits of 
available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when 
the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has 
been determined by the Secretary: Provided, however, That no grant shall 
be made for an amount in excess of the total cost found necessary by the 
Secretary to carry out the project.
    (i) In determining the percentage of project costs to be borne by 
the grantee, factors which the Secretary will take into consideration 
will include the following:
    (A) The ability of the grantee to finance its share of project costs 
from non-Federal sources;
    (B) The need in the area served by the project for the services to 
be provided; and
    (C) The extent to which the project will provide services in an 
innovative manner which the Secretary desires to stimulate in the 
interest of developing more effective health service delivery systems on 
a regional or national basis.
    (ii) At any time after approval of an application under this part, 
the Secretary may retroactively agree to a percentage of project costs 
to be borne by the grantee lower than that determined pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section where he finds that changed 
circumstances justify a smaller contribution.
    (iii) In determining the grantee's share of project costs, costs 
borne by Federal grant funds, or costs used to match other Federal 
grants, may not be included except as otherwise provided by law or 
regulations.
    (b) All grant awards shall be in writing, and shall set forth the 
amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.
    (c) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award shall 
commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, 
supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved 
project or portion thereof. For continuation support, grantees must make 
separate application.


<R05>
Sec. 51c.107   Use of project funds.

determines such payments necessary to promote prompt initiation and 
advancement of the approved project.


<R05>
Sec. 51c.109   Nondiscrimination.

    (a) Attention is called to the requirements of title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 252, (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.)) and in

United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be 
excluded from participation, in be denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving 
Federal Financial assistance. A regulation implementing such title VI, 
which applies to grants made under this part, has been issued by the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services with the approval of the 
President (45 CFR part 80). In addition, no person shall, on the grounds 
of age, sex, creed, or marital status (unless otherwise medically 
indicated), be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits

benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 51c.110   Confidentiality.

    All information as to personal facts and circumstances obtained by 
the project staff about recipients of services shall be held 
confidential, and shall not be divulged without the individual's consent 
except as may be required by law or as may be necessary to provide 
service to the individual or to provide for medical audits by the 
Secretary or his designee with appropriate safeguards for 
confidentiality of patient records. Otherwise, information may be 
disclosed only in summary, statistical, or other form which does not 
identify particular individuals.


<R05>

    (a) Accounting for grant award payments. All payments made by the 
Secretary shall be recorded by the grantee in accounting records 
separate from the records of all other funds, including funds derived

grantee shall account for the sum total of all amounts paid as well as 
other funds and in-kind contributions by presenting or otherwise making 
available evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of expenditure for 
direct and indirect costs meeting the requirements of this part: 
Provided, however, That when the amount awarded for indirect costs was 
based on a predetermined fixed-percentage of estimated direct costs, the 
amount allowed for indirect costs shall be computed on the basis of such 
predetermined fixed-percentage rates applied to the total, or a selected 
element thereof, of the reimbursable direct costs incurred.
    (b) Accounting for interest earned on grant funds. Pursuant to 
section 203 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C.

defined, must return all interest earned on grant funds to the Federal 
Government.
    (c) Grant closeout--(1) Date of final accounting. A grantee shall 
render, with respect to each approved project, a full account, as 
provided herein, as of the date of the termination of grant support. The 
Secretary may require other special and periodic accounting.

Government as final settlement with respect to each approved project the 
total sum of:
    (i) Any amount not accounted for pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section;

Sec. 51c.504  Project elements.

    (a) General requirements. A grantee which has received a grant under 
section 330 of the Act for a project which includes the acquisition and/
or modernization of an existing building must:
    (1) Assurances. Comply with the assurances provided pursuant to this 
subpart.
    (2) Approval of estimated cost. Not enter into any contract for the 
acquisition and/or modernization funded under this subpart where the 
cost of such acquisition and/or modernization exceeds the estimates in 
the application, without the prior approval of the Secretary.
    (3) Non-default. Make every effort to prevent any default on any 
loan secured by the building and, in the event of a default, promptly 
notify the Secretary of the default and make every effort on a timely 
basis to cure the default.
    (b) Requirements for acquisition grants. In addition to the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a grantee which has 
received a grant under section 330 of the Act for a project which 
includes the acquisition of an existing building must:
    (1) Bona-fide sale. Acquire or, in the case of a grant solely for 
amortization of principal and payment of interest on an existing loan, 
have acquired the existing building pursuant to a bona-fide sale 
involving an actual cost to the applicant and resulting in additional or 
improved facilities for the purposes of the project.
    (2) Standards of construction and equipment. Except in the case of a 
grant solely for amortization of principal and payment of interest on an 
existing loan, obtain a determination by the Secretary that the facility 
conforms (or upon completion of any necessary alteration and renovation 
or modernization will conform) to the standards set forth in 
Sec. 51c.503(a)(7)(iii) of this subpart before entering into a final or 
unconditional contract for the acquisition. Where the Secretary finds 
that exceptions to or modifications of any such standards would be 
consistent with the purposes of the Act and of the program, he may 
authorize such exceptions or modifications.
    (3) Financing. Where the grantee will obtain a loan secured by the 
building in order to acquire the building, obtain such financing at the 
lowest current rate prevailing in the area for comparable loans on 
comparable facilities.
    (c) Requirements for modernization grants. In addition to the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a grantee which has 
received a grant under section 330 of the Act for a project which 
includes the modernization of an existing building must:
    (1) Costs in excess of approved costs. Finance all costs in excess 
of the estimated costs approved in the application and submit to the 
Secretary for prior approval any changes that substantially alter the 
scope of the function, utilities, or safety of the facility.
    (2) Competitive bids. (i) Obtain the approval of the Secretary 
before the project is advertised or placed on the market for bidding; 
such approval must include a determination by the Secretary that the 
final plans and specifications conform to the standards set forth in 
Sec. 51c.503(a)(7)(iii) of these regulations.
    (ii) Except as otherwise provided by State or local law, contract 
for construction (including the purchase and installation of built-in 
equipment) on a lump sum fixed-price basis, and award

[[Page 200]]

contracts on the basis of competitive bidding obtained by public 
advertising with award of the contracts to the lowest responsive and 
responsible bidders. The provision for exceptions based on State and 
local law shall not be invoked to give local contractors or suppliers a 
percentage preference over non-local contractors bidding for the same 
contract. Such practices are precluded by this paragraph.
    (3) Construction contracts. (i) Include the following conditions and 
provisions in all construction contracts for the modernization project:
    (A) The provisions set forth in ``DHHS Requirements for Federally 
Assisted Construction Contracts Regarding Labor Standards and Equal 
Employment Opportunities,'' Form DHHS 514 (rev. 7/76) (issued by the 
Office of Grants Administration Policy, U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services) pertaining to the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contract Work 
Hours Standards Act, and the Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback) Regulations, 
except in the case of contracts in the amount of $2,000 or less; and 
pertaining to Executive Order 11246, 30 FR 12319 (September 24, 1965), 
as amended, relating to nondiscrimination in construction contract 
employment, except in the case of contracts in the amount of $10,000 or 
less;
    (B) That the contractor shall furnish performance and payment bonds 
each of which shall be in the full amount of the contract price, and 
shall maintain, during the life of the contract, adequate fire, 
workmen's compensation, public liability, and property damage insurance: 
Provided, however, That in the case of a State or local unit of 
government which enters into a construction contract of less than 
$100,000, State or local provisions with respect to performance and 
payment bonds shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this 
paragraph; and
    (C) That the Secretary shall have access at all reasonable times to 
work wherever it is in preparation or progress, and the contractor shall 
provide proper facilities for such access and inspection.
    (ii) Executive Order 11246. Comply with the applicable requirements 
of Executive Order 11246, 30 FR 12319 (September 24, 1965) as amended, 
relating to nondiscrimination in construction contract employment, and 
the applicable rules, regulations, and procedures prescribed pursuant 
thereto.
    (4) Modernization supervision. Provide and maintain competent and 
adequate architectural or engineering supervision and inspection at the 
modernization site to insure that the completed work conforms with the 
plans and specifications.
    (5) Completion responsibility. Complete the modernization in 
accordance with the grant application and the approved plans and 
specifications.
    (6) Progress reports. Furnish progress reports and such other 
information concerning the modernization as the Secretary may require.
    (d) The Secretary may at any time approve exceptions to the 
provisions of this section where he finds that such exceptions are not 
inconsistent with section 330 of the Act, other requirements of law, or 
the purposes of the program.

on a loan or mortgage on an existing building acquired under this part, 
including a building purchased by a grantee prior to the promulgation of 
this part, but only if the building is being used for the purposes of 
section 330 and complies with the applicable provisions of this subpart 
and only to the extent the

[[Page 201]]

Secretary finds such principal amounts and interest rates to be 
reasonable.

[41 FR 5700, Dec. 30, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 51c.507  Facility which has previously received Federal grant.

    No grant for the acquisition of a facility which has previously

<R05>
Sec. 52.5  Evaluation and disposition of applications.

    (a) Evaluation. All applications filed in accordance with Sec. 52.4 
shall be evaluated by the Secretary through such officers and employees 
and such experts or consultants engaged for this purpose as the 
Secretary determines are specially qualified in the areas of research 
involved in the project, including review by an appropriate National 
Advisory Council or other body as may be required by law. The 
Secretary's evaluation shall take into account among other pertinent 
factors the scientific merit and significance of the project, the 
competency of the proposed staff in relation to the type of research 
involved, the feasibility of the project, the likelihood of its 
producing meaningful results, the proposed project period, and the 
adequacy of the applicant's resources available for the project and the 
amount of grant funds necessary for completion, and in the case of 
applications for support of research in emergency medical services, 
special consideration shall be given to applications for grants for 
research relating to the delivery of emergency medical services in rural 
areas.
    (b) Disposition. On the basis of the Secretary's evaluation of an 
application in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and subject 
to approvals, recommendations or consultations by the appropriate 
National Advisory Council or other body as may be required by law, the 
Secretary will (1) approve, (2) defer because of either lack of funds or 
a need for further evaluation, or (3) disapprove support of the proposed 
project in whole or in part. With respect to approved projects, the 
Secretary will determine the project period (subject to extension as 
provided in Sec. 52.7(c)) during which the project may be supported. Any 
deferral and disapproval of an application will not preclude its 
reconsideration or a reapplication.

[45 FR 12240, Feb. 25, 1980; 45 FR 20096, Mar. 27, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 52.6  Grant awards.

    (a) General. Within the limits of funds available for such purpose, 
the Secretary shall award a grant to those applicants whose approved 
projects will in the Secretary's judgment best promote the purposes of 
Sec. 52.1. The date specified by the Secretary as the beginning of the 
project period shall be no later than 9 months following the date of any 
initial or new award statement unless the Secretary finds that because 
of the nature of a project or the grantee's particular circumstances 
earlier assurance of grant support is required to initiate the project. 
Any funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the 
purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the 
approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms 
and conditions of the award and the applicable cost principles 
prescribed in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74.
    (b) Notice of grant award. (1) The notice of grant award specifies 
how long HHS intends to support the project without requiring the 
project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, 
will usually be for 1-5 years.
    (2) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of 
the government.
    (3) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other

[[Page 204]]

award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved 
application.
    (c) Multiple, concurrent, initial awards. Whenever a reseach project 
involves a number of different but related problems, activities or 
disciplines which require evaluation by different groups, or whenever 
support for a project could be more effectively administered by separate 
handling of separate aspects of the project, the Secretary may evaluate 
and approve two or more concurrent applications each dealing with one or 
more specified aspects of the project, and the Secretary may make two or 
more concurrent grant awards with respect to such a project.
    (d) Unobligated balances. The Secretary may permit unobligated grant 
funds remaining in the grant account at the close of a budget period to 
be carried forward for obligation during a subsequent budget period, 
provided a continuation award is made for that period and the 
Secretary's written approval is obtained.
    (e) Award for continuation of project under new grantee. The 
Secretary, upon application in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 52.4 and without further action by a Council or other body, may 
make a grant to any institution or other person eligible under Sec. 52.3 
for continuation of a currently supported project for which a grant was 
previously made to another institution or person, provided the Secretary 
finds that the change in the conduct of the project is consonant with 
the previous evaluation and approval of the project under Sec. 52.5.

<R05>
Sec. 52.7  Use of funds; changes.

    (a) Delegation of fiscal responsibility. The grantee may not in 
whole or in part delegate or transfer to another person responsibility 
for the use or expenditure of grant funds.
    (b) Changes in project. The permissible changes by the principal 
investigator in the approved project shall be limited to changes in 
methodology, approach or other aspects of the project to expedite 
achievement of the project's research objectives, including changes that 
grow out of the approved project and serve the best scientific strategy. 
If the grantee and the principal investigator are uncertain whether a 
change complies with this provision, the question must be referred to 
the Secretary for a final determination.
    (c) Changes in project period. The project period determined 
pursuant to Sec. 52.5(b) may be extended by the Secretary, with or 
without additional grant support, for such an additional period as the 
Secretary determines may be required to complete, or fulfill the 
purposes of, the approved project.

with similar efforts by other organizations;
    (6) The administrative and managerial capability of the applicant;
    (7) The reasonableness of the proposed budget in relation to the 
proposed program; and
    (8) Other factors which the awarding institute, center, or division 
considers appropriate in light of its particular statutory mission.
    (b) Where required by statute or NIH policy, applications are 
reviewed by appropriate national advisory councils or boards before 
awards are made. NIH grants may be awarded generally only after approval 
recommendations from both appropriate scientific peer review groups and 
national advisory councils or boards.


<R05>
Sec. 52a.6  Information about grant awards.

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long NIH intends to 
support the project without requiring the project to recompete for 
funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 
years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by the NIH that continued funding is in the best interest 
of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application, nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.

Sec. 52b.9  Acquisition of facilities.

    In addition to the other requirements of this part, the following 
provisions are applicable to the acquisition of existing facilities.
    (a) Minimum standards of construction and equipment. A determination 
by the Director that the facility conforms (or upon completion of any 
necessary construction will conform) to the minimum standards of 
construction and equipment as set forth in Sec. 52b.11 of this part, 
shall be obtained before entering into a final or unconditional contract 
for such acquisition. Where the Director finds that exceptions to or 
modification of any such minimum standards of construction and equipment 
would be consistent with the purposes of section 406(b) or section 
404(b)(9) of the Act, the Director may authorize such exceptions or 
modifications;
    (b) Estimated cost of acquisition and remodeling: Suitability of 
facility. Each application for a project involving the acquisition of

for which they are acquired. Such application shall demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Director that the architectural, structural and 
other pertinent features of the facility, as modified by any proposed 
expansion, remodeling, renovation, or alteration, will be clearly 
suitable for the purposes of section 406(b) or section 404(b)(9) of the 
Act, and, to the extent of the costs in which Federal participation is 
requested, are not in excess of what is necessary for the services 
proposed to be provided in such facilities;
    (c) Bona fide sale. Federal participation in the acquisition of 
existing facilities is on condition that such acquisition constitutes a 
bona fide sale involving an actual cost to the applicant and will result 
in additional or improved facilities for purposes of section 406(b) or 
section 404(b)(9) of the Act; and
    (d) Facility which has previously received Federal grant. No grant 
for the acquisition of a facility which has previously received a 
Federal grant for construction, acquisition, or equipment shall serve 
either to reduce or restrict the liability of the applicant or any other 
transferor or transferee from any obligation of accountability imposed 
by the Federal Government by reason of such prior grant.

    (4) The administrative and managerial capability and competence of 
the applicant;
    (5) The availability of the facilities and resources (including 
where necessary collaborative arrangements with other institutions) to 
engage in biomedical research;
    (6) The applicant's relative need for funding; and
    (7) The overall significance of the proposal in terms of numbers of 
ethnic minority persons benefited thereby.
    (b) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to 
support the project without requiring the project to recompete for 
funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 
years.
    (c) Generally the grant will initially be for one year and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of 
the government.
    (d) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.

<R05>
Sec. 52e.6  How will NIH evaluate applications?

    (a) Within the limits of funds available, after consultation with 
the Council, the Director may award grants to applicants with proposed 
projects which in the Director's judgment will best promote the purposes 
of section 419 of the Act, taking into consideration among other 
pertinent factors:
    (1) The scientific and technical merit of the proposed project;

[[Page 220]]

    (2) The significance of the project in relation to the goals of the 
National Program;
    (3) Whether the project appropriately emphasizes the prevention, 
diagnosis, or treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, or blood diseases 
of children;
    (4) The qualifications and experience of the project director and 
other key personnel;
    (5) The administrative and managerial capability and fiscal 
responsibility of the applicant;
    (6) The reasonableness of the proposed budget in relation to the 
proposed project;
    (7) The adequacy of the methods proposed for monitoring and 
evaluating the proposed project; and
    (8) The degree to which the application adequately provides for the 
requirements set forth in Secs. 52e.5(a) and 52e.5(b).
    (b) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to 
support the project without requiring the project to recompete for 
funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 
years.
    (c) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of 
the government.
    (d) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.
    (e) Any funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for 
the purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the 
approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the 
terms, and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles 
prescribed in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74.

Sec. 52e.7  What are the terms and conditions of awards?

    (a) Any funds granted pursuant to this part shall be expended solely 
for the purposes for which the funds were granted in accordance with the 
approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms 
and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles 
prescribed by subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74.
    (b) The Director may permit unobligated grant funds remaining in the 
grant account at the close of a budget period to be carried forward for 
obligation during a subsequent budget period, provided a continuation 
award is made for that period and the NHLBI Director's written approval 
is obtained. The amount of any subsequent award will take into 
consideration unobligated grant funds remaining in the grant account.

Sec. 52h.7  Grants; matters to be reviewed.

    (a) No awarding official will make a grant based upon an application 
covered by this part unless the application has been reviewed by a peer 
review group in accordance with the provisions of this part and said 
group has made recommendations concerning the scientific merit of such 
application. In addition, where under applicable law an awarding 
official is required to secure the approval or advice of a national 
advisory council or board concerning an application, said application 
will not be considered by the council or board unless it has been 
reviewed by a peer review group in accordance with the provisions of 
this part and said group has made recommendations concerning the 
scientific merit of the application except where the council or board is 
the peer review group.
    (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided for by law, such 
recommendations are advisory only and not binding on the awarding 
official or national advisory council or board.


<R05>
Sec. 52h.8  Grants; review criteria.

<R05>
Sec. 52h.9  Unsolicited contract proposals; matters to be reviewed.

    (a) No awarding official will award a contract based upon an 
unsolicited contract proposal covered by this part unless the proposal 
has been reviewed by a peer review group in accordance with the 
provisions of this part (pursuant to procedures set forth in 41 CFR 
subpart 3-4.52) and said group has made recommendations concerning the 
scientific merit of such proposal.
    (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided for by law, such 
recommendations are advisory only and not binding on the awarding 
official.


<R05>
Sec. 52h.10  Contract projects involving solicited contract proposals; matters to be reviewed.

    (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, no awarding official 
will issue a request for contract proposals with respect to a contract 
project involving solicited contract proposals unless the project 
concept has been reviewed by a peer review group in accordance with the 
provisions of this part and said group has made recommendations 
concerning the scientific merit of said concept. Where in the judgment 
of the awarding official the project approach has been sufficiently well 
defined by the time the review required by the preceding sentence is 
conducted, this review and the resulting recommendations shall include 
the project approach as well.
    (b) The awarding official may waive the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section for peer review before issuing a request for 
contract proposals if he determines that the accomplishments of 
essential program objectives would otherwise be placed in jeopardy and 
any further delay would clearly not be in the best interest of the 
Government. The awarding official shall specify in writing the grounds 
on which this determination is based. Under such circumstances, the 
awarding official will not award a contract based on the request for 
contract proposals unless the proposals received in response to the 
request have been reviewed by a peer review group and that group has 
made recommendations concerning the scientific merit of the project 
concept and of the approaches outlined in the proposals. The request for 
proposals will indicate that the project concept has not been reviewed 
by a peer review group and that no award will be made until such review 
is conducted and recommendations made based on such review.
    (c) The Director of the National Institutes of Health, the 
Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Service 
Administration, or their designees may identify individual contracts or 
classes of contracts which may not be awarded unless all pertinent 
contract proposals have been reviewed by a peer review group in 
accordance with the provisions of this part and that group has made 
recommendations concerning the scientific merit of the proposals.
    (d) Except to the extent otherwise provided for by law, such 
recommendations are advisory only and not binding on the awarding 
official.

<R05>
Sec. 53.111   Services for persons unable to pay.

    (a) Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to every 
applicant which heretofore has given or hereafter will give an assurance 
that it will make available a reasonable volume of services to persons 
unable to pay therefor but shall not apply to an applicant (1) for more 
than 20 years after the completion of construction of any facility with 
respect to which funds have been paid under section 606 of the Act or 
(2) beyond the period during which any amount of a direct loan made 
under sections 610 or 623 of the Act, or any amount of a loan with 
respect to which a loan guarantee and interest subsidy has been provided 
under sections 623 and 624 of the Act remains unpaid.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section:
    (1) The term facility includes hospitals, facilities for long-term 
care, outpatient facilities, rehabilitation facilities, and public 
health centers;
    (2) The term applicant means an applicant for, or recipient of, a 
grant, a loan guarantee or a loan under the Act;
    (3) Fiscal year means the fiscal year of the applicant;
    (4) The term operating costs means the actual operating costs of the 
applicant for a fiscal year as determined in accordance with cost 
determination principles and requirements under title XVIII of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395): Provided, That such ``operating 
costs'' shall be determined for the applicant's entire facility and for 
all patients regardless of the source of payment for such care: And 
provided further, That in determining such operating costs there shall 
be deducted the amount of all actual or estimated reimbursements, as 
applicable, for services received or to be received pursuant to title 
XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 and 1936);
    (5) The term reasonable cost means the cost of providing services to 
a specific patient determined in accordance

[[Page 227]]

with the cost determination principles and requirements under title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395) and subpart D of the 
regulations thereunder (20 CFR part 405,<SUP>1 part 401 et seq.);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <SUP>1 Redesignated as 42 CFR part 405 at 42 FR 52826, Sept. 30, 
1977.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) The term uncompensated services means services which are made 
available to persons unable to pay therefor without charge or at a 
charge which is less than the reasonable cost of such services. The 
level of such services is measured by the difference between the amount 
charged such persons for such services and the reasonable cost thereof;
    (7) Reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor 
means a level of uncompensated services which meets a need for such 
services in the area served by an applicant and which is within the 
financial ability of such applicant to provide.
    (c) Assurance. (1) Before an application under this part is 
recommended by a State agency to the Secretary for approval, the State 
agency shall obtain an assurance from the applicant that there will be 
made available in the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or 
modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay 
therefor. The requirement of an assurance from an applicant shall be 
waived if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State 
agency, subject to subsequent approval by the Secretary, that such a 
requirement is not feasible from a financial viewpoint.
    (2) Prior to recommending that such requirement be waived, the State 
agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 
served by the applicant a notice of the request for such waiver and 
invite public comment thereon, allowing not less than 30 days therefor. 
All comments received shall be available for public inspection, and 
shall be considered by the State agency in arriving at its 
recommendation. Notice of the determination on the request for waiver 
shall be given to all interested persons and to the public before the 
approval of the Secretary is sought.
    (d) Presumptive compliance guideline. An applicant which, for a 
fiscal year, (1) budgets for the support of, and makes available on 
request, uncompensated services at a level not less than the lesser of 3 
percent of operating costs or 10 percent of all Federal assistance 
provided to or on behalf of the applicant under the Act, or (2) 
certifies that it will not exclude any person from admission on the 
ground that such person is unable to pay for needed services and that it 
will make available to each person so admitted services provided by the 
facility without charge or at a charge below reasonable cost which does 
not exceed any such person's ability to pay therefor as determined in 
accordance with criteria established pursuant to paragraph (g), shall be 
deemed in presumptive compliance with its assurance. In the case of a 
loan guarantee with interest subsidy or a direct loan guarantee be sold 
by the Secretary with an interest subsidy, the amount of Federal 
assistance shall include the total amount of the interest subsidy which 
the Secretary is, or will be, obligated to pay over the full life of the 
loan, as well as any other payments which the Secretary makes on behalf 
of the applicant in connection with the loan guarantee or the direct 
loan which has been sold.
    (e) Compliance reports. (1) Each applicant shall, not later than 120 
days after the end of a fiscal year, unless a longer period is approved 
by the State agency for good cause shown, file with the State agency a 
copy of its annual statement for such year as required by section 646 of 
the Act and Sec. 53.128(q), which shall set forth its operating costs.
    (2) With respect to each fiscal year for which a level of 
uncompensated services has been established in accordance with this 
section, the annual statement shall also set forth the amount of 
uncompensated services provided in such year.
    (i) The provision of a level of uncompensated services in such year 
which equals or exceeds the level established pursuant to paragraph (h) 
of this section for such year shall constitute compliance with the 
assurance.

[[Page 228]]

    (ii) If the level of services provided was less than the level of 
uncompensated services established pursuant to paragraph (h) of this 
section, the applicant shall submit with such statement: A justification 
therefor, showing that the provision of such lower level of 
uncompensated services was reasonable under the circumstances; and a 
description of the steps it proposes to take to assure the availability 
and utilization of the level of uncompensated services to be established 
for the current fiscal year, which shall include an affirmative action 
plan, utilizing press releases or other appropriate means as the 
facility may desire to bring to the attention of the public the 
availability of such uncompensated services and the conditions of 
eligibility therefor.
    (3) Each applicant shall file with its annual statement a copy of 
that portion of its adopted budget for the current fiscal year relating 
to the support of uncompensated services in such year. Such budget for 
uncompensated services shall be based on the operating costs of the 
applicant for the preceding fiscal year and shall give due cognizance to 
probable increases in operating costs. Except in the case of a 
certification pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if the 
budget statement does not conform to the presumptive compliance 
guideline, the applicant shall submit with its statement.
    (i) A justification therefor, showing that such lower level of 
uncompensated services is reasonable under the circumstances, and
    (ii) A plan to increase such uncompensated services to meet the 
presumptive compliance guideline or such other level of uncompensated 
services as may have been established or as it requests the State agency 
to establish in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (4) The applicant shall also submit such additional reports related 
to compliance with its assurance as the State agency may reasonably 
require.
    (5) Pending the establishment of a level of uncompensated services 
for any fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the 
applicant shall, in such fiscal year, provide a level of services which 
is the higher of
    (i) The level established for the preceding fiscal year (or if no 
such level has been established for such prior year, the level of 
services provided in such year) or
    (ii) The level proposed in its adopted budget for the current fiscal 
year.
    (f) Qualifying services. (1) In determining the amount of 
uncompensated services provided by an applicant, there shall be included 
only those services provided to an individual with respect to whom the 
applicant has made a written determination prior to the provision of 
such services that such individual is unable to pay therefor under the 
criteria established pursuant to 42 CFR 53.111(g), except that:
    (i) Such determination may be made after the provision of such 
services in the case of services provided on an emergency basis: 
Provided, That when billing is made for such service, such billing must 
be accompanied by substantially the information required in the posted 
notice under paragraph (i) of this section; and
    (ii) Such determination may be made after the provision of such 
services in the case of a change in circumstances as a result of the 
illness or injury occasioning such services (e.g., the patient's 
financial condition has changed due to a loss of wages resulting from 
the illness) or in case of insurance coverage or other resources being 
less than anticipated or the costs of services being greater than 
anticipated. Further, in all cases where such determination was not made 
prior to the provision of services, such services may not be included as 
uncompensated services if any collection effort has been made other than 
the rendering of bills permissible in the above exceptions: Provided, 
That such a determination may be made at any time if the determination 
was hindered or delayed by reason of erroneous or incomplete information 
furnished by or in behalf of the patient.
    (2) There shall be excluded from the computation of uncompensated 
services:
    (i) Any amount which the applicant has received, or is entitled to 
receive, from a third party insurer or under a governmental program; and

[[Page 229]]

    (ii) The reasonable cost of any services for which payment in whole 
or in part would be available under a governmental program (e.g., 
Medicare and Medicaid) in which the applicant, although eligible to do 
so, does not participate, but only to the extent of such otherwise 
available payment.
    (g) Persons unable to pay for services. (1) The State agency shall 
set forth in its State plan, subject to approval by the Secretary, 
criteria for identifying persons unable to pay for services, which shall 
include persons who are otherwise self-supporting but unable to pay the 
full charge for needed services. Such criteria shall be based on the 
following or similar factors:
    (i) The health and medical care insurance coverage, personal or 
family income, the size of the patient's family, and other financial 
obligations and resources of the patient or the family in relation to 
the reasonable cost of the services;
    (ii) Generally recognized standards of need such as:
    (a) The State standard for the medically needy as determined for the 
purposes of the Aid for Families with Dependent Children program;
    (b) The current Social Security Administration poverty income level;
    (c) The current Office of Economic Opportunity Income Poverty 
Guidelines applicable in the area; or
    (iii) Any other equivalent measures which are found by the Secretary 
to provide a reasonable basis for determining an individual's ability to 
pay for medical and hospital services.
    (2) A copy of such criteria shall be provided by the applicant, upon 
request, to any patient or former patient of the applicant and to any 
person seeking services from the applicant.
    (3) The State agency shall provide a copy of such criteria to any 
person requesting it.
    (h) Level of uncompensated services. (1) The State agency shall set 
forth in its State plan procedures for the determination for each 
applicant of the level of uncompensated services which constitutes a 
reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor provided 
that in no event shall the level of uncompensated services established 
under this section exceed the presumptive compliance guideline.
    (2) The State agency shall for the purpose of making such 
determination, review, and evaluate the annual statement, the budget and 
the related documents submitted by each applicant pursuant to paragraph 
(e) of this section, by applying the following criteria:
    (i) The financial status of the applicant, taking account of income 
from all sources, and its financial ability to provide uncompensated 
services;
    (ii) The nature and quantity of services provided by the applicant;
    (iii) The need within the area served by the applicant for the 
provision, without charge or at charge which is less than reasonable 
cost, for services of the nature provided or to be provided by the 
applicant; and
    (iv) The extent and nature of joint or cooperative programs with 
other facilities for the provision of uncompensated services, and the 
extent and nature of outreach services directed to the needs of 
underserved areas.
    (3) In accordance with its findings made after such review and 
evaluation, the State agency shall, within 60 days after receipt of the 
annual statement and related documents required by paragraph (e) of this 
section, for each fiscal year of an applicant which begins following the 
expiration of 90 days after the effective date of this regulation:
    (i) Establish a level of uncompensated services for each applicant 
which may be equal to or less than the presumptive compliance guideline: 
Provided, That if the State agency determines, in accordance with 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section, that (a) there is a need in the area 
served by an applicant for a level of uncompensated services greater 
than the level proposed in the applicant's budget statement, and (b) the 
applicant is financially able to provide such greater level of 
uncompensated services, the State agency shall establish such greater 
level as the level applicable to the applicant; and
    (ii) Accept or modify a plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (e) of 
this section.

[[Page 230]]

    (4) The State agency shall notify the applicant in writing of the 
level of uncompensated services which it has established for the 
applicant for the fiscal year. At the time of notifying the applicant, 
the State agency shall also publish as a public notice in a newspaper of 
general circulation within the community served by the applicant the 
rate that has been established and a statement that the documents upon 
which the agency based its determination are available for public 
inspection at a location and time prescribed. In the case of the 
establishment by the State agency of a rate which is less than the 
presumptive compliance guideline, such notice shall also include a 
statement that persons wishing to object to the rate established may do 
so by writing to the State agency within 20 days after publication of 
the notice: Provided, That the applicant may object to any level 
established which is greater than the level proposed in the applicant's 
budget statement.
    (5) In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (h)(4) of this 
section, the applicant or any person or persons residing or located 
within the area served by the applicant, or any organization on behalf 
of such person or persons, may submit to the State agency within 20 days 
of the publication and sending of the notice objections to the rate 
established by the State agency for the applicant. Such objections may 
be supported in writing by factual information and argument. The State 
agency shall give public notice of receipt of the objections and shall 
make the objections and their supporting documents available for public 
inspection and comment. It may, if it believes that determination of the 
objections will be assisted by oral evidence or by oral argument, set a 
public hearing on the objections and shall give notice of such hearing 
to all interested parties and to the public. The State agency shall 
within 60 days of the expiration of the period within which objections 
may be filed, rule upon the objections in writing, stating its reason 
for sustaining or overruling them, in whole or in part, and establishing 
finally the rate of uncompensated services either the same as, above, or 
below the rate previously established, as may best accord with all of 
the evidence on file with or heard by the State agency. Notice of the 
final determination shall be mailed to all parties who filed objections 
or who participated in the proceedings leading to the redetermination.
    (6) Within 20 days of receipt of written notice of the final 
determination of a State agency after ruling on objections to the rate 
established by the State agency, the applicant or any other interested 
person or organization may submit to the Secretary a written request for 
review of the State agency determination. Such review shall be made upon 
the record of the State agency determination which shall be sustained if 
supported by substantial evidence and is not otherwise arbitrary or 
capricious. If the Secretary or his designee determines that the rate 
established by the State agency is unsupported by the evidence in the 
record or is otherwise arbitrary or capricious, the Secretary or his 
designee shall, upon the basis of the record or upon other evidence or 
information which is before him or which he may obtain, establish a 
level of uncompensated services which he determines, in accordance with 
the criteria set out in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, is 
appropriate.
    (7) The level of uncompensated services established for an applicant 
under this section for any fiscal year shall constitute a reasonable 
volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor with respect to 
such applicant for such fiscal year.
    (i) Posted notice. The applicant shall post notice (which shall be 
multilingual where the applicant serves a multilingual community), in 
substantially the following form, in appropriate areas within the 
facility (admissions, office, emergency department and business office) 
for the purpose of informing patients or potential patients that 
criteria for eligibility and applications are available upon request:

                    Notice of Hill-Burton Obligation

    This hospital (or other facility) is required by law to give a a 
reasonable amount of service at no cost or less than full cost to people 
who cannot pay. If you think that you are eligible for these services, 
please contact our

[[Page 231]]

business office (give office location) and ask for assistance. If you 
are not satisfied with the results, you may contact (the State Hill-
Burton agency with address).
    Provided, That an applicant which has selected a presumptive 
compliance guideline under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may, at its 
option, either (1) add to such notice language stating that the 
facility's obligation is limited to a specified dollar volume of 
uncompensated services and that if the facility has, during a specified 
period (e.g., year, quarter, month), already provided a volume of 
uncompensated services sufficient to satisfy such obligation, any person 
inquiring about such services will be given a written statement to that 
effect which shall also state when additional uncompensated services 
will be available; or (2) post an additional notice stating that the 
facility's obligation has been satisfied for the current period and 
stating when additional uncompensated services will be available.

    (j) Evaluation and enforcement. The State plan shall provide for 
evaluation and enforcement of the assurance in accordance with the 
following requirements:
    (1) The State agency shall,
    (i) At least annually, perform evaluations of the amount of the 
various services provided in each facility with respect to which Federal 
assistance has been provided under the Act, to determine whether such 
assurance is being complied with; and
    (ii) Establish procedures for the investigation of complaints that 
such assurance is not being complied with.
    (2) Evaluation pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) of this section shall be 
based on the annual budget of each facility for uncompensated services 
and on financial statements of such facilities filed pursuant to section 
646 of the Act and Sec. 53.128(q), and on such other information, 
including reports of investigations and hearing decisions, as the State 
agency deems relevant and material.
    (3) The State plan shall provide for adequate methods of enforcement 
of the assurance, including effective sanctions to be applied against 
any facility which fails to comply with such assurance. Such sanctions 
may include, but need not be limited to, license revocation, termination 
of State assistance, and court action.
    (k) Reports. (1) The State agency shall, not less often than 
annually, report in writing to the Secretary its evaluation of each 
facility's compliance with the assurance, the disposition of each 
complaint received by the State agency, proposed remedial action with 
respect to each facility found by the State agency to be not in 
compliance with the assurance, and the status of such remedial action.
    (2) In addition, the State agency shall promptly report to the 
Regional Attorney and Regional Health Director of the Department of 
Health and Human Services the institution of any legal action against a 
facility or the State agency involving compliance with the assurance.

<R05>
Sec. 53.112   Nondiscrimination.

    (a) Before an application is recommended by a State agency to the 
Secretary for approval, the State agency shall obtain an assurance from 
the applicant that all portions and services of the entire facility for 
the construction or modernization of which, or in connection with which, 
aid under the Act is sought will be made available without 
discrimination on account of creed and no professionally qualified 
person will be discriminated against on account of creed with respect to 
the privilege of professional practice in the facility.
    (b) Each construction contract is subject to the condition that the 
applicant shall comply with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, 
September 24, 1965 (30 FR 12319), relating to nondiscrimination in 
construction contract employment, and the applicable rules, regulations, 
and procedures prescribed pursuant thereto.
    (c) Attention is called to the requirement of title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d; 78 Stat. 252) which provides that 
no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or 
national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the 
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity receiving Federal financial assistance. A regulation 
implementing such title VI, applicable to assistance under this part for 
construction and

[[Page 232]]

modernization of hospitals and medical facilities, has been issued by 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the approval of the 
President (45 CFR part 80).

<R04>
               Subpart N--Loan Guarantees and Direct Loans


<R05>
Sec. 53.154   Waiver of right of recovery.

    In determining whether there is good cause for waiver of any right 
of recovery which he may have against a nonprofit private agency by 
reason of any payments made pursuant to a loan guarantee, or against a 
public agency by reason of the failure of such agency to make payments 
of principal and interest on a direct loan to such agency, the Secretary 
shall take into consideration the extent to which:
    (a) The facility with respect to which the loan guarantee or direct 
loan was made will continue to be devoted by the applicant or other 
owner to use for the purpose for which it was constructed or another 
public or nonprofit purpose which will promote the purposes of the Act;
    (b) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of the 
repayment period of the loan other public or non-profit facilities not 
previously utilized for the purpose for which the facility was 
constructed will be so utilized and are substantially equivalent in 
nature and extent for such purposes; and
    (c) Such recovery would seriously curtail the provision of medical 
services to persons in need of such services in the area.

[37 FR 182, Jan. 6, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 53.155  Modification of loans.

    No official of the Department of Health and Human Services will 
approve any proposal to modify the terms of a loan guaranteed under 
title VI of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 291 et seq.) and 
this subpart which would permit the use of the guaranteed loan (or the 
guarantee) as collateral for an issue of tax-exempt securities.

[48 FR 42984, Sept. 21, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 53.156   Fees for modification requests.

    (a) Fees will be charged for the processing of requests for parity, 
and for major and minor modifications of the terms of documents 
evidencing and securing direct and guaranteed loans. In accordance with 
the requirements of the User Charge Statute, 31 U.S.C. 9701(b), the 
Secretary determines the amount of the application fee that must be 
submitted with each type of modification.
    (1) As used in this section, a request for parity allows new debt to 
share lien position (i.e. collateral) with an existing Hill-Burton loan.
    (2) As used in this section, a major modification is any 
modification involving the release of $100,000 or more of collateral; a 
corporate restructuring that involves a transfer of assets; master 
indenture requests; modifications to a sinking fund; defeasance requests 
and requests for additional secured indebtedness; and any, other 
modification that involves a comparably significant use of Department 
resources.
    (3) As used in this section, a minor modification is any 
modification involving the release of less than $100,000 of collateral; 
an easement; and any other modification that involves a comparable use 
of Department resources.
    (b) A request for modification is to be accompanied by a certified 
check or money order in the amount of the appropriate fee, payable to 
the U.S. Treasury. The fees for modification requests submitted on or 
after October 28, 1986 are as follows:
    (1) $1,500 for a minor modification,
    (2) $4,500 for a major modification, and
    (3) $5,500 for a request for parity.
    (c) A submitter may withdraw its request for modification within 10 
business days following its receipt and receive a refund of the fee.
    (d) If the Secretary determines that a change in the amount of a fee 
is appropriate, the Department will issue a notice of proposed 
rulemaking in the

[[Page 234]]

Federal Register to announce the proposed amount.

the conduct of all activities of the Center. The Committee shall be 
composed of persons who are not associated with the Center (apart from 
their membership on the Committee).


<R05>
Sec. 54a.506  Grant awards.

    (a) Within the limits of funds available, the Secretary, after 
taking into account the comments of an appropriate peer review group, 
may award grants to applicants with proposed programs which have been 
recommended for approval by the council and will in his judgment best 
promote the purposes of section 504 of the Act, taking into 
consideration among other pertinent factors:
    (1) The scientific and technical merit of the proposed program and 
its individual components;
    (2) The qualifications and experience of the Center director and 
other key personnel;
    (3) The extent to which the various components of the proposed 
research program would be coordinated into an interdisciplinary effort 
within the Center;
    (4) The administrative and managerial capability of the applicant;

[[Page 236]]

    (5) The reasonableness of the proposed budget in relation to the 
proposed program;
    (6) The adequacy of proposed methods for monitoring and evaluating 
the overall Center program and its components including proposed 
mechanisms for review of the Center's program by its Program Advisory 
Committee;
    (7) The potential of the proposed Center to become a significant 
regional and national research resource; and
    (8) The degree to which the application adequately provides for the 
requirements of Sec. 54a.505.
    (b) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to 
support the project without requiring the project to recompete for 
funds. This period, called the project period, will not exceed 5 years.
    (c) Generally the grant will initially be for one year and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of those awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In any case, a grant award shall not exceed $1 
million in any fiscal year. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by HHS that continued funding is in the best interest of 
the government.
    (d) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.
    (e) An initial 5-year project period may be extended by the 
Secretary for additional periods not in excess of 5 years each, after 
review of the operations of the grantee by an appropriate peer review 
group and with the Council's recommendation for approval, except that if 
an additional period of support involves only the expenditure of funds 
previously awarded, peer review and consultation with the Council are 
not required.

[44 FR 17921, Mar. 23, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31095, May 12, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 54a.507  Expenditure of grant funds.

    (a) Any funds granted under this subpart shall be expended solely 
for the purpose for which the funds were granted in accordance with the 
approved application and budget, the regulations on this part, the terms 
and conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles 
prescribed by subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, except that those funds may 
not be expended for trainee stipends, fees, or other expenses directly 
relating to training or for the purchase or rental of any land or the 
rental, purchase, construction, preservation, or repair of any building. 
For purposes of this paragraph, construction means the construction of 
new buildings, and the expansion, remodeling, and alteration of existing 
buildings, including architects' fees, but not including the cost of 
acquisition of land or off-site improvements, and equipping new 
buildings and existing buildings, whether or not expanded, remodeled, or 
altered.<SUP>1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 Section 504(b) of the Act provides that for the purposes of that 
paragraph the term ``construction'' shall have the meaning given to it 
by section 702(2) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 292a). The 
above definition incorporates the language of section 702(2) in effect 
on July 26, 1976, the date of the enactment of section 504 by Pub. L. 
94-371.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward to the next budget period, for use as prescribed by the 
Secretary, provided a continuation award is made. If at any time during 
a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary that the amount of 
Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee for that period, 
including any unobligated balance carried forward from prior periods, 
exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary may adjust the 
amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess.

<R05>
Sec. 56.105   Accord with health planning.

    A grant may be made under this part only if the applicable 
requirements of title XV of the Act relating to review and approval by 
the appropriate health planning agencies have been met.


<R05>
Sec. 56.106   Amount of grant.

    (a) The amount of any award under this part will be determined by 
the Secretary on the basis of his estimate of the sum necessary for a 
designated portion of direct project costs plus an additional amount for 
indirect costs, if any, which will be calculated by the Secretary 
either:
    (1) On the basis of the estimate of the actual indirect costs 
reasonably related to the project; or
    (2) On the basis of a percentage of all, or a portion of, the 
estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable 
assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the 
approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an estimated 
provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs 
(such as fringe benefit rates) subject to upward (within the limits of 
available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when 
the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has 
been determined by the Secretary: Provided, however, That no grant shall 
be made for an amount in excess of the total costs found necessary by 
the Secretary to carry out the project.
    (i) In determining the percentage of project costs to be borne by 
the grantee, factors which the Secretary will take into consideration 
will include the following:

[[Page 244]]

    (A) The ability of the grantee to finance its share of project costs 
from non-Federal sources;
    (B) The need in the area served by the project for the services to 
be provided; and
    (C) The extent to which the project will provide services in an 
innovative manner which the Secretary desires to stimulate in the 
interest of developing more effective health service delivery systems on 
a regional or national basis.
    (ii) At any time after approval of an application under this part, 
the Secretary may retroactively agree to a percentage of project costs 
to be borne by the grantee lower than that determined pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section where he finds that changed 
circumstances justify a smaller contribution.
    (iii) In determining the grantee's share of project costs, costs 
borne by Federal grant funds, or costs used to match other Federal 
grants, may not be included except as otherwise provided by law or 
regulations.
    (b) All grant awards shall be in writing, and shall set forth the 
amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.
    (c) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award, shall 
commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, 
supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved 
project or portion thereof. For continuation support, grantees must make 
separate application.


<R05>

United States shall on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be 
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance. A regulation implementing such title VI, 
which applies to grants made under this part, has been issued by the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services with the approval of the 
President (45 CFR part 80). In addition, no person shall, on the grounds 
of age, sex, creed, or marital status (unless otherwise medically

<R05>
Sec. 56.111   Confidentiality.

    All information as to personal facts and circumstances obtained by 
the project staff about recipients of services shall be held 
confidential and shall not be divulged without the individual's consent 
except as may be required by law or as may be necessary to provide 
service to the individual or to provide for medical audits by the

confidentiality of patient records. Otherwise, information may be 
disclosed only in summary, statistical, or other form which does not 
identify particular individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 56.112   Publications and copyright.

    Except as may otherwise be provided under the terms and conditions 
of the award, the grantee may copyright without prior approval any 
publications, films, or similar materials developed or resulting from a

royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable license or right in the 
Government to reproduce, translate, publish, use, disseminate, and 
dispose of such materials and to authorize others to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 56.113   Grantee accountability.

    (a) Accounting for grant award payments. All payments made by the 
Secretary shall be recorded by the grantee in accounting records 
separate from the records of all other funds, including funds derived 
from other grant awards. With respect to each approved project, the 
grantee shall account for the sum total of all amounts paid as well as 
other funds and in-kind contributions by presenting or otherwise making 
available evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of expenditures for 
direct and indirect costs meeting the requirements of this part: 
Provided, however, That when the amount awarded for indirect costs was 
based on a predetermined fixed-percentage of estimated direct costs, the 
amount allowed for indirect costs shall be computed on the basis of such 
predetermined fixed-percentage rates applied to the total, or a selected 
element thereof, of the reimbursable direct costs incurred.
    (b) Accounting for interest earned on grant funds. Pursuant to 
section 203 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
4213), a State will not be held accountable for interest earned on grant 
funds, pending their disbursement for grant purposes. A State, as 
defined in section 102 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, means 
any one of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
any territory or possession of the United States, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a State, but does not include the government of the 
political subdivisions of the State. All grantees other than a State, as 
so defined, must return all interest earned on grant funds to the 
Federal Government.
    (c) Grant closeout--(1) Date of final accounting. A grantee shall 
render, with respect to each approved project, a full account, as 
provided herein, as of the date of the termination of grant support. The 
Secretary may require other special and periodic accounting.
    (2) Final settlement. There shall be payable to the Federal 
Government as final settlement with respect to each approved project, 
the sum of:
    (i) Any amount not accounted for pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (ii) Any credits for earned interest pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section;
    (iii) Any other amounts due pursuant to subparts F, M, and O of 45 
CFR part 74.

Such total sum shall constitute a debt owed by the grantee to the 
Federal Government and shall be recovered from the grantee or its 
successors or assignees by setoff or other action as provided by law.

319(c)(1)(B) of the Act and this part, in accordance with priorities 
established pursuant to section 319(b) of the Act and Sec. 56.107 of 
subpart A of this part; Provided, That in the case of applicants which 
propose to serve substantially the same catchment areas or where 
available funds are insufficient to fund all approvable applications 
within a priority category specified in Sec. 56.107,
    (1) Priority shall be given to applications submitted by community-
based organizations which are representative of the population to be 
served by the project. For purposes of this paragraph, an applicant 
shall be deemed to be such an organization if it provides a formal 
mechanism (such as membership on the organization's governing body or 
membership on an advisory body) which gives migratory and seasonal 
agricultural workers and their families significant involvement in the 
formulation of the organization's policies; and
    (2) Where all such applicants are community-based organizations 
representative of the population to be served by the project, the 
Secretary shall award the grant to the applicants which will, in his 
judgment, best promote the purposes of section 319(c)(1)(B) of the Act 
and the applicable regulations of this part, taking into account with 
respect to each application:
    (i) The degree to which the proposed project satisfactorily provides 
for the elements set forth in Sec. 56.203;
    (ii) The administrative and management capability of the applicant;
    (iii) The extent to which community resources will be utilized in 
the project; and
    (iv) The degree to which the applicant intends to integrate services 
supported by a grant under this part with health services provided under 
other federally assisted health services or reimbursement programs or 
projects.
    (b) The Secretary shall award no more than one grant under this 
subpart for the same project.

<R05>
Sec. 56.602   Application.

    To be approved by the Secretary under this subpart, an application 
for a grant must, in addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 56.104 
of subpart A of this part,
    (a) Be submitted for a project with a catchment area which
    (1) Is not served, in whole or in part, by a migrant health center, 
and
    (2) Has not more than 6,000 migratory agricultural workers and the 
members of their families residing therein for more than two months per 
year; and
    (b) Contain information sufficient to enable the Secretary to 
determine that the project for which the grant is sought will meet the

Sec. 56.603   Project elements.

    A project for operating a migrant health program supported under 
this subpart must:
    (a) Provide to migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and the 
members of their families in its catchment area one or more of the 
following groups of services so that such services are available and 
accessible promptly as appropriate, and in a manner which will assure 
continuity of care, as approved by the Secretary and

[[Page 256]]

set forth (including specific services to be provided) in the grant 
award:
    (1) Emergency health care, including diagnostic and treatment 
services in an ambulatory health care setting or hospital and dental 
services for the alleviation of acute pain and suffering for medical 
emergencies, when provision of such services is necessary to avoid 
jeopardizing the patient's condition until appropriate services from 
other providers can reasonably be obtained;
    (2) Primary care;
    (3) Arrangements with existing health care facilities to furnish 
primary health services (other than primary care);
    (4) Other services set forth in Sec. 56.102(g)(1) which are needed 
to improve the health of such individuals.
    (b) Implement a system for maintaining the confidentiality of 
patient records in accordance with the requirement of Sec. 56.111 of 
subpart A of this part.
    (c) Develop management and control systems which are in accordance 
with sound financial management procedures, including the provision for 
an audit conducted in accordance with the DHHS Audit Agency Guide for 
Audits of Migrant Health Grants, as amended, on at least an annual basis 
(unless waived for cause by the Secretary), by an independent certified 
public accountant or public accountant licensed before December 31, 
1970, to determine, at a minimum, the fiscal integrity of grant 
financial transactions and reports and compliance with the regulations 
of this part and the terms and conditions of the grant.
    (d) When the cost of care and services furnished by or through the 
project is to be reimbursed under title XIX or title XX of the Social 
Security Act, obtain or make every reasonable effort to obtain a written 
agreement with the title XIX or title XX State agency for such 
reimbursement.
    (e) Have prepared a schedule of fees or payments for the provision 
of its services designed to cover its reasonable costs of operation and 
a corresponding schedule of discounts adjusted on the basis of the 
patient's ability to pay. The schedule of discounts must provide for a 
full discount to individuals and families with annual incomes at or 
below those set forth in the most recent CSA Poverty Income Guidelines 
(42 CFR 1060.2) (except that nominal fees for service may be collected 
from individuals and families with annual incomes at or below such 
levels if imposition of such fees is consistent with project goals) and 
for no discount to individuals and families with annual incomes greater 
than twice those set forth in the Guidelines.
    (f) Make every reasonable effort, including the establishment of 
systems for eligibility determination, billing, and collection, to
    (1) Collect reimbursement for its costs in providing health services 
to persons who are entitled to insurance benefits under title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act, to medical assistance under a State plan 
approved under title XIX of such Act, to social services and family 
planning under title XX of such Act, or to assistance for medical 
expenses under any other public assistance program, grant program, or 
private health insurance or benefit program on the basis of the schedule 
of fees prepared pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section without 
application of any discounts, and
    (2) Secure from patients payments for services in accordance with 
the schedule of fees and discounts required by paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (g) Develop an overall financial management plan and an operating 
budget for the project which include and identify, in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, all anticipated current income 
and expense items and capital income and expense items, if any.
    (h) Establish basic statistical data, cost accounting, management 
information, and reporting or monitoring systems which will meet the 
project's management needs and shall enable the project to provide such 
statistics and other information as the Secretary may reasonably require 
relating to the project's costs of operation, patterns of utilization of 
services, and the availability, accessibility, and acceptability of its 
services, and to make such reports to the Secretary in a timely manner 
with such frequency as the Secretary may reasonably require.

[[Page 257]]

    (i) Review its catchment area annually to insure that the criteria 
set out in Sec. 56.104(b)(2) are met and, where such criteria are not 
met, revise its catchment area, with the approval of the Secretary, to 
conform with such criteria to the extent feasible.
    (j) In the case of a project which serves a population including a 
substantial proportion of individuals of limited English-speaking 
ability, have a plan and made arrangements responsive to the needs of 
these populations for providing services to the extent practicable in 
the language and cultural context most appropriate to such individuals, 
and have identified an individual on its staff who is fluent in both 
that language and in English and whose responsibilities include 
providing guidance to such individuals and to appropriate staff members 
with respect to cultural sensitivities and bridging linguistic and 
cultural differences. If more than one non-English language is spoken by 
such group or groups, an individual or individuals fluent in those 
languages and English must be so identified.
    (k) Be operated in a manner calculated to preserve human dignity and 
to maximize acceptability and effective utilization of services.
    (l) To the extent possible, coordinate and integrate project 
activities with the activities of other federally funded, as well as 
State and local, health services delivery projects and programs serving 
the same population.
    (m) Establish means for evaluating progress toward the achievement 
of the specific objectives of the project.
    (n) Provide sufficient staff, qualified by training and experience, 
to carry out the activities of the project.
    (o) Assure that facilities utilized in the performance of the 
project meet applicable fire and life safety codes.
    (p) Utilize, to the maximum extent feasible, other Federal, State 
and local, and private resources available for support of the project, 
prior to use of project funds under this part.
    (q) Provide for community participation through, for example, 
contributions of cash or services, loans of full- or part-time staff, 
equipment, space, materials, or facilities, and, to the extent feasible, 
establishment of an advisory council to advise with respect to the 
overall management of the project including services to be provided, the 
manner of their provision, and appointment of personnel. The membership 
of such advisory council shall be representative of the population to be 
served in terms of appropriate demographic characteristics, such as 
race, sex, and ethnicity.
    (r) Where the project will provide services through contract or 
other cooperative arrangements with other providers of services, the 
project must
    (1) Enter into any such contract or arrangement only if the provider 
of services will provide the services in a timely manner and make the 
services accessible and acceptable to the population to be served; and
    (2) Make payment for services so provided in accordance with a 
schedule of rates and payment procedures established and maintained by 
the project. The project must be prepared to substantiate that such 
rates are reasonable and necessary.
    (s) Operate in a manner such that no migratory or seasonal 
agricultural worker or member of their families will be denied service 
by reason of his or her inability to pay therefor. Provided, however, 
That a charge for the provision of services will be made to the extent 
that a third party (including a Government agency) is authorized or is 
under legal obligation to pay such charges.
    (t) Have an ongoing quality assurance program as described in 
Sec. 56.303(c) except as the Secretary finds that such a program would 
not be feasible.

  Subpart B--Grants for Construction of Teaching Facilities for Health 
                          Professions Personnel

    Authority: Sec. 727, Public Health Service Act, 77 Stat. 170 (42 
U.S.C. 293g).

    Source: 37 FR 20543, Sept. 30, 1972, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 57.101   Applicability.

    The regulations in this part are applicable to the award of grants 
under part B of title VII of the Public Health Service Act for 
construction of teaching facilities for medical, dental, and other 
health personnel (42 U.S.C. 293 et seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 57.102   Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    (a) All terms not defined herein shall have the same meaning as 
given them in section 724 of the Act.
    (b) Act means the Public Health Service Act, as amended.
    (c) Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and 
any other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human 
Services to whom the authority involved has been delegated.
    (d) Council means the National Advisory Council on Health 
Professions Education (established pursuant to section 725 of the Act).
    (e) Construction grant and grant mean a grant of funds for the 
construction of an approved project as authorized under part B of title 
VII of the Act, and in accordance with these regulations.
    (f) Affiliated hospital or affiliated outpatient facility means a 
hospital or outpatient facility (as defined in section 645 of the Act) 
which, although not owned by such school, has a written agreement with a 
school of medicine, osteopathy or dentistry eligible for assistance 
under this subpart, providing for effective control by the school of the 
teaching in the hospital or outpatient facility.
    (g) New school means a school which, at the time of filing an 
application for a construction grant under this subpart, has not 
graduated a class because of an insufficient period of operation.
    (h) Equipment includes those items which are necessary for the 
functioning of the facility or portion thereof with respect to which the 
grant is made, but does not include items of current operating expense 
or consumed in use such as glassware, chemicals, food, fuel, drugs, 
paper, printed forms, books, pamphlets, periodicals and disposable 
housekeeping items.
    (i) Advanced education means training in the health sciences beyond 
the first professional degree or equivalent degree, and such training 
related thereto. Such training may include internships and residencies,

to enhance their skills, and may include refresher courses, seminars, 
and the like.

[[Page 264]]

    (k) Multipurpose facilities means facilities which are primarily for 
teaching purposes, but which are also for research, or research and 
related purposes, in the sciences related to health (within the meaning 
of part A of title VII of the Act) or for medical library purposes 
(within the meaning of part J of title III). The Secretary may determine 
``to be primarily for teaching purposes'' any facilities with respect to 
which he determines that the health professions teaching portions of 
such facilities, including research and library space essential for 
teaching purposes, will substantially exceed the total of the research 
and library portions which are not essential for teaching taken 
together.
    (l) Completion of construction means that date on which the 
Secretary determines, on the basis of certification by the grantee, that 
the project is completed: Provided, however, In the event the grantee 
occupies the project prior to the date of such certification, the 
Secretary shall be immediately notified of such occupancy, and 
``completion of construction'' shall be deemed to have occurred with 
respect to the project as of the date of such occupancy.


<R05>
Sec. 57.103   Eligibility.

    In order to be eligible for a construction grant under part B of the 
Act, the applicant shall:
    (a) Meet the applicable requirements of section 721(b) of the Act;
    (b) Be a public or nonprofit private school of medicine, dentistry, 
osteopathy, pharmacy, optometry, podiatry, veterinary medicine, public 
health, or any combination thereof, or an affiliated hospital or 
affiliated outpatient facility;
    (c) Be located in a State, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Canal Zone, 
American Samoa, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands or Guam;
    (d) Except in the case of an application with respect to an 
affiliated hospital or affiliated outpatient facility, be accredited by 
a recognized body or bodies approved for such purpose by the 
Commissioner of Education, except that a new school which (by reason of 
no, or an insufficient period of, operation) is not, at the time of 
making application for the construction grant, eligible for 
accreditation by such recognized body or bodies shall be deemed 
accredited for purposes of receiving a grant if the Commissioner finds, 
after consultation with the appropriate accreditation body or bodies, 
that there is reasonable assurance that the school, after completion of 
the facility and at or prior to the time of graduation of the first 
class to use such facility, will have met the accreditation standards of 
such body or bodies: Provided, That, in the case of an application from 
a combination of schools, each constituent school must meet the 
requirements of this paragraph;
    (e) In the case of an application with respect to an affiliated 
hospital or outpatient facility, have its application approved by the 
school of medicine, osteopathy, or dentistry with which the hospital or 
outpatient facility is affiliated;
    (f) In the case of an application with respect to the construction 
of multipurpose facilities, provide evidence satisfactory to the 
Secretary that such facilities will be used primarily for teaching 
purposes, and that such facilities are otherwise eligible under part B 
of title VII of the Act;
    (g) In the case of a project for the construction of a facility 
intended, at least in part, for the provision of health services, 
provide an opportunity for comment with respect to such project to
    (1) The State agency administering or supervising the administration 
of the State plan approved under section 314(a), and
    (2) The public or nonprofit private agency or organization 
responsible for the plan or plans referred to in section 314(b) and 
covering the area in which such project is to be located or if there is 
no such agency, such other public or nonprofit private agency or 
organization (if any) as performs, as determined in accordance with 
criteria of the Secretary, similar functions;
    (h) In the case of an application with respect to interim 
facilities, provide assurance satisfactory to the Secretary that such 
facilities are designed to provide teaching space on a short-term

[[Page 265]]

(less than 10 years) basis while facilities of a more permanent nature 
are being planned and constructed;
    (i) Provide its assessment of the environmental impact of the 
project as called for by section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(c));
    (j) Furnish its evaluation of the project site in accordance with 
the terms and provisions of E.O. 11296, 31 FR 10663 (August 10, 1966) 
relating to the evaluation of flood hazards in locating federally owned 
or financed facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 57.104   Priority.

    (a) Priority in approving applications for construction grants shall 
be determined in accordance with the factors specified in section 721(d) 
of the Act, and the following:
    (1) The relative need for increased enrollment and the availability 
of students;
    (2) The relative effectiveness of the project in accomplishing the 
purposes of the Act at the least relative cost to the Federal 
Government;
    (3) The relative ability of the applicant to make efficient and 
productive use of the facility constructed; and
    (4) Such other pertinent factors as the Secretary may specify;
    (b) The Secretary shall give special consideration to grant 
applications to assist in the construction of new schools of medicine, 
osteopathy, and dentistry, where such applications contain or are 
reasonably supported by assurances that, because of use by such school 
of existing facilities (including Federal medical or dental facilities), 
the school will be able to accelerate the date on which it will begin 
its teaching program.


<R05>
Sec. 57.105   Percentage of participation; amount of construction grant.

    (a) Percentage of maximum participation. (1) The amount of any 
construction grant made under part B of title VII of the Act and 
pursuant to this subpart may not exceed 70 percent of the necessary cost 
of construction of a project as determined by the Secretary, except:
    (i) In the case of a project with respect to a school of public 
health, the amount of such grant may not exceed 75 percent of the 
necessary cost of construction; and
    (ii) In the case of (a) a project with respect to a new school; (b) 
a project constituting new facilities which will result in a major 
expansion of training capacity at an existing school in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section; (c) all or so much of a project 
constituting a major remodeling or renovation of an existing facility 
which is required by a school to meet an increase in student enrollment; 
or (d) any other project where the Secretary determines that unusual 
circumstances require a larger percent of participation in order to 
carry out the intent of part B of title VII of the Act the amount of 
such grant may not exceed 80 percent of the necessary cost of 
construction.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section:
    (i) A major expansion of training capacity at an existing school 
shall be construed to mean that the full-time first-year enrollment at 
such school, upon completion of construction, will exceed the highest 
full-time first-year enrollment at such school for any of the 5 full 
school years preceding the year in which the application for a 
construction grant is made by not less than 40 students or 40 percent, 
whichever is greater: Provided, however, That where the Secretary 
determines with respect to a particular school that such increased 
enrollment cannot be achieved until the second or third full school year 
after completion of construction, he may determine that the requirements 
for a major expansion of training capacity are met for each of the first 
or second full school years after completion of construction, if during 
such first or second full school year the increase in first-year 
enrollment will equal such amount in excess of 5 percent or five 
students, whichever is greater, as the Secretary may specify;
    (ii) A major remodeling or renovation of a facility shall include 
only that portion of remodeling or renovation which is necessary to meet 
an increase in student enrollment, which increase shall be construed to 
mean that, during the first full school year after completion of 
construction and for

[[Page 266]]

each of the 9 school years thereafter the first-year enrollment will 
exceed the highest first-year enrollment at such school for any of the 5 
full school years preceding the year in which the application is made by 
not less than the mandatory increase as provided for under section 
770(f)(1)(A) of the Act;
    (iii) Unusual circumstances may be determined by the Secretary to 
exist:
    (a) Where a school is located in a geographical area of the United 
States with a critical shortage of health profession manpower (as 
determined by the Secretary with the advice of Council);
    (b) Where the project is found to be necessary to prevent the 
curtailment of enrollment at a school;
    (c) Where the project is essential to the securing or maintenance of 
a school's accreditation; or
    (d) Where there are other relevant factors consistent with this 
subpart and the purposes of part B of title VII of the Act.
    (b) Amount of construction grant--less than maximum. In determining 
the amount of a construction grant within the percentage limitations as 
set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary shall take 
into consideration the most effective use of available Federal funds to 
further the purposes of part B of title VII of the Act, and the needs of 
the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 57.106   Nondiscrimination.

    (a) Executive Order 11246. Each construction contract under this 
subpart is subject to the condition that the applicant shall comply with 
the requirements of Executive Order 11246, 30 FR 12319 (September 24, 
1965), as amended, relating to nondiscrimination in construction 
contract employment, and the applicable rules, regulations, and 
procedures prescribed pursuant thereto.
    (b) Civil Rights Act of 1964. Attention is called to the 
requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 252, 
42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), which provides that no person in the United 
States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be 
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination, under any program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance. A regulation implementing such title VI, 
which is applicable to grants made under this part, has been issued by 
the Secretary with the approval of the President (45 CFR part 80).
    (c) Discrimination on the basis of sex prohibited. Attention is 
called to the requirements of section 704 of the Act, and to 45 CFR part 
83 which together provide that the Secretary may not make a grant, loan 
guarantee, or interest subsidy payment under title VII of the Act to, or 
for the benefit of, any school of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, 
veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, or public health, or 
any training center for allied health personnel or to any other entity 
unless the application for the grant, loan guarantee, or interest 
subsidy payment contains assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that 
the school, training center or other entity will not discriminate on the 
basis of sex in the admission of individuals to its training programs.

[37 FR 20543, Sept. 30, 1972, as amended at 49 FR 38112, Sept. 27, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 57.107   Terms and conditions.

    In addition to any other requirements imposed by law or determined 
by the Secretary to be reasonably necessary with respect to particular 
projects to fulfill the purpose of the grant, each construction grant 
shall be subject to the condition that the applicant shall furnish and 
comply with the following assurances:
    (a) Title. That applicant has a fee simple or such other estate or 
interest in the site, including necessary easements and rights-of-way, 
sufficient to assure for a period of not less than 20 years (or in the 
case of interim facilities for the period constituting the estimated 
useful life of such facilities) undisturbed use and possession for the 
purpose of the construction and operation of the facility;
    (b) Competitive bids. (1) That the approval of the Secretary shall 
be obtained before the project is advertised or placed on the market for 
bidding and that such approval shall include a determination by the 
Secretary that

[[Page 267]]

the final plans and specifications conform to the minimum standards of 
construction and equipment as set forth in appendix A of these 
regulations.
    (2) That, except as otherwise provided by State or local law, all 
contracting for construction (including the purchase and installation of 
built-in equipment) shall, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section, be on a lump sum fixed-price basis, and contracts will be 
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding obtained by public 
advertising with award of the contract to the lowest responsive and 
responsible bidder. The provision for exceptions based on State or local 
law shall not be invoked to give local contractors or suppliers a 
percentage preference over non-local contractors bidding for the same 
contract. Such practices are precluded by this paragraph.
    (3) A substitute bidding procedure of selective solicitation with 
response from three or more bidders may be used if:
    (i) The applicant requests and justifies the use of the procedure;
    (ii) The procedure is consistent with State and local laws; and
    (iii) The Secretary determines that it is necessary to limit bidding 
to contractors of proven competence due to the complexity or specialty 
of the project or that the time element is of primary consideration. 
When this bidding procedure is used, the applicant shall establish 
reasonable bid prequalification standards for contractors. The applicant 
shall then accept and consider bids from any contractor who requests 
permission to bid and who is determined by the applicant to meet these 
prequalification standards. Adequate time (normally 30 days) shall be 
allowed for contractors to prepare bids, and award of construction 
contracts shall be made to the lowest qualified and responsible bidder 
whose bid is considered fully responsive to the bid invitation;
    (c) Approval of estimated cost. That applicant will enter into no 
construction contract or contracts with respect to the project or any 
portion thereof where the costs exceed estimates in the application for 
such work, without prior approval of the Secretary.
    (d) Relocation assistance. That in the case of a public applicant 
with an approved project which involves the displacement of persons or 
businesses, on and after January 2, 1971, whose real property has or 
will be taken, the applicant will comply with the provisions of the 
Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act 
of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-646) and the applicable regulations issued 
thereunder; (45 CFR part 15, as added by 36 FR 18838 (Sept. 22, 1971));
    (e) Cost in excess of approved costs. That applicant will finance 
all costs in excess of the estimated costs approved in the application 
and submit to the Secretary for prior approval any changes that 
substantially alter the scope of its education program, or of the work, 
functions, utilities, or safety of the facility:
    (f) Completion responsibility. That applicant will construct the 
project, or cause it to be constructed, to final completion in 
accordance with the grant application and the plans and specifications;
    (g) Records and accounts. That applicant will maintain adequate and 
separate accounting and fiscal records and accounts for all funds 
provided from any source to pay the cost of the project, and permit 
audit of such records and accounts at any reasonable time. All records 
will be retained for 3 years after the close of the fiscal year in which 
the construction is completed. Such records may be destroyed at the end 
of such 3-year period if the applicant has been notified of the 
completion of the Federal audit by such time. If the applicant has not 
been so notified by the end of such 3-year period, such records will be 
retained (1) for 5 years after the close of the fiscal year in which the 
construction is completed or (2) until the grantee is notified of the 
completion of the Federal audit, whichever is earlier. In all cases 
where audit questions have arisen before the expiration of such 5-year 
period, records shall be retained until resolution of such questions;
    (h) Progress reports. That applicant shall furnish progress reports 
and such other information as the Secretary may require;

[[Page 268]]

    (i) Construction supervision. That applicant shall provide and 
maintain competent and adequate architectural or engineering supervision 
and inspection at the construction site to insure that the completed 
work conforms with the plans and specifications;
    (j) Non-Federal share. That sufficient funds will be available to 
meet the non-Federal share of the cost of constructing the facility;
    (k) Funds for operation. That sufficient funds will be available 
after construction is completed for effective use of the facility for 
the purposes for which it is being constructed;
    (l) Authorized uses. That the facility is intended to be used for 
the purposes for which the application has been made;
    (m) Prohibition against religious use. That no portion of the 
facility constructed with funds under part B of title VII of the Act 
will be used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious 
worship for so long as such facility has substantial value;
    (n) Expansion of training capacity. That in the case of any 
application (including an application with respect to continuing 
education or advanced training) to expand the training capacity of an 
existing school, the first-year enrollment at such school during the 
first full year after the completion of the construction and for each of 
the 9 school years thereafter will exceed the highest first-year 
enrollment at such school for any of the 5 full years preceding the year 
in which the application is made by at least 5 percent of such highest 
first-year enrollment, or by five students, whichever is greater. This 
increase shall be in addition to any increase assured pursuant to 
section 770(f)(1)(A) of the Act: Provided, however, That if such school 
is not required to meet in the fiscal year in which the application is 
made the enrollment increase prescribed under section 770(f)(1)(A) of 
the Act because of limitations of physical facilities available to the 
school for training, the Secretary may, after consulation with the 
Council, waive all or any portion of such requirements provided for in 
this paragraph, if the application contains or is supported by 
reasonable assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the number of 
first-year students enrolled at such school during the first full school 
year after the completion of such project and for each of the next 9 
school years thereafter shall be not less than the number of first-year 
students that such school would be required to enroll for a grant under 
section 770(f) of the Act (without regard to paragraph (2) thereof) for 
a grant under section 770(a) of the Act;

<R05>
Sec. 57.108   Construction contract requirements.

    The following conditions and provisions must be included in all 
construction contracts:
    (a) The provisions set forth in ``DHHS Requirements for Federally 
Assisted Construction Contracts Regarding Labor Standards and Equal 
Employment Opportunities'', Form DHHS 514 (April, 1969) (issued by the 
Office of Grants Administration Policy, U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services) pertaining to the Davis-Bacon Act, the Contract Work 
Hours Standards Act, and the Copeland Act (Anti-Kickback) Regulations, 
except in the case of contracts in the amount of $2,000 or less; and 
pertaining to Executive Order 11246, 30 FR 12319 (September 24, 1965), 
as amended, relating to nondiscrimination in construction contract 
employment, except in the case of contracts in the amount of $10,000 or 
less;
    (b) The contractor shall furnish performance and payment bonds, each 
of which shall be in the full amount of the contract price, and shall 
maintain, during the life of the contract, adequate fire, workmen's 
compensation, public liability, and property damage insurance: Provided 
however, That in the case of a State or local unit of government which 
enters into a construction contract of less than $100,000, State or 
local provisions with respect to performance and payment bonds shall be 
deemed to meet the requirements of this paragraph; and
    (c) The Secretary shall have access at all reasonable times to work 
wherever it is in preparation or progress, and the contractor shall 
provide proper facilities for such access and inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 57.109   Good cause for other use of completed facility.

    If, within 20 years after completion of construction (or, in the 
case of interim facilities prior to the time at which teaching in such 
facilities is moved to a permanent facility, whichever comes first), the 
facility shall cease to be used for any one or more of the purposes for 
which it was constructed, the Secretary, in determining whether there is 
good cause for releasing the applicant or other owner of the facility 
from the obligation so to use the facility, shall take into 
consideration the extent to which:
    (a) The facility will be devoted by the applicant or other owner to 
the teaching of other health personnel, or to other purposes in the 
sciences related to health for which funds are available under part B of 
title VII of the Act and these regulations;
    (b) A hospital or outpatient facility will be used as provided for 
under title VI of the Act;
    (c) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of such 
period other facilities not previously utilized for teaching health 
professions personnel, or for research and related purposes in the 
sciences related to health, or for medical library purposes, as the case 
may be, will be so utilized and are substantially the equivalent in 
nature and extent for such purposes.

[[Page 270]]


<R05>
Sec. 57.110   Acquisition of facilities.

    In addition to the other requirements of this subpart the following 
provisions are also applicable to the acquisition of existing 
facilities:
    (a) Minimum standards of construction and equipment. That a 
determination by the Secretary that the facility conforms (or upon 
completion of any necessary construction will conform) to the minimum 
standards of construction and equipment as set forth in appendix A of 
this subpart, shall be obtained before entering into a final or 
unconditional contract for such acquisition. Where the Secretary finds 
that exceptions to or modification of any such minimum standards of 
construction and equipment would be consistent with the purposes of part 
B of title VII of the Act and of the program, he may authorize such 
exceptions or modifications;
    (b) Estimated cost of acquisition and remodeling: suitability of 
facility. Each application for a project involving the acquisition of 
existing facilities shall include in the detailed estimates of the cost 
of the project, the cost of acquiring such facilities, and any cost of 
remodeling, renovating or altering such facilities to serve the purposes 
for which they are acquired. Such application shall demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary that the architectural, structural and 
other pertinent features of the facility, as modified by any proposed 
expansion, remodeling, renovation, or alteration, will be clearly 
suitable for the purposes of the program, and, to the extent of the 
costs in which Federal participation is requested, are not in excess of 
what is necessary for the services proposed to be provided in such 
facilities;
    (c) Determination of necessary cost. The necessary cost of 
acquisition of existing facilities will be determined on the basis of 
such documentation submitted by the applicant as the Secretary may 
prescribe (including the reports of such real estate appraisers as the 
Secretary may approve) and other relevant factors;
    (d) Bona fide sale. Federal participation in the acquisition of 
existing facilities is on condition that such acquisition constitutes a 
bona fide sale involving an actual cost to the applicant and will result 
in additional or improved facilities for purposes of the program; and
    (e) Facility which has previously received Federal grant. No grant 
for the acquisition of a facility which has previously received a 
Federal grant for construction, acquisition, or equipment shall serve 
either to reduce or restrict the liability of the applicant or any other 
transferor or transferee from any obligation of accountability imposed 
by the Federal Government by reason of such prior grant.


<R05>
Sec. 57.111   Additional conditions.

    The Secretary may with respect to any grant award impose additional 
conditions prior to or at the time of any award when in his judgment 
such conditions are necessary to assure or protect advancement of the 
approved project, the interest of public health or the conservation of 
grant funds.


<R05>
Sec. 57.112   Early termination and withholding of payments.

    Whenever the Secretary finds that a grantee has failed in a material 
respect to comply with the applicable provisions of the Act, the 
regulations of this subpart or the terms of the grant, he may, on 
reasonable notice to the grantee, withhold further payments, and take 
such other action, including the termination of the grant, as he finds 
appropriate to carry out the purposes of the applicable provisions of 
the Act and regulations. Noncancellable obligations of the grant 
properly incurred prior to the receipt of the notice of termination will 
be honored. The grantee shall be promptly notified of such termination 
in writing and given the reasons therefor.

<R05>
Sec. 57.204  Payment of Federal capital contributions and reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary.

    (a) Annual payment. The Secretary will make payments to each school 
with which he or she has entered into an agreement under the Act at a 
time determined by him or her. If the total of the amounts requested for 
any fiscal year by all schools for Federal capital contributions exceeds 
the amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of 
payment to be available for this purpose, the payment to each school 
will be reduced to whichever is smaller:
    (1) The amount requested in the application, or
    (2) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of 
Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be 
available for that fiscal year for the Health Professions Student Loan 
Program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary 
to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of 
full-time students in all participating schools during that year. 
Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in 
accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications 
requested more than the amount paid to them, but with whatever 
adjustments that may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any 
school from exceeding the total requested by it.
    (b) Method of payment. The payment of Federal capital contributions 
to a school will be paid in a manner that avoids unnecessary 
accumulations of money in any health professions student loan fund.
    (c) Reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary. All funds from 
a student loan fund established under this subpart which are remitted to 
the Secretary in any fiscal year shall be available for allotment under 
this subpart, in the same fiscal year and the succeeding fiscal year, to 
schools which, during the period beginning on July 1, 1972, and ending 
on September 30, 1985, established student loan funds with Federal 
capital contributions under this subpart. The Secretary will from time 
to time set dates by which the schools must file applications to receive 
a portion of these funds. If the total of the amounts requested for any 
fiscal year by eligible schools exceeds the amount of funds determined 
by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this 
purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is 
smaller:
    (1) The amount requested in the application, or
    (2) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of 
returned funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be 
available for that fiscal year for the Health Professions Student Loan 
program as the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary 
to be enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of 
full-time students in all eligible schools during that year.

Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in 
accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications 
requested more than the amount paid to them, with whatever adjustments 
may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any school from exceeding 
the total requested by it.

FR 19293, Apr. 26, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 57.205  Health professions student loan funds.

    (a) Funds established with Federal capital contributions. Any fund 
established by a school with Federal capital contributions will be 
accounted for separately from other funds, providing a clear audit trail 
for all transactions. At all times the fund must contain monies 
representing the institutional capital contribution. The school must at 
all times maintain all monies relating to the fund in one or more 
interest-bearing accounts or investment instruments which meet OMB 
requirements established for Federal monies held by third parties. The 
school must place all earnings into the fund but may first

[[Page 274]]

deduct from total earnings any reasonable and customary charges incurred 
through the use of an interest-bearing account. An institution shall 
exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary with regard to these 
deposits and investments, and shall be responsible for reimbursing the 
fund for any losses that occur due to the use of investments that are 
not federally insured.
    (1) The Federal capital contribution fund is to be used by the 
school only for:
    (i) Health professions student loans to full-time students;
    (ii) Capital distribution as provided in section 728 of the Act or 
as agreed to by the school and the Secretary; and
    (iii) Costs of litigation, costs associated with membership in 
credit bureaus, and to the extent specifically approved by the 
Secretary, other collection costs that exceed the usual expenses 
incurred in the collection of health professions student loans.
    (2) A school must review the balance in the fund on at least a semi-
annual basis to determine whether the fund balance compared with 
projected levels of expenditures and collections exceeds its needs. A 
school in closing status must review the balance in the fund on a 
quarterly basis. Monies identified as in excess of the school's needs 
must be reported, and the Federal share returned to the Federal 
Government, by the due date of the required report which identifies the 
excess monies. The school's determination is subject to the review and 
approval of the Secretary.
    (b) Funds established with Federal capital loans. (1) Each Federal 
capital loan is subject to the terms of the promissory note executed by 
an authorized official on behalf of the borrowing school.
    (2) The Federal capital loans must be carried in a special account 
of the school, to be used by the school only for (i) repayments of 
principal and interest on Federal capital loans; and (ii) costs of 
litigation; costs associated with membership in credit bureaus; and, to 
the extent specifically approved by the Secretary, other collection 
costs that exceed the usual expenses incurred in the collection of 
health professions student loans.
    (c) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will 
subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of Sec. 57.218 and the 
Department's Claims Collections regulations (45 CFR part 30), as 
appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 57.206  Eligibility and selection of health professions student loan applicants.

    (a) Determination of eligibility. (1) Applicants are eligible for 
consideration for a health professions student loan if they are:
    (i) Residents of the United States and either a citizen or national 
of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
in the United States, a citizen of the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, a citizen of the Republic of Palau, a citizen of the 
Republic of the Marshall Islands, or a citizen of the Federated States 
of Micronesia;
    (ii) Enrolled, or accepted for enrollment in the school as full-time 
students;
    (iii) In need of the amount of the loan to pursue a full-time course 
of study at the school;
    (iv) Of exceptional financial need in the case of students of 
medicine or osteopathic medicine. A student will be considered to 
demonstrate exceptional financial need if the school determines that his 
or her resources, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, do 
not exceed the lesser of $6,700 or one-half of the costs of attendance 
at the school. Summer earnings, educational loans, veterans (G.I.) 
benefits and earnings during the school year will not be considered as 
resources in determining whether an applicant meets the eligibility 
criteria for exceptional financial need, but will be considered in 
determining the amount of funds a student may receive; and
    (v) In compliance with the requirement to register for the draft, if 
required to do so under section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act.

[[Page 275]]

    (2) An applicant who has previously attended an institution of 
higher education must submit a financial aid transcript which includes 
at least the following data:
    (i) Applicant's name and social security number;
    (ii) Amounts and sources of loans and grants previously received by 
the applicant for study at an institution of higher education;
    (iii) Whether the applicant is in default on any of these loans, or 
owes a refund on any grants;
    (iv) Certification from each institution previously attended by the 
applicant that the applicant has received no financial aid, if 
applicable; and
    (v) From each institution previously attended, the signature of an 
official authorized by the institution to sign such transcripts on 
behalf of the institution.
    (b) Selection of applicants. The school will select qualified 
applicants, including medical (M.D. and D.O.) applicants, and determine 
the amount of student loans by considering:
    (1) The financial resources available to the student by using one of 
the national need analysis systems or any other procedure approved by 
the Secretary of Education in combination with other information which 
the school has regarding the student's financial status. The school must 
take into account, regardless of the tax status of the student, the 
expected contribution from parents, spouse, self or other family 
members; and
    (2) The costs reasonably necessary for the student's attendance at 
the school, including any special needs and obligations which directly 
affect the student's ability to attend the school on a full-time basis. 
The school must document the criteria used for determining these costs.
    (c) Selection of medical (M.D. and D.O.) student applicants. In 
addition to the factors in Sec. 57.206(b), the school must select 
medical (M.D. and D.O.) students graduating after June 30, 1979, based 
on the order of greatest need, taking into consideration the other 
resources available to the student through the school. For purposes of 
establishing priority for selecting medical (M.D. and D.O.) student 
applicants to receive health professions student loans, summer earnings, 
educational loans, veterans (G.I.) benefits, and earnings during the 
school year will be considered as financial resources.
    (d) Verification of loan information. The school must verify, to the 
best of its ability, the information provided by the student on the loan 
application. To comply with this requirement, a school may require that 
a student provide, for example: Photocopies of the parents', student's, 
and spouse's Federal income tax forms with original signatures for the 
most recent tax year (or certification that no Federal income tax return 
was filed); tax returns that are certified as having been received by 
the Internal Revenue Service; or other documentation that the school 
considers necessary to help assure that information on the loan 
application is correct.

Sec. 57.209  Payment of health professions student loans.

    (a) Health professions student loans from any fund may be paid to or 
on behalf of student borrowers in installments considered appropriate by 
the school except that a school may not pay to or on behalf of any 
borrower more during any given installment period (e.g., semester, term, 
or quarter) than the school determines the student needs for that 
period.
    (b) No payment may be made from a fund to or on behalf of any 
student borrower if at the time of the payment the borrower is not a 
full-time student.


<R05>
Sec. 57.210  Repayment and collection of health professions student loans.

    (a) Each health professions student loan, including accrued 
interests, will be repayable in equal or graduated periodic installments 
in amounts calculated on the basis of a 10-year repayment period. Except 
as otherwise provided in this paragraph, repayment of a

[[Page 277]]

loan must begin one year after the student ceases to be a full-time 
student.
    (1) If a borrower reenters the same or another school as a full-time 
student within the 1-year period, the date upon which interest will 
accrue and the repayment period will begin will be determined by the 
date on which the student last ceases to be a full-time student at that 
school.
    (2) The following periods will be excluded from the 10-year 
repayment period:
    (i) All periods for up to a total of 3 years of active duty 
performed by the borrower as a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Corps or the U.S. Public Health Service Corps;
    (ii) All periods for up to a total of 3 years of service as a 
volunteer under the Peace Corps Act;
    (iii) All periods of advanced professional training including 
internships and residencies, except as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) 
of this section;
    (iv) All periods during which the borrower is pursuing a full-time 
course of study at an eligible health professions school;
    (v) A period not in excess of 2 years during which a borrower who is 
a full-time student in a health professions school leaves the school, 
with the intent to return to such school as a full-time student, to 
engage in a full-time educational activity which is directly related to 
the health profession for which the individual is preparing. To qualify 
for such deferment, the full-time educational activity must be one 
which:
    (A) Is part of a joint-degree program or a formal program of joint 
study in conjunction with the health profession for which the borrower 
is preparing at the school; or
    (B) Is an activity which will enhance the borrower's knowledge and 
skills in the health profession for which the borrower is preparing at 
the school, as determined by the school.

The borrower must request such deferment from the school in which he or 
she is enrolled no later than 60 days prior to leaving such school to 
engage in the full-time educational activity. The school must then 
determine, no later than 30 days prior to the borrower's leaving such 
school, whether the borrower qualifies for such deferment. A borrower 
who qualifies for this type of deferment receives the grace period upon 
completion or termination of his or her studies leading to the first 
professional degree in the health discipline being pursued. If the 
borrower fails to return to school, the school retroactively must begin 
the borrower's grace period based on the date the borrower terminated 
his or her studies at the school, and must begin the repayment period 
immediately following the end of the grace period; and
    (vi) A period not in excess of 2 years during which a borrower who 
is a graduate of a health professions school participates in:
    (A) A fellowship training program which is directly related to the 
health profession for which the borrower prepared at the school, as 
determined by the school from which the borrower received his or her 
loan, and is engaged in by the borrower no later than 12 months after 
the completion of the borrower's participation in advanced professional 
training as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, or prior 
to the completion of such borrower's participation in such training. To 
qualify for such deferment, the fellowship training program must be one 
which:
    (1) Is a full-time activity in research or research training or in 
health care policy; and
    (2) Is a formally established fellowship program which was not 
created for a specific individual; or
    (B) A full-time educational activity which is directly related to 
the health profession for which the borrower prepared at the school, as 
determined by the school from which the borrower received his or her 
loan, and is engaged in by the borrower no later than 12 months after 
the completion of the borrower's participation in advanced professional 
training as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, or prior 
to the completion of the borrower's participation in such training. To 
qualify for such deferment, the full-time educational activity must be 
one which:

[[Page 278]]

    (1) Is part of a joint-degree program in conjunction with the health 
profession for which the borrower prepared at the school; or
    (2) Is required for licensure, registration, or certification in the 
health profession for which the borrower received the HPSL loan; or
    (3) Is a full-time educational program in public health, health 
administration, or a health care discipline directly related to the 
health profession for which the borrower received the loan.
    (3) To receive a deferment, a borrower must, no later than 30 days 
prior to the onset of the activity (or no later than 30 days prior to 
the due date of the first payment if the borrower begins the activity 
during the grace period), and annually thereafter, provide the lending 
school with evidence of his or her status in the deferrable activity, 
and evidence that verifies deferment eligibility of the activity. This 
evidence must include certification by the Program Director or other 
authorized official that the borrower's activity meets the deferment 
requirements. The borrower must also notify the school upon completion 
or termination of the activity. It is the responsibility of the borrower 
to provide the lending school with all required information or other 
information regarding the requested deferment. The school may deny a 
request for deferment if it is not filed in accordance with the 
requirements of this section.
    (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a 
borrower must establish a repayment schedule with the school providing 
for payments not less often than quarterly. Any borrower whose repayment 
is delinquent more than 60 days must establish a monthly repayment 
schedule with the school. However, a borrower may at his or her option 
and without penalty, prepay all or part of the principal and accrued 
interest at any time.
    (5) A school may grant forbearance whenever extraordinary 
circumstances such as unemployment, poor health or other personal 
problems temporarily affect the borrower's ability to make scheduled 
loan repayments.
    (b)(1) Each school at which a fund is established must exercise due 
diligence in the collection of health professions student loans due the 
fund. In the exercise of due diligence, a school must follow procedures 
which are at least as extensive and effective as those used in the 
collection of other student loan accounts due the school, and must use 
the steps outlined below in accordance with collection practices which 
are generally accepted among institutions of higher education:
    (i) Conduct and document an entrance interview (individually or in 
groups) with the borrower prior to disbursing HPSL funds in an academic 
year. During the entrance interview the school must obtain documentation 
which indicates that the borrower is aware of the rights and 
responsibilities associated with HPSL funds and personal information 
which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep 
the school informed of his or her current address. The requirements of 
this subparagraph may be met by correspondence, if the school determines 
that a face-to-face meeting (individually or in groups) is 
impracticable.
    (ii) Conduct and document an exit interview (individually or in 
groups) with the borrower. During the exit interview, the school must 
provide each borrower with information necessary to carry out the terms 
of repayment, remind the borrower of the rights and responsibilities 
associated with HPSL funds, and update the personal information 
collected prior to disbursing HPSL funds which would assist in locating 
the borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or 
her current address. If the borrower terminates studies without advance 
notice, the school must document attempts to inform the borrower of the 
substance of the exit interview and to secure exit interview information 
from the borrower by mail.
    (iii) Notify the borrower in writing of the impending repayment 
obligation at least twice during the grace period;
    (iv) Notify a borrower who is in deferment status in writing of the 
impending repayment obligation 1 to 3 months prior to the expiration of 
the approved period of deferment;
    (v) Perform regular billing;

[[Page 279]]

    (vi) Follow up past due payments with a series of at least four 
documented and reasonably spaced attempts to contact the borrower, at 
least three of which must be in writing at not more than 30-day 
intervals, prior to the loan becoming 120 days past due, provided that 
the school has a current address for the borrower;
    (vii) Perform address searches when necessary;
    (viii) Use collection agents, which may include the use of an 
internal collection agent;
    (ix) Institute legal proceedings against borrowers after all other 
attempts at collection have failed, unless the school determines, 
subject to the approval of the Secretary, that such litigation would not 
be cost-effective; and
    (x) Become a member of a credit bureau and notify the credit bureau 
of accounts past due by more than 120 days.

In place of one or more of the procedures outlined above schools may 
substitute collection techniques that are equally or more effective, but 
only after they have demonstrated the effectiveness of the techniques 
and obtained written approval from the Secretary.
    (2) Late change. (i) For any health professions student loan made 
after June 30, 1969, but prior to October 22, 1985, the school may fix a 
charge for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an 
installment when it is due and, in the case of a borrower who is 
entitled to deferment under section 722(c) of the Act for any failure to 
file timely and satisfactory evidence of the entitlement. The amount of 
the charge may not exceed $1 for the first month or part of a month by 
which the installment or evidence is late and $2 for each succeeding 
month or part of a month. The school may elect to add the amount of this 
charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the day after the day 
on which the installment or evidence was due, or to make the amount of 
the charge payable to the school no later than the due date of the next 
installment following receipt of the notice of the charge by the 
borrower.
    (ii) For any health professions student loan made on or after 
October 22, 1985, the school shall assess a charge for failure of the 
borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when the loan is more 
than 60 days past due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to 
deferment under section 722(c) of the Act, for any failure to file 
satisfactory evidence of the entitlement within 60 days of the date 
payment would otherwise be due. No charge may be made if the loan is 
less than 61 days past due. The amount of this charge may not exceed an 
amount equal to 6 percent of the amount due at the time the charge is 
calculated. The school may elect to add the amount of this charge to the 
principal amount of the loan as of the day on which the charge is 
calculated, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school no 
later than the due date of the next installment following receipt of the 
notice of the charge by the borrower.
    (3) With respect to any health professions student loan made after 
June 30, 1969, the school may require the borrower to make payments of 
at least $15 per month on all outstanding health professions student 
loans during the repayment period.
    (4) A school must, on an annual basis, review and assess the 
collectibility of any loan more than 3 years past due. If the school 
determines that the prospects of future collection are promising enough 
to justify periodic review of the debt, and neither the statute of 
limitations nor the 10-year repayment period has expired, the school may 
retain the account for continued collections, provided that it makes an 
attempt at least semi-annually to collect from the borrower. When the 
due diligence procedures required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
have been exhausted, the school is responsible for determining the 
collection methods it will use for the semi-annual collection effort 
required on these loans. If the school determines that the prospects of 
future collection are not promising, or when the statute of limitations 
or the 10-year repayment period has expired, the loan must be considered 
uncollectible. A school may determine a loan to be uncollectible sooner 
than 3 years past due when it has evidence that the loan cannot be 
collected, but in no case should a school consider a loan as

[[Page 280]]

uncollectible if it has not been in default for a least 120 days. A 
school is not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) and 
(iii) of this section for loans that became uncollectible, as determined 
by the school, before August 1, 1985.
    (i) A school must request permission to write off an uncollectible 
loan within 30 days of the determination that it is uncollectible or 
reimburse the fund in the full amount of the loan, pursuant to 
Sec. 57.210(b)(4)(iii). The 30-day period for submitting the loan for 
write-off review begins on the date that the determination of 
uncollectibility is made, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section. In any instance where the Secretary determines that a school 
has failed to exercise due diligence in the collection of a loan, in 
accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, the school will 
be required to place in the fund the full amount of principal, interest, 
and penalty charges that remains uncollected on the loan. Reimbursement 
must be made by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is 
sooner, except that in no case will a school be required to reimburse 
the fund in less than 30 days following the Secretary's disapproval of 
the request for write-off approval.
    (ii) If the Secretary determines that a school has exercised due 
diligence in the collection of a loan, in accordance with the applicable 
regulatory requirements, or if the school determines that the loan was 
uncollectible prior to August 1, 1985, the school will be permitted to 
reduce its accounts receivable for the HPSL fund by the full amount of 
principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on 
that loan and will not be required to return the Federal share of the 
loss to the Secretary.
    (iii) If a school does not request permission to write off an 
uncollectible loan within the required timeframe, it must reimburse the 
fund for the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges 
that remains uncollected on that loan. This reimbursement must be made 
by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is sooner, except 
that in no case will a school be required to reimburse the fund in less 
than 30 days following its determination that a loan is uncollectible.
    (iv) Failure to comply with the requirement of this section will 
subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of Sec. 57.218 and the 
Department's Claims Collection regulations (45 CFR part 30), as 
appropriate.
    (5) Disclosure of taxpayer identity information. Upon written 
request by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) may disclose the address of any taxpayer who has defaulted on a 
health professions student loan, for use only by officers, employees, or 
agents of the Department, to locate the defaulted borrower to collect 
the loan. Any such mailing address may be disclosed by the Secretary to 
any school from which the defaulted borrower received a health 
professions student loan, for use only by officers, employees, or agents 
of the school whose duties relate to the collection of health 
professions student loan funds, to locate the defaulted borrower to 
collect the loan. Any school which requests and obtains this address 
information must comply with the requirements of the Secretary and the 
IRS regarding the safeguarding and proper handling of this information.

    (a) Permanent and total disability. The Secretary will cancel a 
student borrower's indebtedness in accordance with section 722(d) of the 
Act if the borrower is found to be permanently and totally disabled on 
recommendation of the school and as supported by whatever medical 
certification the Secretary may require. A borrower is totally and

permanently disabled if he or she is unable to engage in any substantial 
gainful activity because of a medically determinable impairment, which 
the Secretary expects to continue for a long time or to result in death.
    (b) Death. The Secretary will cancel a student borrower's 
indebtedness in accordance with section 722(d) of the Act upon the death 
of the borrower. The school to which the borrower was indebted must 
secure a certification of death or whatever official proof is conclusive 
under State law.

Sec. 57.213a  Loan cancellation reimbursement.

    (a) For loans made prior to October 22, 1985, in the event that 
insufficient funds are available to the Secretary in any fiscal year to 
enable him or her to pay to all schools their proportionate shares of 
all loans and interest canceled under this subpart for practice in a 
shortage area, death, or disability:
    (1) Each school will be paid an amount bearing the same ratio to the 
total of the funds available for that purpose as the principal of loans 
canceled by that school in that fiscal year bears to the total principal 
of loans canceled by all schools in that year; and
    (2) Any additional amounts to which a school is entitled will be 
paid by the Secretary at the time of distribution of the assets of the 
school's Fund under section 728 of the Act.
    (b) For loans made on or after October 22, 1985, a school may assess 
the borrower a charge to insure against the loss of the institutional 
share of a loan canceled due to the borrower's death or permanent and 
total disability. The school must develop annually a rate which reflects 
its cancellation experience. This charge shall not exceed .6 percent of 
the loan amount. Funds collected under this provision must be maintained 
by the school in an insured, interest-bearing account (with any earned 
interest credited to this insurance fund), and used only to reimburse 
the school for the institutional share of any HPSL loan made on or after 
October 22, 1985, that is canceled due to the borrower's death or 
permanent and total disability. A school is not required to establish a 
separate bank account, but is required to maintain separate 
accountability.

Sec. 57.214  Repayment of loans made after November 17, 1971, for failure to complete a program of study.

    In the event that the Secretary undertakes to repay educational 
loans under section 722(k) of the Act, he or she will use the following 
criteria to make a determination as to each applicant's eligibility:
    (a) An applicant will be considered to have failed to complete the 
course of study leading to the first professional degree for which an 
eligible education loan was made upon certification by a health 
professions school that the individual ceased to be enrolled in the 
school subsequent to November 17, 1971;
    (b) An applicant will be considered to be in exceptionally needy 
circumstances if, upon comparison of the income and other financial 
resources of

[[Page 282]]

the applicant with his or her expenses and financial obligations, the 
Secretary determines that repayment of the loan would constitute a 
serious economic burden on the applicant. In making this determination, 
the Secretary will take into consideration the applicant's net financial 
assets, his or her potential earning capacity, and the relationship of 
the income available to the applicant to the low-income levels published 
annually by the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this section;
    (c) An applicant will be considered to be from a low-income family 
if the applicant comes from a family with an annual income below a level 
based on low-income thresholds according to family size published by the 
U.S. Bureau of the Census, adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer 
Price Index, and adjusted by the Secretary for use in this program, and 
the family has no substantial net financial assets. Income levels as 
adjusted will be published annually by the Secretary in the Federal 
Register.
    (d) An applicant will be considered to be from a disadvantaged 
family if the individual comes from a family in which the annual income 
minus unusual expenses which contribute to the economic burdens borne by 
the family does not exceed the low-income levels published by the 
Secretary under paragraph (c) of this section and the family has no 
substantial net financial assets;
    (e) An applicant will be considered as not having resumed his or her 
health professions studies within two years following the date the 
individual ceased to be a student upon a certification so stating from 
the applicant; and
    (f) An applicant will be considered as not reasonably expected to 
resume his or her health professions studies within two years following

Sec. 57.215  Records, reports, inspection, and audit.

    (a) Each Federal capital contribution and Federal capital loan is 
subject to the condition that the school must maintain those records and 
file with the Secretary those reports relating to the operation of its 
health professions student loan funds as the Secretary may find 
necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act and these regualtions. A 
school must submit required reports to the Secretary within 45 days of 
the close of the reporting period.
    (1) A school which fails to submit a required report for its Federal 
capital contribution fund within 45 days of the close of the reporting 
period:
    (i) Shall be prohibited from receiving new Federal capital 
contributions;
    (ii) Must place the revolving fund and all subsequent collections in 
an insured interest-bearing account; and
    (iii) May make no loan disbursements.

The above restrictions apply until the Secretary determines that the 
school is in compliance with the reporting requirement.
    (2) A school that fails to submit a complete report within 6 months 
of the close of the reporting period will be subject to termination. The 
Secretary will provide the school with a written notice specifying his 
or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program 
and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt 
of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it 
must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, 
factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a 
hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing 
will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will 
deny a hearing if:
    (i) The request for a hearing is untimely (i.e., fails to meet the 
30-day requirement);
    (ii) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual 
issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or

[[Page 283]]

    (iii) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or 
inconsequential.

In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will 
send a written denial to the school setting forth the reasons for 
denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, 
termination is still determined to be necessary, the school will be 
terminated from participation in the program and will be required to 
return the Federal share of the revolving fund to the Department. A 
school terminated for failure to submit a complete report within 6 
months of the close of the reporting period must continue to pursue 
collections and may reapply for participation in the program once it has 
submitted the overdue report.
    (3) The school must also comply with the requirements of 45 CFR part 
74 and section 798(e) of the Act concerning recordkeeping, audit, and 
inspection.
    (b) The following student records must be retained by the school for 
5 years after an individual student ceases to be a full-time student:
    (1) Approved student applications for health professions student 
loans;
    (2) Documentation of the financial need of applicants; and
    (3) Copy of financial aid transcript(s).
    (c) The following repayment records for each individual borrower 
must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of retirement of a 
loan:
    (1) The amount and date of each loan;
    (2) The amount and date of each payment or cancellation;
    (3) Records of periods of deferment;
    (4) Date, nature and result of each contact with the borrower or 
proper endorser in the collection of an overdue loan;
    (5) Copies of all correspondence to or from the borrower and 
endorser;
    (6) Copies of all correspondence with collection agents related to 
the individual borrower;
    (7) Copies of all correspondence with a credit bureau related to an 
individual borrower; and
    (8) Copies of all correspondence relating to uncollectible loans 
which have been written off by the Federal Government or repaid by the 
school.
    (d) The school must also retain other records as the Secretary may 
prescribe. In all cases where questions have arisen as a result of a 
Federal audit, the records must be retained until resolution of all 
questions.
    (e) Institutional officials who have information which indicates the 
potential or actual commission of fraud or other offenses against the 
United States, involving these loan funds, should promptly provide this 
information to the appropriate Regional Office of Inspector General for 
Investigations.

Sec. 57.216a  Performance standard.

    On June 30, 1984, and on each June 30 thereafter, except as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section, each school must have a default rate 
(as calculated under paragraph (a) of this section) of not more than 5 
percent.
    (a) The default rate for each school shall be the ratio (stated as a 
percentage) that the defaulted principal amount outstanding of the 
school bears to the matured loans of the school. For this purpose:
    (1) The term defaulted principal amount outstanding means the total 
amount borrowed from the loan fund of a school that has reached the 
repayment stage (minus any principal amount repaid or canceled) on loans 
in default for more than 120 days; and
    (2) The term matured loans means the total principal amount of all 
loans made by a school under this subpart minus the total principal 
amount of loans made by the school to students who are:
    (i) Enrolled in a full-time course of study at the school; or
    (ii) In their grace period.
    (b) Any school that has a default rate greater than 5 percent on 
June 30 of any year will be required to:
    (1) Reduce its default rate by 50 percent (or a school with a 
default rate below 10 percent must reduce its rate to 5 percent) by the 
close of the following 6-month period; and
    (2) By the end of each succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default 
rate to 50 percent of the required rate for the previous 6-month period, 
until it reaches 5 percent.
    (c) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section which fails to comply with those requirements will receive no 
new HPSL funds and will be required to:
    (1) Place the revolving fund monies and all subsequent collections 
into an insured interest-bearing account;
    (2) Make no loan disbursements; and
    (3) By the end of the succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default 
rate to 50 percent of the rate it failed to achieve under paragraph (b) 
of this section, or 5 percent. A school that meets this requirement wil 
be permitted to resume the use of its health professions student loan 
funds, but must continue to comply with the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section if its default rate is still greater than 5 
percent.
    (d) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section which fails to comply with those requirements will be subject to 
termination. The Secretary will provide the school with a written notice 
specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation 
in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days 
of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests 
a hearing, it must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit 
material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause 
for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The 
hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The 
Secretary will deny a hearing if:
    (1) The request for a hearing is untimely (i.e., fails to meet the 
30-day requirement);
    (2) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual 
issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or
    (3) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or 
inconsequential.

In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will 
send a written denial to the school setting forth the reasons for 
denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, 
termination is still determined to be necessary, the school will be 
terminated from participation in the program and will be required to 
return the Federal share of the revolving fund to the Department. A 
school terminated for failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section must continue to pursue collections and may 
reapply for participation

in the program only when it has attained a default rate of 5 percent or 
less.

withhold further payment of Federal capital contributions, and take such 
other action, including the termination of any agreement, as he or she

<R05>
Sec. 57.304  Payment of Federal capital contributions and reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary.

    (a) Annual payment. The Secretary will make payments at a time 
determined by him or her, to each school with which he or she has 
entered into an agreement under the Act.
    (1) For any fiscal year for which ``set-aside'' funds are available, 
the Secretary will first make payments in the manner described in (a)(2) 
of this section of not less than $1,000,000 of the amount of Federal 
funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available 
for making loans under this subpart. These funds will be paid to schools 
submitting an application for ``set-aside'' funds to be used only for 
the purpose of making loans to individuals qualified to receive loans 
under this subpart who, on the date they receive the loan, have not been 
employed on a full-time basis or been enrolled in any educational 
institution on a full-time basis for at least 7 years. An individual may 
not receive a loan under this subparagraph that exceeds $500 for any 
academic year.
    (2) If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal year by all 
schools for Federal capital contributions minus the amount received 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds the amount of Federal 
funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available 
for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to 
whichever is smaller: (i) The amount requested in the application, or 
(ii) an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of Federal 
funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available 
for that fiscal year for the Nursing Student Loan program as the number 
of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that 
school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in all 
participating schools during that year.
    (3) Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be 
distributed in accordance with this paragraph among schools whose 
applications requested more than the amount paid to them, but with 
whatever adjustments that may be necessary to prevent the total paid to 
any school from exceeding the total requested by it.
    (b) Method of payment. The payment of Federal capital contributions 
to a school will be paid in a manner that avoids unnecessary 
accumulations of money in any nursing student loan fund.
    (c) Reallocation of funds remitted to the Secretary. (1) All funds 
from a student loan fund established under this subpart which are 
remitted to the Secretary in any fiscal year shall be available for 
allotment under this subpart, in the same fiscal year and the succeeding 
fiscal year, to eligible nursing schools. In making these allotments, 
the Secretary shall give priority to nursing schools which established a 
student loan fund under this subpart after September 30, 1975. The 
Secretary will make payments to eligible schools at a time determined by 
him or her, according to the procedures indicated in paragraphs (c)(2) 
and (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Eligible schools which established a nursing student loan fund 
after September 30, 1975. The Secretary will make awards first to those 
eligible schools that established a nursing student loan fund after 
September 30, 1975. If the total of the amounts requested for any fiscal 
year by these schools exceeds the amount of funds determined by the 
Secretary at the time of payment to be available for this purpose, the 
payment to each school will be reduced to whichever is smaller:
    (i) The amount requested in the application, or
    (ii) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of 
returned

[[Page 288]]

funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available 
for that fiscal year for the Nursing Student Loan program as the number 
of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be enrolled in that 
school bears to the estimated total number of full-time students in 
these eligible schools during that year.

Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in 
accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications 
requested more than the amount paid to them, with whatever adjustments 
may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any school from exceeding 
the total requested by it.
    (3) Eligible schools which established a nursing student loan fund 
prior to October 1, 1975. If there are funds remaining after making 
awards as specified by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary 
will make awards to eligible schools which established a nursing student 
loan fund prior to October 1, 1975. If the total of the amounts 
requested for any fiscal year by these schools exceeds the amount of 
funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be available 
for this purpose, the payment to each school will be reduced to 
whichever is smaller:
    (i) The amount requested in the application, or
    (ii) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of 
returned funds determined by the Secretary at the time of payment to be 
available for that fiscal year for the Nursing Student Loan program as 
the number of full-time students estimated by the Secretary to be 
enrolled in that school bears to the estimated total number of full-time 
students in these eligible schools during that year.

Amounts remaining after these payments are made will be distributed in 
accordance with this paragraph among schools whose applications 
requested more than the amount paid to them, with whatever adjustments 
may be necessary to prevent the total paid to any school from exceeding 
the total requested by it.

Sec. 57.305  Nursing student loan funds.

    (a) Funds established with Federal capital contributions. Any fund 
established by a school with Federal capital contributions will be 
accounted for separately from other funds, providing a clear audit trail 
for all transactions. At all times the fund must contain monies 
representing the institutional capital contribution. The school must at 
all times maintain all monies relating to the fund in one or more 
interest-bearing accounts or investment instruments which meet OMB 
requirements established for Federal monies held by third parties, 
except that if the school documents that the costs associated with the 
use of an interest-bearing account would exceed expected earnings, the 
school is not required to maintain these monies in an interest-bearing 
account. The school must place all earnings into the fund but may first 
deduct from total earnings any reasonable and customary charges incurred 
through the use of an interest-bearing account. An institution shall 
exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary with regard to these 
deposits and investments, and shall be responsible for reimbursing the 
fund for any losses that occur due to the use of investments that are 
not federally insured.
    (1) The Federal capital contribution fund is to be used by the 
school only for:
    (i) Nursing student loans to full-time or half-time students;
    (ii) Capital distribution as provided in section 839 of the Act or 
as agreed to by the school and the Secretary; and
    (iii) Costs of litigation, costs associated with membership in 
credit bureaus, and to the extent specifically approved by the 
Secretary, other collection costs that exceed the usual expenses 
incurred in the collection of nursing student loans.
    (2) A school must review the balance in the fund on at least a semi-
annual basis to determine whether the fund balance compared with 
projected levels of expenditures and collections exceeds its needs. A 
school in closing status must review the balance in the fund on a 
quarterly basis. Monies identified as in excess of the school's needs 
must be reported, and the Federal share returned to the Federal 
Government, by

[[Page 289]]

the due date of the required report which identifies the excess monies. 
The school's determination is subject to the review and approval of the 
Secretary.
    (b) Funds established with Federal capital loans. (1) Each Federal 
capital loan is subject to the terms of the promissory note executed by 
an authorized official on behalf of the borrowing school.
    (2) The Federal capital loans must be carried in a special account 
of the school, to be used by the school only for: (i) Repayments of 
principal and interest on Federal capital loans; and (ii) costs of 
litigation, costs associated with membership in credit bureaus, and, to 
the extent specifically approved by the Secretary, other collection 
costs that exceed the usual expenses incurred in the collection of 
nursing student loans.
    (c) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will 
subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of Sec. 57.318 and the 
Department's Claims Collections regulations (45 CFR part 30), as 
appropriate.

consideration for a nursing student loan if they are:
    (i) Residents of the United States and either a citizen or national 
of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
in the United States, a citizen of the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, a citizen of the Republic of Palau, a citizen of the 
Republic of the Marshall Islands, or a citizen of the Federated States 
of Micronesia;
    (ii) Enrolled, or accepted for enrollment in the school as full-time 
or half-time students;
    (iii) In need of the amount of the loan to pursue the course of 
study at the school; and
    (iv) Capable, in the opinion of the school, of maintaining good 
standing in the course of study.
    (2) An applicant who has previously attended an institution of 
higher education must submit a financial aid transcript which includes 
at least the following data:
    (i) Applicant's name and social security number;
    (ii) Amounts and sources of loans and grants previously received by 
the applicant for study at an institution of higher education;
    (iii) Whether the applicant is in default on any of these loans, or 
owes a refund on any grants;
    (iv) Certification from each institution previously attended by the 
applicant that the applicant has received no financial aid, if 
applicable; and
    (v) From each institution previously attended, the signature of an 
official authorized by the institution to sign such transcripts on 
behalf of the institution.
    (b) Selection of nursing student loan applicants and determinations 
of need. The school will select qualified applicants, make reasonable 
determinations of need, and determine the amount of student loans.
    (1) In selecting nursing student loan applicants the school will 
give preference to licensed practical nurses, and to persons with 
exceptional financial need. For purposes of this preference, a student 
will be considered to demonstrate exceptional financial need if the 
school determines that the student's resources, as described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, do not exceed one-half of the costs 
of attendance at the school. Summer earnings, educational loans, 
veterans (G.I.) benefits, earnings during the school year, and Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) will not be considered as 
resources in determining whether an applicant meets these criteria for 
exceptional financial need, but will be considered in determining the 
amount of funds a student may receive.
    (2) In determining whether a student is in need of a nursing student 
loan to pursue a full-time or half-time course of study at the school, 
the school will take into consideration:
    (i) The financial resources available to the student by using one of 
the national need analysis systems or any

[[Page 290]]

other procedure approved by the Secretary of Education in combination 
with other information which the school has regarding the student's 
financial status; and
    (ii) The costs reasonably necessary for the student's attendance at 
the school, including any special needs and obligations which directly 
affect the student's financial ability to attend the school on a full-
time or half-time basis. The school must document the criteria used for 
determining these costs.
    (c) Verification of loan information. The school must verify, to the 
best of its ability, the information provided by the student on the loan 
application. To comply with this requirement, a school may require that 
a student provide, for example: Photocopies of the parents', student's, 
and spouse's Federal income tax forms with original signatures for the 
most recent tax year (or certification that no Federal income tax return 
was filed); tax returns that are certified as having been received by 
the Internal Revenue Service; or other documentation that the school 
considers necessary to help assure that information on the loan 
application is correct.

    The total of the nursing student loans made from the fund to any 
student for an academic year may not exceed $2,500, except that for each 
of the final 2 academic years of the program, the total must not exceed 
$4,000. The maximum amount loaned during a 12-month period to any 
student enrolled in a school which provides a course of study longer 
than the 9-month academic year may be proportionately increased. The 
total of all nursing student loans to any student must not exceed 
$13,000.

Sec. 57.308  Nursing student loan promissory note.

    (a) Promissory note form. Each nursing student loan must be 
evidenced by a properly executed promissory note in a form approved by 
the Secretary. The school must safeguard the promissory note against 
fire, theft, and tampering.
    (1) Each promissory note must state that the loan will bear interest 
on the unpaid balance computed only for periods during which repayment 
of the loan is required, at the rate of 5 percent per year.
    (2) Each promissory note must contain an acceleration clause 
provided by the Secretary, which will permit the acceleration of 
delinquent loans at the school's option.
    (3) A copy of each executed note must be supplied by the school to 
the student borrower.
    (b) Security. A school must require security or endorsement if the 
borrower is a minor and if, under the applicable State law, the note 
signed by him or her would not create a binding obligation. The school 
may not require security or endorsement in any other circumstances.

Sec. 57.309  Payment of nursing student loans.

    (a) Nursing student loans from any fund may be paid to or on behalf 
of student borrowers in installments considered appropriate by the 
school except that a school may not pay to or on behalf of any borrower 
more during any given installment period (e.g., semester, term, or 
quarter) than the school determines the student needs for that period.
    (b) No payment may be made from a fund to or on behalf of any 
student borrower if at the time of the payment the borrower is not a 
full-time or half-time student.

[[Page 291]]


<R05>
Sec. 57.310  Repayment and collection of nursing student loans.

    (a) Each nursing student loan, including accrued interest, will be 
repayable in equal or graduated periodic installments in amounts 
calculated on the basis of a 10-year repayment period. Repayment of a 
loan must begin 9 months after the student ceases to be a full-time or 
half-time student, except that if a borrower reenters the same or 
another school as a full-time or half-time student within the 9-month 
period, the date upon which interest will accrue and the repayment 
period will begin will be determined by the date upon which the student 
last ceases to be a full-time or half-time student at that school.
    (1) The following periods will be excluded from the 10-year 
repayment period: (i) All periods up to a total of 3 years of active 
duty performed by the borrower as a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, 
Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Corps or the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned 
Corps;
    (ii) All periods up to a total of 3 years of service as a volunteer 
under the Peace Corps Act; and
    (iii) All periods up to a total of 10 years during which the 
borrower is pursuing a full-time or half-time course of study at a 
school leading to a baccalaureate degree in nursing or an equivalent 
degree, or to a graduate degree in nursing, or is otherwise pursuing 
advanced professional training in nursing (or training to be a nurse 
anesthetist). For purposes of this paragraph, ``otherwise pursuing 
advanced professional training in nursing'' shall include full-time or 
half-time training, beyond the first diploma or degree in nursing 
received by the particular borrower, of at least 1 academic year which 
will advance the borrower's knowledge of and strengthen his or her 
skills in the provision of nursing services.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Individuals who received nursing student loans prior to July 1, 
1969, remain subject to the repayment provisions of 42 CFR 
57.314(a)(3)(1976) as adopted on February 4, 1974. These provisions can 
be found at 39 FR 16473 (May 9, 1974), and a copy can be obtained by 
writing the Division of Student Assistance, Bureau of Health 
Professions, 5600 Fishers Lane, Parklawn Building, room 8-34, Rockville, 
MD 20857.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a 
borrower must establish a repayment schedule with the school providing 
for payments not less often than quarterly. Any borrower whose repayment 
becomes more than 60 days past due must be placed on a monthly repayment 
schedule by the school. A borrower may at his or her option and without 
penalty, prepay all or part of the principal and accrued interest at any 
time.
    (3) A school may grant forbearance whenever extraordinary 
circumstances such as unemployment, poor health or other personal 
problems temporarily affect the borrower's ability to make scheduled 
loan repayments.
    (b) Collection of nursing student loans. (1) Each school at which a 
fund is established must exercise due diligence in the collection of 
nursing student loans due the fund. In the exercise of due diligence, a 
school must follow procedures which are at least as extensive and 
effective as those used in the collection of other student loan accounts 
due the school, and must use the steps outlined below in accordance with 
collection practices which are generally accepted among institutions of 
higher education:
    (i) Conduct and document an entrance interview (individually or in 
groups) with the borrower prior to disbursing NSL funds in any academic 
year. During the entrance interview the school must obtain documentation 
which indicates that the borrower is aware of the rights and 
responsibilities associated with NSL funds and personal information 
which would assist in locating the borrower if he or she fails to keep 
the school informed of his or her current address. The requirement of 
this subparagraph may be met by correspondence if the school determines 
that a face-to-face meeting (individually or in groups) is 
impracticable.
    (ii) Conduct and document an exit interview (individually or in 
groups) with the borrower. During the exit interview, the school must 
provide

[[Page 292]]

each borrower with information necessary to carry out the terms of 
repayment, remind the borrower of the rights and responsibilities 
associated with NSL funds, and update the personal information collected 
prior to disbursing NSL funds which would assist in locating the 
borrower if he or she fails to keep the school informed of his or her 
current address. If the borrower terminates studies without advance 
notice, the school must document attempts to inform the borrower of the 
substance of the exit interview and to secure exit interview information 
from the borrower by mail.
    (iii) Notify the borrower in writing of the impending repayment 
obligation at least twice during the grace period;
    (iv) Notify a borrower who is in deferment status in writing of the 
impending repayment obligation 1 to 3 months prior to the expiration of 
the approved period of deferment;
    (v) Perform regular billing;
    (vi) Follow up past due payments with a series of at least four 
documented and reasonably spaced attempts to contact the borrower, at 
least three of which must be in writing at not more than 30-day 
intervals, prior to the loan becoming 120 days past due, provided that 
the school has a current address for the borrower;
    (vii) Perform address searches when necessary;
    (viii) Use collection agents, which may include the use of an 
internal collection agent;
    (ix) Institute legal proceedings against borrowers after all other 
attempts at collection have failed, unless the school determines, 
subject to the approval of the Secretary, that such litigation would not 
be cost-effective; and
    (x) Become a member of a credit bureau and notify the credit bureau 
of accounts past due by more than 120 days.

In place of one or more of the procedures outlined above schools may 
substitute collection techniques that are equally or more effective, but 
only after they have demonstrated the effectiveness of the techniques 
and obtained written approval from the Secretary.
    (2) Late charge. (i) For any nursing student loan made after June 
30, 1969, but prior to October 1, 1985, the school may fix a charge for 
failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when it 
is due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment under 
section 836(b)(2) of the Act, or cancellation or repayment under section 
836(b)(3) of the Act, for any failure to file timely and satisfactory 
evidence of the entitlement. The amount of the charge may not exceed $1 
for the first month or part of a month by which the installment or 
evidence is late and $2 for each succeeding month or part of a month. 
The school may elect to add the amount of this charge to the principal 
amount of the loan as of the day after the day on which the installment 
or evidence was due, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the 
school no later than the due date of the next installment following 
receipt of the notice of the charge by the borrower.
    (ii) For any nursing student loan made on or after October 1, 1985, 
the school shall assess a charge for failure of the borrower to pay all 
or any part of an installment when the loan is more than 60 days past 
due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment under 
section 836(b)(2) of the Act, for any failure to file satisfactory 
evidence of the entitlement within 60 days of the date payment would 
otherwise be due. No charge may be made if the loan is less than 61 days 
past due. The amount of this charge may not exceed an amount equal to 6 
percent of the amount due at the time the charge is calculated. The 
school may elect to add the amount of this charge to the principal 
amount of the loan as of the day on which the charge is calculated, or 
to make the amount of the charge payable to the school no later than the 
due date of the next installment following receipt of the notice of the 
charge by the borrower.
    (3) With respect to any nursing student loan made after June 30, 
1969, the school may require the borrower to make payments of at least 
$15 per month on all outstanding nursing student loans during the 
repayment period.
    (4) A school must, on an annual basis, review and assess the 
collectibility of any loan more than 3 years past due. If

[[Page 293]]

the school determines that the prospects of future collection are 
promising enough to justify periodic review of the debt, and neither the 
statute of limitations nor the 10-year repayment period has expired, the 
school may retain the account for continued collections, provided that 
it makes an attempt at least semi-annually to collect from the borrower. 
When the due diligence procedures required by paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section have been exhausted, the school is responsible for determining 
the collection methods it will use for the semi-annual collection effort 
required on these loans. If the school determines that the prospects of 
future collection are not promising, or when the statute of limitations 
or the 10-year repayment period has expired, the loan must be considered 
uncollectible. A school may determine a loan to be uncollectible sooner 
than 3 years past due when it has evidence that the loan cannot be 
collected, but in no case should a school consider a loan as 
uncollectible if it has not been in default for at least 120 days. A 
school is not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) and 
(iii) of this section for loans that became uncollectible, as determined 
by the school, before January 1, 1983.
    (i) A school must request permission to write off an uncollectible 
loan within 30 days of the determination that it is uncollectible or 
reimburse the fund in the full amount of the loan, pursuant to 
Sec. 57.310(b)(4)(iii). The 30-day period for submitting the loan for 
write-off review begins on the date that the determination of 
uncollectibility is made, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section. In any instance where the Secretary determines that a school 
has failed to exercise due diligence in the collection of a loan, in 
accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, the school will 
be required to place in the fund the full amount of principal, interest, 
and penalty charges that remains uncollected on the loan. Reimbursement 
must be made by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is 
sooner, except that in no case will a school be required to reimburse 
the fund in less than 30 days following the Secretary's disapproval of 
the request for write-off approval.
    (ii) If the Secretary determines that a school has exercised due 
diligence in the collection of a loan, in accordance with the applicable 
regulatory requirements, or if the school determines that the loan was 
uncollectible prior to January 1, 1983, the school will be permitted to 
reduce its accounts receivable for the NSL fund by the full amount of 
principal, interest, and penalty charges that remains uncollected on 
that loan and will not be required to return the Federal share of the 
loss to the Secretary.
    (iii) If a school does not request permission to write off an 
uncollectible loan within the required timeframe, it must reimburse the 
fund for the full amount of principal, interest, and penalty charges 
that remains uncollected on that loan. This reimbursement must be made 
by the following June 30 or December 31, whichever is sooner, except 
that in no case will a school be required to reimburse the fund in less 
than 30 days following its determination that a loan is uncollectible.
    (iv) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will 
subject a school to the noncompliance provisions of Sec. 57.318 and the 
Department's Claims Collection regulations (45 CFR part 30), as 
appropriate.
    (5) Disclosure of taxpayer identity information. Upon written 
request by the Secretary, the Secretary of the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) may disclose the address of any taxpayer who has defaulted on a 
nursing student loan, for use only by officers, employees, or agents of 
the Department, to locate the defaulted borrower to collect the loan. 
Any such mailing address may be disclosed by the Secretary to any school 
from which the defaulted borrower received a nursing student loan, for 
use only by officers, employees, or agents of the school whose duties 
relate to the collection of nursing student loan funds, to locate the 
defaulted borrower to collect the loan. Any school which requests and 
obtains such address information must comply with the requirements of 
the Secretary and the

IRS regarding the safeguarding and proper handling of this information.

Sec. 57.311  Cancellation of nursing student loans for disability or death.

    (a) Permanent and total disability. The Secretary will cancel a 
borrower's indebtedness in accordance with section 836(b)(4) of the Act 
if the borrower is found to be permanently and totally disabled on 
recommendation of the school and as supported by whatever medical 
certification the Secretary may require. A borrower is totally and 
permanently disabled if he or she is unable to engage in any substantial 
gainful activity because of a medically determinable impairment, which 
the Secretary expects to continue for a long time or to result in death.
    (b) Death. The Secretary will cancel a borrower's indebtedness in 
accordance with section 836(b)(4) of the Act upon the death of the 
borrower. The school to which the borrower was indebted must secure a 
certification of death or whatever official proof is conclusive under 
State law.

Sec. 57.312  Repayment of loans for service in a shortage area.

    (a) Service in a shortage area. Subject to the availability of 
funds, a person who:
    (1) Has obtained a degree as specified in section 846(a)(1) of the 
Act;
    (2) Has obtained one or more nursing student loans or any other 
loans necessary for costs (including tuition, books, fees, equipment, 
living and other expenses which the Secretary determines were necessary) 
of attending a school of nursing; and
    (3) Enters into an agreement with the Secretary to serve as a full-
time registered nurse for a period of not less than 2 years in an Indian 
Health Service health center, a Native Hawaiian health center, a public 
hospital, a migrant health center, a community health center, a nursing 
facility, a rural health clinic, or in a health facility determined by 
the Secretary to have a critical shortage of nurses, will have a portion 
of these loans repaid by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section. Prior to entering an agreement for repayment of loans, 
other than nursing student loans, the Secretary will require that 
satisfactory evidence be provided of the existence and reasonableness of 
the education loans (i.e., a copy of the written loan agreement 
establishing the loan).
    (b) When entering into agreements under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Secretary shall give priority to:
    (1) Applicants with the greatest financial need; and
    (2) Applicants that, with respect to health facilities described in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, agree to serve in such facilities 
located in geographic areas with a shortage of and need for nurses, as 
determined by the Secretary.
    (3) In addition to the priorities under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) 
of this section, should specific needs warrant, the Secretary may 
establish additional preferences which will be announced from time to 
time in the Federal Register.
    (c) Repayment. Loan repayment will be made by the Secretary to 
persons who meet the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section. Payment will be as follows:
    (1) Upon completion by the borrower of the first year of service as 
specified in the agreement, the Secretary will pay 30 percent of the 
principal of, and the interest on, each loan which was unpaid as of the 
date the borrower began his or her service;
    (2) Upon completion by the borrower of the second year of service, 
the Secretary will pay another 30 percent of the principal of, and the 
interest on, each loan which was unpaid as of the date the borrower 
began his or her service;
    (3) Upon completion by the borrower of a third year of service, the 
Secretary will pay another 25 percent of the principal of, and the 
interest on, each loan

[[Page 295]]

which was unpaid as of the date the borrower began his or her service; 
and
    (4) No more than 85 percent of the principal of any loan will be 
paid under this section.

Sec. 57.313  Loan cancellation for full-time employment as a registered nurse.

    (a) For loans made after November 18, 1971, and before September 29, 
1979. A person who: (1) Received one or more nursing student loans after 
November 18, 1971, and before September 29, 1979; (2) is in compliance 
with the requirements of title VIII of the Act and these regulations; 
and (3) engages in full-time employment as a registered nurse (including 
teaching in any of the fields of nurse training or service as an 
administrator, supervisor, or consultant in any of the fields of 
nursing) in any public or nonprofit private agency, institution, or 
organization (including neighborhood health centers) is entitled to have 
a portion of these nursing student loans canceled as follows: 15 percent 
of the total amount of the loans plus accrued interest on the loan which 
is unpaid on the first day of his or her service, for each of the first, 
second, and third year of service; and 20 percent of the total amount of 
the loan plus accrued interest on the loan for each complete fourth and 
fifth year of service thereafter, up to 85 percent of the total of the 
loans, plus accrued interest.
    (b) Continuation of provisions for cancellation of loans made prior 
to November 18, 1971. A person who received one or more nursing student 
loans prior to November 18, 1971, may still receive cancellation of 
these loans for service under section 836(h) of the Act. The regulations 
set forth in 42 CFR 57.316 (a) and (b)(6) (1976), as adopted on February 
4, 1974, remain applicable to cancellation on this basis. The provisions 
can be found at 39 FR 16473 (May 9, 1974) and a copy can be obtained by 
writing to the Division of Student Assistance, Bureau of Health 
Professions, Room 8-34, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,

Sec. 57.313a  Loan cancellation reimbursement.

    In the event that insufficient funds are available to the Secretary 
in any fiscal year to enable him or her to pay to all schools their 
proportionate shares of all loans and interest canceled under this 
subpart for full-time employment as a nurse, death, or disability:
    (a) Each school will be paid an amount bearing the same ratio to the 
total of the funds available for that purpose as the principal of loans 
canceled by that school in that fiscal year bears to the total principal 
of loans canceled by all schools in that year; and
    (b) Any additional amounts to which a school is entitled will be 
paid by the Secretary at the time of distribution of the assets of the 
school's fund under section 839 of the Act.

Sec. 57.314  Repayment of loans made after November 17, 1971, for failure to complete a program of study. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Effective November 26, 1984, the Secretary stopped accepting 
applications under Sec. 57.314 because Federal funds are not available 
for this provision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the event that the Secretary undertakes to repay educational 
loans under section 836(i) of the Act, he or she will use the following 
criteria to make a determination as to each applicant's eligibility:
    (a) An applicant will be considered to have failed to complete the 
course of study in nursing for which an eligible education loan was made 
upon certification by a school of nursing that the individual ceased to 
be enrolled in the school subsequent to November 17, 1971;

[[Page 296]]

    (b) An applicant will be considered to be in exceptionally needy 
circumstances if, upon comparison of the income and other financial 
resources of the applicant with his or her expenses and financial 
obligations, the Secretary determines that repayment of the loan would 
constitute a serious economic burden on the applicant. In making this 
determination, the Secretary will take into consideration the 
applicant's net financial assets, his or her potential earning capacity, 
and the relationship of the income available to the applicant to the 
low-income levels published annually by the Secretary in the Federal 
Register;
    (c) An applicant will be considered as not having resumed his or her 
nursing studies within 2 years following the date the individual ceased 
to be a student upon certification so stating from the applicant; and
    (d) An applicant will be considered as not reasonably expected to 
resume his or her nursing studies within 2 years following the date upon 
which he or she terminated these studies, based upon consideration of 
the reasons for the applicant's failure to complete these studies, 
taking into account such factors as academic, medical, or financial

Sec. 57.315  Records, reports, inspection, and audit.

    (a) Records and reports. (1) Each Federal capital contribution and 
Federal capital loan is subject to the condition that the school must 
maintain those records and file with the Secretary those reports 
relating to the operation of its nursing student loan funds as the 
Secretary may find necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act and 
these regulations. A school must submit required reports to the 
Secretary within 45 days of the close of the reporting period.
    (i) A school which fails to submit a required report for its Federal 
capital contribution fund within 45 days of the close of the reporting 
period:
    (A) Shall be prohibited from receiving new Federal capital 
contributions;
    (B) Must place the revolving fund and all subsequent collections in 
an insured interest-bearing account; and
    (C) May make no loan disbursements.

The above restrictions apply until the Secretary determines that the 
school is in compliance with the reporting requirement.
    (ii) A school that fails to submit a complete report within 6 months 
of the close of the reporting period will be subject to termination. The 
Secretary will provide the school with a written notice specifying his 
or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program 
and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt 
of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it 
must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, 
factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a 
hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing 
will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will 
deny a hearing if:
    (A) The request for a hearing is untimely (ie., fails to meet the 
30-day requirement);
    (B) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual 
issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or
    (C) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or 
inconsequential.

In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will 
send a written denial to the school setting forth the reasons for 
denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, 
termination is still determined to be necessary, the school will be 
terminated from participation in the program and will be required to 
return the Federal share of the revolving fund to the Department. A 
school terminated for failure to submit a complete report within 6 
months of the close of the reporting period must continue to pursue 
collections and may reapply for participation in the program once it has 
submitted the overdue report.
    (2) The following student records must be retained by the school for 
5

[[Page 297]]

years after the individual student ceases to be a full-time or half-time 
student:
    (i) Approved student applications for nursing student loans;
    (ii) Documentation of the financial need of applicants; and
    (iii) Copy of financial aid transcripts.
    (3) The following repayment records for each individual borrower 
must be retained for at least 5 years from the date of retirement of a 
loan:
    (i) The amount and date of each loan;
    (ii) The amount and date of each payment or cancellation;
    (iii) Records of periods of deferment;
    (iv) Date, nature, and result of each contract with the borrower or 
proper endorser in the collection of an overdue loan;
    (v) Copies of all correspondence to or from the borrower and 
endorser;
    (vi) Copies of all correspondence with a collection agency related 
to the individual borrower;
    (vii) Copies of all correspondence with a credit bureau related to 
an individual borrower; and
    (viii) Copies of all correspondence relating to uncollectible loans 
which have been written off by the Federal Government or repaid by the 
school.
    (4) The school must also retain other records as the Secretary may 
prescribe. In all cases where questions have arisen as a result of a 
Federal audit, the records must be retained until resolution of all 
questions.
    (b) Inspection and audit. (1) Any application for a Federal capital 
contribution will constitute the consent of the applicant school to 
inspection and fiscal audit, by the Secretary and the Comptroller 
General of the United States or any of their duly authorized 
representatives, of the fiscal and other records of the applicant school 
which relate to the Federal capital contribution or Federal capital 
loan.
    (2) The school must comply with the audit requirements of the 
Department of Health and Human Services' Administration of Grants 
regulations which are set forth in 45 CFR part 74.
    (c) Institutional officials who have information which indicates the 
potential or actual commission of fraud or other offenses against the 
United States, involving these loan funds, should promptly provide this 
information to the appropriate Regional Office of Inspector General for 
Investigations.

<R05>
Sec. 57.316a  Performance standard.

    On June 30, 1986, and on each June 30 thereafter, except as provided 
in paragraph (b) of this section, each school must have a default rate 
(as calculated under paragraph (a) of this section) of not more than 5 
percent.
    (a) The default rate for each school shall be the ratio (stated as a 
percentage) that the defaulted principal amount outstanding of the 
school bears to the matured loans of the school. For this purpose:

[[Page 298]]

    (1) The term ``defaulted principal amount outstanding'' means the 
total amount borrowed from the loan fund of a school that has reached 
the repayment stage (minus any principal amount repaid or canceled) on 
loans in default for more than 120 days; and
    (2) The term ``matured loans'' means the total principal amount of 
all loans made by a school under this subpart minus the total principal 
amount of loans made by the school to students who are:
    (i) Enrolled in a full-time or half-time course of study at the 
school; or
    (ii) In their grace period.
    (b) Any school that has a default rate greater than 5 percent on 
June 30, 1986, or on June 30 of any year thereafter will be required to:
    (1) Reduce its default rate by 50 percent (or a school with a 
default rate below 10 percent must reduce its rate to 5 percent) by the 
close of the following 6-month period; and
    (2) By the end of each succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default 
rate to 50 percent of the required rate for the previous 6-month period, 
until it reaches 5 percent.
    (c) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section which fails to comply with those requirements will receive no 
new NSL funds and will be required to:
    (1) Place the revolving fund monies and all subsequent collections 
into an insured interest-bearing account;
    (2) Make no loan disbursements; and
    (3) By the end of the succeeding 6-month period, reduce its default 
rate to 50 percent of the rate it failed to achieve under paragraph(b) 
of this section, or 5 percent. A school that meets this requirement will 
be permitted to resume the use of its nursing student loan funds, but 
must continue to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section if its default rate is still greater than 5 percent.

A school that meets the requirements of subparagraph (c)(3) of this 
section will be permitted to resume the use of its NSL funds, but must 
continue to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (b)(2) of this 
section if its delinquency rate is still greater than 5 percent.
    (d) Any school subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section which fails to comply with those requirements will be subject to 
termination. The Secretary will provide the school with a written notice 
specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation 
in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days 
of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests 
a hearing, it must within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit 
material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause 
for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The 
hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The 
Secretary will deny a hearing if:
    (1) The request for a hearing is untimely (i.e., fails to meet the 
30-day requirement);
    (2) The school does not provide a statement of material, factual 
issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or
    (3) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or 
inconsequential.

In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will 
send a written denial to the school setting forth the reasons for 
denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, 
termination is still determined to be necessary, the school will be 
terminated from participation in the program and will be required to 
return the Federal share of the revolving fund to the Department. A 
school terminated for failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section must continue to pursue collections and may 
reapply for participation in the program only when it has attained a 
default rate of 5 percent or less.

Sec. 57.317  Additional conditions.

    The Secretary may, with respect to any agreement entered into with

assure or protect advancement of the purposes of the agreement, the 
interest of the public health, or the conservation of funds awarded.


<R05>
Sec. 57.318  Noncompliance.

    Whenever the Secretary finds that a participating school has failed 
to comply with the applicable provisions of the Act or the regulations 
of this subpart he or she may, on reasonable notice to the school, 
withhold further payments of Federal capital contributions and take 
other action, including the termination of any agreement, as he or she 
finds necessary to enforce the Act and regulations. In such case no 
further expenditures shall be made from the nursing student loan fund or 
funds involved until the Secretary determines that there is no longer 
any failure of compliance.

    If, within 20 years after completion of construction (or, in the 
case of interim facilities prior to the time at which teaching in such 
facilities is moved to a permanent facility, whichever comes first), the 
facility shall cease to be used for any one or more of the purposes for 
which it was constructed, the Secretary, in determining whether there is 
good cause for releasing the applicant or other owner of the facility 
from the obligation so to use the facility, shall take into 
consideration the extent to which:
    (a) The facility will be devoted by the applicant or other owner to 
the teaching of other health personnel;
    (b) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of such 
period other facilities not previously utilized for nurse training will 
be so utilized and are substantially the equivalent in nature and extent 
for such purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 57.504  How will applications be evaluated?

    Within the limits of funds available, the Secretary will award a

<R05>
Sec. 57.505  How long does grant support last?

Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any

                                                                  N     
      G              =              F              x       -------------
                                                                  E     
                                                                        

G represents the amount of grant to be awarded. F represents the amount 
of traineeship funds appropriated to implement section 831(a) in the 
fiscal year in which application is made. E represents the total number 
of full-time students enrolled beyond the twelfth month of study in all 
the approved applicant nurse anesthetist training programs. N represents 
the number of full-time students enrolled beyond the twelfth month of 
study in the applicant nurse anesthetist training program. Should 
special factors for determining the funding of applications be announced 
from time to time in the Federal Register, N will be adjusted upward for 
those applicants meeting the specific criteria as announced. (This 
adjustment will result in the award of additional traineeship funds to 
successful applicants who

[[Page 301]]

meet the criteria of the special factors.)
    (b) Students will be counted as of October 15 of the Federal fiscal 
year in which application is made.


<R05>
Sec. 57.507  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    (a) A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
for traineeships according to Sec. 57.508, the authorizing legislation, 
terms and conditions of the grant award, applicable cost principles 
specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these regulations.
    (b) A grantee may not spend grant funds for sectarian instruction or 
for any religious purpose.
    (c) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of the budget period may be 
carried forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. 
If at any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the 
Secretary that the amount of Federal funds awarded and made available to 
the grantee for that period, including any unobligated balance carried 
forward from prior periods, exceeds the grantee's need for that period, 
the Secretary may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. 
A budget period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which 
the project period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.

Stipends may only be paid to the trainee in monthly installments.
    (c) A transportation allowance for travel to field training if the 
site is beyond a reasonable commuting distance and requires the trainee 
to establish a temporary new residence. However, the grantee may not pay 
an allowance for daily commuting from the new place of residence to the 
field training headquarters.

must include information to document the eligibility of the trainee and 
certify that there will be compliance with all applicable Public Health 
Service terms and conditions governing the appointment. The program 
director must sign the statement on behalf of the grantee, and the 
trainee must sign it thus certifying the statements are true and 
complete. The original copy of the statement must be retained by the 
grantee to be available for program review and financial audit. A copy 
shall be provided to the trainee for his or her records.
    (b) The grantee may not require trainees to perform any work which

required for all students in the program, or to perform services which 
detract from or prolong their training.

    (3) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award shall 
commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional,

progress and management practices, existence of legislative authority, 
and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require 
a determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.

any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee 
for that period, including any unobligated balance carried forward from 
prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary 
may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget 
period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project 
period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.

Sec. 57.1106  What are the criteria for deciding which applications are to be funded?

    As required by section 798(a) of the Act, each application for a

composed principally of non-Federal experts, for an evaluation of the 
merits of the proposals made in the application. The Secretary may not 
approve such an application unless a peer review group has recommended 
the application for approval. The Secretary will approve or disapprove 
applications filed in accordance with Sec. 57.1104, taking into 
consideration, among other pertinent factors:
    (a) The potential effectiveness of the proposed project in carrying 
out the training purposes of section 785 of the Act;
    (b) The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for 
meeting the project requirements set forth in Sec. 57.1105;
    (c) The administrative and managerial capability of the applicant to 
carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective manner;
    (d) The qualifications of proposed staff and faculty;

basis after the period of grant support; and
    (f) The degree to which the proposed project proposes to attract, 
maintain and graduate minority and disadvantaged students.

<R05>
Sec. 57.1107  How will grant awards be made?

    (a) General. (1) Within the limit of funds available, the Secretary 
will award grants to those applicants whose approved projects will, in 
his or her judgment, best promote the purposes of section 749 of the 
Act, as determined in accordance with Sec. 57.1106.
    (2) The notice of grant award specifies the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without

[[Page 311]]

requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the 
project period, will not exceed 3 years.
    (3) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. 
Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding levels of these 
awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's 
progress and management practices, existence of legislative authority, 
and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require 
a determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (4) Neither the approval of any project nor the award of any grant 
shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation or other award with respect to 
any approved project or any portion of an approved project. For 
continuation support, grantees must make separate application at such 
times and in such a form as the Secretary may prescribe.
    (b) Determination of grant amount. The Secretary will determine the 
amount of any award under this subpart on the basis of his or her 
estimate of the sum necessary for the cost (including both direct and 
indirect costs) of the project. In addition, in determining the amount 
of stipend support to be made available for the general practice 
residency program, the amount of any stipend must be limited to that 
portion of the annual amount normally paid to other residents by the 
applicant which the Secretary determines, on the basis of the 
documentation required in the application, cannot reasonably be paid 
from other available funds, including the incomes derived from the 
residents' services. For the advanced educational program in general 
dentistry, stipends for participants (who are postdoctoral students) 
must be paid in accordance with established Public Health Service 
postdoctoral stipend rates.

<R05>
Sec. 57.1108  How will grant payments be made?

    The Secretary will, from time to time, make payments to a grantee of 
all or a portion of any grant award, either in advance or by way of 
reimbursement.

[43 FR 54931, Nov. 24, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 57.1109  Purposes for which grant funds may be spent.

    (a) A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
according to the approved application and budget, the authorizing 
legislation, terms and conditions of the grant award, applicable cost 
principles specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these 
regulations.
    (b) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. If at 
any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee 
for that period, including any unobligated balance carried forward from 
prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary 
may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget 
period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project 
period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.
    (c) Grants funds may not be used for sectarian instruction or for 
any religious purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 57.1505   Approval of applications.

    (a) General. Any application for loan guarantee or interest 
subsidies, or for a combination of both, may be approved by the 
Secretary, after consultation with the Council, only if he makes each of 
the applicable determinations set forth in section 721(c) of the Act. In

    (1) Any such approval shall be subject to compliance by the 
applicant with the applicable provisions set forth in Secs. 57.106,

title assurance in Sec. 57.107(a) the period shall be not less than 20 
years or the term of the guaranteed loan, whichever is longer or in the 
case of interim facilities, the term of the guaranteed loan, and

[[Page 314]]

    (2) Any such application may be approved by the Secretary only if he 
determines:
    (i) That the applicant will have sufficient financial resources to 
enable him to comply with the terms and conditions of the loan;
    (ii) That the applicant has the necessary legal authority to 
finance, construct, and maintain the proposed project, to apply for and 
receive the loan, and to pledge or mortgage any assets or revenues to be 
given as security for such loan;
    (iii) That the loan will be made only with respect to the initial 
permanent financing of the project;
    (iv) That the loan will be secured by a lien against the facilities 
to be constructed or against other security satisfactory to the 
Secretary specified in Sec. 57.2210;
    (v) That the rate of interest on the loan does not exceed such 
percent per annum as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking 
into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private 
market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States; and
    (vi) Such additional determinations as the Secretary finds necessary 
with respect to particular applications in order to protect the 
financial interests of the United States.
    (b) Loan guarantees. In addition to the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section, any application for a loan guarantee may be 
approved by the Secretary only if he determines that the loan with 
respect to which such guarantee is sought would not be available to the 
applicant on reasonable terms and conditions without such guarantee. To 
assist the Secretary in making such determination, each applicant for a 
loan guarantee shall submit statements from at least three non-Federal 
institutions normally engaged in making long-term loans for 
construction, describing whether, and the terms and conditions under 
which, each institution would make a loan to the applicant for the 
project described in the application.

(a) of this section, any application for interest subsidies may be

    (a) Priority in approving applications for loan guarantee and/or

relative need for increased enrollment and the availability of students; 
(2) the relative effectiveness of the project relative to the cost to 
the Federal Government; and (3) the relative ability of the applicant to 
make efficient and productive use of the facility constructed.
    (b) In the case of applications to aid in the construction of new 
schools of medicine, osteopathy, or dentistry, the Secretary shall give 
special consideration to those applications which contain or are 
reasonably supported by assurances that, because of the use that will be 
made by such school of already existing facilities (including Federal 
medical or dental facilities), the school will be able to accelerate the 
date on which it will begin its teaching program.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1507   Limitations applicable to loan guarantee.

    (a) The amount of loan with respect to which a guarantee is made 
under this subpart shall be determined by the Secretary based upon such 
considerations as the availability of funds and the applicant's need 
therefor; Provided, That: (1) Subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, no loan with respect to which a guarantee is made for any 
project under this subpart may be in an amount which, when added to the 
amount of any grant made with respect to such project under part B of 
title VII of the Act or any other law of the United States, or to the 
total of such grants, exceeds 90 percent of the eligible cost of 
construction of such project as determined by the Secretary;
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary 
may in

[[Page 315]]

particular cases guarantee loans in excess of the amount specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section where he determines that, because of 
special circumstances, such additional loan guarantee will further the 
purposes of part B of title VII of the Act. In making such 
determinations, the Secretary will in each case consider the following 
factors:
    (i) The need for the project in the area to be served;
    (ii) The availability of financing for the project on reasonable 
terms and conditions without such additional loan guarantee;
    (iii) Whether the project can be constructed without such additional 
loan guarantee; and
    (iv) Other relevant factors consistent with the purpose of part B of 
title VII of the Act and this subpart.
    (3) In determining the cost of construction of the project there 
shall be excluded from such cost all fees, interest, and other charges 
relating or attributable to the financing of the project except the 
following:
    (i) Reasonable fees attributable to services rendered by legal 
counsel in connection with such loan;
    (ii) With the approval of the Secretary, reasonable fees 
attributable to the services of a financial advisor in assisting the 
applicant in securing the loan and arranging for repayment thereof; and
    (iii) Interest attributable to the interim financing of construction 
of the project prior to the initial permanent financing thereof.
    (b) No loan guarantee under this subpart shall apply to more than 90 
percent of the loss of principal of and interest on such loan incurred 
by the holder of such loan upon default by the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1508   Amount of interest subsidy payments; limitations.

    The length of time for which interest subsidy payments will be made 
under the agreement, the amount of loan with respect to which such 
payments will be made, and the level of such payments shall be 
determined by the Secretary on the basis of the availability of funds 
and his determination of the applicant's need therefor taking into 
consideration his analysis of the present and reasonable projected 
future financial ability of the applicant to repay the principal and 
interest of the loan without jeopardizing the quality of its educational 
program: Provided however, That each such interest subsidy payment shall 
not exceed the amount necessary to reduce by 3 percent per annum the net 
effective interest rate otherwise payable on the loan or the portion 
thereof with respect to which such interest subsidy is paid.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1509   Forms of credit and security instruments.

    Each loan with respect to which a guarantee is made or interest 
subsidies are paid under this subpart shall be evidenced by a credit 
instrument and secured by a security instrument in such forms as may be 
acceptable to the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1510   Security for loans.

    Each loan with respect to which a guarantee is made or interest 
subsidies are paid under this subpart shall be secured in a manner which 
the Secretary finds reasonably sufficient to insure repayment. The 
security may be one or a combination of the following:
    (a) A first mortgage on the facility and site thereof.
    (b) Negotiable stocks or bonds of a quality and value acceptable to 
the Secretary.
    (c) A pledge of unrestricted and unencumbered income from an 
endowment or other trust fund acceptable to the Secretary.
    (d) A pledge of a specified portion of annual general or special 
revenues of the applicant acceptable to the Secretary.
    (e) Such other security as the Secretary may find acceptable in 
specific instances.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1511   Opinion of legal counsel.

    At appropriate stages in the application and approval procedure for 
a loan guarantee or interest subsidy, the applicant shall furnish to the 
Secretary a memorandum or opinion of legal counsel with respect to the 
legality of any proposed note issue, the legal authority of the 
applicant to issue the note

[[Page 316]]

and secure it by the proposed collateral, and the legality of the issue 
upon delivery. ``Legal counsel'' means either a law firm or individual 
lawyer, thoroughly experienced in the long-term financing of 
construction projects, and whose approving opinions have previously been 
accepted by lenders or lending institutions. The legal memorandum or 
opinion to be provided by legal counsel in each case shall be as 
follows:
    (a) A memorandum, submitted with the application for a loan 
guarantee or interest subsidy, stating that the applicant is or will be 
lawfully authorized to finance, construct, and maintain the project, and 
to issue the proposed obligations and to pledge or mortgage the assets 
and/or revenues offered to secure the loan, citing the basis for such 
authority; and
    (b) A final approving opinion, delivered to the Secretary at the 
time of delivery of the evidence of indebtedness to the lender, stating

duly authorized and delivered and that the indebtedness of the applicant 
is valid, binding, and payable in accordance with the terms on which the 
loan guarantee was approved by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1512   Length and maturity of loans.

    The repayment period for loans with respect to which guarantees are 
made or interest subsidies paid under this subpart shall be limited to 
30 years: Provided, That:
    (a) The Secretary may, in particular cases where he determines that 
a repayment period of less than 30 years is more appropriate to an 
applicant's total financial plan, approve such shorter repayment period;
    (b) The Secretary may, in particular cases where he determines that, 
because of unusual circumstances, the applicant would be financially 
unable to amortize the loan over a repayment period of 30 years, approve 
a longer requirement period which shall in no case exceed 40 years; and
    (c) In no case shall a loan repayment period exceed the useful life 
of the facility to be constructed with the assistance of the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1513   Repayment.

    Unless otherwise specifically authorized by the Secretary, each loan 
with respect to which a guarantee is made or interest subsidies are paid 
shall be repayable in substantially level total annual installments of 
principal and interest, sufficient to amortize the loan through the 
final year of the life of the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 57.1514   Loan guarantee and interest subsidy agreements.

    For each application for a loan guarantee or interest subsidy, or 
combination thereof, which is approved by the Secretary under this 
subpart, an offer to guarantee such loan and/or make interest subsidy 
payments with respect thereto will be sent to the applicant, setting 
forth the pertinent terms and conditions for the loan guarantee and/or 
interest subsidy, and will be conditioned upon the fulfillment of such 
terms and conditions. The accepted offer will constitute the loan 
guarantee agreement, the interest subsidy agreement, or the loan 
guarantee and interest subsidy agreement, as the case may be. Each such 
agreement shall include the applicable provisions set forth below:
    (a) Loan guarantee. Each agreement pertaining to a loan guarantee 
shall include the following provisions:
    (1) That the loan guarantee evidenced by the agreement shall be 
incontestable (i) in the hands of the applicant on whose behalf such 
loan guarantee is made except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part

interest on the guaranteed loan, the Secretary shall, upon demand by the 
holder not less than 90 days after receipt by the Secretary of 
notification of such default, pay to such holder 90 percent of the total

Secretary is notified in writing by the holder that such loan has been 
transferred. Pursuant to such written notification of transfer, the 
Secretary will make such interest payments directly to the new holder 
(transferee) of the loan: Provided, however, That it shall be the

interest subsidies are to be paid, the applicant ceases to use the

obligation with respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall 
cease: Provided, however, That where the applicant is continuing to use 
the

[[Page 318]]

facility for purposes eligible for support under part B of title VII of 
the act, the Secretary may make a determination, based upon the health 
manpower needs of the community served by the facility as well as other 
relevant factors, to continue to make interest subsidy payments in 
accord with the agreement.
    (6) Where during the life of the loan with respect to which interest 
subsidies are to be paid, it is determined, after an opportunity for a 
hearing pursuant to 45 CFR part 83, that the Assurance executed by the

subsidies are to be paid, it is determined by the Secretary after an

title, and its implementing regulations, the Secretary's obligation with 
respect to the payment of interest subsidies shall cease: Provided, 
however, That the Secretary shall resume making interest subsidy 
payments if he subsequently determines that the applicant has come into 
compliance with the requirements of title IX of the Education Amendments 
of 1972 and implementing regulations.
    (c) General. In addition to the applicable requirements of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, each agreement, whether 
pertaining to a loan guarantee or interest subsidy or both, shall

    In determining whether there is good cause for waiver of any right

will continue to be devoted by the applicant or other owner to the 
teaching of health professions personnel, or to other purposes in the 
sciences related to health for which funds are available under part B of 
title VII of the act and these regulations;

[[Page 319]]

    (b) A hospital or outpatient facility will be used as provided for 
under title VI of the act;

repayment period of the loan other facilities not previously utilized 
for the purpose for which the facility was constructed will be so 
utilized and are substantially equivalent in nature and extent for such

Sec. 57.1605  How will applications be evaluated?

    (a) As required by section 798(a) of the Act, each application for a 
grant under this subpart shall be submitted to a peer review group, 
composed principally of non-Federal experts, for an evaluation of the 
merits of the proposals made in the application. The Secretary may not 
approve such an application unless a peer review group has recommended 
the application for approval. The Secretary will approve projects which 
best promote the purposes of section 747 of the Act and these 
regulations. The Secretary will consider, among other factors:
    (1) The degree to which the proposed project provides for the 
project requirements in Sec. 57.1604;
    (2) The administrative and management ability of the applicant to 
carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective manner; and
    (3) The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining 
basis.
    (b) In determining the funding of projects approved under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the Secretary will consider any special factors 
relating to national needs as the Secretary may from time to time 
announce in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 57.1606  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without

[[Page 323]]

requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, called the 
project period, will not exceed 5 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. 
Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding levels of these 
awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's 
progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all 
cases, continuation awards require a determination by the Secretary that 
continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application. For 
continuation support, grantees must make separate application at such 
times and in such a form as the Secretary may prescribe.

<R05>
Sec. 57.1607  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    (a) A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
according to the approved application and budget, the authorizing 
legislation, terms and conditions of the grant award, applicable cost 
principles specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these 
regulations.
    (b) Grantees may not spend grant funds for sectarian instruction or 
for any religious purpose.
    (c) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. If at 
any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee 
for that period, including any unobligated balance carried forward from 
prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary 
may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget 
period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project 
period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.

    Academic administrative unit or unit means a department, division, 
or other formal academic unit of a school of medicine or osteopathic 
medicine or clinical campuses of such schools that provides clinical 
instruction in family medicine.
    Act means the Public Health Service Act, as amended.
    Clinical campus means a geographically separate educational entity 
of an accredited medical school that is recognized and identified as a 
clinical campus by the American Academy of Family Physicians and that 
has been given the responsibility to coordinate or provide all clinical 
training for that clinical campus.
    Family medicine includes ``osteopathic general practice'' and means 
the field of medicine in which the physician:
    (a) Serves as a physician of first contact with families and 
patients of all ages and provides a means of entry into the health care 
system;
    (b) Evaluates the patient's total health needs, provides personal 
medical care within one or more fields of medicine, and refers the 
patient, when indicated, to appropriate sources of care while preserving 
the continuity of care;
    (c) Assumes responsibility with the patient for comprehensive and 
continuous health care and acts as a leader or coordinator of others 
providing health services; and
    (d) Considers the patient's total health care within the context of 
his or her environment, including the community and the family or 
comparable social units.
    Nonprofit refers to the status of an entity which is a corporation

<R05>
Sec. 57.1703  Who is eligible to apply for a grant?

    Any school of medicine or osteopathic medicine which is located in a 
State is eligible to apply for a grant. Each eligible applicant desiring 
a grant under this subpart shall submit an application in the form and 
at such time as the Secretary may prescribe.

[57 FR 45739, Oct. 5, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 57.1704  Program requirements.

    Existing units supported under this subpart must meet all the 
requirements of this section no later than 12 months after initial award 
of the grant. Units which are being established with the aid of grants 
under this subpart must meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this 
section no later than 12 months after initial award, and the remaining 
requirements of this section no later than 24 months after initial award 
of the grant. However, within the first 12 months of grant support, 
units which are being established must submit a continuation 
application. This application is expected to include a plan which 
details, in a format determined by the applicant, how the remaining 
project requirements will be met by the end of the second year of grant 
support. In addition to units that are initially establishing under this 
subpart, those that change organizational status (i.e., from division to 
department) are also considered establishing units for the purpose of 
this subpart. Those that maintain organizational status are considered 
existing units.
    (a) Each project must have a project director, who works at the 
grantee institution in an administrative unit of the grantee institution 
on an appointment consistent with other major departments, heads or will 
head the unit, and has relevant training and experience in family 
medicine.
    (b) The unit must have academic status comparable to that of one of 
the other major clinical units at the institution.
    (c) The unit must have administrative autonomy comparable to that of 
other academic units.
    (d) The unit must have control over a residency training program. 
The program must have the capacity to enroll a total of at least 9 
interns or residents annually. A unit whose applicant school or clinical 
campus does not have a residency program accredited under its direct 
authority will be considered as meeting this requirement if it has a 
written affiliation agreement with a hospital which conducts a residency 
program as described.
    (e) The unit (or units in the case of schools with one or more 
decentralized units) must have responsibility for providing instruction 
to each member of the student body who is engaged in an education 
program leading to a degree in doctor of medicine or doctor of 
osteopathic medicine. The amount of mandatory and elective curriculum 
must be comparable to the amount of mandatory and elective curriculum 
time required for other major clinical units at the school.
    (f) The unit must have, in the judgment of the Secretary, a 
sufficient number of full-time faculty to conduct the instruction. The 
number of family medicine faculty in the unit must be comparable to that 
of full-time faculty responsible for conducting the instruction of one 
of the other major clinical units either at the school or at the

[[Page 326]]

clinical campus, whichever is the same as the unit receiving the grant 
funds.
    (g) Each project must evaluate the program of instruction required 
in paragraph (f) of this section, including evaluation of faculty 
competence, the administration of the program, and the degree to which 
program objectives are met.
    (h) Where projects include the planning and development of model 
predoctoral, faculty development, or graduate medical education 
programs, those programs must be designed to eventually meet the 
requirements of the regulations implementing section 747 of the Act, 42 
CFR part 57, subpart Q.

<R05>
Sec. 57.1705  How will applications be evaluated?

    As required by section 798(a) of the Act, each application for a 
grant under this subpart shall be submitted to a peer review group, 
composed principally of non-Federal experts, for an evaluation of the 
merits of the proposals made in the application. The Secretary may not 
approve such an application unless a peer review group has recommended 
the application for approval. The Secretary will award grants to 
applicants whose projects will best promote the purposes of section 747 
of the Act and this subpart. The Secretary will consider, among other 
factors:
    (a) The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for 
the project requirements in Sec. 57.1704;
    (b) The administrative and management capability of the applicant to 
carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective manner;
    (c) The qualifications of the proposed staff and faculty of the 
unit; and
    (d) The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining 
basis.

[48 FR 20215, May 4, 1983, as amended at 60 FR 28067, May 30, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 57.1706  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long the Secretary 
intends to support the project without requiring the project to 
recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will not 
exceed 5 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year and 
subsequent noncompeting continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a 
time. Decisions regarding noncompeting continuation awards and the 
funding levels of these awards will be made after consideration of such 
factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, noncompeting continuation awards 
require a determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in 
the best interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application, nor the award of any 
grant, shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, noncompeting continuation or other award with 
respect to any approved application or portion of an approved 
application. For continuation support, grantees must make separate 
application at such times and in such a form as the Secretary may 
prescribe.

[48 FR 20215, May 4, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 45739, Oct. 5, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 57.1707  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    (a) A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
according to the approved application and budget, the authorizing 
legislation, the terms and conditions of the grant award, and the 
applicable cost principles in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these 
regulations.
    (b) Grantees may not spend grant funds for sectarian instruction or 
for any religious purpose.
    (c) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. If at 
any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal

[[Page 327]]

funds awarded and available to the grantee for that period, including 
any unobligated balance carried forward from prior periods, exceeds the 
grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary may adjust the amount 
awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget period is an interval of 
time (usually 12 months) into which the project period is divided for 
funding and reporting purposes.

Sec. 57.1805  Program requirements.

    (a) The Secretary will award grants to meet the cost of carrying out 
one or more of the following five purposes:
    (1) To identify individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds for 
education in the health or allied health professions through the 
development and application of criteria for this purpose, and to recruit 
these individuals through motivational activities which may involve 
dissemination of information, exposure to role models and health 
facilities, and counseling.
    (2) To provide individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, for a 
period prior to their entry into a regular course of education of such a 
school, preliminary education designed to assist them to complete 
successfully such regular course of education in a health professions 
school or school of allied health, or to refer them to institutions 
which provide it. Preliminary education in this context is education 
designed to expand the academic ability of disadvantaged students during 
their preprofessional training. It may not include classes already 
taught as part of the regular course of education leading to a high 
school diploma or undergraduate degree. It may not be offered to 
students before they complete the junior year of high school.
    (3) To provide information to individuals from disadvantaged 
backgrounds about financial aid available to students in health 
professions schools, or schools of allied health, or schools and 
entities which provide training necessary to qualify for enrollment in 
health professions schools or schools of allied health.
    (4) To facilitate the entry of individuals from disadvantaged 
backgrounds into health professions schools or schools of allied health 
by engaging in activities which assist them to compete for admission, 
such as instruction designed to improve their performance on admission 
tests, and by assisting admission committees with the evaluation of 
disadvantaged applicants.
    (5) To provide counseling or other retention services, such as 
tutorial assistance and assistance in adjusting to the environment of 
the school, which are designed to help individuals from disadvantaged 
backgrounds who are enrolled in health professions schools or schools of 
allied health to complete this education.
    (b) The grantee must carry out at least two of the five purposes, 
even if grant funds are requested or awarded for only one of them.
    (c) The grantee must evaluate its program based on the plan provided 
in the grant application.
    (d) Grantees which: (1) Are schools of medicine, osteopathic 
medicine, public health, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, 
pharmacy, allied health, chiropractic, podiatric medicine, and public 
and private nonprofit schools that offer graduate programs in clinical 
psychology; and
    (2) Have a proportionate enrollment of individuals from 
disadvantaged backgrounds that is less than 200 percent of the national 
average percentage of such individuals in all schools of each health 
professions discipline must assure the Secretary that during a period of 
3 years, commencing on the date of the award of the grant, they

[[Page 330]]

will increase their first-year enrollment of individuals from 
disadvantaged backgrounds by at least 20 percent over enrollments in the 
base year of 1987.

    (a) As required by section 798(a) of the Act, each application for a 
grant under this subpart shall be submitted to a peer review group, 
composed principally of non-Federal experts, for an evaluation of the 
merits of the proposals made in the application. The Secretary may not 
approve such an application unless a peer review group has recommended 
the application for approval. The Secretary will decide which 
applications to approve by considering, among other factors:
    (1) The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for 
the requirements in Sec. 57.1805;
    (2) The number and types of individuals who can be expected to 
benefit from the project;
    (3) The administrative and management ability of the applicant to 
carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective manner;
    (4) The adequacy of the staff and faculty;
    (5) The soundness of the budget; and
    (6) The potential of the project to continue without further support 
under this program.
    (b) Within the limits of funds available, the Secretary will award 
grants to approved applicants with projects that will best promote the 
purposes of section 740 of the Act. Of the amounts appropriated under 
this section for any fiscal year, 10 percent shall be obligated for 
community-based programs and 70 percent shall be obligated for grants to 
institutions of higher education and not more than 5 percent of such 
funds may be obligated for grants having the primary purpose of 
informing individuals about the existence and general nature of health 
careers. Section 740(a)(2)(G) authorizes the payment of such stipends as 
the Secretary may approve for participants in a project for any period 
of education at any school eligible for a grant under this subpart.
    (c) Funding priority. (1) In determining the funding of applications 
approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give 
priority to schools described in Sec. 57.1805(d), beginning in fiscal 
year 1992--
    (i) Which previously received a grant under this subpart and 
increased its first-year enrollment of individuals from disadvantaged 
backgrounds by at least 20 percent over that enrollment in the base year 
1987 by the end of 3 years from the date of the award of the HCOP grant; 
and
    (ii) Which had not previously received a grant under this subpart 
that increased its first-year enrollment of individuals from 
disadvantaged backgrounds by at least 20 percent over that enrollment in 
the base year 1987, over any period of time.
    (2) In addition, should specific needs warrant, the Secretary will 
also consider other special factors relating to national needs as the 
Secretary may from time to time announce in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 57.1807  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the project 
to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will not 
exceed 3 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be funded for 1 year at a time. 
Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding levels of these 
awards will be made after consideration of factors such as the grantee's 
progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all

Sec. 57.1808  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    (a) A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
according to the approved application and budget, the authorizing 
legislation, terms and conditions of the grant award, applicable cost 
principles specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these 
regulations.
    (b) Any balance of federally-obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. If at 
any time during the budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds provided and made available to the 
grantee for that period, including any unobligated balance carried 
forward from prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, 
the Secretary may adjust the amounts provided by withdrawing the excess. 
A budget period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which 
the project period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.
    (c) The grantee may spend grant funds to provide one round trip for 
each individual in the program between his or her residence and the 
training site if:
    (1) The training site is beyond a reasonable commuting distance and 
requires the individual to establish a temporary new residence; and
    (2) The educational assistance is not offered at a time when the 
individual would be at the training site as a student in a regular 
course of education leading to a high school diploma, associate degree, 
undergraduate degree, or degree in the health or allied health 
professions.
    (d) The grantee may spend grant funds to pay individuals in the 
program a stipend when the grantee determines that:
    (1) The condition in paragraph (c)(2) of this section exists;
    (2) No other Federal financial assistance program is authorized to 
provide this support; and
    (3) The individual needs this support to participate in the program.
    (e) The grantee may not spend grant funds to pay tuition or fees, 
train program staff, retrain health professionals, or for sectarian 
instruction, or for any religious purpose.

[[Page 334]]

must be submitted within 6 months of the date of grant award;

grant under this subpart shall be submitted to a peer review group, 
composed principally of non-Federal experts, for an evaluation of the 
merits of the proposals made in the application. The Secretary may not 
approve such an application unless a peer review group has recommended 
the application for approval. The Secretary will decide which 
applications to approve by considering, among other factors:
    (1) The degree to which the applicant can arrange to continue the 
proposed project beyond the federally funded project period;
    (2) The degree to which the proposed project meets three or more of 
the purposes as described in Sec. 57.2104;

carry out the project in a cost effective manner;

populations in underserved areas.
    (b) In determining the funding of applications approved under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will consider any special 
factors relating to national needs as the Secretary may from time to 
time announce in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 57.2106  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the project 
to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will not 
exceed 3 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. 
Decisions regarding the continuation awards and the funding levels of 
these awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the 
grantee's progress, including the degree that the projected portion of 
non-federal funds supporting the project has been met, and management 
practices, the existence of legislative authority, and the availability 
of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by 
the Secretary that continued funding is in the best interest of the 
Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant shall

[[Page 335]]

commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, 
supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved 
application or portion of an approved application. For continuation 
support, grantees must make separate application at such times and in 
such a form as the Secretary may prescribe.

Sec. 57.2107  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

regulations.
    (b) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. If at 
any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee 
for that period, including any unobligated balance carried foward from 
prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary 
may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget 
period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project 
period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.
    (c) The grantee may spend grant funds to pay individual participants 
in the program a per diem when the grantee determines that--
    (1) The training program requires the individual to establish a 
temporary new residence;
    (2) The program is offered at a time when the individual would not 
be at the training site in a regular course of education or employed as 
a faculty member at that institution; and
    (3) No other Federal financial assistance program is authorized to 
provide this support.
    (d) The grantee may spend grant funds to provide one round trip per 
participant between the place of residence and the training site, 
provided that conditions in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section 
are met.
    (e) The grantee may not spend grant funds for stipends, licensing 
exams, loan or scholarship support, support of research faculty or 
projects and related activities, establishment of research centers, 
establishment of planning offices, support of commercial ventures, 
entertainment, dependency allowances, new construction of facilities, 
acquisition of land, fund raising, or for sectarian instruction or any 
religious purpose.

Sec. 57.2209   Conditions of scholarship grant.

    (a) Any scholarship grant made to any individual under this subpart 
shall be awarded upon the condition that such individual will, following 
completion of his professional training, engage in the full-time 
practice of primary care for a period of 12 continuous months for each

as follows:
    (1) In the case of any individual selected pursuant to 
Sec. 57.2205(a) (1) or (2), such practice must be in the physician 
shortage area to which such individual agreed to return: Provided 
however, That if the Secretary determines at the time the individual 
proposes to engage in the required practice that such area is no longer 
a physician shortage area and cannot reasonably be expected to become 
such an area within 2 years from such time, such practice shall, at the 
option of the individual, be either in any then current physician 
shortage area, or in such place or places, facility, or facilities, and 
in such manner as the Secretary finds necessary to assure that, of the 
patients receiving medical care in such practice, a substantial portion 
will consist of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or 
members of their families.
    (2) In the case of any individual selected pursuant to 
Sec. 57.2205(a) (3) or (4), such practice must be in accordance with the 
agreement described in Sec. 57.2205(b)(2) (i.e., in a physician shortage 
area with a substantial portion of migratory agricultural workers in 
such area; a physician shortage area; or in such place or places, 
facility or facilities, and in such manner as may be necessary to assure 
that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a 
substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory 
agricultural workers or members of their families; as the case may be).
    (b) Subject to the provision of Sec. 57.2211(f) and except as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any individual to whom the 
conditions of this section apply must complete the practice required by 
paragraph (a) of this section within a period beginning on the date of 
completion by the individual of his professional training, as determined 
by the Secretary, and not to exceed the period of practice determined in 
accordance with such paragraph (a) of this section, plus 6 months.
    (c) Where an individual to whom the conditions of this section apply 
is currently performing an active duty service obligation under section 
235 of the Act, the individual must complete the practice required by 
paragraph (a) of this section within a period beginning on the date of 
completion by the individual of his service obligation under section 225 
of the Act or completion of his internship and residency training (not 
to exceed four years) if not previously received, whichever comes later, 
and not to exceed the period of

[[Page 339]]

practice determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, 
plus 6 months.
    (d) Where an individual has received scholarship grant support for 
four academic years, such individual shall be considered to have 
received scholarship grant support for only three academic years if the 
Secretary determines (1) that such individual has served his internship 
or residency in a hospital (i) which is located in a physician shortage 
area, or (ii) in which a substantial portion of the patients of such 
hospital consists of persons who are migratory agricultural workers or 
members of the families of such workers and (2) that while so serving 
such internship or residency, he has received training or professional 
experience designed to prepare him to engage in the practice of primary 
care.
    (e) For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, (1) 
internships which will be recognized by the Secretary as providing 
training or professional experience designed to prepare an individual to 
engage in the practice of primary care are: Rotating internships without 
a major emphasis, rotating internships with an emphasis on internal 
medicine, rotating internships with an emphasis on pediatrics, rotating 
internships with an emphasis on obstetrics and gynecology, straight 
internships in internal medicine, straight internships in pediatrics and 
straight internships in obstetrics and gynecology; Provided, That such 
internships are approved or provisionally approved by the Council on 
Medical Education of the American Medical Association or the Board of 
Trustees of the American Osteopathic Association; and
    (2) Residencies which will be recognized as providing such training 
or experience are those in general practice, family practice, general 
internal medicine, general pediatrics and general obstetrics and 
gynecology; Provided, That such residencies are approved or 
provisionally approved by the Council on Medical Education of the

Osteopathic Association.
    (f) No individual who has received a scholarship grant under this 
subpart may enter into an agreement with the Secretary pursuant to 
section 741(f) of the Act until either (1) such individual has completed 
the practice required by paragraph (a) of this section, or (2) the 
Secretary has determined that the United States is entitled to recover 
from such individual an amount determined in accordance with 
Sec. 57.2210. In no case, however, shall a scholarship grant under this 
subpart be considered an educational loan for purposes of section 741(f) 
of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 57.2210   Failure to comply.

    (a) Subject to the provision of Sec. 57.2211, if any individual 
fails to complete the course of study or fails, within the time period 
set forth in Sec. 57.2209(b), to meet the applicable conditions of 
practice imposed by receipt of a scholarship grant for the full number 
of months to which such condition is applicable, the United States shall 
be entitled to recover from such individual an amount determined in 
accordance with section 784(c)(3) of the Act; Provided however, That no 
interest shall accrue on any amount due the United States during any 
period for which the Secretary has suspended the obligation to repay 
pursuant to Sec. 57.2211(b).


<R05>
Sec. 57.2211   Waiver or suspension.

    (a) Any obligation of any individual under this subpart will be 
cancelled upon the death of such individual as documented by a 
certification of death, or such other official proof as is conclusive 
under State law, and submitted to the Secretary.
    (b) Subject to the provision of paragraph (f) of this section, where 
an individual fails to complete the practice required by Sec. 57.2209(a) 
within the period prescribed in Sec. 57.2209(b), the Secretary may waive 
or suspend for such period as determined by the Secretary the obligation 
of such individual to repay pursuant to Sec. 57.2210 where the Secretary 
determines that compliance by such individual with such obligation (1) 
is impossible, or (2) would involve extreme hardship to such individual 
and enforcement of such obligation with respect to such individual would 
be against equity and good conscience.

[[Page 340]]

    (c) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, compliance by 
an individual will be deemed impossible where the Secretary determines, 
on the basis of such information and documentation as he may require, 
that the individual is permanently and totally disabled.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in determining 
whether compliance by an individual would involve extreme hardship to 
such individual and would be against equity and good conscience, the 
Secretary will take into consideration the following:
    (1) The individual's present financial resources and obligations;
    (2) The individual's estimated future financial resources and 
obligations;
    (3) The reasons for the individual's failure to complete such 
practice within the prescribed period, such as problems of a personal 
nature; and
    (4) The extent to which the individual is practicing his profession 
in a manner consistent with the purposes of section 784 of the Act.
    (e) Where the Secretary determines that compliance by an individual 
with his obligation to engage in the practice of primary care in a 
specified shortage area pursuant to Sec. 57.2209(a) is impossible or 
would involve extreme hardship to such individual and enforcement of 
such obligation with respect to such individual would be against equity 
and good conscience, the Secretary may waive such obligation and permit 
the individual at his option to practice either in any then current 
physician shortage area, or in such place or places, facility or 
facilities, and in such manner as the Secretary finds necessary to 
assure that, of the patients receiving medical care in such practice, a 
substantial portion will consist of persons who are migratory 
agricultural workers or members of their families. The Secretary will 
take into consideration in determining whether to grant a waiver under 
this paragraph the extent to which the individual has problems of a 
personal nature, e.g., physical or mental disability, terminal illness 
in the family, or need for financial support that cannot be supplied by 
the required service, which intrude upon the individual's ability to 
perform the required service in the specified shortage area.
    (f) The Secretary may extend the period (prescribed in 
Sec. 57.2209(b)) within which an individual must complete the practice 
required pursuant to Sec. 57.2209(a) for a period not to exceed one year 
where the Secretary finds that (1) such individual is unable to complete 
such practice within such period because of a temporary physical or 
mental disability, or (2) completion by such individual of such practice 
within such period would involve extreme hardship to such individual and 
that failure to so extend such period would be against equity and good 
conscience.

    (3) Neither the approval of any project nor the award of any grant 
shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved project or portion thereof. For continuation support, 
grantees must make separate application at such times and in such form 
as the Secretary may prescribe.
    (c) Noncompeting continuation awards. If a grantee has filed an 
application for continuation support and within the limits of funds 
available for this purpose, the Secretary may make a grant award for an 
additional budget period for any previously approved project if (1) the 
application is for a project which meets the regulations of this subpart 
and (2) on the basis of such progress and accounting records as may be 
required, the Secretary finds that the project's activities during the 
current budget period justify continued support of the project for an 
additional budget period. If the Secretary decides to continue support, 
the amount of the grant award will be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the Secretary decides not to 
continue supporting a project for an additional budget period, he will 
notify the grantee in writing before the end of the current budget 
period. In addition, the Secretary may provide financial support for the 
orderly phaseout of the supported project, if he determines that such 
support is necessary.

solely for carrying out the approved project in accordance with section 
822 of the Act, the regulations of this subpart, the terms and 
conditions of the award, and the applicable cost principles prescribed 
by subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74; Provided, That such funds shall not be 
expended for sectarian instruction or for any religious purpose.
    (b) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. If at 
any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee 
for that period, including any unobligated balance carried forward from 
prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary 
may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget 
period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project

Sec. 57.2506  Evaluation and grant awards.

    (a) Evaluation. Within the limits of funds available for this 
purpose, the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, may award 
grants to those applicants whose projects will, in his or her judgment, 
best promote the purposes of section 821 of the Act, taking into 
consideration among other pertinent factors:
    (1) The need for the proposed project including, with respect to 
projects to provide education in professional nursing specialties 
determined by the Secretary to require advanced education:
    (i) The current or anticipated need for professional nurses educated 
in the specialty; and
    (ii) The relative number of programs offering advanced education in 
the specialty;
    (2) The need for nurses in the specialty in which education is to be 
provided in the State in which the education program is located, as 
compared with the need for these nurses in other States;
    (3) The degree to which the applicant proposes to recruit students 
from States in need of nurses in the specialty in which education is to 
be provided, and to promote their return to these States following 
education;
    (4) The degree to which the applicant proposes to encourage 
graduates to practice in States in need of nurses in the specialty in 
which education is to be provided;
    (5) The potential effectiveness of the proposed project in carrying 
out the educational purposes of section 821 of the Act and this subpart;
    (6) The capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed 
project;
    (7) The soundness of the fiscal plan for assuring effective 
utilization of grant funds; and
    (8) The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining 
basis after the period of grant support; and
    (9) The degree to which the applicant proposes to attract, retain 
and graduate minority and financially needy students.
    (b) Funding preference. In determining the funding of applications 
approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may from 
time to time announce in the Federal Register special factors relating 
to national needs.
    (c) Grant awards. (1) The Secretary will determine the amount of any 
award on the basis of his or her estimate on the sum necessary for the 
cost (including both direct and indirect costs) of the project.
    (2) All grant awards shall be in writing and shall set forth the 
amount of funds granted and the period for which the funds will be 
available for obligation by the grantee.
    (3) Neither the approval of any project nor the award of any grant 
shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved project or portion thereof. For continuation support, 
grantees must make separate application annually in a form and at the 
time that the Secretary may require.
    (d) Noncompeting continuation awards. Within the limits of funds 
available for this purpose, the Secretary may make a grant award for an 
additional budget period for any previously approved project on the 
basis of an application and those progress and accounting records which 
may be required. If the Secretary finds that the project's activities 
during the current budget period justify continued support of the 
project for an additional budget period, and the Secretary decides to 
continue support, the amount of the grant award will be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the Secretary 
decides not to continue support for an additional budget period, he or 
she will notify the grantee in writing before the end of the current 
budget period. The Secretary may provide financial support for the 
orderly phase-out of the supported project, if he or she determines that 
this support is necessary.

    The Secretary will from time to time make payments to the grantee of 
all or a portion of any grant award, either by way of reimbursement for 
expenses incurred in the budget period, or in advance for expenses to be

the Act, the regulations of this subpart, the terms and conditions of 
the award, except that funds shall not be expended for sectarian 
instruction or for any religious purpose.
    (b) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried

any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee 
for that period, including any unobligated balance carried forward from 
prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary 
may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget 
period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project 
period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.

Sec. 57.2806  How is the amount of grant award determined?

    (a) A school which receives a grant under this subpart must award 
each scholarship successively to the eligible individual as specified in 
Sec. 57.2803(b)(1) of greatest financial need at that school.
    (b) The Secretary will make a randomized list of all eligible 
applicant schools of medicine, dentistry and osteopathic medicine and a 
second randomized list of all remaining eligible applicant schools. To 
the extent of available funds, the Secretary will award grant funds 
sufficient for one scholarship to each eligible applicant school on the 
first list, and then proceed to the list of all other eligible applicant 
schools and award one scholarship to each school in the same manner. 
These scholarships must go to students who have no financial resources 
for the first year of study at the school, as determined under 
Sec. 57.2804. The Secretary will then allocate any remaining funds 
according to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c)(1) Proceeding in sequence through the list of schools of 
medicine, dentistry and osteopathic medicine, the Secretary will award 
each school of medicine, dentistry, and osteopathic medicine sufficient 
grant funds for a second scholarship which must be given to a student 
with no financial resources as determined under Sec. 57.2804. This 
procedure will be repeated until all the scholarship requests of the 
applicant schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, and dentistry for 
scholarships for students with no financial resources have been 
satisfied or until all the available grant funds have been allocated. If 
there are additional grant funds, the Secretary will then proceed to the 
list of all other eligible applicant schools and will allocate 
scholarships for students with no financial resources using the same 
procedure.
    (2) If additional grant funds remain after fulfilling all requests 
for scholarships for students with no financial resources at all 
eligible applicant schools, using the method described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section the Secretary will allocate funds for 
scholarships to students who have resources from one to 500 dollars. 
With any remaining funds after completion of these awards, the Secretary 
will, in the same manner, award grants for scholarships to students with 
resources in

[[Page 354]]

increments of $500 until all grant funds are awarded or students who 
have $5,000 in resources or 50 percent of the cost of education at the 
school have received awards.

paragraph (b)(1) of this section, do not exceed the lesser of $5,000 or 
one-half of the cost of attendance at the school. Student summer 
earnings, educational loans, veterans (G.I.) benefits, and earnings 
during the school year will not be considered resources for purposes of 
determining whether a student has exceptional financial need.
    (b) Selection of aid recipients. The school will select qualified 
recipients and determine the amount of aid to be awarded to provide its 
needy students with the maximum possible benefit.
    (1) In determining the amount of aid an eligible student needs to 
pursue a full-time course of study at the school, the school will take 
into consideration:
    (i) The financial resources available to the student by using one of 
the national need analysis systems or any other procedure approved by 
the Secretary of Education in combination with other information which 
the school has regarding the student's financial status. The school must 
take into account, regardless of the tax status of the student, the 
expected contribution from parents, spouse, self, or (as appropriate) 
other family members. In making this determination, the school must 
consider photocopies of the parents', student's, and spouse's Federal 
income tax forms with original signatures for the most recent tax year 
(or certification that no Federal income tax return was filed and 
documentation of the total income for the most recent tax year), and may 
require tax returns that are certified as having been received by the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS); and
    (ii) The costs reasonably necessary for the student's attendance at 
the school. The school must document the criteria used for determining 
these costs. This documentation must include resource materials used by 
the school to determine the dollar amount for each category of expenses 
in its standard student budgets.
    (2) The school must select aid recipients in order of greatest need, 
as determined by the school. The school may consider other scholarship, 
grant, or fellowship funds that a student has received or will receive 
for the award period when determining the order of greatest need.

Sec. 57.2905  Amount of student award.

    (a) The total award made under this program to any student, plus all 
other sources of aid the student has received or will receive for the 
award period, may not exceed the amount the school determines that the 
student needs to meet the costs of education (i.e., tuition, fees, 
books, equipment, other expenses required by the school, and reasonable 
living expenses) for the period covered by the award. The total award 
made under this program to any student may be less than the amount the 
school determines that the student needs to meet the costs of education 
for the period covered by the award.
    (b) The total award made under this program to any student for a 
school year may not exceed $10,000. The maximum amount awarded during a 
12-month period to any student enrolled in a school which provides a 
full-time course of study longer than the traditional 9-month school 
year may be proportionately increased.
    (c) The school must disburse this award to the student in payments 
based on the student's need during each academic period (e.g. semester, 
quarter, trimester) of a school year.


<R05>
Sec. 57.2906  How is the amount of the grant award determined?

    (a) The amount of the grant to each eligible school will be the 
amount requested in its application, except that if the total of the 
amounts requested for any fiscal year by all schools for these funds 
exceeds the amount of Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the 
time of payment to be available for this purpose, the grant to each 
school will be reduced to whichever is smaller:
    (1) The amount requested in the application; or
    (2) An amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of 
Federal funds determined by the Secretary at the time of grant award to 
be available

[[Page 357]]

for that fiscal year for this program as the number of eligible students 
at the school bears to the total number of eligible students at all 
participating schools during that year.
    (b) Amounts remaining after the calculation described in paragraph 
(a) will be distributed in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section among schools whose applications requested more than the amount 
paid to them, but with whatever adjustments may be necessary to prevent 
the total grant to any school from exceeding the amount requested by it.


<R05>
Sec. 57.2907  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    (a) A school shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
in accordance with the approved application, the authorizing 
legislation, terms and conditions of the grant award, and these 
regulations.
    (b) The school must discontinue all payments to a recipient in the 
event that the recipient ceases to be a full-time student at the school, 
and must remit any unused balance of funds to the Federal Government in 
the event it is unable to make full use of its grant award during the

<R05>
Sec. 57.3006  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the project 
to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will not 
exceed 3 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. 
Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding levels of these 
awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's 
progress and management practices, existence of legislative authority, 
and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require 
a determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of any approved application. For 
continuation support, grantees must make separate application at such 
times and in such a form as the Secretary may prescribe.

<R05>
Sec. 57.3007  How is the amount of the grant award determined?

    (a) The amount of any award will be limited to that portion of the 
annual program costs which the Secretary determines, on the basis of the 
documentation required in the application, cannot reasonably be paid 
from other available funds. Moreover, the amount of any stipend will be 
limited to that portion of the annual amount normally paid to other 
residents by the applicant which the Secretary determines, on the basis 
of the documentation required in the application, cannot reasonably be 
paid from other available funds. The applicant must document attempts to 
pursue other sources of funding.
    (b) Stipend support may only be given to residents in the academic 
and field years of training, and support to each resident is limited to 
2 years of training, excluding the clinical year.

any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee 
for that period, including any unobligated balance carried forward from 
prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary 
may adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget 
period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project 
period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.

Sec. 57.3106  How will applications be evaluated?

    (a) As required by section 798(a) of the Act, each application for a 
grant under this subpart shall be submitted to a peer review group, 
composed principally of non-Federal experts, for an evaluation of the 
merits of the proposals made in the application. The Secretary may not 
approve such an application unless a peer review group has recommended 
the application for approval. The Secretary will award grants to 
applicants whose projects best promote the purposes of section 748 of 
the Act. The Secretary will take into consideration, among other 
factors:
    (1) The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for 
the project requirements set forth in Sec. 57.3105;
    (2) The administrative and management capability of the applicant to 
carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective manner;
    (3) The qualifications of the proposed staff and faculty;
    (4) The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining 
basis; and
    (5) For faculty development programs, the applicant must demonstrate 
the institution's commitment to general internal medicine and/or general 
pediatrics as defined under Sec. 57.3102.
    (b) In determining the funding of applications approved under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give priority to 
applicants that demonstrate a commitment to general internal medicine 
and general pediatrics in their medical education training programs. 
However, should specific needs warrant, the Secretary will consider any 
other special factors relating to national needs as the Secretary may

[[Page 366]]

from time to time announce in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 57.3107  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the project 
to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will not 
exceed 5 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. 
Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding levels of these 
awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's 
progress and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all 
cases, continuation awards require a determination by the Secretary that 
continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application. For 
continuation support, grantees must make separate application at such 
times and in such a form as the Secretary may prescribe.

<R05>
Sec. 57.3108  How is the amount of the grant award determined?

    The amount of any award will be limited to that portion of the 
annual program costs which the Secretary determines, on the basis of the 
documentation required in the application, cannot reasonably be paid 
from other available funds. Further, the amount of any stipend will be 
limited to that portion of the annual amount normally paid to other 
residents by the applicant which the Secretary determines, on the basis 
of the documentation required in the application, cannot reasonably be 
paid from other available funds, including the incomes derived by the 
hospital from the residents' services.

[45 FR 51202, Aug. 1, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 57.3109  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    (a) A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
according to the approved application and budget, the authorizing 
legislation, terms and conditions of the grant award, applicable cost 
principles specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these 
regulations.
    (b) Grantees may not spend grant funds for sectarian instruction or 
for any religious purpose.
    (c) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward provided specific approval is granted by the Secretary. If at 
any time during a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary 
that the amount of Federal funds provided and made available to the 
grantee for that period, including any unobligated balance carried 
forward from prior periods, exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, 
the Secretary may adjust the amounts provided by withdrawing the excess. 
A budget period is an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which 
the project period is divided for funding and reporting purposes.

       Subpart GG--Payment for Tuition and Other Educational Costs

    Authority: Sec. 215, Public Health Service Act, 58 Stat. 690, as 
amended by 63 Stat. 35 (42 U.S.C. 216); sec. 711, Public Health Service 
Act, 90 Stat. 2253; section 710, PHS Act, as redesignated by Pub. L. 97-
35, 95 Stat. 915 (42 U.S.C. 292k).


<R05>
Sec. 57.3201  To which programs do these regulations apply?

    The regulations in this subpart establish the criteria to be used in 
determining allowable increases in tuition and other educational costs 
for which the Secretary is responsible for payment under the following 
sections of the Public Health Service Act: The National Health Service 
Corps Scholarship Program (sec. 338A) (42 U.S.C. 254l) and the Indian 
Health Scholarship Program (awarded pursuant to sec. 338A-339G of the 
PHS Act) (25 U.S.C. 1613a). These programs are referred to herein as the 
``scholarship programs.'' The regulations apply to increases in tuition 
and other educational costs occurring after the school year beginning 
immediately before October 1, 1981.

[57 FR 45745, Oct. 5, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 57.3202  How will allowable increases be determined?

    (a) The Secretary is responsible for increases in tuition and other 
educational costs only if the same increase is charged to all students 
in the same category (for example, the same class year or place of 
residence) and without regard to whether the student is receiving 
support under the scholarship programs. A student participating in the 
scholarship programs may not be denied eligibility because of this 
participation for any discounts or rebates in tuition or other 
educational costs given to all other students in the same category at 
the institution.
    (b) Institutions whose enrollment contains 25 percent or more 
students participating in the scholarship programs, and whose percentage 
increase in tuition and other educational costs in any school year 
exceeds the previous calendar year's average inflation rate as indicated 
by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Areas, may be requested to 
provide the Secretary with detailed cost breakdowns justifying the 
increase.
    (c) In the case of a school which is requested to provide the 
Secretary with cost increase justification under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Secretary will be responsible for increases in tuition and 
other educational costs charged to students participating in the 
scholarship programs over the amount charged for the school year 
immediately preceding the increase only to the extent that they are: (1) 
Attributable to uncontrollable costs, such as

[[Page 368]]

fuel costs, mandated cost-of-living increases in wages, salaries and 
fringe benefits, (2) attributable to costs of maintaining and improving 
the quality of the health professions education provided by the 
institution, such as hiring additional faculty to improve the faculty-
student ratio, costs incurred in off-site training of students, and 
necessary improvements in teaching equipment. Increases in patient care 
and research costs are allowable as part of an increase in tuition and 
other educational costs only to the extent that they can be documented 
as clearly necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the 
education being supported; or (3) attributable to loss of revenue from 
other sources which was used solely for the maintenance and improvement 
of the educational system.

These three categories of valid escalators of tuition and other 
educational costs are exclusive. However, the examples within each 
category are merely illustrative and not meant to be inclusive.
    (d) If the Secretary, after reviewing all available data, 
information, and justifications submitted by an institution, determines 
that an increase in tuition and other educational costs is not allowable 
under the criteria described in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, 
the Secretary will provide the affected institution a detailed written 
explanation of the basis of that determination. The Secretary will be 
responsible for that portion of tuition and other educational costs the 
Secretary determines to be allowable.

in section 781(d)(2) of the Act and these regulations, and assist the 
schools participating in the program in meeting the requirements in 
section 781(c) of the Act and these regulations.
    (2) Provide for the active participation in the program by 
individuals who are associated with the administration of the school, 
and staff or faculty members of each of the departments (or specialties 
if the school has no departments) of internal medicine, pediatrics,

the Secretary fully describing and documenting the good cause and 
stating which school meets the requirement. This request must include 
the following information:
    (A) The extent to which the school for which the waiver has been 
requested has attempted to meet this requirement. A description of 
efforts and the reasons why the school cannot meet the requirement must 
demonstrate that the school has made a good faith effort, but 
constraints beyond its control have caused these efforts to be 
unsuccessful.
    (B) The length of time for which this waiver is requested, and a 
plan and timetable for meeting the requirement.
    (C) The alternative mechanisms the schools will use to provide 
clinical experiences in locations removed from the site of the teaching

physician assistants, which meets the requirements of 42 CFR part 57, 
subpart I, or nurse practitioners, which meets the requirements of 42 
CFR part 57, subpart Y, appendix. If one school which is participating 
in the area health education center program provides for or conducts a 
program for the training of

[[Page 371]]

physician assistants or nurse practitioners meeting this requirement, 
other schools participating in the program may, but need not, provide 
for or conduct a physician assistant or nurse practitioner program. 
Where the school is responsible for, but does not conduct one of these 
programs, it must participate in the presentation, review, and 
evaluation of one of these programs at an affiliated institution so that 
at least part of the education in the program is provided by faculty of 
the school. The school must give special consideration to the enrollment 
in these programs of individuals from or who plan to practice in the 
area served by the center by either:
    (i) Giving preference to applicants whose place of residence has 
been in the area served by the center at any time prior to application; 
or
    (ii) Obtaining a signed statement from applicants, indicating an 
intent to practice the skills acquired in the program in the areas.
    (5) Provide for the active participation of at least two schools or 
programs of other health professions in the educational program 
conducted in the area served by the center(s). In meeting this 
requirement:
    (i) One of the participating schools or programs must be a school of 
dentistry, if there is one affiliated with the university with which the 
school of medicine or osteopathy is affiliated;
    (ii) Only the following schools or programs of other health 
professions may be included to meet the requirement of this paragraph:
    (A) Training centers for the allied health professions;
    (B) Schools of nursing;
    (C) Schools of optometry;
    (D) Schools of pharmacy;
    (E) Schools of podiatry; or
    (F) Schools of public health.
    (iii) Each school or program participating in the area health 
education center program under this paragraph must have a written 
agreement with the school(s) of medicine or osteopathy, under which the 
school or program agrees to assist and participate, as is appropriate, 
in the activities of each center as required under section 781(d)(2) of 
the Act.
    (iv) Each school or program participating in the area health 
education center under this paragraph must have a written agreement with 
each center, under which the school or program agrees to provide some or 
all of its students with educational experiences in the center or in 
settings affiliated with the center, and the center agrees to arrange 
for and support the provision of the educational programs. This 
agreement may be part of the agreement required by paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section.
    (e) Requirements for area health education centers. Each area health 
education center participating in an area health education center 
program must:
    (1) Designate either a geographic area or medically underserved 
population which it will serve (``the area served by the center''). This 
area or population must be in a location remote from the main site of 
the teaching facilities of the schools which participate in the program. 
For purposes of this requirement,
    (i) A medically underserved population means the population of a 
geographic area designated as a primary medical personnel shortage area 
under section 332 of the Act or a population group designated under 
section 332 of the Act as having a shortage of primary medical care 
personnel;
    (ii) An area or population will meet this requirement if its 
location is removed from the site of the teaching facilities where the 
major part of the educational program of any participating school is 
conducted. The area served by the center must not duplicate, in whole or 
in part, the area served by any other center.
    (2) Provide for or conduct training in health education services, in 
the area served by the center. This training must consist of courses and 
programs to train health professionals to instruct the public or 
patients in medical self-help, disease prevention, accident prevention, 
nutrition, physical fitness, and other subjects relating to health 
maintenance, and must include the principles of nutrition, the 
evaluation of nutritional status, and nutritional counseling. The 
training must be oriented toward the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of 
the people in the area.

[[Page 372]]

    (3) Assess the health manpower needs of the area served by the 
center and assist in the planning and development of training programs 
to meet these needs. In meeting this requirement, the center should work 
with existing health systems agencies designated for the area served by 
the center and other appropriate entities by cooperatively developing 
and sharing data on health personnel needs of the area for the next 10 
years and in developing a plan for training programs to meet these 
needs. In areas where HSAs exist, the planned training programs must be 
consistent with the health personnel projections developed by the health 
systems agencies. At a minimum, the center must assess the need for (i) 
personnel to provide health education and nutrition counseling services; 
(ii) primary care health personnel including physicians in family 
practice, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, and obstetrics 
and gynecology, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners; (iii) 
mental health practitioners; (iv) dentists; and (v) nurses. In carrying 
out its responsibility to assess health personnel needs in the area, the 
center shall, to the maximum extent practicable, use existing data 
(including data used for the designation of shortage areas under 
sections 332 and 836(h) of the Act).
    (4) Provide for or conduct a rotating osteopathic internship or 
medical residency training program in family practice, general internal 
medicine or general pediatrics, or osteopathy in which no fewer than six 
persons are enrolled in first-year positions in the program. If one 
center which is participating in the area health education center 
program provides for or conducts a medical residency training program 
meeting this requirement, other centers participating in the program 
may, but need not, provide for or conduct a medical residency training 
program in these fields. In meeting this requirement:
    (i) A family practice residency for allopathic and osteopathic 
physicians must meet the requirements of section 786(a) of the Act, and 
implementing regulations.
    (ii) A general internal medicine or general pediatrics residency 
must meet the requirements of 42 CFR 57.3104, except for the 
requirements in paragraphs (h) and (i) of that section.

    (a) The period of time in which any entity will have to meet all the 
requirements or Sec. 57.3804 will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, 
depending upon the nature and scope of the planned area health education 
center program. No cooperative agreement, however, shall provide funds 
solely for the planning or development of a program for a period of 
longer than two years.

[[Page 374]]

    (b) Each area health education center program must begin planning 
for at least one center during the first year of support so that at 
least one center is fully operational and meets all the applicable 
requirements of Sec. 57.3804 during the third year of support. 
Additional centers may be phased in during the first four years of 
Federal support except that once planning for any center is initiated, 
it must become fully operational and meet all the applicable 
requirements of Sec. 57.3804 within three years.
    (c) Each school with which the Secretary enters into a cooperative 
agreement under this subpart must meet all the requirements of 
Sec. 57.3804 during the first four years of Federal support, except that 
once planning to add any school is initiated, it must meet all the 
applicable requirements of Sec. 57.3804 within three years.


<R05>
Sec. 57.3806  How will applications be evaluated?

    (a) After consulting with the National Advisory Council on Health 
Professions Education established by section 702 of the Act, the 
Secretary will award cooperative agreements to applicants whose projects 
will best promote the purposes of section 781 of the Act and these 
regulations, taking into consideration among other factors:
    (1) The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for 
the program requirements set forth in Sec. 57.3804;
    (2) The capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed 
project; and
    (3) The extent of the need of the area to be served by the proposed 
area health education center.
    (b) In determining the funding of applications approved under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will consider any special 
factors relating to national needs as the Secretary may from time to 
time announce in the Federal Register.

[48 FR 7446, Feb. 22, 1983, as amended at 53 FR 14792, Apr. 26, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 57.3807  How is the amount of the award determined?

    (a) The amount of the award will be based on the Secretary's 
estimate of the sum necessary for the approved activity.
    (b) The Secretary will not provide in any year under this subpart 
more than 75 percent of the total operating funds of an area health 
education center program.


<R05>
Sec. 57.3808  How long does support under a cooperative agreement last?

    (a) The cooperative agreement will specify the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the project 
to recompete for funds. In addition, the maximum period during which a 
project may be funded will be specified in each cooperative agreement.
    (b) Generally, the project will initially be funded for one year, 
and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. 
A school which enters into a cooperative agreement must submit a 
separate application to have the support continued for each subsequent 
year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding levels of 
these continuation awards will be made after consideration of such 
factors as the applicant's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the entering into of 
any cooperative agreement commits or obligates the Federal Government in 
any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation or other 
award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved 
application.
    (d) Any balance of federally obligated funds remaining unobligated 
by the school at the end of a budget period may be carried forward to 
the next budget period, for use as prescribed by the Secretary, provided 
a continuation award is made. If at any time during a budget period it 
becomes apparent to the Secretary that the amount of Federal funds 
awarded and available to the school for that period, including any 
unobligated balance carried forward from prior periods, exceeds the 
school's needs for the period, the Secretary may

[[Page 375]]

adjust the amounts awarded by withdrawing the excess. A budget period is 
an interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project period is 
divided for funding and reporting purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 57.3809  For what purposes may cooperative agreement funds be spent?

    (a) A school which is awarded a cooperative agreement shall only 
spend funds it receives under this subpart according to the approved 
application and budget, the authorizing legislation, terms and 
conditions of the cooperative agreement award, applicable cost 
principles specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these 
regulations.
    (b) The area health education center program must spend at least 75 
percent of the funds provided under this subpart in any year in area 
health education centers.
    (c) Schools which are awarded cooperative agreements may not spend 
cooperative agreement funds for sectarian instruction or for any 
religious purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 57.3810  How will the Department participate in a cooperative agreement?

    The Secretary anticipates substantial Federal involvement in the 
management of the project supported under the cooperative agreement. 
This involvement may include, as determined necessary, the following 
activities, among others:
    (a) Reviewing and approving plans, upon which continuation of the 
cooperative agreement is contingent, to permit appropriate direction and 
conduct of activities;
    (b) Reviewing and approving all contracts between the cooperating 
school of medicine, other health professions schools, and area health 
education centers;
    (c) Participating with project staff in the development of funding 
projections;
    (d) Developing with project staff data collection systems and 
procedures; and
    (e) Participating with project staff in the design of project 
evaluation protocols and methodologies.

composed principally of non-Federal experts, for an evaluation of the 
merits of the proposals made in the application. The Secretary may not 
approve such an application unless a peer review group has recommended 
the application for approval. The Secretary will award grants to 
applicants whose projects will best promote the purposes of section 
777(b) of the Act and these regulations. The Secretary will consider, 
among other factors:
    (1) The extent to which the proposed training program will prepare

applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective manner;
    (4) The potential for the applicant to continue the program without 
Federal support after completion of the requested project period; and

[[Page 383]]

    (5) The extent to which the project will increase the number of 
geriatric fellowship and retraining positions available for individuals 
who want to prepare for academic careers in geriatric medicine, 
psychiatry, or dentistry.
    (b) In determining the funding of applications approved under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will consider any special 
factors relating to national needs as the Secretary may from time to 
time announce in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec. 57.4107  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies the length of time the 
Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the project 
to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will not 
exceed 5 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be funded for 1 year, and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. 
Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding levels of these 
awards will be made after consideration of such factors as the grantee's 
progress and management practices, existence of legislative authority, 
and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require 
a determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application. For 
continuation support, grantees must make separate application at such 
time and in such a form as the Secretary may prescribe.

the fellow receives

[[Page 384]]

notice of his or her fellowship appointment after the training period 
has begun. The statement of appointment must include information to 
document the eligibility of the fellow and certify that there will be 
compliance with all applicable Public Health Service terms and 
conditions governing the appointment. The program director must sign the 
statement on behalf of the grantee, and the fellow must sign it thus 
certifying the statements are true and complete. The original copy of 
the statement must be retained by the grantee to be available for 
program review and financial audit. A copy shall be provided to the 
fellow for his or her records.
    (b) The grantee may not require fellows to perform work which is not 
an integral part of the geriatric training program, or to perform 
services which detract from or prolong their training.

<R05>
Sec. 58.204  How will applications be evaluated?

    (a) The Secretary will award a grant to each eligible school of 
public health

[[Page 387]]

which submits an application containing all the information and 
assurances requested in the required form and time.
    (b) For public and nonprofit educational entities other than schools 
of public health, the Secretary will decide which applications to 
approve by considering, among other factors:
    (1) The administrative and management ability of the applicant to 
carry out the proposed project in a cost-effective manner;
    (2) The degree of need for the professionals to be trained; and
    (3) The adequacy of the staff and faculty; and

requirements in paragraphs Sec. 58.208(c) and (d).

Within the limits of funds available for competing awards the Secretary 
will award grants to those approved applicants whose traineeship 
programs will best promote the purposes of section 761 of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 58.205  How is the amount of the award determined?

    (a) Grants to schools of public health. The Secretary will use a 
formula to determine the amount of the grant to be awarded to each 
school of public health with an approved application.
    This formula is
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE96.000
    
    G is the amount of the grant award; SS is the number of eligible 
full-time and full-time equivalent students of each applicant enrolled 
in severe shortage occupations targeted for support (epidemiology, 
environmental health, biostatistics, toxicology, public health 
nutrition, and maternal and child health); TS is the total number of 
students enrolled in graduate and specialized training in all schools of 
public health with approved applications; and AF is the amount of 
traineeship funds under this program that the Secretary has designated 
for award to schools of public health for that fiscal year. The 
Secretary will determine the number of students enrolled in graduate and 
specialized training in public health at the school (SS) with the 
formula
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE96.001

    FTS is the number of full-time students, and PTC is the total number 
of credit hours in which part-time students are enrolled. If necessary, 
the figure for
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE96.002

will be rounded to the next highest number. Students will be counted as 
of October 15 of the fiscal year in which application is made. The 
amount of a grant will never exceed the amount requested by the 
applicant.

    (b) Grants to public and nonprofit private educational entities. The 
remaining funds will be available to meet continuation commitments and 
to award on a competitive basis to eligible public or nonprofit private 
educational entities other than schools of public health. The Secretary 
will determine the amount of these awards by estimating the sum 
necessary during the budget period to cover the tuition, fees, stipends, 
and allowances (including travel costs approved by the Secretary) for 
full-time students, and the tuition and fees for part-time students 
which the applicant proposes to provide to its trainees.

[45 FR 73661, Nov. 6, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 54440, Dec. 3, 1982; 61 
FR 6130, Feb. 16, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 58.206  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The written notice of grant award specifies the period during 
which formula grant funds are available for obligation by the grantee, 
or the period during which the recipient of a competitive grant award 
need not recompete for funds. This period will not exceed one year for 
formula grants and 3 years for competitve grants. The period during 
which recompetition is not necessary is called the project period.
    (b) Generally a competitive grant will initially be funded for one 
year, and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a 
time. A grantee must submit a separate application to have the support 
continued

[[Page 388]]

for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding levels of these awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.
    (d) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried 
forward to the next budget period, for use as prescribed by the 
Secretary, provided a continuation award is made. If at any time during 
a budget period it becomes apparent to the Secretary that the amount of 
Federal funds awarded and available to the grantee for that period, 
including any unobligated balance carried forward from prior periods, 
exceeds the grantee's needs for the period, the Secretary may adjust the 
amounts awarded by withholding the excess. A budget period is an 
interval of time (usually 12 months) into which the project period is 
divided for funding and reporting purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 58.207  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    (a) A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this subpart 
according to the approved application and budget, the authorizing 
legislation, terms and conditions of the grant award, applicable cost 
principles specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and these 
regulations. Use of grant funds to meet the direct or indirect 
administrative costs of the training institution is not authorized.
    (b) Grantees may not spend grant funds for sectarian instruction or 
for any religious purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 58.208  What are the requirements for appointment of trainees?

    (a) The grantee must require each trainee to complete a statement of 
appointment by the beginning of the training period, or as soon as 
possible if the trainee receives notice of his or her traineeship 
appointment after the training period has begun. The program director 
must sign the statement on behalf of the grantee and the original copy 
of the statement must be retained by the grantee to be available for 
program review and financial audit. The grantee must also send a copy of 
the statement to the Secretary upon request.
    (b) The grantee must require full-time trainees to sign a statement 
that they will not undertake employment during their traineeships which 
would interfere with their ability to satisfactorily complete the 
training program in a timely fashion.
    (c) The grantee may not require trainees to perform any work which 
is not an integral part of their training program and required of all 
students in the program, or to perform services which detract from or 
prolong their training.
    (d) The grantee must advise each trainee who is enrolled in a course 
of study which requires more than twelve months that continued support 
under this program is contingent upon the continued availability of 
grant funds.

residence. However, the grantee may not pay an allowance for daily 
commuting from the new place of residence to the field training 
headquarters.
    (iii) The grantee may pay a trainee an allowance from grant funds 
for domestic travel to conduct research to meet dissertation 
requirements.
    (b) The grantee may not give a stipend or allowance to a part-time 
trainee, but may give a traineeship award to pay a part-time trainee's 
tuition and fees.

Sec. 58.211  Duration of traineeships.

    Traineeships must be for a full academic year, except an appointment 
for less than a full academic year may be made when the student will 
complete the program of study at the termination of the appointment, or 
when joint-degree programs require enrollment at another unit of the 
grantee institution for part of the academic year. A traineeship may not 
exceed 12 months in duration. However, consecutive or subsequent 
traineeship appointments may be made if a student's required program of 
study exceeds 12 months. Training for which the student receives a 
traineeship must begin during the period for which funds are made 
available, but may extend beyond the end of this period.

Sec. 59.1  To what programs do these regulations apply?

    The regulations of this subpart are applicable to the award of 
grants under section 1001 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
300) to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family 
planning projects. These projects shall consist of the educational, 
comprehensive medical, and social services necessary to aid individuals 
to determine freely the number and spacing of their children.

[[Page 395]]


<R05>
Sec. 59.2  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Act means the Public Health Service Act, as amended.
    Family means a social unit composed of one person, or two or more 
persons living together, as a household.
    Family planning means the process of establishing objectives for the 
number and spacing of one's children and selecting the means by which 
those objectives may be achieved. These means include a broad range of 
acceptable and effective methods and services to limit or enhance 
fertility, including contraceptive methods (including natural family 
planning and abstinence) and the management of infertility (including 
adoption). Family planning services includes preconceptional counseling, 
education, and general reproductive health care (including diagnosis and 
treatment of infections which threaten reproductive capability). Family 
planning does not include pregnancy care (including obstetric or 
prenatal care). As required by section 1008 of the Act, abortion may not 
be included as a method of family planning in the title X project. 
Family planning, as supported under this subpart, should reduce the 
incidence of abortion.
    Grantee means the organization to which a grant is awarded under 
section 1001 of the Act.
    Low income family means a family whose total annual income does not 
exceed 100 percent of the most recent Community Services Administration 
Income Poverty Guidelines (45 CFR 1060.2). Low-income family also 
includes members of families whose annual family income exceeds this 
amount, but who, as determined by the title X project director, are 
unable, for good reasons, to pay for family planning services. For 
example, unemancipated minors who wish to receive services on a 
confidential basis must be considered on the basis of their own 
resources.
    Nonprofit, as applied to any private agency, institution, or 
organization, means that no part of the entity's net earnings benefit, 
or may lawfully benefit, any private shareholder or individual.
    Prenatal care means medical services provided to a pregnant woman to 
promote maternal and fetal health.
    Program and project are used interchangeably and mean a coherent 
assembly of plans, activities and supporting resources contained within 
an administrative framework.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and any 
other officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services 
to whom the authority involved has been delegated.
    State means one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto 
Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Marianas, or 
the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
    Title X means title X of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq.
    Title X program and title X project are used interchangeably and 
mean the identified program which is approved by the Secretary for 
support under section 1001 of the Act, as the context may require. Title 
X project funds include all funds allocated to the title X program, 
including but not limited to grant funds, grant-related income or 
matching funds.

Sec. 59.3  Who is eligible to apply for a family planning services grant?

    Any public or nonprofit private entity in a State may apply for a 
grant under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 59.4  How does one apply for a family planning services grant?

    (a) Application for a grant under this subpart shall be made on an 
authorized form.
    (b) An individual authorized to act for the applicant and to assume 
on behalf of the applicant the obligations imposed by the terms and 
conditions of the grant, including the regulations of this subpart, must 
sign the application.
    (c) The application shall contain--
    (1) A description, satisfactory to the Secretary, of the project and 
how it will meet the requirements of this subpart;

[[Page 396]]

    (2) A budget and justification of the amount of grant funds 
requested;
    (3) A description of the standards and qualifications which will be 
required for all personnel and for all facilities to be used by the 
project; and
    (4) Such other pertinent information as the Secretary may require.


<R05>
Sec. 59.5  What requirements must be met by a family planning project?

    (a) Each project supported under this part must:
    (1) Provide a broad range of acceptable and effective medically 
approved family planning methods (including natural family planning 
methods) and services (including infertility services and services for 
adolescents). If an organization offers only a single method of family 
planning, such as natural family planning, it may participate as part of 
a title X project as long as the entire title X project offers a broad 
range of family planning services.
    (2) Provide services without subjecting individuals to any coercion 
to accept services or to employ or not to employ any particular methods 
of family planning. Acceptance of services must be solely on a voluntary 
basis and may not be made a prerequisite to eligibility for, or receipt 
of, any other service, assistance from or participation in any other 
program of the applicant.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 Section 205 of Pub. L. 94-63 states: ``Any (1) officer or employee 
of the United States, (2) officer or employee of any State, political 
subdivision of a State, or any other entity, which administers or 
supervises the administration of any program receiving Federal financial 
assistance, or (3) person who receives, under any program receiving 
Federal assistance, compensation for services, who coerces or endeavors 
to coerce any person to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure 
by threatening such person with the loss of, or disqualification for the 
receipt of, any benefit or service under a program receiving Federal 
financial assistance shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned 
for not more than one year, or both.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Provide services in a manner which protects the dignity of the 
individual.
    (4) Provide services without regard to religion, race, color, 
national origin, handicapping condition, age, sex, number of 
pregnancies, or marital status.
    (5) Provide that priority in the provision of services will be given 
to persons from low-income families.
    (6) Provide that no charge will be made for services provided to any 
person from a low-income family except to the extent that payment will 
be made by a third party (including a Government agency) which is 
authorized to or is under legal obligation to pay this charge.
    (7) Provide that charges will be made for services to persons other 
than those from low-income families in accordance with a schedule of 
discounts based on ability to pay, except that charges to persons from 
families whose annual income exceeds 250 percent of the levels set forth 
in the most recent CSA Income Poverty Guidelines (45 CFR 1060.2) will be 
made in accordance with a schedule of fees designed to recover the 
reasonable cost of providing services.
    (8) If a third party (including a Government agency) is authorized 
or legally obligated to pay for services, all reasonable efforts must be 
made to obtain the third-party payment without application of any 
discounts. Where the cost of services is to be reimbursed under title 
XIX or title XX of the Social Security Act, a written agreement with the 
title XIX or title XX agency is required.
    (9)(i) Provide that if an application relates to consolidation of 
service areas or health resources or would otherwise affect the 
operations of local or regional entities, the applicant must document 
that these entities have been given, to the maximum feasible extent, an 
opportunity to participate in the development of the application. Local 
and regional entities include existing or potential subgrantees which 
have previously provided or propose to provide family planning services 
to the area proposed to be served by the applicant.
    (ii) Provide an opportunity for maximum participation by existing or 
potential subgrantees in the ongoing policy decisionmaking of the 
project.
    (10) Provide for an Advisory Committee as required by Sec. 59.6.
    (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, each title

[[Page 397]]

X project must meet each of the following requirements unless the 
Secretary determines that the title X project has established good cause 
for its omission. Each title X project must:
    (1) Provide for medical services related to family planning 
(including physician's consultation, examination prescription, and 
continuing supervision, laboratory examination, contraceptive supplies) 
and necessary referral to other medical facilities when medically 
indicated, and provide for the effective usage of contraceptive devices 
and practices.
    (2) Provide for social services related to family planning, 
including counseling, referral to and from other social and medical 
service agencies, and any ancillary services which may be necessary to 
facilitate clinic attendance.
    (3) Provide for informational and educational programs designed to 
(i) achieve community understanding of the objectives of the title X 
program, (ii) inform the community of the availability of services, and 
(iii) promote continued participation in the title X project by persons 
to whom family planning services may be beneficial.
    (4) Provide for orientation and inservice training for all title X 
project personnel.
    (5) Provide services without the imposition of any durational 
residency requirement or requirement that the patient be referred by a 
physician.
    (6) Provide that family planning medical services will be performed 
under the direction of a physician with special training or experience 
in family planning.
    (7) Provide that all services purchased for title X project 
participants will be authorized by the title X project director or his 
designee on the title X project staff.
    (8) Provide for coordination and use of referral arrangements with 
other providers of health care services, local health and welfare 
departments, hospitals, voluntary agencies, and health services projects 
supported by other Federal programs.
    (9) Provide that if family planning services are provided by 
contract or other similar arrangements with actual providers of 
services, services will be provided in accordance with a plan which 
establishes rates and methods of payment for medical care. These 
payments must be made under agreements with a schedule of rates and 
payment procedures maintained by the grantee. The grantee must be 
prepared to substantiate that these rates are reasonable and necessary.
    (10) Provide, to the maximum feasible extent, an opportunity for 
participation in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the 
title X project by persons broadly representative of all significant 
elements of the population to be served, and by others in the community 
knowledgeable about the community's needs for family planning services.

<R05>
Sec. 59.6  What procedures apply to assure the suitability of informational and educational material?

    (a) A grant under this section may be made only upon assurances 
satisfactory to the Secretary that the title X project shall provide for 
the review and approval of informational and educational materials 
developed or made available under the title X project by an Advisory 
Committee prior to their distribution, to assure that the materials are 
suitable for the population or community to which they are to be made 
available and the purposes of title X of the Act. The title X project 
shall not disseminate any such materials which are not approved by the 
Advisory Committee.
    (b) The Advisory Committee referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be established as follows:
    (1) Size. The Committee shall consist of no fewer than five but not 
more than nine members, except that this provision may be waived by the 
Secretary for good cause shown.

[[Page 398]]

    (2) Composition. The Committee shall include individuals broadly 
representative (in terms of demographic factors such as race, color, 
national origin, handicapped condition, sex, and age) of population or 
community for which the materials are intended.
    (3) Function. In reviewing materials, the Advisory Committee shall:
    (i) Consider the educational and cultural backgrounds of individuals 
to whom the materials are addressed;

<R05>
Sec. 59.7  Standards of compliance with prohibition on abortion.

    A project may not receive funds under this subpart unless it 
provides assurance satisfactory to the Secretary that it does not 
include abortion as a method of family planning. Such assurance must 
include, as a minimum, representations (supported by such documentation 
as the Secretary may request) as to compliance with each of the 
requirements in Sec. 59.8 through Sec. 59.10. A project must comply with 
such requirements at all times during the period for which support under 
title X is provided.

[53 FR 2944, Feb. 2, 1988]

    Editorial Note: For provisions of Sec. 59.7 which have been 
suspended, see the Editorial Note following the Source of Subpart A.


<R05>
Sec. 59.8  Prohibition on counseling and referral for abortion services; limitation of program services to family planning.

    (a)(1) A title X project may not provide counseling concerning the 
use of abortion as a method of family planning or provide referral for 
abortion as a method of family planning.
    (2) Because title X funds are intended only for family planning, 
once a client served by a title X project is diagnosed as pregnant, she 
must be referred for appropriate prenatal and/or social services by 
furnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfare of 
mother and unborn child. She must also be provided with information 
necessary to protect the health of mother and unborn child until such 
time as the referral appointment is kept. In cases in which emergency 
care is required, however, the title X project shall be required only to 
refer the client immediately to an appropriate provider of emergency 
medical services.
    (3) A title X project may not use prenatal, social service or 
emergency medical or other referrals as an indirect means of encouraging 
or promoting abortion as a method of family planning, such as by 
weighing the list of referrals in favor of health care providers which 
perform abortions, by including on the list of referral providers health 
care providers whose principal business is the provision of abortions, 
by excluding available providers who do not provide abortions, or by 
``steering'' clients to providers who offer abortion as a method of 
family planning.
    (4) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as prohibiting the 
provision of information to a project client which is medically 
necessary to assess the risks and benefits of different methods of 
contraception in the course of selecting a method; provided, that the 
provision of this information does not include counseling with respect 
to or otherwise promote abortion as a method of family planning.
    (b) Examples. (1) A pregnant client of a title X project requests 
prenatal care services, which project personnel are qualified to 
provide. Because the provision of such services is outside the scope of 
family planning supported by title X, the client must be referred to 
appropriate providers of prenatal care.
    (2) A title X project discovers an ectopic pregnancy in the course 
of conducting a physical examination of a client. Referral arrangements 
for emergency medical care are immediately

[[Page 399]]

provided. Such action is in compliance with the requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (3) A pregnant woman asks the title X project to provide her with a 
list of abortion providers in the area. The title X project tells her 
that it does not refer for abortion but provides her a list which 
includes, among other health care providers, a local clinic which 
principally provides abortions. Inclusion of the clinic on the list is 
inconsistent with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (4) A pregnant woman asks the title X project to provide her with a 
list of abortion providers in the area. The project tells her that it 
does not refer for abortion and provides her a list which consists of 
hospitals and clinics and other providers which provide prenatal care 
and also provide abortions. None of the entries on the list are 
providers that principally provide abortions. Although there are several 
appropriate providers of prenatal care in the area which do not provide 
or refer for abortions, none of these providers are included on the 
list. Provision of the list is inconsistent with paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (5) A pregnant woman requests information on abortion and asks the 
title X project to refer her to an abortion provider. The project 
counselor tells her that the project does not consider abortion an 
appropriate method of family planning and therefore does not counsel or 
refer for abortion. The counselor further tells the client that the 
project can help her to obtain prenatal care and necessary social 
services, and provides her with a list of such providers from which the 
client may choose. Such actions are consistent with paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (6) Title X project staff provide contraceptive counseling to a 
client in order to assist her in selecting a contraceptive method. In 
discussing oral contraceptives, the project counselor provides the 
client with information contained in the patient package insert 
accompanying a brand of oral contraceptives, referring to abortion only 
in the context of a discussion of the relative safety of various 
contraceptive methods and in no way promoting abortion as a method of 
family planning. The provision of this information does not constitute 
abortion counseling or referral.

    A title X project must be organized so that it is physically and 
financially separate, as determined in accordance with the review 
established in this section, from activities which are prohibited under 
section 1008 of the Act and Sec. 59.8 and Sec. 59.10 of these 
regulations from inclusion in the title X program. In order to be 
physically and financially separate, a title X project must have an 
objective integrity and independence from prohibited activities. Mere 
bookkeeping separation of title X funds from other monies is not 
sufficient. The Secretary will determine whether such objective 
integrity and independence exist based on a review of facts and 
circumstances. Factors relevant to this determination shall include (but 
are not limited to):
    (a) The existence of separate accounting records;
    (b) The degree of separation from facilities (e.g., treatment, 
consultation, examination, and waiting rooms) in which prohibited 
activities occur and the extent of such prohibited activities;
    (c) The existence of separate personnel;
    (d) The extent to which signs and other forms of identification of 
the title X project are present and signs and material promoting 
abortion are absent.

<R05>
Sec. 59.10  Prohibition on activities that encourage, promote or advocate abortion.

    (a) A title X project may not encourage, promote or advocate 
abortion as a

[[Page 400]]

method of family planning. This requirement prohibits actions to assist 
women to obtain abortions or increase the availability or accessibility 
of abortion for family planning purposes. Prohibited actions include the 
use of title X project funds for the following:
    (1) Lobbying for the passage of legislation to increase in any way 
the availability of abortion as a method of family planning;
    (2) Providing speakers to promote the use of abortion as a method of 
family planning;
    (3) Paying dues to any group that as a significant part of its 
activities advocates abortion as a method of family planning;
    (4) Using legal action to make abortion available in any way as a 
method of family planning; and
    (5) Developing or disseminating in any way materials (including 
printed matter and audiovisual materials) advocating abortion as a 
method of family planning.
    (b) Examples. (1) Clients at a title X project are given brochures 
advertising an abortion clinic. Provision of the brochure violates 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) A title X project makes an appointment for a pregnant client 
with an abortion clinic. The title X project has violated paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (3) A title X project pays dues to a state association which, among 
other activities, lobbies at state and local levels for the passage of 
legislation to protect and expand the legal availability of abortion as 
a method of family planning. The association spends a significant amount 
of its annual budget on such activity. Payment of dues to the 
association violates paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (4) An organization conducts a number of activities, including 
operating a title X project. The organization uses non-project funds to 
pay dues to an association which, among other activities, engages in 
lobbying to protect and expand the legal availability of abortion as a 
method of family planning. The association spends a significant amount 
of its annual budget on such activity. Payment of dues to the 
association by the organization does not violate paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.
    (5) An organization that operates a title X project engages in 
lobbying to increase the legal availability of abortion as a method of 
family planning. The project itself engages in no such activities and 
the facilities and funds of the project are kept separate from 
prohibited activities. The project is not in violation of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.
    (6) Employees of a title X project write their legislative 
representatives in support of legislation seeking to expand the legal 
availability of abortion, using no project funds to do so. The title X 
project has not violated paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (7) On her own time and at her own expense, a title X project 
employee speaks before a legislative body in support of abortion as a 
method of family planning. The title X project has not violated 
paragraph (a) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 59.11  What criteria will the Department of Health and Human Services use to decide which family planning services projects to fund and in what amount?

    (a) Within the limits of funds available for these purposes, the 
Secretary may award grants for the establishment and operation of those 
title X projects which will in the Department's judgment best promote 
the purposes of section 1001 of the Act, taking into account:
    (1) The number of patients and, in particular, the number of low-
income patients to be served;
    (2) The extent to which family planning services are needed locally;
    (3) The relative need of the applicant;
    (4) The capacity of the applicant to make rapid and effective use of 
the Federal assistance;
    (5) The adequacy of the applicant's facilities and staff;
    (6) The relative availability of non-Federal resources within the 
community to be served and the degree to

[[Page 401]]

which those resources are committed to the project; and
    (7) The degree to which the title X project plan adequately provides 
for the requirements set forth in these regulations.
    (b) The Secretary shall determine the amount of any award on the 
basis of his estimate of the sum necessary for the performance of the 
title X project. No grant may be made for less than 90 percent of the 
title X project's costs, as so estimated, unless the grant is to be made 
for a title X project which was supported, under section 1001, for less 
than 90 percent of its costs in fiscal year 1975. In that case, the 
grant shall not be for less than the percentage of costs covered by the 
grant in fiscal year 1975.
    (c) No grant may be made for an amount equal to 100 percent of the 
title X project's estimated costs.

<R05>
Sec. 59.12  How is a grant awarded?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long HHS intends to 
support the title X project without requiring the project to recompete 
for funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 3 
to 5 years.
    (b) Generally the grant will initially be for 1 year and subsequent 
continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. A grantee must 
submit a separate application to have the support continued for each 
subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding 
level of such awards will be made after consideration of such factors as 
the grantee's progress and management practices, and the availability of 
funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a determination by HHS 
that continued funding is in the best interest of the Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.

Secretary

[[Page 404]]

may award grants to assist in the establishment and operation of those 
projects which will in his judgment best promote the purposes of section 
1003 of the Act, taking into account:
    (1) The extent to which a training program will increase the 
delivery of services to people, particularly low-income groups, with a 
high percentage of unmet need for family planning services;
    (2) The extent to which the training program promises to fulfill the 
family planning services delivery needs of the area to be served, which 
may include, among other things:
    (i) Development of a capability within family planning service 
projects to provide pre- and in-service training to their own staffs;

    (6) The degree to which the project plan adequately provides for the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 59.205.
    (b) The amount of any award shall be determined by the Secretary on 
the basis of his estimate of the sum necessary for all or a designated 
portion of direct project costs plus an additional amount for indirect 
costs, if any, which will be calculated by the Secretary either: (1) On 
the basis of his estimate of the actual indirect costs reasonably 
related to the project, or (2) on the basis of a percentage of all, or a 
portion of, the estimated direct costs of the project when there are 
reasonable assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed 
the approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an 
estimated provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct 
costs (such as travel or supply costs) subject to upward (within the 
limits of available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual 
costs when the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional 
items has been determined by the Secretary.
    (c) Allowability of costs shall be in conformance with the 
applicable cost principles prescribed by Subpart Q of 35 CFR part 74.
    (d) All grant awards shall be in writing, shall set forth the amount

Rights Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) and in 
particular section 601 of such Act which provides that no person in the 
United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin 
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving 
Federal financial assistance. A regulation impelmenting such title VI, 
which applies to grants made under this part, has been issued by the

<R05>
Sec. 59.210   Inventions or discoveries.

    Any grant award pursuant to Sec. 59.206 is subject to the 
regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services as set forth 
in 45 CFR parts 6 and 8, as amended. Such regulations shall apply to any 
activity for which grant funds are in fact used whether within the scope 
of the project as approved or otherwise. Appropriate measures shall be 
taken by the grantee and by the Secretary to assure that no contracts, 
assignments or other arrangements inconsistent with the grant obligation 
are continued or entered into and that all personnel involved in the 
supported activity are aware of and comply with such obligations. 
Laboratory notes, related technical data, and information pertaining to

derived from other grant awards. With respect to each approved project 
the grantee shall account for the sum total of all amounts paid by 
presenting or otherwise making available evidence satisfactory to the 
Secretary of expenditures for direct and indirect costs meeting the 
requirements of this part: Provided, however, That when the amount 
awarded for indirect costs was based on a predetermined fixed-percentage 
of estimated direct costs, the amount allowed for indirect costs shall 
be computed on the basis of such predetermined fixed-percentage rates 
applied to the total, or a selected element thereof, of the reimbursable 
direct costs incurred.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Accounting for grant-related income--(1) Interest. Pursuant to 
section 203 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
4213), a State will not be held accountable for interest earned on grant 
funds, pending their disbursement for grant purposes. A State, as 
defined in section 102 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, means 
any one of the several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
any territory or possession of the United States, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a State, but does not include the governments of the 
political subdivisions of the State. All grantees

[[Page 406]]

other than a State, as defined in this subsection, must return all 
interest earned on grant funds to the Federal Government.
    (d) Grant closeout--(1) Date of final accounting. A grantee shall 
render, with respect to each approved project, a full account, as 
provided herein, as of the date of the termination of grant support. The 
Secretary may require other special and periodic accounting.
    (2) Final settlement. There shall be payable to the Federal 
Government as final settlement with respect to each approved project the 
total sum of:
    (i) Any amount not accounted for pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (ii) Any credits for earned interest pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section;
    (iii) Any other amounts due pursuant to subparts F, M, and O of 45 
CFR part 74.

Such total sum shall constitute a debt owed by the grantee to the 
Federal Government and shall be recovered from the grantee or its 
successors or assignees by setoff or other action as provided by law.

<R05>
Sec. 59a.5  Awards.

    (a) General. Within the limits of funds available, the Secretary may 
award grants to those applicants whose proposals for establishments, 
expansion, or improvement will, in the Secretary's judgment, best 
promote the purposes of section 474 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 286b-5).
    (b) Determination of award amount. An Award may not exceed 
$1,000,000 or other amount established by law for any fiscal year.
    (1) The scope of medical-library or related services provided by the 
applicant for the population and purposes it serves considering:
    (i) The number of graduate and undergraduate students, and 
physicians and other practitioners in health-related sciences making use 
of the applicant's library resources;
    (ii) The type and availability of library support staff;
    (iii) The type, size, and qualifications of the faculty of any 
school with which the applicant is affiliated;
    (iv) The staff of any hospitals or clinics with which the 
applicant's library is affiliated;

non-Federal sources of the applicant's proposed activity during and 
after the period of award. The Secretary shall consider the level of 
non-Federal support for the proposed activity for periods prior to the 
fiscal year in which a grant is made. The Secretary shall require the 
applicant's assurance that non-Federal support will not be diminished as 
a result of the award and that adequate support for this activity will 
be continued during and after the period of Federal assistance.
    (c) Project period. (1) the notice of grant award specifies how long 
the Secretary intends to support the project

[[Page 408]]

without requiring the project to recompete for funds. This period, 
called the project period, will usually be for one to five years.
    (2) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year at a time 
and subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. 
A grantee must submit a separate application to have the support 
continued for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation 
awards and the funding level of these awards will be made after 
consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management 
practices, and the availability of funds. In all cases, continuation 
awards require a determination by the Secretary that continued funding 
is in the best interest of the Federal Government.
    (3) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award for any approved 
application or portion of an approved application.

<R05>
Sec. 59a.6  How may funds or materials be used?

    Authority: 42 U.S.C. 286b-2, 286b-6.


<R05>
Sec. 59a.11  Programs to which these regulations apply.

    (a) This subpart applies to grants made under section 475 of the Act 
(42 U.S.C. 286b-6). Grants are awarded to medical libraries to enable 
them to serve as regional medical libraries for their geographic areas. 
The purpose of the program is to develop a national system of regional 
medical libraries, each of which would have sufficient facilities to 
supplement the services of other medical libraries in its region.
    (b) The purpose of the program may also be supported by contracts. 
Since the primary purpose of these contracts is to assist regional 
libraries and is not for the purpose of acquiring supplies or services 
for use of the Federal Government, the provisions of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1) do not apply. Any contract 
awarded pursuant to section 475 of the Act shall be subject to the 
applicable provisions of this subpart.


<R05>

established by section 466 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 286a).
    Geographic area means an area that forms an academically and 
professionally integrated region. Factors considered are location and 
extent of communication facilities and systems, presence and 
distribution of educational and medical and health facilities and 
programs and other activities which, in the Secretary's opinion, justify 
the establishment and operation of a regional medical library.
    Modify and increase means the use of Federal funds or materials to 
supplement rather than supplant non-Federal funds available for library 
resources and services.
    Project period--See Sec. 59a.15(b).
    Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and any 
other official of the Department of Health and Human Services to whom 
the authority involved is delegated.


<R05>
Sec. 59a.13  Who is eligible for a grant?

    Except as otherwise prohibited by law, any public or private 
nonprofit organization which is authorized and qualified to operate a

    In addition to any other pertinent information which the Secretary 
may require, the applicant shall submit a grant application containing a 
detailed description of a program to provide health-sciences 
informational services for the geographic area in which it is located. 
The description shall include:

<R05>
Sec. 59a.15  Awards.

    (a) General. The Secretary, with the advice of the Board in each 
case, shall award grants to those applicants whose arrangements and 
proposed services will, in the Secretary's judgment, have the greatest 
potential for fulfilling the need for a regional medical library. The 
Secretary, in determining the priority assigned an applicant, must 
consider:
    (1) The adequacy of the applicant's library in terms of collections, 
personnel, equipment, and other facilities; and
    (2) The size and nature of the population to be served in the 
applicant's region.
    (b) Project period. (1) The notice of grant award specifies how long 
the Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the 
project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, 
will usually be for one to five years.
    (2) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of these awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (3) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or

[[Page 410]]

other award for any approved application or portion of an approved 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 59a.16  What other conditions apply?

    Although the Secretary may approve exceptions which are consistent 
with program purposes, in addition to other terms, conditions, and 
assurances required by law, each grantee must meet the following 
requirements:
    (a) Use of funds. Any funds granted under this subpart shall be 
expended solely for the purpose for which the funds were granted in 
accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of 
this subpart, the terms and conditions of the award, and the applicable 
cost principles in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74.
    (b) Library resources--(1) Provision of services. The grantee shall 
modify and increase its library resources to provide supportive services 
to other health-sciences informational activities.
    (2) Access to and fees for services. The grantee shall provide free 
loan services to qualified users or, in lieu of loans, make available 
photoduplicated or facsimile copies of biomedical materials which 
qualified requesters may retain. Reasonable fees may be charged for 
copies or other services (other than free loan services) provided by a 
grantee under this subpart: Provided, That equal access to the health-
information resources of the region or of the national network is 
assured. These fees shall be designed to recover expenses. The grantee's 
access policies shall determine the qualifications of individuals or 
organizations for access to the services provided under the grant, so 
long as those policies are consistent with the mandatory service 
undertakings of the program. The Secretary may review the grantee's 
access policies to assure compliance with this requirement.

<R04>
                 Subpart A--General Program Description


<R05>
Sec. 60.1  What is the HEAL program?

    (a) The Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program is a program 
of Federal insurance of educational loans to graduate students in the 
fields of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary 
medicine, optometry, podiatric medicine, pharmacy, public health, 
chiropractic, health administration and clinical psychology. The basic 
purpose of the program is to encourage lenders to make loans to students 
in these fields who desire to borrow money to pay for their educational 
costs. In addition, certain nonstudents (such as doctors serving as 
interns or residents) can borrow in order to pay the current interest 
charges accruing on earlier HEAL loans. By taking a HEAL loan, the 
borrower is obligated to repay the lender or holder the full amount of 
the money borrowed, plus all interest which accrues on the loan.
    (b) HEAL loans may be made by schools, banks, credit unions, State 
agencies, and other institutions eligible as lenders under Sec. 60.30. 
HEAL school eligibility is described in Sec. 60.50.
    (c) The Secretary insures each lender or holder for the losses of 
principal and interest it may incur in the event that a borrower dies; 
becomes totally and permanently disabled; files for bankruptcy under 
chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act; files for bankruptcy under 
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and files a compliant to determine the 
dischargeability of the HEAL loan; or defaults on his or her loan. In 
these instances, if the lender or holder has complied with all HEAL 
statutes and regulations, and with the lender's or holder's insurance 
contract, and the Secretary pays the amount of the loss to the lender or 
holder, the borrower's loan is then assigned to the Secretary. Only at 
that time, the United States Government becomes the borrower's direct 
creditor and will actively pursue the borrower for repayment of the 
debt, including reporting the borrower's default on the loan to consumer 
credit reporting agencies or to the Internal Revenue Service for 
purposes of locating such taxpayer or for income

[[Page 412]]

tax refund offset, and referral to the Department of Justice for 
litigation.
    (d) Any person who knowingly makes a false statement or 
misrepresentation in a HEAL loan transaction, bribes or attempts to 
bribe a Federal official, fraudulently obtains a HEAL loan, or commits 
any other illegal action in connection with a HEAL loan is subject to 
possible fine and imprisonment under Federal statute.
    (e) Calculating time periods. In counting the number of days allowed 
to comply with any provisions of these regulations, Saturdays, Sundays, 
and holidays are to be included. However, if a due date falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the due date is the next Federal 
work day.

(only to the extent that they are directly related to the borrower's 
education), and the HEAL insurance premium.
    (h) He or she must require the loan to pursue the course of study at 
the school. This determination of the maximum amount of the loan will be 
made by the school, applying the considerations in Sec. 60.51(f).
    (i) If required under section 3 of the Military Selective Service 
Act to present himself for and submit to registration under such 
section, he must

Sec. 60.8  What are the borrower's major rights and responsibilities?

    (a) The borrower's rights. (1) Once the terms of the HEAL loan have 
been established, the lender or holder may not change them without the 
borrower's consent.
    (2) The lender must provide the borrower with a copy of the 
completed promissory note when the loan is made. The lender or holder

full.
    (3) A lender must disburse HEAL loan proceeds as described in 
Sec. 60.33(f).
    (4) The lender or holder must provide the borrower with a copy of 
the repayment schedule before repayment begins.
    (5) If the loan is sold from one lender or holder to another lender 
or holder, or if the loan is serviced by a party other than the lender 
or holder, the buyer must notify the borrower within 30 days of the 
transaction.
    (6) The borrower does not have to begin repayment until 9 full 
months after leaving school or an accredited internship or residency 
program as described in Sec. 60.11.
    (7) The borrower is entitled to deferment from repayment of the

more fully described in Sec. 60.37.
    (12) Any borrower who received a fixed interest rate HEAL loan in 
excess of 12 percent per year may enter into an agreement with the 
lender which made this loan for the reissuance of the loan in accordance

    (b) The borrower's responsibilities. (1) The borrower must pay any

against the discharge of a HEAL loan applies to bankruptcy under any 
chapter of the Bankruptcy Act, including Chapter 13. A borrower may have 
a HEAL loan discharged in bankruptcy after the first 5 years of the 
repayment period only upon a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the 
non-discharge of such debt would be unconscionable and upon the 
condition that the Secretary shall not have waived his or her rights to 
reduce any Federal reimbursements or Federal payments for health 
services under any Federal law in amounts up to the balance of the loan.
    (6) If the borrower fails to make payments on the loan on time, the 
total amount to be repaid by the borrower may be increased by additional 
interest, late charges, attorney's fees, court costs, and other 
collection charges. In addition, the Secretary may offset amounts 
attributable to an unpaid loan from reimbursements or payment for health 
services provided under any Federal law to a defaulted borrower 
practicing his or her profession.

<R05>
Sec. 60.10  How much can be borrowed?

    (a) Student borrower. An eligible student may borrow an amount to be 
used solely for expenses, as described in Sec. 60.5(g), incurred or to 
be incurred over a period of up to an academic year and disbursed in 
accordance with Sec. 60.33(f). The maximum amount he or she may receive 
for that period shall be determined by the school in accordance with 
Sec. 60.51(f) within the following limitations:
    (1) A student enrolled in a school of medicine, osteopathic 
medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry or podiatric 
medicine may borrow up to $80,000 under this part. The amount received 
may not exceed $20,000 in any academic year.
    (2) A student enrolled in a school of public health, pharmacy, 
chiropractic, or a graduate program in health administration, clinical 
psychology, or allied health may borrow up to $50,000 under this part. 
The amount received may not exceed $12,500 per academic year.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph, an academic year means the 
traditional approximately 9-month September-to-June annual session. For 
the purpose of computing academic year equivalents for students who, 
during a 12-month period, attend for a longer period than the 
traditional academic year, the academic year will be considered to be 9 
months in length.
    (4) The student's estimated cost of attendance shall not exceed the 
estimated cost of attendance of all students in like circumstances 
pursuing a similar curriculum at that school.
    (b) Non-student borrower. An eligible nonstudent may borrow amounts 
under this authority with the following restrictions:
    (1) In no case may an eligible nonstudent borrower receive a loan 
that is greater than the sum of the HEAL insurance premium plus the 
interest that is expected to accrue and must be paid on the borrower's 
HEAL loans during the period for which the new loan is intended.
    (2) An eligible nonstudent in the field of medicine, ostepathic 
medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry,

[[Page 416]]

or podiatric medicine may borrow up to $80,000 under this part including 
loans obtained while the borrower was a student. The loan amount may not 
exceed $20,000 in any 12-month period.
    (3) An eligible nonstudent in the field of pharmacy, public health, 
chiropractic, health administration, or clinical psychology may borrow 
up to $50,000 under this part including loans obtained while the 
borrower was a student. The loan amount received under this part may not 
exceed $12,500 in any 12-month period.

<R05>
Sec. 60.11  Terms of repayment.

    (a) Commencement of repayment. (1) The borrower's repayment period 
must begin the first day of the 10th month after the month he or she 
ceases to be a full-time student at a HEAL school. The 9-month period 
before the repayment period begins is popularly called the ``grace 
period.''
    (i) Postponement for internship or residency program. However, if 
the borrower becomes an intern or resident in an accredited program 
within 9 full months after leaving school, then the borrower's repayment 
period must begin the first day of the 10th month after the month he or 
she ceases to be an intern or resident. For a borrower who receives his 
or her first HEAL loan on or after October 22, 1985, this postponement 
of the beginning of the repayment period for participation in an 
internship or residency program is limited to 4 years.
    (ii) Postponement for fellowship training or educational activity. 
For any HEAL loan received on or after October 22, 1985, if the borrower 
becomes an intern or resident in an accredited program within 9 full 
months after leaving school, and subsequently enters into a fellowship 
training program or an educational activity, as described in 
Sec. 60.12(b)(1) and (2), within 9 months after the completion of the 
accredited internship or residency program or prior to the completion of 
such program, the borrower's repayment period begins on the first day of 
the 10th month after the month he or she ceases to be a participant in 
the fellowship training program or educational activity. Postponement of 
the commencement of the repayment period for either activity is limited 
to 2 years.
    (iii) Non-student borrower. If a nonstudent borrower obtains another 
HEAL loan during the grace period or period of internship, residency, or 
deferment (as defined in Sec. 60.12), the borrower must begin to repay 
this loan when repayment on the borrower's other HEAL loans begins or 
resumes.
    (2) An accredited internship or residency program must be approved 
by one of the following accrediting agencies:
    (i) Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.
    (ii) Council on Optometric Education.
    (iii) Commission on Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary 
Programs.
    (iv) American Osteopathic Association.
    (v) Council on Podiatry Education.
    (vi) American Council on Pharmaceutical Education.
    (vii) Council on Education for Public Health.
    (viii) American College of Veterinary Surgeons.
    (ix) Council on Chiropractic Education.
    (b) Length of repayment period. In general, a lender or holder must 
allow a borrower at least 10 years, but not more than 25 years, to repay 
a loan calculated from the beginning of the repayment period. A borrower 
must fully repay a loan within 33 years from the date that the loan is 
made.
    (1) For a HEAL borrower who received any HEAL loan prior to October 
22, 1985, periods of deferment (as described in Sec. 60.12) are not 
included when calculating the 10 to 25 or 33 year limitations.
    (2) For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan on or 
after October 22, 1985, periods of deferment (as described in 
Sec. 60.12) are included when calculating the 33 year limitation, but 
are not included when calculating the 10 to 25 year limitation.
    (c) Prepayment. The borrower may prepay the whole or any part of the 
loan at any time without penalty.
    (d) Minimum annual payment. During each year of repayment, a 
borrower's

[[Page 417]]

payments to all holders of his or her HEAL loans must total the interest 
that accrues during the year on all of the loans, unless the borrower, 
in the promissory note or other written agreement, agrees to make 
payments during any year or any repayment period in a lesser amount.
    (e) Repayment schedule agreement. At least 30 and not more than 60 
days before the commencement of the repayment period, a borrower must 
contact the holder of the loan to establish the precise terms of 
repayment. The borrower may select a monthly repayment schedule with 
substantially equal installment payments or a monthly repayment schedule 
with graduated installment payments that increase in amount over the 
repayment period. If the borrower does not contact the lender or holder 
and does not respond to contacts from the lender or holder, the lender 
or holder may establish a monthly repayment schedule with substantially 
equal installment payments, subject to the terms of the borrower's HEAL 
note.
    (f) Supplemental repayment agreement. (1) A lender or holder and a 
borrower may enter into an agreement supplementing the regular repayment 
schedule agreement. Under a supplemental repayment agreement, the lender 
or holder agrees to consider that the borrower has met the terms of the 
regular repayment schedule as long as the borrower makes payments in 
accordance with the supplemental schedule.
    (2) The purpose of a supplemental repayment agreement is to permit a 
lender or holder, at its option, to offer a borrower a repayment 
schedule based on other than equal or graduated payments. (For example, 
a supplemental repayment agreement may base the amount of the borrower's 
payments on his or her income.)
    (3) The supplemental schedule must contain terms which, according to 
the Secretary, do not unduly burden the borrower and do not extend the 
Secretary's insurance liability beyond the number of years specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section. The supplemental schedule must be 
approved by the Secretary prior to the start of repayment.
    (4) The lender or holder may establish a supplemental repayment 
agreement over the borrower's objection only if the borrower's written 
consent to enter into a supplemental agreement was obtained by the 
lender at the time the loan was made.
    (5) A lender or holder may assign a loan subject to a supplemental 
repayment agreement only if it specifically notifies the buyer of the 
terms of the supplemental agreement. In such cases, the loan and the 
supplemental agreement must be assigned together.

Sec. 60.12  Deferment.

    (a) After the repayment period has commenced, installments of 
principal and interest need not be paid during any period:
    (1) During which the borrower is pursuing a full-time course of 
study at a HEAL school or at an institution of higher education that is 
a ``participating school'' in the Guaranteed Student Loan Program;
    (2) Up to 4 years during which the borrower is a participant in an 
accredited internship or residency program, as described in 
Sec. 60.11(a)(2). For a borrower who receives his or her first HEAL loan 
on or after October 22, 1985, this total of 4 years for an internship or 
residency program includes any period of postponement of the repayment 
period, as described in Sec. 60.11(a)(1);
    (3) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a member of the Armed 
Forces of the United States;
    (4) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is in service as a 
volunteer under the Peace Corps Act;
    (5) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a member of the 
National Health Service Corps; or
    (6) Up to 3 years during which the borrower is a full-time volunteer 
under title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973.
    (b) For any HEAL loan received on or after October 22, 1985, after 
the repayment period has commenced, installments of principal and 
interest need

[[Page 418]]

not be paid during any period for up to 2 years during which the 
borrower is a participant in:
    (1) A fellowship training program, which:
    (i) Is directly related to the discipline for which the borrower 
received the HEAL loan;
    (ii) Begins within 12 months after the borrower ceases to be a 
participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as 
described in Sec. 60.11(a)(2), or prior to the completion of the 
borrower's participation in such program;
    (iii) Is a full-time activity in reasearch or reserch training or 
health care policy;
    (iv) Is not a part of, an extension of, or associated with an 
internship or residency program, as described in Sec. 60.11(a)(2);
    (v) Pays no stipend or one which is not more than the annual stipend 
level established by the Public Health Service for the payment of 
uniform levels of financial support for trainees receiving graduate and 
professional training under Public Health Service grants, as in effect 
at the time the borrower requests the deferment; and
    (vi) Is a formally established fellowship program which was not 
created for a specific individual; or
    (2) A full-time educational activity at an institution defined by 
section 435(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 which:
    (i) Is directly related to the discipline for which the borrower 
received the HEAL loan;
    (ii) Begins within 12 months after the borrower ceases to be a 
participant in an accredited internship or residency program, as 
described in Sec. 60.11(a)(2), or prior to the completion of the 
borrower's participation in such program;
    (iii) Is not a part of, an extension of, or associated with an 
internship or residency program, as described in Sec. 60.11(a)(2); and
    (iv) Is required for licensure, registration, or certification in 
the State in which the borrower intends to practice the discipline for 
which the borrower received the HEAL program loan.
    (c) (1) To receive a deferment, including a deferral of the onset of 
the repayment period (see Sec. 60.11(a)), a borrower must at least 30 
days prior to, but not more than 60 days prior to, the onset of the 
activity and annually thereafter, submit to the lender or holder 
evidence of his or her status in the deferment activity and evidence 
that verifies deferment eligibility of the activity (with the full 
expectation that the borrower will begin the activity). It is the 
responsibility of the borrower to provide the lender or holder with all 
required information or other information regarding the requested 
deferment. If written evidence that verifies eligibility of the activity 
and the borrower for the deferment, including a certification from an 
authorized official (e.g., the director of the fellowship activity, the 
dean of the school, etc.), is received by the lender or holder within 
the required time limit, the lender or holder must approve the 
deferment. The lender or holder may rely in good faith upon statements 
of the borrower and the authorized official, except where those 
statements or other information conflict with information available to 
the lender or holder. When those verification statements or other 
information conflict with information available to the lender or holder, 
to indicate that the applicant fails to meet the requirements for 
deferment, the lender or holder may not approve the deferment until 
those conflicts are resolved.
    (2) For those activities described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of 
this section, the borrower may request that the Secretary review a 
decision by the lender or holder denying the deferment by sending to the 
Secretary copies of the application for deferment and the lender's or 
holder's denial of the request. However, if information submitted to the 
lender or holder conflicts with other information available to the 
lender or holder, to indicate that the borrower fails to meet the 
requirements for deferment, the borrower may not request a review until 
such conflicts have been resolved. During the review process, the lender 
or holder must comply with any requests for information made by the 
Secretary. If the Secretary determines that the fellowship or 
educational activity is eligible for deferment and so notifies the

[[Page 419]]

lender or holder, the lender or holder must approve the deferment.

Sec. 60.13  Interest.

    (a) Rate. At the lender's option, the interest rate on the HEAL loan 
may be calculated on a fixed rate or on a variable rate basis. However, 
whichever method is selected must continue over the life of the loan, 
except where the loan is consolidated with another HEAL loan.
    (1) For all loans made on or after October 22, 1985, for each 
calendar quarter, the Secretary determines the maximum annual HEAL 
interest rate by determining the average of the bond equivalent rates 
reported for the 91-day U.S. Treasury bills auctioned for the preceding 
calendar quarter, adding 3 percentage points, and rounding that amount 
to the next higher one-eighth of 1 percent.
    (2) Interest that is calculated on a fixed rate basis is determined 
for the life of the loan during the calendar quarter in which the loan 
is executed. It may not exceed the rate determined for that quarter by 
the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) Interest that is calculated on a variable rate basis varies 
every calendar quarter throughout the life of the loan as the market 
price of U.S. Treasury bills changes. For any quarter it may not exceed 
the rate determined by the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (4) The Secretary announces the rate determined under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section on a quarterly basis through a notice published 
in the Federal Register.
    (b) Compounding of interest. Interest accrues from the date the loan 
is disbursed until the loan is paid in full. Unpaid accrued interest 
shall be compounded not more frequently than semiannually and added to 
principal. However, a lender or holder may postpone the compounding of 
interest before the beginning of the repayment period or during periods 
of deferment or forbearance and add interest to principal at the time 
repayment of principal begins or resumes.
    (c) Payment. Repayment of principal and interest is due when the 
repayment period begins. A lender or holder must permit a borrower to 
postpone paying interest before the beginning of the repayment period or 
during a period of deferment or forbearance. In these cases, payment of 
interest begins or resumes on the date repayment of principal begins or 
resumes.
    (d) Usury laws. No provision of any Federal or State law that limits 
the rate or amount of interest payable on loans shall apply to a HEAL 
loan.

<R05>
Sec. 60.14  The insurance premium.

    (a) General. (1) The Secretary insures each lender or holder for the 
losses of principal and interest it may incur in the event that a 
borrower dies; becomes totally and permanently disabled; files for 
bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act; files for 
bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and files a complaint 
to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; or defaults on his 
or her loan. For this insurance, the Secretary charges the lender an 
insurance premium. The insurance premium is due to the Secretary on the 
date of disbursement of the HEAL loan.
    (2) The lender may charge the borrower an amount equal to the cost 
of the insurance premium. The cost of the insurance premium may be 
charged to the borrower by the lender in the form of a one-time special 
charge with no subsequent adjustments required. The lender may bill the 
borrower separately for the insurance premium or may deduct an amount 
attributable to it from the loan proceeds before the loan is disbursed. 
In either case, the lender must clearly identify to the borrower the 
amount of the insurance premium and the method of calculation.
    (3) If the lender does not pay the insurance premium on or before 30 
days after disbursement of the loan, a late fee will be charged on a 
daily basis at the same rate as the interest rate that the lender 
charges for the HEAL loan

[[Page 420]]

for which the insurance premium is past due. The lender may not pass on 
this late fee to the borrower.
    (4) HEAL insurance coverage ceases to be effective if the insurance 
premium is not paid within 60 days of the disbursement of the loan.
    (5) Except in cases of error, premiums are not refundable by the 
Secretary, and need not be refunded by the lender to the borrower, even 
if the borrower graduates or withdraws from the school, defaults, dies 
or becomes totally and permanently disabled.
    (b) Rate. The rate of the insurance premium shall not exceed the 
statutory maximum. The Secretary announces changes in the rate of the 
insurance premium through a notice published in the Federal Register.
    (c) Method of calculation--(1) Student borrowers. For loans 
disbursed prior to July 22, 1986, the lender must calculate the 
insurance premium on the basis of the number of months beginning with 
the month following the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed 
to the student borrower and ending 9 full months after the month of the 
student's anticipated date of graduation. For loans disbursed on or 
after July 22, 1986, the insurance premium shall be calculated as a one-
time flat rate on the principal of the loan at the time of disbursement.
    (2) Non-student borrowers. For loans disbursed prior to July 22, 
1986, the lender must calculate the insurance premium for nonstudent 
borrowers on the basis of the number of months beginning with the month 
following the month in which the loan proceeds are disbursed to the 
borrower and ending at the conclusion of the month preceding the month 
in which repayment of principal is expected to begin or resume on the 
borrower's previous HEAL loans. For loans disbursed on or after July 22, 
1986, the insurance premium shall be calculated as a one-time flat rate 
on the principal of the loan at the time of disbursement.
    (3) Multiple installments. In cases where the lender disburses the 
loan in multiple installments, the insurance premium is calculated for 
each disbursement.

<R05>
Sec. 60.15  Other charges to the borrower.

    (a) Late charges. If the borrower fails to pay all of a required 
installment payment or fails to provide written evidence that verifies 
eligibility for the deferment of the payment within 30 days after the 
payment's due date, the lender or holder will require that the borrower 
pay a late charge. A late charge must be equal to 5 percent of the 
unpaid portion of the payment due.
    (b) Collection charges. The lender or holder may also require that 
the borrower pay the holder of the note for reasonable costs incurred by 
the holder or its agent in collecting any installment not paid when due. 
These costs may include attorney's fees, court costs, telegrams, and 
long-distance phone calls. The holder may not charge the borrower for 
the normal costs associated with preparing letters and making personal 
and local telephone contacts with the borrower. A service agency's fee 
for normal servicing of a loan may not be passed on to the borrower, 
either directly or indirectly. No charges, other than those authorized 
by this section, may be passed on to the borrower, either directly or 
indirectly, without prior approval of the Secretary.
    (c) Other loan making costs.  A lender may not pass on to the 
borrower any cost of making a HEAL loan other than the costs of the 
insurance premium.

<R05>
Sec. 60.16  Power of attorney.

    Neither a lender nor a school may obtain a borrower's power of 
attorney or other authorization to endorse a disbursement check on 
behalf of a borrower. The borrower must personally endorse the check and 
may not authorize anyone else to endorse it on his or her behalf.

[[Page 421]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.17  Security and endorsement.

    (a) A HEAL loan must be made without security.
    (b) With one exception, it must also be made without endorsement. If 
a borrower is a minor and cannot under State law create a legally 
binding obligation by his or her own signature, a lender may require an 
endorsement by another person on the borrower's HEAL note. For purposes 
of this paragraph, an ``endorsement'' means a signature of anyone other 
than the borrower who is to assume either primary or secondary liability 
on the note.


<R05>
Sec. 60.18  Consolidation of HEAL loans.

    HEAL loans may be consolidated as follows provided that the lender 
or holder must first inform the borrower of the effect of the 
consolidation on the interest rate and explain to the borrower that he 
or she is not required to agree to the consolidation:
    (a) If a lender or holder holds two or more HEAL loans made to the 
same borrower, the lender or holder and the borrower may agree to 
consolidate the loans into a single HEAL loan obligation evidenced by 
one promissory note.
    (b) A HEAL loan may be consolidated with any other loan only if:
    (1) The consolidation will not result in terms less favorable to the 
borrower than if no consolidation had occurred, and
    (2) The Federal Government does not, as a result of the 
consolidation, become liable for any payment of principal or interest 
for a Guaranteed Student Loan under the provisions of section 439(o) of 
the Higher Education Act of 1965.

Sec. 60.19  Forms.

    All HEAL forms are approved by the Secretary and may not be changed 
without prior approval by the Secretary. HEAL forms shall not be signed 
in blank by a borrower, a school, a lender or holder, or an agent of any 
of these. The Secretary may prescribe who must complete the forms, and 
when and to whom the forms must be sent. All HEAL forms must contain a 
statement that any person who knowingly makes a false statement or 
misrepresentation in a HEAL loan transaction, bribes or attempts to 
bribe a Federal official, fraudulently obtains a HEAL loan, or commits 
any other illegal action in connection with a HEAL loan is subject to 
possible fine and imprisonment under Federal statute.

<R05>
Sec. 60.20  The Secretary's collection efforts after payment of a default claim.

    After paying a default claim on a HEAL loan, the Secretary attempts 
to collect from the borrower and any valid endorser in accordance with 
the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 105), 
the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, issued May 9, 1985, 
and the Department's Claims Collection Regulation (45 CFR part 30). The 
Secretary attempts collection of all unpaid principal, interest, 
penalties, administrative costs, and other charges or fees, except in 
the following situations:
    (a) The borrower has a valid defense on the loan. The Secretary 
refrains from collection against the borrower or endorser to the extent 
of any defense that the Secretary concludes is valid. Examples of a 
valid defense include expiration of the statute of limitations and 
infancy.
    (b) A school owes the borrower a refund for the period covered by 
the loan. In this situation, the Secretary refrains from collection to 
the extent of the unpaid refund if the borrower assigns to the Secretary 
the right to receive the refund.
    (c) The school or lender or holder is the subject of a lawsuit or 
Federal administrative proceeding. In this situation, if the Secretary 
determines that the proceeding involves allegations that, if proven, 
would provide the borrower with a full or partial defense on the loan, 
then the Secretary may suspend collection activity on all or part of a 
loan until the proceeding ends. The Secretary suspends collection 
activity only for so long as the proceeding is being energetically 
prosecuted in good faith and the allegations that relate to

[[Page 422]]

the borrower's defense are reasonably likely to be proven.
    (d) The borrower dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled. 
In this situation, the Secretary terminates all collection activity 
against the borrower. If the borrower dies or becomes totally and 
permanently disabled, the Secretary also terminates all collection 
activity against any endorser.

<R05>
Sec. 60.21  Refunds.

    (a) Student authorization. By applying for a HEAL loan, a student 
authorizes a participating school to make payment of a refund that is 
allocable to a HEAL loan directly to the original lender (or to a 
subsequent holder of the loan note, if the school has knowledge of the 
holder's identity).
    (b) Treatment by lenders or holders. (1) A holder of a HEAL loan 
must treat a refund payment received from a HEAL school as a downward 
adjustment in the principal amount of the loan.
    (2) When a lender receives a school refund check for a loan it no 
longer holds, the lender must transfer that payment to the holder of the 
loan and either inform the borrower about the refund check and where it 
was sent or, if the borrower's address is unknown, notify the current 
holder that the borrower was not informed. The current holder must 
provide the borrower with a written notice of the refund payment.

<R05>
Sec. 60.30  Which organizations are eligible to apply to be HEAL lenders and holders?

    (a) A HEAL lender may make and hold loans under the HEAL program.
    (b) The following types of organizations are eligible to apply to 
the Secretary to be HEAL lenders:
    (1) A financial or credit institution (including a bank, savings and 
loan association, credit union, or insurance company) which is subject 
to examination and supervision in its capacity as a lender by an agency 
of the United States or of the State in which it has its principal place 
of business;
    (2) A pension fund approved by the Secretary;
    (3) An agency or instrumentality of a State;
    (4) A HEAL school; and
    (5) A private nonprofit entity, designated by the State, regulated 
by the State, and approved by the Secretary.
    (c) The following types of organizations are eligible to apply to 
the Secretary to be HEAL holders:
    (1) Public entities in the business of purchasing student loans;
    (2) The Student Loan Marketing Association (popularly known as 
``Sallie Mae''); and
    (3) Other eligible lenders.
    (d) HEAL holders must comply with any provisions in the regulations 
required of HEAL lenders including, but not limited to, provisions 
regarding applications, contracts, and due diligence.

<R05>
Sec. 60.31  The application to be a HEAL lender or holder.

    (a) In order to be a HEAL lender or holder, an eligible organization 
must submit an application to the Secretary annually.
    (b) In determining whether to enter into an insurance contract with 
an applicant and what the terms of that contract should be, the 
Secretary may consider the following criteria:
    (1) Whether the applicant is capable of complying with the 
requirements in the HEAL regulations applicable to lenders and holders;
    (2) The amount and rate of loans which are currently delinquent or 
in default, if the applicant has had prior experience with similar 
Federal or State student loan programs; and
    (3) The financial resources of the applicant.
    (c) The applicant must develop and follow written procedures for 
making, servicing and collecting HEAL loans. These procedures must be 
reviewed during the biennial audit required by Sec. 60.42(d). If the 
applicant uses procedures more stringent than those required by 
Secs. 60.34 and 60.35 for its other

[[Page 423]]

loans of comparable dollar value, on which it has no Federal, State, or 
other third party guarantee, it must include those more stringent 
procedures in its written procedures for servicing and collecting its 
HEAL loans.
    (d) The applicant must submit sufficient materials with his or her 
application to enable the Secretary to fairly evaluate the application 
in accordance with these criteria.

[48 FR 38988, Aug. 26, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 747, Jan. 8, 1987; 57 
FR 28796, June 29, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 60.32  The HEAL lender or holder insurance contract.

    (a)(1) If the Secretary approves an application to be a HEAL lender 
or holder, the Secretary and the lender or holder must sign an insurance 
contract. Under this contract, the lender or holder agrees to comply 
with all the laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its 
participation in the HEAL program and the Secretary agrees to insure 
each eligible HEAL loan held by the lender or holder against the 
borrower's default, death, total and permanent disability, bankruptcy 
under chapter 11 or 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or bankruptcy under 
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act when the borrower files a complaint to 
determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan. The Secretary's 
insurance covers 100 percent of the lender's or holder's losses on both 
unpaid principal and interest, except to the extent that a borrower may 
have a defense on the loan other than infancy.
    (2) HEAL insurance, however, is not unconditional. The Secretary 
issues HEAL insurance on the implied representations of the lender that 
all the requirements for the initial insurability of the loan have been 
met. HEAL insurance is further conditioned upon compliance by the holder 
of the loan with the HEAL statute and regulations, the lender's or 
holder's insurance contract, and its own loan management procedures set 
forth in writing pursuant to Sec. 60.31(c). The contract may contain a 
limit on the duration of the contract and the number or amount of HEAL 
loans a lender may make or hold. Each HEAL lender has either a standard 
insurance contract or a comprehensive insurance contract with the 
Secretary, as described below.
    (b) Standard insurance contract. A lender with a standard insurance 
contract must submit to the Secretary a borrower's loan application for 
HEAL insurance on each loan that the lender determines to be eligible. 
The Secretary notifies the lender whether the loan is or is not 
insurable, the amount of the insurance, and the expiration date of the 
insurance commitment. A loan which has been disbursed under a standard 
contract of insurance prior to the Secretary's approval of the 
application is considered not to have been insured.
    (c)(1) Comprehensive insurance contract. A lender with a 
comprehensive insurance contract may disburse a loan without submitting 
an individual borrower's loan application to the Secretary for approval. 
All eligible loans made by a lender with this type of contract are 
insured immediately upon disbursement.
    (2) The Secretary will revoke the comprehensive contract of any 
lender who utilizes procedures which are inconsistent with the HEAL 
statute and regulations, the lender's insurance contract, or its own 
loan management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to 
Sec. 60.31(c), and require that such lenders disburse HEAL loans only 
under a standard contract. When the Secretary determines that the lender 
is in compliance with the HEAL statute and regulations and its own loan 
management procedures set forth in writing pursuant to Sec. 60.31(c), 
the lender may reapply for a comprehensive contract.
    (3) In providing comprehensive contracts, the Secretary shall give 
priority to eligible lenders that:
    (i) Make loans to students at interest rates below the rates 
prevailing during the period involved; or
    (ii) Make loans under terms that are otherwise favorable to the 
student relative to the terms under which eligible

[[Page 424]]

lenders are generally making loans during the period involved.

<R05>
Sec. 60.33  Making a HEAL loan.

    The loan-making process includes the processing of necessary forms, 
the approval of a borrower for a loan, determination of a borrower's 
creditworthiness, the determination of the loan amount (not to exceed 
the amount approved by the school), the explanation to a borrower of his 
or her responsibilities under the loan, the execution of the promissory 
note, and the disbursement of the loan proceeds. A lender may rely in 
good faith upon statements of an applicant and the HEAL school contained 
in the loan application papers, except where those statements are in 
conflict with information obtained from the report on the applicant's 
credit history, or other information available to the lender. Except 
where the statements are in conflict with information obtained from the 
applicant's credit history or other information available to the lender, 
a lender making loans to nonstudent borrowers may rely in good faith 
upon statements by the borrower and authorizing officials of internship, 
residency, or other programs for which a borrower may receive a 
deferment.
    (a) Processing of forms. Before making a HEAL loan, a lender must 
determine that all required forms have been completed by the borrower, 
the HEAL school, the lender, and the authorized official for an 
internship, a residency, or other deferment activity.
    (b) Approval of borrower. A lender may make a HEAL loan only to an 
eligible student or nonstudent borrower.
    (c) Lender determination of the borrower's creditworthiness. The 
lender may make HEAL loans only to an applicant that the lender has 
determined to be creditworthy. This determination must be made at least 
once for each academic year during which the applicant applies for a 
HEAL loan. An applicant will be determined to be ``creditworthy'' if he 
or she has a repayment history that has been satisfactory on any loans 
on which payments have become due. The lender may not determine that an 
applicant is creditworthy if the applicant is currently in default on 
any loan (commercial, consumer, or educational) until the delinquent 
account is made current or satisfactory arrangements are made between 
the affected lender(s) and the HEAL applicant. The lender must obtain 
documentation, such as a letter from the authorized official(s) of the 
affected lender(s) or a corrected credit report indicating that the HEAL 
applicant has taken satisfactory actions to bring the account into good 
standing. It is the responsibility of the HEAL loan applicant to assure 
that the lender receives each such documentation. No loan may be made to 
an applicant who is delinquent on any Federal debt until the delinquent 
account is made current or satisfactory arrangements are made between 
the affected agency and the HEAL applicant. The lender must receive a 
letter from the authorized Federal official of the affected Federal 
agency stating that the borrower has taken satisfactory actions to bring 
the account into good standing. It is the responsibility of the loan 
applicant to assure that the lender has received each such letter. The 
absence of any previous credit, however, is not an indication that the 
applicant is not creditworthy and is not to be used as a reason to deny 
the status of creditworthy to an applicant. The lender must determine 
the creditworthiness of the applicant using, at a minimum, the 
following:
    (1) A report of the applicant's credit history obtained from an 
appropriate consumer credit reporting agency, which must be used in 
making the determinations required by paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (2) For student applicants only, the certification made by the 
applicant's school under Sec. 60.51(e).
    (d) Determination of loan amount. A lender may not make a HEAL loan 
in an amount that exceeds the permissible annual and aggregate maximums 
described in Sec. 60.10.
    (e) Promissory note. (1) Each loan must be evidenced by a promissory 
note approved by the Secretary. A lender must obtain the Secretary's

[[Page 425]]

prior approval of the note form before it makes a HEAL loan evidenced by 
a promissory note containing any deviation from the provisions of the 
form most currently approved by the Secretary. The lender must give the 
borrower a copy of each executed note.
    (2) The lender must explain to the borrower that the loan must be 
repaid and that the loan proceeds may be applied toward educational 
expenses only.
    (f) Disbursement of HEAL loan. (1) A lender must disburse HEAL loan 
proceeds:
    (i) To a student borrower, by means of a check or draft payable 
jointly to the student borrower and the HEAL school. Except where a 
lender is also a school, a lender must mail the check or draft to the 
school. A lender may not disburse the loan proceeds earlier than is 
reasonably necessary to meet the cost of education for the period for 
which the loan is made.
    (ii) To a nonstudent borrower, by means of a check or draft payable 
to the borrower. However, when a previous loan is held by a different 
lender, the current lender must make the HEAL loan disbursement check or 
draft payable jointly to the borrower and the holder of the previous 
HEAL loan for which interest is payable.
    (2) Effective July 1, 1987, a lender must disburse the HEAL loan 
proceeds in two or more installments unless the loan is intended to 
cover a period of no more than one-half an academic year. The amount 
disbursed at one time must correspond to the borrower's educational 
expenses for the period for which the disbursement is made, and must be 
indicated by the school on the borrower's application. If the loan is 
intended for more than one-half an academic year, the school must 
indicate on the borrower's application both the approximate dates of 
disbursement and the amount the borrower will need on each such date. In 
no case may the lender disburse the proceeds earlier than is reasonably 
necessary to meet the costs of education for the period for which the 
disbursement or the loan is made.
    (g) If the lender determines that the applicant is not creditworthy, 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the lender must not approve 
the HEAL loan request. If the applicant is a student, the lender must 
notify the applicant and the applicant's school named on the application 
form of the denial of a HEAL loan, stating the reason for the denial.
    (h) The lender must report a borrower's HEAL indebtedness to one or 
more national credit bureaus within 120 days of the date the final 
disbursement on the loan is made.

Sec. 60.34  HEAL loan account servicing.

    HEAL loan account servicing involves the proper maintenance of 
records, and the proper review and management of accounts. Generally 
accepted account servicing standards ensure that collections are 
received and accounted for, delinquent accounts are identified promptly, 
and reports are produced comparing actual results to previously 
established objectives.
    (a) Borrower inquiries. A lender or holder must respond on a timely 
basis to written inquiries and other communications from a borrower and 
any endorser of a HEAL loan.
    (b) Conversion of loan to repayment status. (1) At least 30 and not 
more than 60 days before the commencement of the repayment period, the 
lender or holder must contact the borrower in writing to establish the 
terms of repayment. Lenders or holders may not charge borrowers for the 
additional interest or other charges, penalties, or fees that accrue 
when a lender or holder does not contact the borrower within this time 
period and a late conversion results.
    (2) Terms of repayment are established in a written schedule that is 
made a part of, and subject to the terms of, the borrower's original 
HEAL note.
    (3) The lender or holder may not surrender the original promissory 
note to the borrower until the loan is paid in full. At that time, the 
lender or holder must give the borrower the original promissory note.

[[Page 426]]

    (c) Borrower contacts. The lender or holder must notify each 
borrower by a written contact, which has an address correction request 
on the envelope, of the balance owed for principal, interest, insurance 
premiums, and any other charges or fees owed to the lender, at least 
every 6 months from the time the loan is disbursed. The lender or holder 
must use this notice to remind the borrower of the option, without 
penalty, to pay all or part of the principal and accrued interest at any 
time.
    (d) Skip-tracing. If, at any time, the lender or holder is unable to 
locate a borrower, the lender or holder must initiate skip-tracing 
procedures as described in Sec. 60.35(a)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 60.35  HEAL loan collection.

    A lender or holder must exercise due diligence in the collection of 
a HEAL loan with respect to both a borrower and any endorser. In order 
to exercise due diligence, a lender or holder must implement the 
following procedures when a borrower fails to honor his or her payment 
obligations:
    (a) (1) When a borrower is delinquent in making a payment, the 
lender or holder must remind the borrower within 15 days of the date the 
payment was due by means of a written contact. If payments do not 
resume, the lender or holder must contact both the borrower and any 
endorser at least 3 more times at regular intervals during the 120-day 
delinquent period following the first missed payment of that 120-day 
period. The second demand notice for a delinquent account must inform 
the borrower that the continued delinquent status of the account will be 
reported to consumer credit reporting agencies if payment is not made. 
Each of the required four contacts must consist of at least a written 
contact which has an address correction request on the envelope. The 
last contact must consist of a telephone contact, in addition to the 
required letter, unless the borrower cannot be contacted by telephone. 
The lender or holder may choose to substitute a personal contact for a 
telephone contact. A record must be made of each attempt to contact and 
each actual contact, and that record must be placed in the borrower's 
file. Each contact must become progressively firmer in tone. If the 
lender or holder is unable to locate the borrower and any endorser at 
any time during the period when the borrower is delinquent, the lender 
or holder must initiate the skip-tracing procedures described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (2) If the lender or holder is unable to locate either the borrower 
or the endorser at any time, the lender or holder must initiate and use 
skip-tracing activities which are at least as extensive and effective as 
those it uses to locate borrowers delinquent in the repayment of its 
other loans of comparable dollar value. To determine the correct address 
of the borrower, these skip-tracing procedures should include, but need 
not be limited to, contacting any other individual named on the 
borrower's HEAL application or promissory note, using such sources as 
telephone directories, city directories, postmasters, drivers license 
records in State and local government agencies, records of members of 
professional associations, consumer credit reporting agencies, skip 
locator services, and records at any school attended by the borrower. 
All skip-tracing activities used must be documented. This documentation 
must consist of a written record of the action taken and its date and 
must be presented to the Secretary when requesting preclaim assistance 
or when filing a default claim for HEAL insurance.
    (b) When a borrower is 90 days delinquent in making a payment, the 
lender or holder must immediately request preclaim assistance from the 
Public Health Service. The Secretary does not pay a default claim if the 
lender or holder fails to request preclaim assistance.
    (c) Prior to the filing of a default claim, a lender or holder must 
use, at a minimum, collection practices that are at least as extensive 
and effective as those used by the lender or holder in the collection of 
its other loans. These practices must include, but need not be limited 
to:

[[Page 427]]

    (1) Using collection agents, which may include its own collection 
department or other internal collection agents;
    (2) Immediately notifying an appropriate consumer credit reporting 
agency regarding accounts overdue by more than 60 days; and
    (3) Commencing and prosecuting an action for default unless:
    (i) In the determination of the Secretary that:
    (A) The lender or holder has made reasonable efforts to serve 
process on the borrower involved and has been unsuccessful in these 
efforts; or
    (B) Prosecution of such an action would be fruitless because of the 
financial or other circumstances of the borrower;
    (ii) For loans made before November 4, 1988, the loan involved was 
made in an amount of less than $5,000; or
    (iii) For loans made on or after November 4, 1988, the loan involved 
was made in an amount of less than $2,500.
    (d) If the Secretary's preclaim assistance locates the borrower, the 
lender or holder must implement the loan collection procedures described 
in this section. When the Secretary's preclaim assistance is unable to 
locate the borrower, a default claim may be filed by the lender as 
described in Sec. 60.40. The Secretary does not pay a default claim if 
the lender or holder has not complied with the HEAL statute and 
regulations or the lender's or holder's insurance contract.
    (e) If a lender or holder does not sue the borrower, it must send a 
final demand letter to the borrower and any endorser at least 30 days 
before a default claim is filed.
    (f) If a lender or holder sues a defaulted borrower or endorser, it 
may first apply the proceeds of any judgment against its reasonable 
attorney's fees and court costs, whether or not the judgment provides 
for these fees and costs.
    (g) Collection of chapter 7 bankruptcies. (1) If a borrower files 
for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act and does not file a 
complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan, the lender 
or holder is responsible for monitoring the bankruptcy case in order to 
pursue collection of the loan after the bankruptcy proceedings have been 
completed.
    (i) For any loan for which the lender or holder had not begun to 
litigate against the borrower prior to the imposition of the automatic 
stay, the period of the automatic stay is to be considered as an 
extended forbearance authorized by the Secretary, in addition to the 2-
year period of forbearance which lenders and holders are authorized to 
grant without prior approval from the Secretary. Only periods of 
delinquency following the date of receipt (as documented by a date 
stamp) of the discharge of debtor notice (or other written notification 
from the court or the borrower's attorney of the end of the automatic 
stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Court) can be included in determining 
default, as described in Sec. 60.40(c)(1)(i). The lender or holder must 
attempt to reestablish repayment terms with the borrower in writing no 
more than 30 days after receipt of the discharge of debtor notice (or 
other written notification from the court or the borrower's attorney of 
the end of the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Court), in 
accordance with the procedures followed at the end of a forbearance 
period. If the borrower fails to make a payment as scheduled, the lender 
or holder must attempt to obtain repayment through written and telephone 
contacts in accordance with the intervals established in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, and must perform the other HEAL loan collection 
activities required in this section, before filing a default claim.
    (ii) For any loan for which the lender or holder had begun to 
litigate against the borrower prior to the imposition of the automatic 
stay, the lender or holder must, upon written notification from the 
court or the borrower's attorney that the bankruptcy proceedings have 
been completed, either resume litigation or treat the loan in accordance 
with paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) If the lender or holder has not received written notification of 
discharge within 12 months of the date that the borrower filed for 
bankruptcy, the lender or holder must contact the court and the 
borrower's attorney (if known) within 30 days to determine if

[[Page 428]]

the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed. If no response is 
received within 30 days of the date of these contacts, the lender or 
holder must resume its collection efforts, in accordance with paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section. If a written response from the court or the 
borrower's attorney indicates that the bankruptcy proceedings are still 
underway, the lender or holder is not to pursue further collection 
efforts until receipt of written notice of discharge, except that 
follow-up in accordance with this paragraph must be done at least once 
every 12 months until the bankruptcy proceedings have been completed.
    (3) If, despite the lender or holder's compliance with required 
procedures, a loan subject to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section is discharged, the lender or holder must file a claim with 
the Secretary within 10 days of the initial date of receipt (as 
documented by a date stamp) of written notification of the discharge 
from the court or the borrower's attorney, in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 60.40(c)(4). The lender or holder also must 
file with the bankruptcy court an objection to the discharge of the HEAL 
loan, and must include with the claim documentation showing that the 
bankruptcy proceedings were handled properly and expeditiously (e.g., 
all documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy court, including 
evidence which shows the period of the bankruptcy proceedings).

Sec. 60.36  Consequence of using an agent.

    The delegation of functions to a servicing agency or other party 
does not relieve a lender or holder of its responsibilities under the 
HEAL program.

[57 FR 28797, June 29, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 60.37  Forbearance.

    (a) Forbearance means an extension of time for making loan payments 
or the acceptance of smaller payments than were previously scheduled to 
prevent a borrower from defaulting on his or her payment obligations. A 
lender or holder must notify each borrower of the right to request 
forbearance.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a lender 
or holder must grant forbearance whenever the borrower is temporarily 
unable to make scheduled payments on a HEAL loan and the borrower 
continues to repay the loan in an amount commensurate with his or her 
ability to repay the loan. Any circumstance which affects the borrower's 
ability to repay the loan must be fully documented.
    (2) If the lender or holder determines that the default of the 
borrower is inevitable and that forbearance will be ineffective in 
preventing default, the lender or holder may submit a claim to the 
Secretary rather than grant forbearance. If the Secretary is not in 
agreement with the determination of the lender or holder, the claim will 
be returned to the lender or holder as disapproved and forbearance must 
be granted.
    (b) A lender or holder must exercise forbearance in accordance with 
terms that are consistent with the 25- and 33-year limitations on the 
length of repayment (described in Sec. 60.11) if the lender or holder 
and borrower agree in writing to the new terms. Each forbearance period 
may not exceed 6 months.
    (c) A lender or holder may also exercise forbearance for periods of 
up to 6 months in accordance with terms that are inconsistent with the 
minimum annual payment requirement if the lender or holder complies with 
the requirements listed in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this 
section. Subsequent renewals of the forbearance must also be documented 
in accordance with the following requirements:
    (1) The lender or holder must reasonably believe that the borrower 
intends to repay the loan but is currently unable to make payments in 
accordance with the terms of the loan note. The lender or holder must 
state the basis for its belief in writing and maintain that statement in 
its loan file on that borrower.
    (2) Both the borrower and an authorized official of the lender or 
holder must sign a written agreement of forbearance.

[[Page 429]]

    (3) If the agreement between the borrower and lender or holder 
provides for deferment of all payments, the lender or holder must 
contact the borrower at least every 3 months during the period of 
forbearance in order to remind the borrower of the outstanding 
obligation to repay.
    (4) The total period of forbearance (with or without interruption) 
granted by the lender or holder to any borrower must not exceed 2 years. 
However, when the borrower and the lender or holder believe that there 
are bona fide reasons why this period should be extended, the lender or 
holder may request a reasonable extension beyond the 2-year period from 
the Secretary. This request must document the reasons why the extension 
should be granted. The lender or holder may grant the extension for the 
approved time period if the Secretary approves the extension request.

Sec. 60.38  Assignment of a HEAL loan.

    A HEAL note may not be assigned except to another HEAL lender, the 
Student Loan Marketing Association (popularly known as ``Sallie Mae''), 
or a public entity in the business of purchasing student loans, and 
except as provided in Sec. 60.40. In this section ``seller'' means any 
kind of assignor and ``buyer'' means any kind of assignee.
    (a) Procedure. A HEAL note assigned from one lender or holder to 
another must be subject to a blanket endorsement together with other 
HEAL notes being assigned or must individually bear effective words of 
assignment. Either the blanket endorsement or the HEAL note must be 
signed and dated by an authorized official of the seller. Within 30 days 
of the transaction, the buyer must notify the following parties of the 
assignment:
    (1) The Secretary;
    (2) The borrower. The notice to the borrower must contain a clear 
statement of all the borrower's rights and responsibilities which arise 
from the assignment of the loan, including a statement regarding the 
consequences of making payments to the seller subsequent to receipt of 
the notice; and
    (3) The borrower's school, as shown on the application form 
supporting the loan purchased by the buyer, if the borrower is enrolled 
in school.
    (b) Risks assumed by the buyer. Upon acquiring a HEAL loan, a new 
holder assumes responsibility for the consequences of any previous 
violations of applicable statutes, regulations, or the terms of the note 
except for defects under Sec. 60.41(d). A HEAL note is not a negotiable 
instrument, and a subsequent holder is not a holder in due course. If 
the borrower has a valid legal defense that could be asserted against 
the previous holder, the borrower can also assert the defense against 
the new holder. In this situation, if the new holder files a default 
claim on a loan, the Secretary denies the default claim to the extent of 
the borrower's defense. Furthermore, when a new holder files a claim on 
a HEAL loan, it must provide the Secretary with the same documentation 
that would have been required of the original lender.
    (c) Warranty. Nothing in this section precludes the buyer of a HEAL 
loan from obtaining a warranty from the seller covering certain future 
reductions by the Secretary in computing the amount of insurable loss, 
if any, on a claim filed on the loan. The warranty may only cover 
reductions which are attributable to an act or failure to act of the 
seller or other previous holder. The warranty may not cover matters for 
which the buyer is charged with responsibility under the HEAL 
regulations.
    (d) Bankruptcy. If a lender or holder assigns a HEAL loan to a new 
holder, or a new holder acquires a HEAL loan under 20 U.S.C. 1092a (the 
Combined Payment Plan authority), and the previous holder(s) 
subsequently receives court notice that the borrower has filed for 
bankruptcy, the previous holder(s) must forward the bankruptcy notice to 
the purchaser within 10 days of the initial date of receipt, as 
documented by a date stamp, except that if it is a chapter 7 bankruptcy 
with no complaint for dismissal, the previous holder(s) must file the 
notice with the purchaser within 30 days of the initial date of receipt, 
as documented by a

[[Page 430]]

date stamp. The previous holder(s) also must file a statement with the 
court notifying it of the change of ownership. Notwithstanding the 
above, the current holder will not be held responsible for any loss due 
to the failure of the prior holder(s) to meet the deadline for giving 
notice if such failure occurs after the current holder purchased the 
loan.

Sec. 60.39  Death and disability claims.

    (a) Death. The Secretary will discharge a borrower's liability on 
the loan in accordance with section 738 of the Act upon the death of the 
borrower. The holder of the loan may not attempt to collect on the loan 
from the borrower's estate or any endorser. The holder must secure a 
certification of death or whatever official proof is conclusive under 
State law. The holder must return to the sender any payments, except for 
refunds under Sec. 60.21, received from the estate of the borrower or 
paid on behalf of the borrower after the date of death.
    (b) Disability. (1) The Secretary will discharge a borrower's 
liability on the loan in accordance with section 738 of the Act if the 
borrower is found to be permanently and totally disabled on 
recommendation of the holder of the loan and as supported by whatever 
medical certification the Secretary may require. A borrower is totally 
and permanently disabled if he or she is unable to engage in any 
substantial gainful activity because of a medically determinable 
impairment, which the Secretary expects to continue for a long and 
indefinite period of time or to result in death.
    (2) After being notified by the borrower or the borrower's 
representative that the borrower claims to be totally and permanently 
disabled, the holder of the loan may not attempt to collect on the loan 
from the borrower or any endorser. The holder must promptly request that 
the Secretary determine whether a borrower has become totally and 
permanently disabled. With its request, the holder must submit medical 
evidence no more than 4 months old that it has obtained from the 
borrower or the borrower's representative.
    (3) If the Secretary determines that the borrower is totally and 
permanently disabled, the lender or holder must return to the borrower 
any payments, except for refunds under Sec. 60.21, that it receives 
after being notified that the borrower claims to be totally and 
permanently disabled.

Sec. 60.40  Procedures for filing claims.

    (a) A lender or holder must file an insurance claim on a form 
approved by the Secretary. The lender or holder must attach to the claim 
all documentation necessary to litigate a default, including any 
documents required to be submitted by the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards, and which the Secretary may require. Failure to submit the 
required documentation and to comply with the HEAL statute and 
regulations or the lender's or holder's insurance contract will result 
in a claim not being honored. The Secretary may deny a claim that is not 
filed within the period specified in this section. The Secretary 
requires for all claims at least the following documentation:
    (1) The original promissory note;
    (2) An assignment to the United States of America of all right, 
title, and interest of the lender or holder in the note;
    (3) The loan application;
    (4) The history of the loan activities from the date of loan 
disbursement through the date of claim, including any payments made; and
    (5) A Borrower Status Form (HRSA-508), documenting each deferment 
granted under Sec. 60.12 or a written statement from an appropriate 
official stating that the borrower was engaged in an activity for which 
he or she was entitled to receive a deferment at the time the deferment 
was granted.
    (b) The Secretary's payment of a claim is contingent upon receipt of 
all required documentation and an assignment to the United States of 
America

[[Page 431]]

of all right, title, and interest of the lender or holder in the note 
underlying the claim. The lender or holder must warrant that the loan is 
eligible for HEAL insurance.
    (c) In addition, the lender or holder must comply with the following 
requirements for the filing of default, death, disability, and 
bankruptcy claims:
    (1) Default claims. Default means the persistent failure of the 
borrower to make a payment when due or to comply with other terms of the 
note or other written agreement evidencing a loan under circumstances 
where the Secretary finds it reasonable to conclude that the borrower no 
longer intends to honor the obligation to repay the loan. In the case of 
a loan repayable (or on which interest is payable) in monthly 
installments, this failure must have persisted for 120 days. In the case 
of a loan repayable (or on which interest is payable) in less frequent 
installments, this failure must have persisted for 180 days. If, for a 
particular loan, an automatic stay is imposed on collection activities 
by a Bankruptcy Court, and the lender or holder receives written 
notification of the automatic stay prior to initiating legal proceedings 
against the borrower, the 120- or 180-day period does not include any 
period prior to the end of the automatic stay.
    (i) If a lender or holder determines that it is not appropriate to 
commence and prosecute an action against a default borrower pursuant to 
Sec. 60.35(c)(3), it must file a default claim with the Secretary within 
30 days after a loan has been determined to be in default.
    (ii) If a lender files suit against a defaulted borrower and does 
not pursue collection of the judgment obtained as a result of the suit, 
it must file a default claim with the Secretary within 60 days of the 
date of issuance of the judgment. If a lender or holder files suit 
against a defaulted borrower, and pursues collection of the judgment 
obtained as a result of the suit, these collection activities must begin 
within 60 days of the date of issuance of the judgment. If the lender or 
holder is unable to collect the full amount of principal and interest 
owed, a claim must be filed within 30 days of completion of the post-
judgment collection activities. In either case, the lender or holder 
must assign the judgment to the Secretary as part of the default claim.
    (iii) In addition to the documentation required for all claims, the 
lender or holder must submit with its default claim at least the 
following:
    (A) Repayment schedule(s);
    (B) A collection history, if any;
    (C) A final demand letter;
    (D) The original or a copy of all correspondence relevant to the 
HEAL loan to or from the borrower (whether received by the original 
lender, a subsequent holder, or an independent servicing agent);
    (E) A claims collection litigation report; and
    (F) If the defaulted borrower filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7 
of the Bankruptcy Act and did not file a complaint to determine the 
dischargeability of the loan, all documents sent to or received from the 
bankruptcy court, including evidence which shows the period of the 
bankruptcy proceedings.
    (iv) If a lender or holder files a default claim on a loan and 
subsequently receives written notice from the court or the borrower's 
attorney that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 
13 of the Bankruptcy Act, or under chapter 7 with a complaint to 
determine the dischargeability of the loan, the lender or holder must 
file that notice with the Secretary within 10 days of the lender or 
holder's initial date of receipt, as documented by a date stamp. If the 
borrower is declaring bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act, 
and has not filed a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the 
loan, the lender or holder must file the written notice with the 
Secretary within 30 days of the lender's or holder's initial date of 
receipt, as documented by a date stamp. If the Secretary has not paid 
the claim at the time the lender or holder receives that notice, upon 
receipt of the notice, the lender or holder must file with the 
bankruptcy court a proof of claim, if applicable, and an objection to 
the discharge or compromise of the HEAL loan. If the Secretary has paid 
the claim, the lender or holder must file a statement with the court

[[Page 432]]

notifying it that the loan is owned by the Secretary.
    (2) Death claims. A lender or holder must file a death claim with 
the Secretary within 30 days after the lender or holder obtains 
documentation that a borrower is dead. In addition to the documentation 
required for all claims, the lender or holder must submit with its death 
claim those documents which verify the death, including an official copy 
of the Death Certificate.
    (3) Disability claims. A lender or holder must file a disability 
claim with the Secretary within 30 days after it has been notified that 
the Secretary has determined a borrower to be totally and permanently 
disabled. In addition to the documentation required for all claims, the 
lender or holder must submit with its claim evidence of the Secretary's 
determination that the borrower is totally and permanently disabled.
    (4) Bankruptcy claims. For a bankruptcy under chapter 11 or 13 of 
the Bankruptcy Act, or a bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy 
Act when the borrower files a complaint to determine the 
dischargeability of the HEAL loan, the current holder must file a claim 
with the Secretary within 10 days of the initial date of receipt of 
court notice or written notice from the borrower's attorney that the 
borrower has filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 or chapter 13, or has 
filed a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan 
under chapter 7. The initial date of receipt of the written notice must 
be documented by a date stamp. The lender or holder must file with the 
bankruptcy court a proof of claim, if applicable, and an objection to 
the discharge or compromise of the HEAL loan. In addition to the 
documentation required for all claims, with its claim the lender or 
holder must submit to the Secretary at least the following:
    (i) Repayment schedule(s);
    (ii) A collection history, if any;
    (iii) A proof of claim, where applicable;
    (iv) An assignment to the United States of America of its proof of 
claim, where applicable;
    (v) All pertinent documents sent to or received from the bankruptcy 
court; and
    (vi) A statement of any facts of which the lender is aware that may 
form the basis for an objection to the bankrupt's discharge or an 
exception to the discharge.
    (vii) The notice of the first meeting or creditors, or an 
explanation as to why this is not included;
    (viii) In cases where there is defective service, a declaration or 
affidavit attesting to the fact that the lender or holder was not 
directly served with the notice of meeting of creditors. This 
declaration or affidavit must also indicate when and how the lender or 
holder learned of the bankruptcy; and
    (ix) In cases where there is defective service due to the borrower's 
failure to list the proper creditor, a copy of the letter sent to the 
borrower at the time of purchase of the HEAL loan by the current holder, 
or a sample letter with documentation indicating when the letter was 
sent to the borrower.

Sec. 60.41  Determination of amount of loss on claims.

    (a) General rule. HEAL insurance covers the unpaid balance of 
principal and interest on an eligible HEAL loan, less the amount of any 
judgment collected pursuant to default proceedings commenced by the 
eligible lender or holder involved. In determining whether to approve an 
insurance claim for payment, the Secretary considers legal defects 
affecting the initial validity or insurability of the loan. The 
Secretary also deducts from a claim any amount that is not a legally 
enforceable obligation of the borrower except to the extent that the 
defense of infancy applies. The Secretary further considers whether all 
holders of the loan have complied with the requirements of the HEAL 
regulations, including those concerned with the making, servicing, and 
collecting of the loan, the timely filing of claims, and the submission 
of documents with a claim.

[[Page 433]]

    (b) Special rules for loans acquired by assignment. If a claim is 
filed by a lender or holder that obtained a loan by assignment, that 
lender or holder is not entitled to any payment under this section 
greater than that to which a previous holder would have been entitled. 
In particular, the Secretary deducts from the claim any amounts that are 
attributable to payments made by the borrower to a prior holder of the 
loan before the borrower received proper notice of the assignment of the 
loan.
    (c) Special rules for loans made by school lenders. (1) If the loan 
for which a claim is filed was originally made by a school and the claim 
is filed by that school, the Secretary deducts from the claim an amount 
equal to any unpaid refund that the school owes the borrower.
    (2) If the loan for which a claim is filed was originally made by a 
school but the claim is filed by another lender of holder that obtained 
the note by assignment, the Secretary deducts from the claim an amount 
equal to any unpaid refund that the school owed the borrower prior to 
the assignment.
    (d) Circumstances under which defects in claims may be cured or 
excused. The Secretary may permit a lender or holder to cure certain 
defects in a specified manner as a condition for payment of a default 
claim. The Secretary may excuse certain defects if the holder submitting 
the default claim satisfies the Secretary that the defect did not 
contribute to the default or prejudice the Secretary's attempt to 
collect the loan from the borrower. The Secretary may also excuse 
certain defects if the defect arose while the loan was held by another 
lender or holder and the holder submitting the default claim satisfies 
the Secretary that the assignment of the loan was an arm's length 
transaction, that the present holder did not know of the defect at the 
time of the sale and that the present holder could not have become aware 
of the defect through an examination of the loan documents.
    (e) Payment of insured interest. The payment on an approved claim 
covers the unpaid principal balance and interest that accrues through 
the date the claim is paid, except:
    (1) If the lender or holder failed to submit a claim within the 
required period after the borrower's default; death; total and permanent 
disability; or filing of a petition in bankrupty under chapter 11 or 13 
of the Bankruptcy Act, or under chapter 7 where the borrower files a 
complaint to determine the dischargeability of the HEAL loan; the 
Secretary does not pay interest that accrued between the end of that 
period and the date the Secretary received the claim.
    (2) If the Secretary returned the claim to the lender or holder for 
additional documentation necessary for the approval of the claim, the 
Secretary pays interest only for the first 30 days following the return 
of the claim to the lender or holder.

<R05>
Sec. 60.42  Records, reports, inspection, and audit requirements for HEAL lenders and holders.

    (a) Records. (1) A lender or holder must keep complete and accurate 
records of each HEAL loan which it holds. The records must be organized 
in a way that permits them to be easily retrievable and allows the ready 
identification of the current status of each loan. The required records 
include:
    (i) The loan application;
    (ii) The original promissory note;
    (iii) The repayment schedule agreement;
    (iv) Evidence of each disbursement of loan proceeds;
    (v) Notices of changes in a borrower's address and status as a full-
time student;
    (vi) Evidence of the borrower's eligibility for a deferment;
    (vii) The borrower's signed statement describing his or her rights 
and responsibilities in connection with a HEAL loan;
    (viii) The documents required for the exercise of forbearance;
    (ix) Documentation of the assignment of the loan; and
    (x) Evidence of a borrower's creditworthiness, including the 
borrower's credit report.

[[Page 434]]

    (2) The lender or holder must maintain for each borrower a payment 
history showing the date and amount of each payment received on the 
borrower's behalf, and the amounts of each payment attributable to 
principal and interest. A lender or holder must also maintain for each 
loan a collection history showing the date and subject of each 
communication with a borrower or endorser for collection of a delinquent 
loan. Furthermore, a lender or holder must keep any additional records 
which are necessary to make any reports required by the Secretary.
    (3) A lender or holder must retain the records required for each 
loan for not less than 5 years following the date the loan is repaid in 
full by the borrower. However, in particular cases the Secretary may 
require the retention of records beyond this minimum period. A lender or 
holder must keep the original copy of an unpaid promissory note, but may 
store all other records in microform or computer format.
    (4) The lender or holder must maintain accurate and complete records 
on each HEAL borrower and related school activities required by the HEAL 
program. All HEAL records shall be maintained under security and 
protected from fire, flood, water leakage, other environmental threats, 
electronic data system failures or power fluctuations, unauthorized 
intrusion for use, and theft.

Sec. 60.43  Limitation, suspension, or termination of the eligibility of a HEAL lender or holder.

    (a) The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the eligibility 
under the HEAL program of an otherwise eligible lender or holder that 
violates or fails to comply with any provision of title VII, part A, 
subpart I of the Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 292-292p), these regulations, 
or agreements with the Secretary concerning the HEAL program. Prior to 
terminating a lender or holder's participation in the program, the 
Secretary will provide the entity an opportunity for a hearing in 
accordance with the procedures under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The Secretary will provide any lender or holder subject to 
termination with a written notice, sent by certified mail, specifying 
his or her intention to terminate the lender or holder's participation 
in the program and stating that the entity may request, within 30 days 
of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. if the entity requests 
a hearing, it must, within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit 
material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause 
for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The 
hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The 
Secretary will deny a hearing if:
    (1) The request for a hearing is untimely (i.e., fails to meet the 
30-day requirement);
    (2) The lender or holder does not provide a statement of material, 
factual issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or
    (3) The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or 
inconsequential.

In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will 
send a written denial, by certified mail, to the lender or holder 
setting forth the reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied,

[[Page 435]]

or if as a result of the hearing, termination is still determined to be 
necessary, the lender or holder will be terminated from participation in 
the program. An entity will be permitted to reapply for participation in 
the program when it demonstrates, and the Secretary agrees, that it is 
in compliance with all HEAL requirements.
    (c) This section does not apply to a determination that a HEAL 
lender fails to meet the statutory definition of an ``eligible lender.''
    (d) This section also does not apply to administrative action by the 
Department of Health and Human Services based on any alleged violation 
of:

                          Subpart E--The School


<R05>
Sec. 60.50  Which schools are eligible to be HEAL schools?

    (a) In order to participate in the HEAL program, a school must enter 
into a written agreement with the Secretary. In the agreement, the 
school promises to comply with provisions of the HEAL law and the HEAL 
regulations. For initial entry into this agreement and for the agreement 
to remain in effect, a school must satisfy the following requirements:
    (1) The school must be legally authorized within a State to conduct 
a course of study leading to one of the following degrees:

Doctor of Medicine
Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine
Doctor of Dentistry or equivalent degree
Bachelor or Master of Science in Pharmacy or equivalent degree
Doctor of Optometry or equivalent degree
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or equivalent degree
Doctor of Podiatric Medicine or equivalent degree
Graduate or equivalent degree in Public Health
Doctor of Chiropractic or equivalent degree
Doctoral degree of Clinical Psychology
Masters or doctoral degree in Health Administration

For the purposes of this section, the term ``State'' includes, in 
addition to the several States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory 
of the Pacific Islands (the Republic of Palau), the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia.
    (2)(i) The school must be accredited by a recognized agency approved 
for that course of study by the Secretary of Education, as described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, except where a school is not 
eligible for accreditation solely because it is too new. A new school is 
eligible if the Secretary of Education determines that it can reasonably 
expect to be accredited before the beginning of the academic year 
following the normal graduation date of its first entering class. The 
Secretary of Education makes this determination after consulting with 
the appropriate accrediting agency and receiving reasonable assurance to 
that effect.
    (ii) The approved accrediting agencies are:
    (A) Liaison Committee on Medical Education.
    (B) American Osteopathic Association.
    (C) Commission on Dental Accreditation.
    (D) Council on Education of American Veterinary Medical Association.
    (E) Council on Optometric Education.
    (F) Council on Podiatric Medical Education.
    (G) American Council on Pharmaceutical Education.
    (H) Council on Education for Public Health.
    (I) Council on Chiropractic Education.

[[Page 436]]

    (J) Accrediting Commission on Education for Health Services 
Administration.
    (K) Committee on Accreditation of American Psychological 
Association.
    (b) If a HEAL school undergoes a change of controlling ownership or 
form of control, its agreement automatically expires at the time of that 
change. The school must enter into a new agreement with the Secretary in 
order to continue its participation in the HEAL program.

<R05>
Sec. 60.51  The student loan application.

    When the student completes his or her portion of the student loan 
application and submits it to the school, the school must do the 
following:
    (a) Accurately and completely fill out its portion of the HEAL 
application;
    (b) Verify, to the best of its ability, the information provided by 
the student on the HEAL application, including, but not limited to, 
citizenship status and Social Security number. To comply with this 
requirement, the school may request that the student provide a certified 
copy of his or her birth certificate, his or her naturalization papers, 
and an original Social Security card or copy issued by the Federal 
Government, or other documentation that the school may require. The 
school must assure that the applicant's I-151 or I-551 is attached to 
the application, if the applicant is required to possess such 
identification by the United States;
    (c) Certify that the student is eligible to receive a HEAL loan, 
according to the requirements of Sec. 60.5;
    (d) Review the financial aid transcript from each institution 
previously attended by the applicant on at least a half-time basis to 
determine whether the applicant is in default on any loans or owes a 
refund on any grants. The school may not approve the HEAL application or 
disburse HEAL funds if the borrower is in default on any loans or owes a 
refund on any educational grants, unless satisfactory arrangements have 
been made between the borrower and the affected lender or school to 
resolve the default or the refund on the grant. If the financial aid 
transcript has been requested, but has not been received at the time the 
applicant submits his or her first HEAL application, the school may 
approve the application and disburse the first HEAL installment prior to 
receipt of the transcript. Each financial aid transcript must include at 
least the following data:
    (1) Student's name;
    (2) Amounts and sources of loans and grants previously received by 
the student for study at an institution of higher education;
    (3) Whether the student is in default on any of these loans, or owes 
a refund on any grants;
    (4) Certification from each institution attended by the student that 
the student has received no financial aid, if applicable; and
    (5) From each institution attended, the signature of an official 
authorized by the institution to sign such transcripts on behalf of the 
institution.
    (e) State that it has no reason to believe that the borrower may not 
be willing to repay the HEAL loan;
    (f) Make reasonable determinations of the maximum loan amount 
approvable, based on the student's circumstances. The student applicant 
determines the amount he or she wishes to borrow, up to this maximum 
amount. Only then may the school certify an eligible application. In 
determining the maximum loan amount approvable, the school will 
calculate the difference between:
    (1) The total financial resources available to the applicant for his 
or her costs of education for the period covered by the proposed HEAL 
loan, and other student aid that the applicant has received or will 
receive during the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan. To 
determine the total financial resources available to the applicant for 
his or her costs of education for the period covered by the proposed 
HEAL loan (including familial, spousal, or personal income or other 
financial assistance that the applicant has received or will receive), 
the school must consider information provided through one of the 
national need analysis systems or any other procedure approved

[[Page 437]]

by the Secretary of Education, in addition to any other information 
which the school has regarding the student's financial situation. The 
school may make adjustments to the need analysis information only when 
necessary to accurately reflect the applicant's actual resources, and 
must maintain in the borrower's record documentation to support the 
basis for any adjustments to the need analysis information; and
    (2) The costs reasonably necessary for each student to pursue the 
same or similar curriculum or program within the same class year at the 
school for the period covered by the proposed HEAL loan, using a 
standard student budget. The school must maintain in its general office 
records the criteria used to develop each standard student budget. 
Adjustments to the standard student budget may be made only to the 
extent that they are necessary for the student to complete his or her 
education, and documentation must be maintained in the borrower's record 
to support the basis for any adjustments to the standard student budget.
    (g) Comply with the requirements of Sec. 60.61.

Sec. 60.52  The student's loan check.

    (a) When a school receives from a HEAL lender a loan disbursement 
check or draft payable jointly to the school and to one of its students, 
it must:
    (1) If the school receives the instrument after the student is 
enrolled, obtain the student's endorsement, retain that portion of funds 
due the school, and disburse the remaining funds to the student.
    (2) If the school receives the instrument before the student is 
enrolled, it must, prior to endorsing the instrument, send the 
instrument to the student to endorse and return to the school. The 
school may then retain that portion of funds then due the school but 
must hold the remaining funds for disbursement to the student at the 
time of enrollment. However, if the student is unable to meet other 
educational expenses due before the time of enrollment, the school may 
obtain the student's endorsement and disburse to the student that 
portion of funds required to meet these other educational expenses.
    (b) If a school determines that a student does not plan to enroll, 
the school must return a loan disbursement check or draft to the lender 
within 30 days of this determination.

<R05>
Sec. 60.53  Notification to lender or holder of change in enrollment status.

    Each school must notify the holder of a HEAL loan of any change in 
the student's enrollment status within 30 days following the change in 
status. Each notice must contain the student's full name under which the 
loan was received, the student's current name (if different), the 
student's Social Security number, the date of the change in the 
enrollment status, or failure to enroll as scheduled for any academic 
period as a full-time student, the student's latest known permanent and 
temporary addresses, and other information which the school may decide 
is necessary to identify or locate the student. If the school does not 
know the identity of the current holder of the HEAL loan, it must notify 
the HEAL Program Office of a change in the student's enrollment status. 
This notification is not required for vacation periods and leaves of 
absence or other temporary interruptions which do not exceed one 
academic term.

Sec. 60.54  Payment of refunds by schools.

    A participating school must pay that portion of a refund that is 
allocable to a HEAL loan directly to the original lender (or to a 
subsequent holder of the loan note, if the school has knowledge of the 
holder's identity). At the same time, the school must provide to the

Sec. 60.61  Responsibilities of a HEAL school.

    (a) A HEAL school is required to carry out the following activities 
for each HEAL applicant or borrower:
    (1) Conduct and document an entrance interview with each student 
(individually or in groups) no later than prior to the loan recipient's 
first HEAL disbursement in each academic year that the loan recipient 
obtains a HEAL loan. The school must inform the loan recipient during 
the entrance interview of his or her rights and responsibilities under a 
HEAL loan, including the consequences for noncompliance with those 
responsibilities, and must gather personal information which would 
assist in locating the loan recipient should he or she depart from the 
school without receiving an exit interview. A school may meet this 
requirement through correspondence where the school determines that a 
face-to-face meeting is impracticable.
    (2) Conduct and document an exit interview with each HEAL loan 
recipient (individually or in groups) within the final academic term of 
the loan recipient's enrollment prior to his or her anticipated 
graduation date or other departure date from the school. The school must 
inform the loan recipient in the exit interview of his or her rights and 
responsibilities under each HEAL loan, including the consequences for 
noncompliance with those responsibilities. The school must also collect 
personal information from the loan recipient which would assist the 
school or the lender or holder in skiptracing activities and to direct 
the loan recipient to contact the lender or holder concerning specific 
repayment terms and options. A copy of the documentation of the exit 
interview, including the personal information collected for skiptracing 
activities, and any other information required by the Secretary 
regarding the exit interview must be sent to the lender or holder of 
each HEAL loan within 30 days of the exit interview. If the loan 
recipient departs from the school prior to the anticipated date or does 
not receive an exit interview, the exit interview information must be 
mailed to the loan recipient by the school within 30 days of the 
school's knowledge of the departure or the anticipated departure date, 
whichever is earlier. The school must request that the loan recipient 
forward any required information (e.g., skiptracing information, request 
for deferment, etc.) to the lender or holder. The school must notify the 
lender or holder of the loan recipient's departure at the same time it 
mails the exit interview material to the loan recipient.
    (3) Verify the accuracy and completeness of information provided by 
each student on the HEAL loan application, particularly in regard to the 
HEAL eligibility requirements, by comparing the information with 
previous loan applications or other records or information provided by 
the student to the school. Notify the potential lender of any 
discrepancies which were not resolved between the school and the 
student.
    (4) Develop and implement procedures relating to check receipt and 
release which keep these functions separate from the application 
preparation and approval process and assure that the amount of the HEAL 
loan check(s) does(do) not exceed the approved total amount of the loan 
and the statutory maximums. Checks must not be cashed without the 
borrower's personal endorsement. Documentation of these procedures and 
their usage shall be maintained by the school.
    (5) Maintain accurate and complete records on each HEAL borrower and 
related school activities required by the HEAL program. All HEAL records 
shall be properly safeguarded and protected from environmental threats 
and unauthorized intrusion for use and theft.

[[Page 441]]

    (6) Maintain documentation of the criteria used to develop the 
school's standard student budgets in the school's general records, 
readily available for audit purposes, and maintain in each HEAL 
borrower's record a copy of the standard budget which was actually used 
in the determination of the maximum loan amount approvable for the 
student, as described in Sec. 60.51.
    (7) Notify the lender or its assignee of any changes in the 
student's name, address, status, or other information pertinent to the 
HEAL loan not more than 30 days after receiving information indicating 
such a change.
    (b) Any school which has information which indicates potential or 
actual commission of fraud or other offenses against the United States 
involving these loan funds must promptly provide this information to the 
appropriate Regional Office of Inspector General for Investigations.
    (c) The school will be considered responsible and the Secretary may 
seek reimbursement from any school for the amount of a loan in default 
on which the Secretary has paid an insurance claim, if the Secretary 
finds that the school did not comply with the applicable HEAL statute 
and regulations, or its written agreement with the Secretary. The 
Secretary may excuse certain defects if the school satisfies the 
Secretary that the defect did not contribute to the default or prejudice 
the Secretary's attempt to collect the loan from the borrower.
    (d) A school is authorized to withhold services from a HEAL borrower 
who is in default on a HEAL loan received while enrolled in that school, 
except in instances where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. Such 
services may include, but are not limited to academic transcripts and 
alumni services. Defaulted HEAL borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy 
shall provide court documentation that verifies the filing for 
bankruptcy upon the request of the school. Schools will also supply this 
information to the Secretary upon request. All academic and financial 
aid transcripts that are released on a defaulted HEAL borrower must 
indicate on the transcript that the borrower is in default on a HEAL 
loan. It is the responsibility of the borrower to provide the school 
with documentation from the lender, holder, or Department when a default 
has been satisfactorily resolved, in order to obtain access to services 
that are being withheld, or to have the reference to default removed 
from the academic and financial aid transcripts.

subpart and a copy of part 10 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations,

the purpose of the fellowship. The fellow and the sponsoring institution 
shall be notified in writing of such termination.


<R05>

nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or 
otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, all copyrightable or 
copyrighted material resulting from the fellowship award.

parts 6 and 8, as amended. Such regulations shall apply to any activity 
for which fellowship funds are in fact used, whether within the scope of 
the fellowship as approved or otherwise. Appropriate measures shall be 
taken by the fellow, the sponsoring institution, and the Surgeon General 
to assure that no contracts, assignments, or other arrangements 
inconsistent with the fellowship obligation are entered into or 
continued and that all personnel involved in the supported activity are 
aware of and comply with such obligation. Laboratory notes, related 
technical data and information pertaining to inventions or discoveries 
shall be maintained for such periods, and filed with or otherwise made

shall be paid to the United States as such interest is received by the

    Attention is called to the fact that funds paid to a sponsoring 
institution pursuant to Sec. 61.11 in order to meet the expenses of the 
activities of a fellow

[[Page 446]]

institution is thus subject in this respect to the prohibition against 
discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin imposed 
by title VI, Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the implementing Regulation 
of the Department of Health and Human Services (45 CFR part 80).

resident was within the continental United States, payment of the 
expenses of preparing the remains and transporting them to the place of 
residence for interment may be authorized as provided for other civilian 
employees of the Public Health Service.
    (c) Benefits. In addition to other benefits provided herein, service 
fellows shall be entitled to benefits as provided by law or regulation 
for other civilian employees of the Public Health Service.

participant for health, personal, or other reasons, or (2) requires the 
participant to repeat course work for which the Secretary has previously 
made scholarship payments under Sec. 62.7. However, if the repeated 
course work does not delay the participant's graduation date, 
scholarship payments will continue except for any additional costs 
relating to the repeated course work. Any scholarship payments suspended 
under this paragraph will be resumed by the Secretary upon notification 
by the school that the participant has returned from the leave-of-
absence or has completed the repeated course work and is pursuing as a 
full-time student the course of study for which the scholarship was

Secretary as soon as possible following: (i) the completion of the 
participant's course of study leading to a degree in medicine, 
osteopathy, dentistry, or an equivalent credential for a particular 
health profession, and (ii) appointment of the participant as a 
Commissioned Officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service or

period for which the Scholarship Program participant is obligated to 
serve is equal to 1 year for each school year for which the participant 
receives a scholarship award under this part, or 2 years, whichever is 
greater.
    (d) Service by detail. If the Secretary determines that there is no 
need in a health manpower shortage area for a member of the profession 
in which the Scholarship Program participant is obligated to provide 
service, the Scholarship Program participant may be detailed to serve 
the period of obligated service as a full-time member of the profession 
for which the participant has been trained, in any unit of the 
Department of Health and Human Services as the Secretary may determine.
    (e) Creditability of approved graduate training. Except as provided 
in Sec. 62.14(b)(2), no period of approved graduate training will be

Scholarship Program participant who demonstrates exceptional promise for 
medical research may perform the period of obligated service owed under 
this section by participating in the National Research Service Award 
Program for individual postdoctoral fellows authorized under section 472 
of the Act.
    (2) Exceptional promise for medical research will be demonstrated if 
the

[[Page 452]]

participant applies for a National Research Service Award for individual 
postdoctoral fellows, is selected to participate in this research 
program, and accepts the offer of participation. A Scholarship Program 
participant in the National Research Service Award Program will receive 
credit toward satisfying the period of obligated service incurred under 
this section for any period of time he or she is engaged in activities 
which meet the service requirements of the National Research Service 
Award Program.
    (3) If the time served under the National Research Service Award 
Program is less than the total period of obligated service owed under 
the Scholarship Program, the participant will serve the remainder of the 
Scholarship Program service obligation (i) in activities which meet the 
criteria for service under the National Research Service Award Program, 
as approved by the Secretary or (ii) as a member of the National Health 
Service Corps providing health services in the full-time clinical 
practice of his or her health profession. A participant who fails to 
begin or complete the service requirements under the National Research 
Service Award Program may be subject to the default penalty under 
Sec. 62.10(c) of this part and the default penalties under the National 
Research Service Award Program.
    (g) Release from service obligation to engage in private practice. 
The Secretary will release a participant from all or part of the service 
obligation if the participant applies for a release under section 753 of 
the Act and agrees in writing to engage for a period equal to the 
remaining period of the participant's service obligation in the full-
time private clinical practice of the participant's health profession, 
under the requirements of section 753 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 62.9  Under what circumstances can the period of obligated service be deferred to complete approved graduate training?

    (a) Requested deferment. Upon the request of any participant 
receiving a degree from a school of medicine, osteopathy, or dentistry, 
veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry or pharmacy, the Secretary will 
defer the beginning date of the obligated service to allow the 
participant to complete an approved graduate training program. The 
period of this deferment may not exceed (1) three years for any 
participant receiving a degree from a school of medicine, osteopathy or 
dentistry, or (2) one year for any participant recieving a degree from a 
school of veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry or pharmacy. The 
Secretary may, however, extend this period of deferment if the Secretary 
determines that the extension is consistent with the needs of the 
National Health Service Corps.
    (b) Required deferment. Each participant receiving a degree in 
medicine or osteopathy who does not intend to enter training which can 
be completed within the deferment period granted under paragraph (a) of 
this section must complete at least one year of approved graduate 
training before beginning the period of obligated service. This one year 
of training must be in (1) an allopathic flexible first-year program 
whose sponsorship includes approved residencies in family practice, 
internal medicine, pediatrics, or a categorical first-year program in 
family practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics; (2) a rotating 
internship in osteopathic medicine; or (3) such other programs as the 
Secretary determines provides comparable experience. Any participant 
receiving a degree in medicine or osteopathy who fails to complete the 
one year of required training or an approved graduate training program 
for which a deferment was granted under paragraph (a) of this section 
will be subject to the default penalties of Sec. 62.10(c).
    (c) Altering deferment. Before altering the length or type of 
approved graduate training for which the period of obligated service was 
deferred under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the participant 
must request and obtain the Secretary's approval of the alteration.
    (d) Additional terms of deferment. The Secretary may prescribe 
additional terms and conditions for deferment under paragraphs (a), (b), 
and (c) of this section as necessary to carry out the purposes of the 
Scholarship Program.

[[Page 453]]

    (e) Beginning of service after deferment. Any participant whose 
period of obligated service has been deferred under paragraphs (a) or 
(b) of this section must begin the obligated service when the 
participant begins to provide health services in the health manpower 
shortage area to which he or she is assigned by the Secretary. This 
assignment will be made by the Secretary as soon as possible following 
(1) the completion of the requested or required graduate training for 
which the deferment was granted, and (2) appointment as a Commissioned 
Officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service or as a civilian 
member of the National Health Service Corps.


<R05>
Sec. 62.10  What will happen if an individual does not comply with the terms and conditions of participating in the scholarship program?

    (a) If a participant, other than one described in paragraph (b) of 
this section, fails to accept payment or instructs the school not to 
accept payment of the scholarship provided by the Secretary, the 
participant must, in addition to any service or other obligation 
incurred under the contract, pay to the United States the amount of 
$1,500 liquidated damages. Payment of this amount must be made within 30 
days of the date on which the participant fails to accept payment of the 
scholarship award or instructs the school not to accept payment.
    (b) When a participant fails to maintain an acceptable level of 
academic standing, is dismissed from the school for disciplinary 
reasons, or voluntarily terminates the course of study or program for 
which the scholarship was awarded before completing the course of study 
or program, the participant must, instead of performing any service 
obligation, pay to the United States an amount equal to all scholarship 
funds awarded under Sec. 62.7. Payment of this amount must be made 
within 3 years of the date the participant becomes liable to make 
payment under this paragraph.
    (c) If a participant fails to begin or complete the period of 
obligated service incurred under Sec. 62.8, including failing to comply 
with the applicable terms and conditions of a deferment granted by the 
Secretary, the participant must pay to the United States an amount 
determined by the formula set forth in section 754(c) of the Act. 
Payment of this amount shall be made within 1 year of the date that the 
participant failed to begin or complete the period of obligated service, 
as determined by the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 62.11  When can a scholarship program payment obligation be discharged in bankruptcy?

    In accordance with section 754(d)(3) of the Act, any payment 
obligation incurred under Sec. 62.10 may not be discharged in bankruptcy 
under title XI of the United States Code until 5 years after the date on 
which the payment obligation is due.


<R05>
Sec. 62.12  Under what circumstances can the service or payment obligation be canceled, waived or suspended?

    (a) Any obligation of a participant for service or payment will be 
canceled upon the death of the participant.
    (b)(1) A participation may seek a waiver or suspension of the 
service or payment obligations incurred under this part by written 
request to the Secretary setting forth the bases, circumstances, and 
causes which support the requested action. The Secretary may approve a 
request for a suspension for a period of 1 year. A renewal of this 
suspension may also be granted.
    (2) The Secretary may waive or suspend any service or payment 
obligation incurred by a participant whenever compliance by the 
participant (i) is impossible, or (ii) would involve extreme hardship to 
the participant and if enforcement of the service or payment obligation 
would be against equity and good conscience.
    (c) Compliance by a participant with a service or payment obligation 
will be considered impossible if the Secretary determines, on the basis 
of information and documentation as may be required, that the 
participant suffers from a physical or mental disability resulting in 
the permanent inability of the participant to perform the service or 
other activities which would be necessary to comply with the obligation.
    (d) In determining whether to waive or suspend any or all of the 
service or

[[Page 454]]

payment obligations of a participant as imposing an undue hardship and 
being against equity and good conscience, the Secretary, on the basis of 
information and documentation as may be required, will consider:
    (1) The participant's present financial resources and obligations;
    (2) The participant's estimated future financial resources and 
obligations; and
    (3) The extent to which the participant has problems of a personal 
nature, such as physical or mental disability, terminal illness in the 
immediate family which so intrude on the participant's present and 
future ability to perform as to raise a presumption that the individual 
will be unable to perform the obligation incurred.


<R05>
Sec. 62.13  What are the limitations on the receipt of concurrent benefits?

    Under section 741(f) or 836(h) of the Act, the Secretary may agree 
to repay a portion of an individual's educational loans in return for 
the individual's agreement to practice his or her profession in an area 
in need of health manpower. However, a Scholarship Program participant 
may not enter into an agreement with the Secretary under section 741(f) 
or 836(h) of the Act, until either:
    (a) The participant has completed the service obligation under the 
Scholarship Program,
    (b) The Secretary has recovered from the participant an amount 
determined under Sec. 62.10, or
    (c) Any service or payment obligation has been waived under 
Sec. 62.12.

In no case shall a scholarship received under these regulations be 
considered an educational loan for the purposes of section 741(f) or 
836(h) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 62.14  What are the special provisions relating to recipients of awards under the PH/NHSC scholarship training program who will also receive awards under 
          the scholarship program?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if a 
participant has previously received an award under the PH/NHSC 
Scholarship Training Program and also receives an award under the 
Scholarship Program, the terms and conditions of these regulations will 
apply to the participant's entire obligation incurred under both the PH/
NHSC Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program.
    (b) If a participant has received an award under the PH/NHSC 
Scholarship Training Program and also receives an award under the 
Scholarship Program, the following conditions apply:
    (1) Period of obligated service--carry over. The period of obligated 
service owed by the participant is equal to the total number of school 
years for which scholarship support was awarded under both the PH/NHSC 
Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program without regard 
to either Program's minimum support requirement under 42 CFR 62.7(a) 
(1976) as adopted on May 22, 1974 (see 39 FR 17962), and under 
Sec. 62.8(c) of this part.
    (2) Credit for internship and residency training. (i) If a 
participant received a scholarship under the PH/NHSC Scholarship 
Training Program for any school year beginning before October 12, 1976, 
the participant will receive credit toward satisfying the periods of 
obligated service incurred under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training 
Program and under Sec. 62.8 of this part for any periods of internship 
or residency training served in a Service or National Health Service 
Corps facility.
    (ii) If a participant received a scholarship for the first time 
during the 1977-78 school year under the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training 
Program, the participant will only receive 1 year of credit toward 
satisfying the period of obligated service incurred under the PH/NHSC 
Scholarship Training Program for internship or residency training served 
in a Service or National Health Service Corps facility.
    (3) Default penalties. The PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program 
default penalty will apply to a participant who fails to begin or 
complete the active duty service obligation incurred under that Program, 
and the Sec. 62.10 default penalties will apply to a participant who 
fails to begin or complete the service obligation incurred under 
Sec. 62.8 of these regulations. In determining which default penalty to 
apply when an individual who has received a Scholarship award under both 
the PH/NHSC

[[Page 455]]

Scholarship Training Program and the Scholarship Program fails to begin

<R05>
Sec. 62.25  What does the Loan Repayment Program provide?

    (a) Loan repayment. For each year of service the individual agrees 
to serve, with a minimum of 2 years of obligated service, the Secretary 
may pay:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, up to 
$20,000 per year of a Program participant's qualifying loans or
    (2) Up to $25,000 per year for a Program participant's qualifying 
loans if the Program participant agrees to provide obligated service in 
the Indian Health Service or a health facility or program operated by a 
tribe or tribal organization under the Indian Self-Determination Act.

The Secretary may establish different levels of annual loan repayment to 
encourage Program participants to serve in a manner which is in the best 
interest of the Loan Repayment Program. No loan repayments will be made 
for any professional practice performed prior to the effective date of 
the Loan Repayment Program Contract. Once a loan repayment contract has 
been signed by both parties, the Secretary will obligate such funds as 
will be necessary to ensure that sufficient funds will be available to 
make loan repayments for the duration of the period of obligated 
service.
    (b) Site visit. The Secretary may reimburse an individual for the 
actual and reasonable travel expenses associated with one trip from the 
individual's residence to a site for the purpose of evaluating such site 
for service under the the Loan Repayment Program.
    (c) Tax liability payments. The Secretary may, upon a Program 
participant's written request, make payments in a reasonable amount, as 
determined by the Secretary, to reimburse the Program participant for 
all or part of the increased Federal, State and local tax liability 
resulting from loan repayments received under the Loan Repayment 
Program. To maximize the Federal resources available for placing 
participants in HMSAs, supplementary payments for increased tax 
liability will only be made under unusual circumstances, and in no cases 
will these tax liability payments exceed 20% of the annual amounts of 
the loans being repaid. Program participants wishing to receive tax 
liability payments must submit their requests for such payments in a 
manner prescribed by the Secretary and must provide the Secretary with 
any documentation the Secretary determines is necessary to establish a 
Program participant's increased tax liability. The Secretary will 
determine, based on the availability of funds and such other factors as 
the Secretary determines, the amounts

[[Page 458]]

of any such payments that may be made.

Sec. 62.26  What does an individual have to do in return for loan repayments received under the Loan Repayment Program?

    (a) A Program participant whose eligibility for the Loan Repayment 
Program is based on Sec. 62.24(a)(1)(i) of this subpart must maintain 
full-time enrollment, at an acceptable level of academic standing, in 
that course of study until its completion. Upon completion of that 
course of study, a Program participant who received a degree in 
allopathic or osteopathic medicine must enter approved graduate training 
and a Program participant who received a degree in a health profession 
other than allopathic or osteopathic medicine may enter approved 
graduate training. Once a Program participant enters approved graduate 
training, he or she must also meet the requirements set forth in 
paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section. If a Program 
participant who received a degree in a health profession other than 
allopathic or osteopathic medicine does not enter approved graduate 
training; service, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, 
must commence as soon as possible upon the Program participant's 
completion of the course of study leading to his or her health 
professions degree.
    (b) A Program participant whose eligibility for the Loan Repayment 
Program is based on Sec. 62.24(a)(1)(ii) of this subpart must: (1) 
Continue in his or her approved graduate training program at an 
acceptable level of academic standing; (2) provide the Secretary with 
annual documentation of continued participation in that approved 
graduate training program at an acceptable level of academic standing; 
(3) successfully complete that approved graduate training program; and 
(4) commence service, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, 
as soon as possible upon completion of approved graduate training.
    (c) A Program participant whose eligibility for the Loan Repayment 
Program is based on Sec. 62.24(a)(1)(iii) of this subpart must commence 
service, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, as soon as 
possible after the effective date of the Loan Repayment Program 
Contract.
    (d) If a Program participant fails to complete approved graduate 
training, the Secretary may, on his or her own initiative or at the 
Program participant's request, waive, for good cause, the completion 
requirement. Good cause will be deemed to exist if the Secretary 
determines that the Program participant has sufficient health 
professions training to be utilized by and make a substantial 
contribution to the National Health Service Corps. If waiver of the 
completion requirement in paragraph (b) of this section is granted; 
service, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, must commence 
as soon as possible after the granting of the waiver.
    (e) Except for Program participants who fail to complete their 
course of study leading to a health professions degree or who fail to 
complete approved graduate training and do not receive a waiver pursuant 
to paragraph (d) of this section, each program participant must:
    (1) Serve in a health manpower shortage area to which he or she is 
assigned by the Secretary as a member of the National Health Service 
Corps or serve pursuant to section 338D of the Act in a health manpower 
shortage area selected by the Secretary and
    (2) Accept employment in a full-time clinical practice of the 
Program participant's profession, as
    (i) A commissioned officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the 
Public Health Service,
    (ii) A civilian member of the National Health Service Corps who is

the provisions of section 338D of the Act.

[[Page 459]]

    (f) The minimum length of obligated service is two years, or such 
longer period as the Program participant may agree to. The maximum 
length of obligated service is four years. If a Program participant 
agrees to an original contract of two or three years, such contract may 
be extended, subject to the availability of appropriated funding, for 
one year or two years (up to the four-year maximum). A one-year 
extension will not reactivate the statutory minimum requirement of two 
years of service.

participant electing to serve under section 204(b) of Pub. L. 100-177 
chooses to serve at a site on the 1989 HPOL, such participant must match 
to a HPOL site by February 15, 1989, and must begin service at the site 
by October 1, 1989. If a Program participant has elected to serve under 
section 204(c) of Pub. L. 100-177, such participant must match to a 
SHPOL site by May 15, 1989, and must begin service at that site by 
October 1, 1989.
    (e) Site visits. The Program participant is responsible for the 
costs of any site visit(s) and any other contact with the site to obtain 
employment at the site.
    (f) Effect of failure to meet established time frames. If a Program 
participant does not match to a site or begin service at that site 
within the time frames described in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
Secretary will determine that such individual is not relieved of his or 
her liability to the United States under the PH/NHSC Scholarship 
Training Program and/or Scholarship Program (including accrued interest 
and/or damages).
    (g) Service. Service must be performed in accordance with subpart II 
of part D of title III of the Act. Service credit will begin after a 
Program participant has matched to a HPOL or SHPOL site and has 
commenced service at that site in accordance with subpart II of part D 
of title III of the Act.
    (h) Secretary's exclusion authority. The Secretary is authorized, at 
any time, to deny or terminate an individual's participation in the 
Program for reasons related to the individual's professional competence 
or conduct.


<R05>
Sec. 62.74  How much credit will a Program participant receive for monetary repayments made, or for approved service performed, before beginning service under 
          the Special Repayment Program?

    (a) Prior approved service performed by a Program participant will 
be credited to the Program participant for the purpose of calculating 
the Program participant's remaining service obligation under this 
Program. Thus, the Program participant's remaining service obligation 
will be calculated by subtracting the number of days of the Program 
participant's prior approved service from the number of days of the 
Program participant's original service obligation under the PH/NHSC 
Scholarship Training Program and/or the Scholarship Program. If a 
Program participant has made monetary payments, his or her remaining 
service obligation will be reduced by converting the monetary payments 
into days of service credit as set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, whichever is applicable.
    (b) Program participants who elect to serve pursuant to section 
204(b) and section 204(c)(2) of Pub. L. 100-177, will not receive a 
refund of any amounts previously paid but will receive service credit 
for those payments as follows:
    (1) The number of days of service credit will be calculated by 
dividing the total amount paid by the Program participant prior to the 
Program participant's service start date by the total debt as of the 
service start date and multiplying the result of that division by the 
number of days of the participant's remaining service obligation (as 
determined by the formula set forth in the second sentence of paragraph 
(a) of this section).
    (2) If the Program participant defaults on a contract under this 
Program, prior monetary payments will not be credited to service but 
will be applied to the monetary debt owed by the Program participant.
    (c) Program participants who elect to serve under section 204(c)(1) 
of Pub. L. 100-177 must pay an amount equal to the scholarship amount. 
Any amounts paid by the Program participant prior to or after entry into 
the Program, in accordance with Sec. 62.76 of this subpart, will be used 
to reduce the Program participant's financial obligation incurred under 
section 204(c)(1) of Pub. L. 100-177. In some cases, the amounts paid 
before or after entry into the Program will exceed the scholarship 
amount. These payments in excess of the scholarship amount will be 
converted into days of service credit under the formula set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If a Program participant defaults on a 
contract under this option, the monies paid in excess of the scholarship 
amount will not be credited to service but will be credited toward the 
monetary debt owed by the

[[Page 465]]

Program participant under section 338E(b) of the Act or section 
225(f)(1) of the Act, as in effect on September 30, 1977. The 
scholarship amount paid upon entering this option will be forfeited.


<R05>
Sec. 62.75  Will individuals serving under the Special Repayment Program receive credit for partial service?

    (a) With respect to obligations under the Scholarship Program, a 
credit will be allowed for partial service under the Special Repayment 
Program and will result in a reduction of the Program participant's 
financial obligation in accordance with the following formula:


                                                                                                                
                                                                   [t-(s + \1/2\r)]                             
                                                    A=30         -------------------                            
                                                                          t                                     
                                                                                                                

In which:

`A' is the amount the United States is entitled to recover;
`0' is the sum of the amounts paid to or on behalf of the Program 
          participant under the Scholarship Program and the interest on 
          such amounts which would be payable if, at the time the 
          amounts were paid, they were loans bearing interest at the 
          maximum legal prevailing rate, as determined by the Treasurer 
          of the United States;
`t' is the sum of (1) the number of months of prior approved service 
          plus (2) the number of months of the Program participant's 
          period of obligated service under the Program including any 
          additional months of service incurred pursuant to section 
          204(c)(2) of Pub. L. 100-177;
`s' is the number of months of prior approved service performed by the 
          Program participant before commencing service under this 
          Program; and
`r' is the number of months of service performed by the Program 
          participant in compliance with this Program.

However, where a judgment has been entered against a Program 
participant, the formula will be revised such that:

`30' is the amount of the judgment representing the Program 
          participant's liability under the Scholarship Program, 
          including any accrued post judgment interest and excluding any 
          monetary payments on the judgment which may have been made by 
          the Program participant;
`t' is the sum of (1) the number of months of prior approved service 
          performed by the Program participant after entry of the 
          judgment but before commencing service under this Program plus 
          (2) the number of months of the Program participant's period 
          of obligated service under the Program including any 
          additional months of service incurred pursuant to section 
          204(c)(2) of Pub. L. 100-177; and
`s' is the number of months of prior approved service performed by the 
          Program participant after the entry of the judgment but before 
          commencing service under this Program.

    (b) With respect to obligations under the PH/NHSC Scholarship 
Training Program, if a Program participant fails to complete the period 
of obligated service under the Program (including any additional months 
of service incurred pursuant to section 204(c)(1) of Pub. L. 100-177), 
no credit for partial service under this Program will be allowed.
    (c) Where participants have obligations under both the Scholarship 
Program and the PH/NHSC Scholarship Training Program, credit for service 
will be applied against the scholarship obligations in the order in 
which they were incurred.


<R05>
Sec. 62.76  How will amounts of money due under the option under section 204(c)(1) of Public Law 100-177 be required to be repaid?

    Program participants who elect to serve under section 204(c)(1) of 
Pub. L. 100-177 will be required to pay the full scholarship amount at 
least 60 days prior to the service start date specified in the 
documentation submitted to the Secretary.

<R05>
Sec. 64.5  How are grant applications evaluated?

    The Secretary shall evaluate applications through the officers and 
employees, experts, consultants, or groups engaged by the Secretary for 
that purpose. The Secretary's evaluation will be for technical merit and 
shall take into account, among other pertinent factors, the significance 
of the project, the qualifications and competency of the project 
director and proposed staff, the adequacy of selection criteria for 
trainees for the project, the adequacy of the applicant's resources 
available for the project, and the amount of grant funds necessary for 
completion of its objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 64.6  Awards.

    (a) Criteria. Within the limits of available funds, the Secretary 
may award training grants to carry out those projects which:
    (1) Are determined by the Secretary to be technically meritorious; 
and
    (2) In the judgment of the Secretary best promote the purpose of the 
grant program as authorized by section 472 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 286b-
3), the regulations of this part (see Sec. 64.1), and address program 
priorities.
    (b) Project period. (1) The notice of grant award specifies how long 
the Secretary intends to support the project without requiring the 
project to recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, 
will usually be for one to five years.
    (2) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of these awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices, and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by the Secretary that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (3) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.
    (4) Any balance of federally obligated grant funds remaining 
unobligated by

[[Page 470]]

the grantee at the end of a budget period may be carried forward to the 
next budget period, for use as prescribed by the Secretary, provided a 
continuation award is made. If at any time during a budget period it 
becomes apparent to the Secretary that the amount of Federal funds 
awarded and available to the grantee for that period, including any 
unobligated balance carried forward from prior periods, exceeds the 
grantee's needs for that period, the Secretary may adjust the amounts 
awarded by withdrawing the excess.


<R05>
Sec. 64.7  What other conditions apply?

    (a) Grants awarded under this part are subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) The grantee may not materially change the quality, nature, or 
duration of the project unless the written approval of the Secretary is 
obtained prior to the change.
    (2) The grantee must submit to the Secretary, in the manner 
prescribed by the Secretary, the name and other pertinent information 
regarding each individual who is awarded a stipend under a grant.

award of any grant under this part if it is determined by the Secretary 
that the conditions are necessary to carry out the purpose of the grant.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0925-0276)


<R05>
Sec. 64.8  How may funds be used?

    A grantee shall expend funds it receives under this part solely in 
accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of 
this part, the terms and conditions of the grant award, and the 
applicable cost principles in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74. The funds may 
not be expended for:
    (a) Compensation for employment or for the performance of personal 
services by individuals receiving training and instruction; or
    (b) Payments to any individual who does not meet the minimum 
qualifications for training and instruction established by the grantee 
and approved by the Secretary or who has failed to demonstrate 
satisfactory participation in the training in accordance with the usual 
standards and procedures of the grantee.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 64a.105  What are the conditions of obligated service?

    In order to receive a clinical traineeship an individual must comply 
with the following conditions:
    (a) Written assurance. Prior to the award of a clinical traineeship, 
the individual must sign a written assurance (in such form and manner as 
the Secretary prescribes) that he or she will satisfy the requirements 
of this section.
    (b) Commencement and crediting of service. (1) An individual must 
start the obligated service within twenty-four months after termination 
of the clinical traineeship and carry out the service on a continuous 
basis unless, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
individual has requested and had approved, respectively, an extension of 
the time for beginning the service, or a break in service.
    (2) Following termination of the traineeship, the individual must 
annually provide (in such form and manner as the Secretary prescribes) a 
written report describing those previous years' activities which are 
related to service that fulfills the payback obligation. The Secretary 
will review this report and credit all service performed in those 
categories specified in paragraph (d) of this section toward the 
individual's payback obligation, except any service which is performed:
    (i) Before termination of the individual's clinical traineeship; and
    (ii) As part of any activity, such as course work, preparation of a 
dissertation or thesis, or practicum, which is needed to complete the 
training for which the individual received the traineeship.
    (c) Duration of obligation. The period of service payback must equal 
the period of support under the clinical traineeship on a month for 
month basis.
    (d) Performance of the obligated service--(1) General requirements. 
The obligated service must consist of the provision of service for which 
the individual was trained (in the training program for which the 
clinical traineeship was received) and must be performed on a full-time 
basis (not less than 30 hours per week averaged over the obligated 
service period).
    (2) Preferred service. Except as provided under paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section, the individual must provide the obligated service in:
    (i) A public inpatient mental institution;
    (ii) Any entity which is receiving or has received a grant under the 
Mental Health Systems Act or the Community Mental Health Centers Act;
    (iii) A psychiatric manpower shortage area designated by the 
Secretary under section 332 of the Public Health Service Act and 42 CFR 
part 5;
    (iv) Any public or private nonprofit entity or in any nursing home 
(whether public, private nonprofit, or for profit) in which 50 percent 
or more of those served are within one or more of the following groups: 
Racial or ethnic minorities (American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or 
Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic), chronically mentally ill, mentally 
retarded, criminal or delinquent populations, rape victims, physically 
handicapped, abusers of alcohol, or persons addicted to drugs or other 
substances, children and adolescents, the elderly, poverty populations, 
migrants, members of the armed forces (or veterans if seen in a Federal 
facility), residents of areas other than those defined as urbanized by 
the Department of Commerce, or any other special populations, such as 
groups of refugees or disaster victims, which are specifically 
designated by the Secretary for this purpose.
    (3) Alternate service. If the individual obtains the written 
approval of the

[[Page 473]]

Secretary, the individual may fulfill his or her obligation by:
    (i) Serving in any public or private nonprofit entity or in any 
nursing home (whether public, private nonprofit, or for profit) in which 
not less than 25 percent of those served are within one or more of the 
underserved population groups listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this 
section. The individual must demonstrate a service commitment of more 
than 50 percent of his or her time to the targeted populations.
    (ii) Teaching, conducting research, or conducting evaluation 
directed at improving alcohol, drug abuse or mental health services to 
one or more of the priority population groups listed in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iv) of this section, or working in a position which fosters the 
closer collaboration of health and alcohol, drug abuse or mental health 
services.
    (iii) Providing in a public or private nonprofit entity 
consultation, training and education, liaison, community support or 
other professional services for which the individual was trained when 
the individual's work is directed toward improving alcohol, drug abuse 
or mental health services to the priority populations listed in 
paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (e) Conditions for deferral or break in service, waiver, or 
cancellation. (1) Upon receipt of a written request showing good cause 
therefor by the individual having a payback obligation, the Secretary 
may:
    (i) Extend the period for beginning the obligated service (24 months 
after termination of the clinical traineeship), permit breaks in the 
required continuous service or extend the period for repayment under 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, if it is determined that:
    (A) An extension or break in service is necessary for the completion 
of training;
    (B) Performance of the obligation must be delayed because a 
temporary disability makes present performance impossible; or
    (C) Performance of the obligation must be delayed because present 
performance would involve a substantial hardship and failure to extend 
the period would be against equity and good conscience.
    (ii) Waive, in whole or in part, the service payback and recovery 
requirements of this section if it is determined that fulfillment would 
be impossible because the individual is permanently and totally 
disabled.
    (iii) In making determinations under Sec. 64a.105(e)(1)(i)(C), the 
Secretary will take into consideration the following factors:
    (A) The individual's present financial resources and obligations;
    (B) The individual's estimated future financial resources and 
obligations;
    (C) The reasons for the individual's failure to complete the 
requirements within the prescribed period, such as problems of a 
personal nature;
    (D) The unavailability of employment opportunities appropriate to 
the individual's education and training; and
    (E) Any other extenuating circumstances.
    (2) Upon receipt of written notice giving evidence of a conflicting 
obligation under section 752 or 753 of the Act or of an election to 
fulfill an obligation under section 472 of the Act prior to an 
obligation under this section, the Secretary will extend the period for 
beginning service (24 months after termination of the clinical 
traineeship), permit breaks in the required continuous service or extend 
the period for repayment under paragraph (g)(1), as appropriate.
    (3) The service payback and recovery obligations of an individual 
will be cancelled upon the submission to the Secretary of a certificate 
of that individual's death or other evidence which the Secretary 
determines to be satisfactory.
    (f) Conflicting or multiple payback obligations. In any case where 
the individual has, in addition to a payback obligation incurred under 
this section, an obligation to perform service under section 752 or 753 
of the Act (because of receipt of a National Health Service Corps 
scholarship) or under section 472 of the Act (because of receipt of a 
National Research Service Award), or both, performance of the same 
activity may not be counted toward more than

[[Page 474]]

one of these obligations. In determining the order in which obligations 
must be fulfilled, obligations under section 752 or 753 take precedence 
over obligations incurred under this section. However, with respect to 
obligations under this section and 472, the individual may elect which 
obligation to fulfill first. Any individual who has an obligation under 
section 752 or 753 or makes an election to fulfill an obligation under 
section 472 prior to an obligation under this section, must give written 
notice to the Secretary as provided by paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (g) Recovery for failure to perform obligated service. (1) If an 
individual fails to begin or complete the obligated service in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this 
section, that individual is obligated to repay the United States an 
amount equal to three times the cost of the award (including stipends 
and other trainee allowances) plus interest on that amount calculated 
for the total period since the trainee failed to perform the obligated 
service at the rate set by the Secretary of the Treasury for National 
Research Service Awards prevailing on the date on which the period of 
appointment begins, multiplied, in any case in which the service that 
was required has been performed in part, by the percentage which the 
length of service that was not performed is to the length of the service 
that was required to be performed. The amount will be determined under 
the following formula:

                                                                                                                
                                                                           (t-s)                                
                                           A=3(<greek-th>+mi<greek-th>) -----------                             
                                                                            (t)                                 
                                                                                                                

where

A=the amount the United States is entitled to recover;
<greek-th>=the cost of the clinical traineeship (including stipends and 
          other trainee allowances);
m=the number of months since the trainee failed to perform obligated 
          service;
i=the National Research Service Award rate on the date which the period 
          of appointment begins divided by twelve;
t=the total number of months of the service obligation;
s=the number of months that have been served.

    (2) Unless the Secretary extends the repayment period as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section, the individual shall pay to the United 
States the total amount which the United States is entitled to recover 
under paragraph (g)(1) of this section immediately upon the date that 
the individual fails to begin or complete the period of obligated 
service (including failing to comply with the applicable terms and 
conditions of an extension or break in service granted the individual) 
or upon the date that the individual indicates his or her intention not 
to fulfill the service obligation as determined by the Secretary. The 
amount is considered a debt owed to the United States, with interest 
accruing monthly upon the total debt as provided under paragraph (g)(1) 
of this section.

Sec. 65.1  To what projects do these regulations apply?

    (a) The regulations in this part apply to:
    (1) The program of grants for the training and education of workers 
who are or are likely to be engaged in activities related to hazardous 
waste removal or containment, or emergency response that is authorized 
under section 126(g) of the SARA; and

[[Page 475]]

    (2) The program of grants to support qualified non-profit 
organizations for the purpose of providing training and education to 
hazardous materials employees regarding: the safe unloading, loading, 
handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials; and, 
emergency preparedness for responding to accidents or incidents 
involving the transportation of hazardous materials that is authorized 
under section 118 of the HMTA.
    (b) Grants are available for curriculum and training materials 
development, technical support of training, direct student training, 
training program evaluation and related activities. Target populations 
for this training are workers and supervisors who are or are likely to 
be engaged in hazardous substance removal or other activities which 
expose or potentially expose these workers to hazardous substances in 
activities such as:
    (1) Waste handling and processing at waste generators and active and 
inactive hazardous substance treatment, storage, and disposal 
facilities;
    (2) Clean up, removal, containment, or remedial actions at waste 
sites;
    (3) Hazardous substance emergency response;
    (4) Hazardous substance disposal site risk assessment and 
investigation, clean up, or remedial actions; and
    (5) Transportation of hazardous wastes.

    Target populations may also be regulated under standards promulgated 
by the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Transportation, the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies 
under section 126(g) of the SARA or section 106(b) of the HMTA.
    (c) Two types of grants are available: Program grants covering the 
full range of activities, including program development, direct worker 
training and education, and program evaluation; and planning grants 
under the SARA.
    (1) Planning grants are intended to assist organizations which 
demonstrate potential for providing hazardous worker training, but need 
additional developmental efforts prior to initiation of full curriculum 
development and training activities. A limited number of one-year 
planning grants may be funded at a level determined appropriate by the 
Director. After successful completion of a one-year planning grant, a 
recipient may apply for a full program grant on a competitive basis.
    (2) Full program grants will be awarded to organizations with 
demonstrated capability to provide worker health and safety training and 
education and demonstrated ability to identify, describe, and access 
target populations. Full program grantees must be able to immediately 
initiate curriculum development and worker training activities.

<R05>
Sec. 65.6  How long does grant support last?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long NIEHS intends to 
support the project without requiring the project to recompete for 
funds. This period, called the project period, will usually be for 1-5 
years.

[[Page 477]]

    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be for one year and 
subsequent continuation awards will also be for one year at a time. A 
grantee must submit a separate application to have the support continued 
for each subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and 
the funding level of such awards will be made after consideration of 
such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices and the 
availability of funds. In all cases, continuation awards require a 
determination by the NIEHS that continued funding is in the best 
interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.


<R05>
Sec. 65.7  For what purposes may grant funds be spent?

    Individuals receiving training shall be entitled only to the

of medicine and doctor of philosophy.


<R05>
Sec. 66.107  Payments to awardees.

accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the 
United States shall be entitled to recover from the individual an amount 
determined in accordance with the formula:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                              (t-s)                     
                                A  =   0 --------------                 
                                              ( t )

    0 is the sum of the total amount paid under one or more Awards to 
the individual less the amount paid for the initial twelve months;
    t is total number in months in the individual's sevice obligation;
    and s is the number of months of the obligation served by him or her 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 66.111, the individual shall pay to 
the United States any amount which it is entitled to recover under 
paragraph (c) within a three-year period beginning on the date the 
United States becomes entitled to recover that amount. Interest shall 
accrue to the United States until any amount due it under paragraph (c) 
of this section is paid. The rate of interest will be fixed by the 
Secretary of the Treasury after taking into consideration private 
consumer rates of interest prevailing on the date the United States 
become entitled to recovery.

<R05>
Sec. 67.16  Grant award.

    (a) General. (1) Within the limits of funds available for such 
purpose and subject to the limitation of section 308(c) of the Act, the 
Secretary may award grants to those applicants whose approved projects 
will in his judgment best promote the purposes of section 305(b) of the 
Act and the regulations of this subpart, taking into consideration:
    (i) Recommendations made pursuant to Sec. 67.14.
    (ii) The appropriateness of the budget.
    (iii) The extent to which the research proposal and the fiscal plan 
provide assurance that effective use will be made of grant funds.
    (iv) The business management capability of the applicant.
    (v) The competence and skill of the staff, especially the senior 
personnel, in light of the scope of the project.
    (vi) The probable usefulness of the project results for dealing with 
national health care problems, policies, and programs.
    (vii) The relative priority of the proposed project in light of the 
established priorities of the National Center for Health Services 
Research.
    (2) In making any grant award the Secretary may add additional 
conditions to or require specific modifications in the project as 
proposed in the application including a different level of grant support 
from that requested in the application. In such cases the Secretary will 
obtain either the written agreement of the applicant to proceed on such 
basis prior to making any grant award or such condition or modification 
will appear on the Notice of Grant Award.
    (3) All grant awards shall be in writing. The Notice of Grant Award 
shall set forth the amount of funds awarded for the conduct of the 
approved project during the first budget period and the amount of annual 
support recommended for the remainder of the project period.
    (4) The project for any grant under this subpart shall be specified 
in the Notice of Grant Award and shall begin no later than 9 months 
following the date of such award. In no case will a project be approved 
for a project period exceeding 5 years. Where the Secretary determines 
on the basis of a request by the grantee prior to the completion of the 
currently active grant that additional time is needed to permit the use 
of funds previously awarded but not expended, the approved project may 
be extended for a period of time not to exceed 12 months except that in 
no case may the project period exceed 5 years and 6 months. No 
additional support may be awarded for any portion of a project period in 
excess of 5 years.
    (5) Neither the approval of any application nor the awarding of any 
grant

[[Page 488]]

shall commit or obligate the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation or other awards with respect to 
the project or any part of the project. For continuation support, 
grantees must make separate application annually and at such times and 
in such form as the Secretary may prescribe.
    (b) Determination of grant amount. (1) The amount of any grant shall 
be determined by the Secretary on the basis of his estimate of the sum 
necessary for all or a designated portion of the direct costs of the 
project plus an additional amount for the indirect costs, if any, which 
will be calculated by the Secretary either:
    (i) On the basis of the estimate of the actual indirect costs 
reasonable related to the project; or
    (ii) On the basis of a percentage of all or a designated portion of 
the estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable 
assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the 
approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an estimated 
provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs 
such as fringe benefit rates subject to upward (within the limits of 
available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when 
the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has 
been determined by the Secretary.
    (2) For particular categories of small grants, such as dissertation 
research support, the Secretary may establish a limit on direct costs 
that is less than $35,000 for the project period. Such limit will be 
announced in advance of the deadline for receipt of applications for 
such grants.
    (c) Supplemental awards. The Secretary may make supplemental awards 
during the course of any budget period of an approved project where the 
Secretary finds on the basis of the applicant's written request and such 
progress and accounting reports as the Secretary may require that the 
amount of the award initially approved was less than the amount 
necessary to carry out the approved project activities for that period, 
or that a supplemental award to fund incremental activities not 
initially approved for the period would substantially further the 
objectives of the project. The Secretary may also make a supplemental 
award where in his judgment such an award is necessary for the 
preparation of data in suitable form for transmittal in accordance with 
Sec. 67.25. In cases where the award of any supplemental grant for a 
project exceeding $35,000 in direct costs would result in supplemental 
awards (excluding any supplemental award for preparation of data in 
suitable form for transmittal in accordance with Sec. 67.25) during the 
project period in the aggregate exceeding twenty percent (20 percent) of 
the approved direct costs of the project, the Secretary will obtain the 
views of the peer review group which first evaluated the initial 
application prior to making any such award. The peer review group shall 
submit a written report to the Secretary which describes the current 
status of the project, the basis for the request and the potential 
consequences of any request where the recommendation is to disapprove. 
In the case of small grants, the Secretary will not approve any 
supplemental grant award during the project period (excluding any 
supplemental award for preparation of data in suitable form for 
transmittal in accordance with Sec. 67.25) which will in the aggregate 
exceed ten percent (10 percent) of the direct costs of the project.
    (d) Noncompeting continuation awards. Where a grantee has filed an 
application for continuation support and within the limits of funds 
available for this purpose, the Secretary may make a grant award for an 
additional budget period of any previously approved project where the 
Secretary finds on the basis of such progress and accounting reports as 
may be required and after considering any recommendations made pursuant 
to this paragraph, that the project activities during the current budget 
period justify continued support of the project for an additional budget 
period. Each project with a project period in excess of 2 years and with 
direct costs over the project period in excess of $35,000 will be 
reviewed during the second budget period and during each subsequent 
budget period (except for the last budget period of the

[[Page 489]]

project period) by at least two members of the same peer group which 
reviewed the proposal in accordance with Sec. 67.14. Such group shall 
review the application for continuation support and make recommendations 
to the Secretary concerning the disposition of such application based 
upon its evaluation of:
    (1) The progress of the project in meeting project objectives,
    (2) The appropriateness of the management of the project and 
allocation of resources within the project,
    (3) The adequacy and appropriateness of the plan for the carrying 
out of the project during the budget period in light of the 
accomplishments during previous budget periods, and
    (4) The reasonableness of the proposed budget for the subsequent 
budget period where the Secretary determines to continue support, the 
amount of grant award shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this section. Where the Secretary determines not to continue a 
project for an additional budget period, the grantee will be notified in 
writing before the end of the current budget period.


<R05>
Sec. 67.17  Project requirements.

    A project supported under this subpart must be conducted in 
accordance with the following requirements:
    (a) The project shall be carried out in accordance with the approved 
application.
    (b) The principal investigator shall be responsible for the conduct 
of the project unless replaced by another individual found by the 
Secretary to be qualified to carry out such responsibilities. Where the 
principal investigator becomes unable to function in such capacity, the 
Secretary shall be notified as soon as possible.


<R05>
Sec. 67.18  Grant payments.

    The Secretary will from time to time make payments to the grantee of 
all or a portion of any grant award, either by way of reimbursement for 
expenses incurred in the budget period, or in advance for expenses to be 
incurred, to the extent he determines such payments are necessary to 
promote prompt initiation and advancement of the approved project. The 
amounts otherwise payable to any grantee shall be reduced by:
    (a) Amounts equal to the fair market value of any equipment or 
supplies furnished to such grantee at their request by the Secretary for 
the purpose of conducting the approved project; and
    (b) Amounts equal to the pay, allowances, traveling expenses, and 
related personnel expenses attributable to the performance of services 
by an officer or employee of the government in connection with such 
approved project, if such officer or employee was assigned or detailed 
by the Secretary at the request of the grantee to perform such services.


<R05>
Sec. 67.19  Use of project funds.

    (a) Any funds granted pursuant to this subpart shall be expended by 
the grantee solely for carrying out the approved project in accordance 
with the Act, the regulations of this subpart, the terms and conditions 
of the award, and the applicable cost principles, prescribed in subpart 
Q of 45 CFR part 74.
    (b) The grantee may not in whole or in part delegate or transfer 
this responsibility for the use of such funds to any other person, or 
other legal entity, without the specific prior written approval of the 
Secretary.
    (c) Prior approval by the Secretary is required whenever there is to 
be a significant change in the scope or nature of the approved project.


<R05>
Sec. 67.20  Termination.

    The termination of any grant under this subpart will be governed by 
the relevant provisions of subpart M of 45 CFR part 74 and the terms and 
conditions of the grant award. Where a grantee unilaterally terminates a 
portion of a grant, the Secretary may terminate such grant in whole 
where he determines that the remaining portion of the grant will not 
accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made.

grantee shall account for the sum total of all amounts paid by 
presenting or otherwise making available evidence satisfactory to the 
Secretary of expenditures for direct and indirect costs meeting the 
requirements of this subpart: Provided, however, That when the amount 
awarded for indirect costs was based on a predetermined fixed-percentage 
of estimated direct costs, the amount allowed for indirect costs shall

[[Page 491]]

be computed on the basis of such predetermined fixed-percentage rates 
applied to the total or a selected element of the reimbursable direct 
costs incurred.
    (b) Accounting for royalties. Royalties received by grantees from

    (2) Royalties received after the completion or termination of grant 
support shall be disposed of as follows:
    (i) Patent royalties shall be governed by agreements between the 
Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services, 
and the grantee pursuant to the Department's patent regulations (45 CFR 
parts 6 and 8).
    (ii) Copyright royalties may be retained by the grantee, unless the 
terms and conditions of the grant or a specific agreement negotiated 
between the Secretary and the grantee provide otherwise, except State or 
local government grantees which receive royalties in excess of $200 a 
year shall return the Federal share of the excess amount (computed by 
applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
grant supported project to the excess amount) to the Federal Government, 
unless specific agreement provides otherwise.
    (c) Grant closeout--(1) Date of final accounting. In addition to 
such other special and periodic accounting as the Secretary may require,

Sec. 67.105   Evaluation and disposition of applications.

    (a) Evaluation. (1) All applications for a grant under this subpart 
will be submitted by the Secretary for review to a panel of experts who 
are neither officers or employees of the United States and who possess 
qualifications necessary to evaluate both the applicant's proposed 
method of planning, establishing and operating a Center and the 
potential of the proposed Center to make a valuable scientific 
contribution (hereinafter referred to as the review panel).
    (2) The review panel to which an application has been submitted 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall make a written report 
to the Secretary on each application so submitted. Each report shall 
consist of the following parts:
    (i) The first part shall consist of a factual summary of the 
proposed Center, including a synopsis of the information required under 
Sec. 67.104(c). If the applicant is applying for an award as a National 
Special Emphasis Center a factual summary of the information provided in 
accordance with Sec. 67.104(d) shall also be submitted.
    (ii) The second part shall address the scientific and technical 
merit of the application and shall consist of a critique of the proposal 
and an assessment of the adequacy of the applicant's plan and available 
resources for meeting the requirements of Sec. 67.107.
    (iii) The third part, where appropriate, shall address the 
scientific and technical merit of the application for an additional 
award for a National Special Emphasis Center. This part of the report 
shall consist of a critique of the proposal and an assessment of the 
adequacy of the applicant's plan and available resources for meeting the 
additional requirements of Sec. 67.107.
    (iv) The fourth part shall describe the panel's assessment of the 
relevance of the proposed program to regional or national health care 
issues.
    (v) The fifth part shall consist of a set of recommendations to the 
Secretary with respect to the disposition of the application:
    (A) The panel may recommend that the Secretary approve, disapprove, 
or defer a decision in order to gather further information on an 
application for support as a Health Services Research Center. If the 
panel recommends approval, it shall also provide its recommendation 
regarding an appropriate project period and an appropriate level of

<R05>
Sec. 67.106   Grant awards.

    (a) General. (1) Within the limits of funds available for such 
purpose, the Secretary may award a grant to those applicants whose 
approved proposed Centers will in his judgment best promote the purposes 
of section 305(d) of the Act and this subpart, taking into 
consideration:
    (i) Recommendations made pursuant to Sec. 67.105.
    (ii) The appropriateness of the proposed budget and the extent to 
which the fiscal plan provides assurance that effective use would be 
made of grant funds.
    (iii) The capability of the applicant as demonstrated by 
organizational and institutional arrangements to successfully operate 
the proposed Center.
    (iv) The qualifications, achievements, and commitment of the senior 
personnel.
    (v) The strength and scientific integrity of the general program and 
approach of the proposed Center.
    (vi) The nature of the sponsoring institution's commitment to the 
proposed Center and the relative importance it ascribes to the endeavor.
    (vii) The past success and future potential of the proposed Center's 
personnel in receiving permanent and project related support from other 
sources.
    (viii) The extent to which a proposed Center's planning process 
incorporates the concerns of pertinent constituents and reflects an 
awareness of significant research problems in health services.
    (ix) The strength of the relationship the proposed Center has 
developed with components of a local health care system in which 
specific projects will be conducted and research findings tested.
    (x) The integration of disciplinary interests within the proposed 
Center and the coordination of the research program with training and 
educational efforts.

However, no grant may be awarded which will result in more than twenty 
per centum (20%) of all Centers supported under this subpart being 
located in any one HHS region, except that this restriction shall not 
operate to proscribe awarding at least two grants under this subpart to 
institutions located in any single HHS region; Provided, That to the 
extent feasible, the Secretary will make such grants as will result in 
at least six Centers being operational in each fiscal year.
    (2) In making any grant award the Secretary may add additional 
conditions to or require specific modifications in the Center as 
proposed in the application including a different level of grant support 
from that requested in the application. In such cases the Secretary will 
obtain either the written agreement of the applicant to proceed on such 
basis prior to making any grant award or such condition or modification 
will appear on the grant award notice.
    (3) All grant awards shall be in writing. The Notice of Grant 
Awarded shall set forth the amount of funds awarded for the conduct of 
the Center during the first budget period and the amount of support 
recommended for the remainder of the project period.
    (4) The project period for any grant under this subpart shall be 
specified in the Notice of Grant Awarded and shall begin no later than 
nine months following the date of such award. In no case may a project 
period exceed five years; Provided, That the approved project period may 
be extended for a period not to exceed six months beyond five years 
where the Secretary determines on the basis of a request by the grantee 
prior to the termination of the currently active grant that such 
additional time is needed to permit the use

[[Page 496]]

of funds previously awarded but not expended. No additional support may 
be awarded for this period.
    (5) Neither the approval of any application nor the awarding of any 
grant shall commit or obligate the Federal Government in any way to make 
any additional, supplemental, continuation or other awards with respect 
to the Center or any part of the Center. For continuation support, 
grantees must make separate application annually and at such times and 
in such form as the Secretary may prescribe.
    (b) Determination of grant amount. The amount of any grant shall be 
determined by the Secretary on the basis of his estimate of the sum 
necessary for all or a designated portion of the direct costs of the 
Center plus an additional amount for the indirect costs, if any, which 
will be calculated by the Secretary either:
    (1) On the basis of the estimate of the actual indirect costs 
reasonably related to the project; or
    (2) On the basis of a percentage of all or a designated portion of 
the estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable 
assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the 
approximate actual indirect costs.

Such award may include an estimated provisional amount for indirect 
costs or for designated direct costs such as fringe benefit rates 
subject to upward (within the limits of available funds) as well as 
downward adjustments to actual costs when the amount properly expended 
by the grantee for provisional items has been determined by the 
Secretary.
    (c) Supplemental awards. The Secretary may make supplemental awards 
during the course of any budget period of an approved Center where the 
Secretary finds on the basis of the applicant's written request and such 
progress and accounting reports as the Secretary may require that the 
amount of the award initially approved was less than the amount 
necessary to carry out the approved Center activities for that period. 
The Secretary may also make a supplemental award where in his judgment 
such an award is necessary for the preparation of data in suitable form 
for transmittal in accordance with Sec. 67.113. However, where the 
making of any supplemental award would result, in any budget period, in 
supplemental awards exceeding twenty per centum (20%) of the original 
award for direct Center costs in that budget period, the Secretary will 
prior to making such award obtain the recommendation of the review panel 
which evaluated the Center's initial application. The review panel shall 
submit a written report to the Secretary which describes the current 
status of the Center, the basis for the request, the panels 
recommendation concerning the request and the potential consequences of 
any request that is disapproved.
    (d) Non-competing continuation awards. Where a grantee has filed an 
application for continuation support and within the limits of funds 
available for this purpose, the Secretary may make a grant award for an 
additional budget period for any previously approved Center where the 
Secretary finds on the basis of such progress and accounting reports as 
may be required that the Center's activities during the current budget 
period justify continued support of the project for an additional budget 
period. Where the Secretary determines to continue support, the amount 
of grant award shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section. Where the Secretary determines not to continue a project 
for an additional budget period, the grantee will be notified in writing 
before the end of the current budget period. In addition, where he 
determines such support is necessary, the Secretary may provide 
financial support for the orderly phase-out of the supported activity.

    (a) Accounting for grant award payments. All payments made by the 
Secretary shall be recorded by the grantee in accounting records 
separate from the records of all other funds, including funds derived 
from other grant awards. With respect to each approved project the 
grantee shall account for the sum total of all amounts paid by 
presenting or otherwise making available evidence satisfactory to the 
Secretary of expenditures for direct and indirect costs meeting the 
requirements of this subpart; Provided however, That when the amount 
awarded for indirect costs was based on a predetermined fixed percentage 
of estimated direct costs, the amount allowed for indirect costs shall 
be computed on the basis of such predetermined fixed-percentage rates 
applied to the total, or a selected element thereof, of the reimbursable 
direct costs incurred.
    (b) Accounting for royalties. Royalties received by grantees from 
copyrights on publications or other works developed under the grant, or 
from patents or inventions conceived or first actually reduced to

    As used in this section the term:
    Cat means all domestic cats.
    Confinement means restriction of a dog or cat to a building or other 
enclosure at a U.S. port, en route to destination and at destination, in 
isolation from other animals and from persons except for contact 
necessary for its care or, if the dog or cat is allowed out of the 
enclosure, muzzling and keeping it on a leash.
    Dog means all domestic dogs.
    Owner means owner or agent.
    Valid rabies vaccination certificate means a certificate which was 
issued for a dog not less than 3 months of age at the time of 
vaccination and which:
    (1) Identifies a dog on the basis of breed, sex, age, color, 
markings, and other identifying information.
    (2) Specifies a date of rabies vaccination at least 30 days before 
the date of arrival of the dog at a U.S. port.
    (3) Specifies a date of expiration which is after the date of 
arrival of the dog at a U.S. port. If no date of expiration is 
specified, then the date of vaccination shall be no more than 12 months 
before the date of arrival at a U.S. port.
    (4) Bears the signature of a licensed veterinarian.
    (b) General requirements for admission of dogs and cats--(1) 
Inspection by Director. The Director shall inspect all dogs and cats 
which arrive at a U.S. port, and admit only those dogs and cats which 
show no signs of communicable disease as defined in Sec. 71.1.
    (2) Examination by veterinarian and confinement of dogs and cats. 
When, upon inspection, a dog or cat does not appear to be in good health 
on arrival (e.g., it has symptoms such as emaciation, lesions of the 
skin, nervous system disturbances, jaundice, or diarrhea), the Director 
may require prompt confinement and give the owner an opportunity to 
arrange for a licensed veterinarian to examine the animal and give or 
arrange for any tests or treatment indicated. The Director will consider 
the findings of the examination and tests in determining whether or not 
the dog or cat may have a communicable disease. The owner shall bear the 
expense of the examination, tests, and treatment. When it is necessary 
to detain a dog or cat pending determination of its admissibility, the 
owner shall provide confinement facilities which in the judgment of the 
Director will afford protection against any communicable disease. The 
owner shall bear the expense of confinement. Confinement shall be 
subject to conditions specified by the Director to protect the public 
health.
    (3) Record of sickness or death of dogs and cats and requirements 
for exposed animals. (i) The carrier responsible for the care of dogs 
and cats shall maintain a record of sickness or death of animals en 
route to the United States and shall submit the record to the quarantine 
station at the U.S. port upon arrival. Dogs or cats which have become 
sick while en route or are dead on arrival shall be separated from other 
animals as soon as the sickness or death is discovered, and shall be 
held in confinement pending any necessary examination as determined by 
the Director.

[[Page 507]]

    (ii) When, upon inspection, a dog or cat appears healthy but, during 
shipment, has been exposed to a sick or dead animal suspected of having 
a communicable disease, the exposed dog or cat shall be admitted only if 
examination or tests made on arrival reveal no evidence that the animal 
may be infected with a communicable disease. The provisions of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section shall be applicable to the examination or tests.
    (4) Sanitation. When the Director finds that the cages or other 
containers of dogs or cats arriving in the United States are in an 
insanitary or other condition that may constitute a communicable disease 
hazard, the dogs or cats shall not be admitted in such containers unless 
the owner has the containers cleaned and disinfected.
    (c) Rabies vaccination requirements for dogs. (1) A valid rabies 
vaccination certificate is required at a U.S. port for admission of a 
dog unless the owner submits evidence satisfactory to the Director that:
    (i) If a dog is less than 6 months of age, it has been only in a 
country determined by the Director to be rabies-free (a current list of 
rabies-free countries may be obtained from the Division of Quarantine, 
Center for Prevention Services, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 
30333); or
    (ii) If a dog is 6 months of age or older, for the 6 months before

rabies-free; or
    (iii) The dog is to be taken to a research facility to be used for 
research purposes and vaccination would interfere with its use for such 
purposes.
    (2) Regardless of the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the Director may authorize admission as follows:
    (i) If the date of vaccination shown on the vaccination certificate 
is less than 30 days before the date of arrival, the dog may be 
admitted, but must be confined until at least 30 days have elapsed since 
the date of vaccination;
    (ii) If the dog is less than 3 months of age, it may be admitted, 
but must be confined until vaccinated against rabies at 3 months of age 
and for at least 30 days after the date of vaccination;
    (iii) If the dog is 3 months of age or older, it may be admitted, 
but must be confined until it is vaccinated against rabies. The dog must 
be vaccinated within 4 days after arrival at destination but no more 
than 10 days after arrival at a U.S. port. It must be kept in 
confinement for at least 30 days after the date of vaccination.
    (3) When a dog is admitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
the Director shall notify the health department or other appropriate 
agency having jurisdiction at the point of destination and shall provide 
the address of the specified place of confinement and other pertinent 
information to facilitate surveillance and other appropriate action.
    (d) Certification requirements. The owner shall submit such 
certification regarding confinement and vaccination prescribed under 
this section as may be required by the Director.
    (e) Additional requirements for the importation of dogs and cats. 
Dogs and cats shall be subject to such additional requirements as may be 
deemed necessary by the Director or to exclusion if coming from areas 
which the Director has determined to have high rates of rabies.
    (f) Requirements for dogs and cats in transit. The provisions of 
this section shall apply to dogs and cats transported through the United 
States from one foreign country to another, except as provided below:
    (1) Dogs and cats that appear healthy, but have been exposed to a 
sick or dead animal suspected of having a communicable disease, need not 
undergo examination or tests as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section if the Director determines that the conditions under which they 
are being transported will afford adequate protection against 
introduction of communicable disease.
    (2) Rabies vaccination is not required for dogs that are transported 
by aircraft or ship and retained in custody of the carrier under 
conditions that would prevent transmission of rabies.
    (g) Disposal of excluded dogs and cats. A dog or cat excluded from 
the United States under the regulations in this part shall be exported 
or destroyed.

[[Page 508]]

Pending exportation, it shall be detained at the owner's expense in the 
custody of the U.S. Customs Service at the U.S. port.

revocation upon filing a written request, either in the answer or in a 
separate document, with the Director within 20 days after the effective 
date of revocation. Failure to request a hearing shall be deemed a 
waiver of hearing and as consent to the submission of the case to the 
Director for decision based on the written record. The failure both to 
file an answer and to request a hearing shall be deemed to constitute 
consent to the making of a decision on the basis of available 
information.
    (4) As soon as practicable after the completion of any hearing 
conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Director shall 
render a final decision. A copy of such decision shall be served on the 
importer.
    (5) An importer's registration which has been revoked may be 
reinstated by the Director upon inspection, examination of records, 
conference with the importer, and receipt of information and assurances 
of compliance with the requirements of this section.

administer radiologic procedures and for the credentialing of such 
persons.
    (b) Section 979 requires the Secretary, after consultation with 
specified Federal agencies, appropriate agencies of States, and 
appropriate professional organizations, to promulgate by regulation the 
minimum standards described above. These standards distinguish between 
the occupations of (1) radiographer, (2) dental hygienist, (3) dental 
assistant, (4) nuclear medicine technologist, and (5) radiation therapy 
technologist. In the interest of public safety and to prevent the 
hazards of improper use of medical radiation identified by Congress in 
its determination of the need for standards, the Secretary is also 
authorized to prepare standards for other occupational groups utilizing 
ionizing and non-ionizing radiation as he/she finds appropriate. 
However, the standards set out below are limited to the five 
occupational groups listed above, utilizing ionizing radiation. Nothing 
in these accreditation standards is intended to discriminate against 
proprietary schools.

in failure to the degree that the respirator does not provide any 
respiratory protection, or a defect that reduces protection and is not 
detectable by the user;
    (3) Major B. A defect, other than Major A or critical, that is 
likely to result in reduced respiratory protection, and is detectable by 
the user; and
    (4) Minor. A defect that is not likely to materially reduce the 
usability of the respirator for its intended purpose, or a defect that 
is a departure from established standards and has little bearing on the 
effective use or operation of the respirator.

<R05>
Sec. 84.146  Method of measuring the power and torque required to operate blowers.

    As shown in Figure 1 of this section, the blower crank is replaced 
by a wooden drum, a (13 cm. (5 inches) in diameter is convenient). This 
drum is wound with about 12 m. (40 feet) of No. 2 picture cord, b. A 
weight, c, of sufficient mass to rotate the blower at the desired speed 
is suspended from this wire cord. A mark is made on the cord about 3 to 
4.5 m. (10 to 15 feet) from the weight, c. Another mark is placed at a 
measured distance (6-9 m./20-30 feet is convenient) from the first. 
These are used to facilitate timing. To determine the torque or 
horsepower required to operate the blower, the drum is started in 
rotation manually at or slightly above the speed at which the power 
measurement is to be made. The blower is then permitted to assume 
constant speed, and then as the first mark on the wire leaves the drum, 
a stopwatch is started. The watch is stopped when the second mark leaves 
the drum. From these data the foot-pounds per minute and the torque may 
be calculated.

equipped with a pressure-release mechanism that will prevent the 
pressure at the hose connection from exceeding 863 kN/m.\2\ (125 pounds 
per square inch gage) under any conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 84.149  Type C supplied-air respirator, demand and pressure demand class; minimum requirements.

    (a) Respirators tested under this section shall be approved only 
when used to supply respirable air at the pressures and quantities 
required.
    (b) The manufacturer shall specify the range of air pressure at the 
point of attachment of the air-supply hose to the air-supply system, and 
the range of hose length for the respirator. For example, he might 
specify that the respirator be used with compressed air at pressures 
ranging from 280-550 kN/m.\2\ (40 to 80 pounds per square inch) with 
from 6 to 76 m. (15 to 250 feet) of air-supply hose.

[[Page 565]]

    (c) The specified air pressure at the point of attachment of the 
hose to the air-supply system shall not exceed 863 kN/m.\2\ (125 pounds 
per square inch gage).
    (d)(1) Where the pressure in the air-supply system exceeds 863 kN/
m.\2\ (125 pounds per square inch gage), the respirator shall be 
equipped with a pressure-release mechanism that will prevent the 
pressure at the point of attachment of the hose to the air-supply system

    (2) The pressure-release mechanism shall be set to operate at a 
pressure not more than 20 percent above the manufacturer's highest 
specified pressure. For example, if the highest specified pressure is 
863 kN/m.\2\ (125 pounds per square inch), the pressure-release 
mechanism would be set to operate at a maximum of 1,035 kN/m.\2\ (150 
pounds per square inch).

Sec. 84.170  Non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators; description.

    (a) Non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators utilize the 
wearer's negative inhalation pressure to draw the ambient air through 
the air-purifying filter elements (filters) to remove particulates from 
the ambient air. They are designed for use as respiratory protection 
against atmospheres with particulate contaminants (e.g., dusts, fumes, 
mists) that are not immediately dangerous to life or health and that 
contain adequate oxygen to support life.
    (b) Non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators are classified 
into three series, N-, R-, and P-series. The N-series filters are 
restricted to use in those workplaces free of oil aerosols. The R- and 
P-series filters are intended for removal of any particulate that 
includes oil-based liquid particulates.
    (c) Non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators are classified 
according to the efficiency level of the filter(s) as tested according

    (a) NIOSH officers who have been issued official NIOSH credentials 
(Form No. CDC/NIOSH 2.93) are authorized by the Director, NIOSH, under 
sections 20(a) (6) and 8 of the OSH Act and sections 501(a)(11) and 103 
of the FMSH Act: To enter without delay any place of employment for the 
purpose of conducting investigations of all pertinent processes, 
conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, equipment, 
records, and materials within the place of employment; and to conduct 
medical examinations, anthropometric measurements, and functional tests 
of employees within the place of employment as may be directly related 
to the specific health hazard evaluation being conducted. Investigations 
will be conducted in a reasonable manner, during regular working hours 
or at other reasonable times and within reasonable limits. In connection 
with any investigation, the NIOSH officers may question privately any 
employer, owner, operator, agent, or employee from the place of 
employment; and review, abstract, and duplicate records required by the 
Acts and regulations and any other related records.
    (b) Areas under investigation which contain information classified 
by any

[[Page 596]]

agency of the United States Government in the interest of national 
security will be investigated only by NIOSH officers who have obtained 
the proper security clearance and authorization.

[45 FR 2653, Jan. 14, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 85.6   Advance notice of visits.

    (a) Advance notice of visits to the place of employment may be given 
to expedite a thorough and effective investigation. Advance notice will 
not be given when, in the judgment of the NIOSH officer, giving such 
notice would adversely affect the validity and effectiveness of the 
investigation.
    (b) Where a request in accordance with this part has been made by an 
authorized representative of employees, advance notice in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section will be given by NIOSH to the 
requester, the representative of the employees for purposes of 
collective bargaining if such representative is other than the 
requester, and to the employer.
    (c) Where a request in accordance with this part has been made by 
any employer, advance notice will be given by NIOSH to the employer. 
Upon the request of the employer, NIOSH will inform the authorized 
representative of employees of the visit: Provided, The employer 
furnishes NIOSH in writing with the identity of such representative and 
with such information as is necessary to enable NIOSH promptly to inform 
such representative of the visit.


<R05>
Sec. 85.7   Conduct of investigations.

    (a) Prior to beginning an investigation, NIOSH officers shall 
present their credentials to the owner, operator, or agent in charge at 
the place of employment, explain the nature, purpose, and scope of the 
investigation and the records specified in Sec. 85.5 which they wish to 
review. Where the investigation is the result of a request submitted by 
an authorized representative of employees, a copy of the request shall 
be provided to the employer, except where the requester or any person 
authorizing the requester pursuant to Sec. 85.3-1(e)(2) has indicated 
that NIOSH not reveal his name to the employer, in which case a summary 
of the basis for the request shall be provided to the employer.
    (b) At the commencement of an investigation, the employer should 
precisely identify information which can be obtained in the workplace or 
workplaces to be inspected as trade secrets. If the NIOSH officer has no 
clear reason to question such identification, such information shall not 
be disclosed except in accordance with the provisions of section 
20(a)(6) and section 15 of the OSH Act or section 501(a)(11) of the FMSH 
Act. However, if NIOSH at any time questions such identification by an 
employer, not less than 15 days' notice to an employer shall be given of 
the intention to remove the trade secret designation from such 
information. The employer may within that period submit a request to the 
Director, NIOSH, to reconsider this intention and may provide additional 
information in support of the trade secret designation. The Director, 
NIOSH, shall notify the employer in writing of the decision which will 
become effective no sooner than 15 days after the date of such notice.
    (c) NIOSH officers are authorized to collect environmental samples 
and samples of substances or measurements of physical agents (including 
measurement of employee exposure by the attachment of personal sampling 
devices to employees with their consent), to take or obtain photographs 
related to the purpose of the investigation, employ other reasonable 
investigative techniques, including medical examinations of employees 
with the consent of such employees, and to question privately any 
employer, owner, operator, agent, or employee. The employer shall have 
the opportunity to review photographs taken or obtained for the purpose 
of identifying those which contain or might reveal a trade secret.
    (d) NIOSH officers shall comply with all safety and health rules and 
practices at the place of employment being investigated, and they shall 
provide and use appropriate protective clothing and equipment. In 
situations requiring specialized or unique types of protective 
equipment, such equipment shall be furnished by the employer.

[[Page 597]]

    (e) The conduct of investigations shall be such as to preclude 
unreasonable disruption of the operations of the employer's 
establishment.

<R05>
Sec. 85.8   Provision of suitable space for employee interviews and examinations; identification of employees.

    An employer shall, in request of the NIOSH officer, provide suitable 
space, if such space is reasonably available, to NIOSH to conduct 
private interviews with, and examinations of, employees. NIOSH officers 
shall consult with the employer as to the time and place of the medical 
examination and shall schedule such examinations so as to avoid undue 
disruption of the operations of the employer's establishment. NIOSH 
shall conduct, and assume the medical costs of, examinations conducted 
under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 85.9   Representatives of employers and employees; employee requests.

representative authorized by his employees who is an employee of the 
employer shall be given an opportunity to accompany the NIOSH officer 
during the initial physical inspection of any workplace for the purpose 
of aiding the investigation by identifying the suspected hazard. The 
NIOSH officer may permit additional employer representatives and such 
additional representatives authorized by employees to accompany him 
where he determines that such additional representatives will further 
aid the investigation. However, if in the judgment of the NIOSH officer, 
good cause has been shown why accompaniment by a third party who is not 
an employee of the employer is reasonably necessary to the conduct of an 
effective and thorough investigation of the workplace, such third party 
may accompany the NIOSH officer during the inspection: Provided, 
however, That access by such persons to areas described in paragraph (d) 
of this section shall be in accordance with the requirements of such 
provision, and access to areas described in paragraph (e) of this 
section shall be with the consent of the employer. A different employer 
and employee representative may accompany the officer during each 
different phase of an inspection if this will not interfere with the 
conduct of the investigation.
    (b) NIOSH officers are authorized to resolve all disputes as to who 
is the representative authorized by the employer and employees for the 
purpose of this section. If there is no authorized representative of 
employees, or if the NIOSH officer is unable to determine with 
reasonable certainty who is such representative, he shall consult with a 
reasonable number of employees concerning matters directly related to 
the health hazard evaluation.
    (c) NIOSH officers are authorized to deny the right of accompaniment 
under this section to any person whose conduct interferes with a fair 
and orderly physical inspection.
    (d) With regard to information classified by an agency of the U.S. 
Government in the interest of national security, only persons authorized 
to have access to such information may accompany an officer in areas 
containing such information.
    (e) Upon request of an employer, any representative authorized under 
this Sec. 85.9 by employees in any area containing trade secrets shall 
be an employee in that area or an employee authorized by the employer to 
enter that area.


<R05>
Sec. 85.10   Imminent dangers.

    Whenever, during the course of, or as a result of, an investigation 
under this part, the NIOSH officer believes that there is a reasonable 
basis for an allegation of an imminent danger, NIOSH will immediately 
advise the employer and those employees who appear to be in immediate 
danger of such allegation and will inform appropriate representatives of 
the Department of Labor or the State agency designated under section 
18(b) of the OSH Act.

Sec. 85.11   Notification of determination to employers, affected employees and Department of Labor.

    (a) Upon conclusion of an investigation, NIOSH will make a 
determination concerning the potentially toxic or hazardous effects of 
each substance or physical agent investigated as a result of the request 
for health hazard evaluation. At a minimum, the determination will: (1) 
Identify each substance or physical agent involved and describe, where 
appropriate, the concentrations or levels of the substance or physical 
agent found in the place of employment and the conditions of use, and 
(2) state whether each substance or physical agent has potentially toxic 
or hazardous effects in the concentrations or levels found, as well as 
the basis for the judgments.
    (b) Copies of the determination will be mailed to the employer and 
to the authorized representatives of employees.
    (c) Except as hereinafter provided, the employer shall post a copy 
of the determination for a period of 30 calendar days at or near the 
workplace(s) of affected employees. The employer shall take steps to 
insure that the posted determinations are not altered, defaced, or 
covered by other material during such period. The employer will not be 
required to post the determination if the employer requests that copies 
of the determination be mailed to affected employees and furnishes NIOSH 
with a list of the names and mailing addresses of the employees employed 
in the workplace(s) designated by the NIOSH Officer. In the latter 
event, NIOSH will mail such copies to affected employees at the mailing 
addresses provided by the employer.
    (d) For purposes of this section, the term ``affected employees'' 
means those employees determined by NIOSH to be exposed to the 
substance(s) or physical agent(s) which is the subject of the health 
hazard evaluation.
    (e) Copies of determinations made under the OSH Act will be 
forwarded to the Department of Labor and the appropriate State agency 
designated under section 18(b) of the OSH Act. Copies of determinations 
made under the FMSH Act will be forwarded to the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration of the Department of Labor; the Bureau of Mines, 
Department of the Interior; and the State agency which, in the judgment 
of NIOSH, would benefit the most from the information. If NIOSH 
determines that any substance or physical agent has potentially toxic or 
hazardous effects at the concentrations or levels at which it is used or 
found in a place of employment, and the substance or physical agent is 
not covered by a safety or health standard established under section 6 
of the OSH Act or section 101 of the FMSH Act, NIOSH will immediately 
submit the determination to the Secretary of Labor, together with all 
pertinent criteria.

[37 FR 23640, Nov. 7, 1972, as amended at 45 FR 2653, Jan. 14, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 85.12  Subsequent requests for health hazard evaluations.

    If a request is received for a health hazard evaluation in a place 
of employment in which an evaluation under this part was made 
previously, NIOSH may make another investigation if, as a result of the 
passage of time or additional information, another investigation would 
be consistent with the purposes of the Acts.

<R05>
Sec. 85a.4   Procedures for initiating investigations of places of employment.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
NIOSH authorized representatives will contact an official representative 
of the place of employment prior to any site visits and will provide the 
details of why an investigation of the place of employment is being 
conducted. Prior to the initiation of a site visit of a place of 
employment, representatives of the following organizations will be 
advised of the site visit and the reason for its conduct:
    (1) The appropriate State agency designated under section 18(b) of 
the OSH Act, or if no State agency has been designated under the OSH Act 
and in the case of the FMSH Act, the State agency which, in the judgment 
of NIOSH, would benefit the most from the investigation's findings;
    (2) If there is a local union at the place of employment, the local 
president, business manager or other appropriate individual;
    (3) The appropriate Assistant Regional Director, when investigations 
are conducted under the OSH Act;
    (4) The appropriate MSHA District Office; the Director, BOM, and the 
Assistant Director for Mining, BOM, when investigations are conducted 
under the FMSH Act.
    (b) Advance notice of site visits will not be given to the place of 
employment or local union at the place of employment when, in the 
judgment of the NIOSH authorized representatives, giving such notice 
would adversely affect the validity and effectiveness of an 
investigation. Those individuals and organizations specified in 
Sec. 85a.4(a)(1), (a)(3) and (a)(4) will be notified prior to the 
initiation of such a site visit. After the site visit has been 
initiated, and, as soon as possible thereafter, the NIOSH authorized 
representatives will contact those individuals specified in 
Sec. 85a.4(a)(2) concerning the nature and details of the site visit.
    (c) In those instances where site visits are not necessary to the 
conduct of an investigation, the NIOSH authorized representatives will 
contact an official representative of the place of employment either 
verbally or through a written communication and provide the details of 
why an investigation of the place of employment is being conducted. If 
appropriate, the NIOSH authorized representatives will contact

[[Page 601]]

those individuals stipulated in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and 
(a)(4) of this section about the nature and details of the 
investigation.

[41 FR 45002, Oct. 14, 1976, as amended at 45 FR 2654, Jan. 14, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 85a.5   Conduct of investigations of places of employment.

    (a)(1) Prior to beginning a site visit, NIOSH authorized 
representatives will present their credentials to the employer, owner, 
operator or agent in charge at the place of employment, explain the 
nature, purpose and scope of the investigation and the records specified 
in Sec. 85a.3 which they wish to review, abstract or duplicate.
    (2) In those instances where site visits are not necessary to the 
conduct of an investigation and the initial contact is made verbally, 
NIOSH authorized representatives will, at the request of the employer, 
owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment, provide a 
written explanation of the nature, purpose and scope of the 
investigation and the records specified in Sec. 85a.3 which they wish to 
review, abstract or duplicate.
    (b)(1) At the commencement of an investigation, the employer, owner, 
operator or agent in charge at the place of employment shall precisely 
identify that information which is trade secret and might be seen or 
obtained by the NIOSH authorized representatives during the 
investigation. If the NIOSH authorized representatives have no clear 
reason to question such identification, such information will not be 
disclosed by NIOSH in accordance with the provisions of section 15 of 
the OSH Act. Generally, NIOSH will not question trade secret 
designations; however, if NIOSH at any time does question such 
identification, not less than 15 days' notice to the employer, owner, 
operator or agent will be given of the intention to remove the trade 
secret designation from such information. The employer, owner, operator 
or agent may within that period submit a request to the Director, NIOSH, 
to reconsider this intention and may provide additional information in 
support of the trade secret designation. The Director, NIOSH, will 
notify the employer, owner, operator or agent in writing of the decision 
which will become effective no sooner than 15 days after the date of 
such notice.
    (2) In those instances where the NIOSH authorized representative is 
a person fulfilling a contact agreement with NIOSH or is serving as an 
expert or consultant to NIOSH pursuant to the Act, the employer, owner, 
operator or agent in charge at the place of employment may, after 
advising the NIOSH contractor or consultant in writing, elect to 
withhold information deemed to be a trade secret from such a NIOSH 
authorized representative or prohibit entry into the area of the place 
of employment where such entry will reveal trade secrets. In those 
instances, where the subject information is needed or access to the area 
of the place of employment is necessary, in the judgment of NIOSH, to 
fulfill the goals of the investigation, NIOSH regular employees will 
then obtain the information or enter the subject area of the place of 
employment.
    (c)(1) NIOSH authorized representatives will be in charge of site 
visits conducted pursuant to this part.
    (2) Where there is a request by the representative of the State 
agency and/or employees, who were notified pursuant to Sec. 85a.4(a)(1) 
or Sec. 85a.4(a)(2) to accompany the NIOSH authorized representatives 
during the site visit of the place of employment, the NIOSH authorized 
representatives will allow this request if they determine that this will 
aid the investigation; or where, in the judgment of the NIOSH authorized 
representatives, good cause has been shown why accompaniment by a third 
party who is not an employee of the employer is reasonably necessary to 
the conduct of an effective and thorough site visit, they may permit 
such third party to accompany them during the site visit: Provided 
however, That access by such person(s) to areas described in 
Sec. 85a.5(c)(4) shall be in accordance with the requirements of such 
provision and access to areas containing trade secrets shall be with the 
consent of the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place 
of employment.
    (3) NIOSH authorized representatives are authorized to deny the 
right of accompaniment under this paragraph to

[[Page 602]]

any person whose conduct in their judgment interferes with a fair and 
orderly site visit. In all instances, a representative of the employer 
shall be permitted to accompany the NIOSH authorized representatives 
during the site visit of the place of employment.
    (4) With regard to information classified by an agency of the United 
States Government in the interest of national security, only persons 
authorized to have access to such information may accompany NIOSH 
authorized representatives in areas containing such information.
    (d)(1) NIOSH authorized representatives are authorized: To collect 
environmental samples and samples of substances; to measure 
environmental conditions and employee exposures (including measurement 
of employee exposure by the attachment of personal sampling devices to 
employees with their consent); to take or obtain photographs, motion 
pictures or videotapes related to the purpose of the investigation; to 
employ other reasonable investigative techniques, including medical 
examinations, anthropometric measurements and standardized and 
experimental functional tests of employees with the informed consent of 
such employees; to review, abstract, and duplicate such personnel 
records as are pertinent to mortality, morbidity, injury, safety, and 
other similar studies; and to question and interview privately any 
employer, owner, operator, agency, or employee from the place of 
employment. The employer, owner, operator, or agency shall have the 
opportunity to review photographs, motion pictures, and videotapes taken 
or obtained for the purpose of identifying those which contain or might 
reveal a trade secret.
    (2) Prior to the conduct of medical examinations, anthropometric 
measurements or functional tests of any employees, the NIOSH authorized 
representatives will obtain approval of the procedures to be utilized 
from the NIOSH Human Subjects Review Board and no employee examination, 
measurement or test will be undertaken without the informed consent of 
such employee.
    (e) NIOSH authorized representatives will comply with all safety and 
health rules and practices at the place of employment and all NIOSH, 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Mine Safety and 
Health Administration regulations and policies during a site visit and 
will provide and use appropriate protective clothing and equipment. In 
situations requiring specialized or unique types of protective 
equipment, such equipment shall be furnished by the employer, owner, 
operator or agent in charge at the place of employment.
    (f) The conduct of site visits will be such as to preclude 
unreasonable disruption of the operations of the place of employment.

FR 4739, Feb. 8, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 85a.6   Provision of suitable space for employee interviews and examinations.

    An employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of 
employment shall, on request of the NIOSH authorized representatives, 
provide suitable space at the place of employment, if such space is 
reasonably available, to NIOSH to conduct private interviews with, and 
medical examinations, anthropometric measurements and functional tests 
of employees. NIOSH authorized representatives will consult with the 
employer, owner, operator or agent as to the time and place of the 
private interviews, medical examination, anthropometric measurements and 
functional tests and will schedule same so as to avoid undue disruption 
of work at the place of employment. NIOSH will conduct the medical 
interviews, measurements, examinations and tests specified under this 
part at its own expense.

[41 FR 45002, Oct. 14, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 85a.7   Imminent dangers.

    Whenever, during the course of, or as a result of, an investigation 
under this part, the NIOSH authorized representatives believe there is a 
reasonable basis for an allegation of an imminent danger, NIOSH will 
immediately advise the employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at 
the place of employment and those employees who appear to be in 
immediate danger of such allegation

[[Page 603]]

and will inform the agencies identified in Sec. 85a.4(a)(1), (a)(3), and 
(a)(4).

[41 FR 45002, Oct. 16, 1976, as amended at 45 FR 2654, Jan. 14, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 85a.8   Reporting of results of investigations of places of employment.

    (a)(1) Specific reports of investigations of each place of 
employment under this part, with identification of the place of 
employment, will be made available by NIOSH to the employer, owner, 
operator or agent in charge at the place of employment, with copies to 
the appropriate officials and Agencies notified pursuant to 
Sec. 85a.4(a). Prior to release of such reports, a preliminary report 
will be sent by NIOSH to the employer, owner, operator or agent for 
review for trade secret information and technical inaccuracies that may 
inadvertently be presented in the report. If requested in writing, the 
data used to compile the reports will be made available by NIOSH to the 
employer, owner, operator or agent in charge at the place of employment, 
except that data will not be released in a form that is individually 
identifiable.
    (2) All specific reports of investigations of each place of 
employment under this part will be available to the public from the 
NIOSH Regional Consultant for Occupational Safety and Health in the 
appropriate NIOSH Regional Office.
    (3) In certain instances, specific reports of investigations of each 
place of employment will not be prepared. In such instances, a closing 
conference at the place of employment will be conducted by the NIOSH 
authorized representatives and those individuals participating in the 
site visit to discuss the findings of the site visit and appropriate 
recommendations.
    (b)(1) Any specific findings of individual employee medical 
examinations, anthropometric measurements and functional tests will be 
released by NIOSH authorized representatives to the company physician, 
private physician, or other person only pursuant to the written 
authorization of the employee; otherwise, the specific findings and 
other personal records concerning individuals will be maintained in 
accordance with 45 CFR part 5b and section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974 
(5 U.S.C. 552a). Notice of all NIOSH systems of records as defined in 45 
CFR 5b.1(n) as a result of the investigations of places of employment 
pursuant to this part will be published in the Federal Register under 
Notices of Systems of Records for the Department of Health and Human 
Services.
    (2) In cases where an employee shows positive significant medical 
findings, the employee and the physician(s) designated by the employee 
under Sec. 85a.8(b)(1) will be immediately notified by NIOSH.
    (3) A summary of the findings of the examinations for each employee 
will be sent by NIOSH to the individual.
    (c) The findings of a total investigation generally will be 
disseminated as part of NIOSH criteria documents, NIOSH technical 
reports, NIOSH information packets, scientific journals, presentations 
at technical meetings, or in other similar manners. These findings of a 
total investigation will be presented in a manner which does not 
identify any specific place of employment; however, it should be noted 
that the specific reports of investigations of each place of employment 
under this part are subject to mandatory disclosure, upon request, under 
the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).

<R05>
Sec. 87.3  Who is eligible to apply for a grant under this part?

    Any public or private agency or institution is eligible to apply for 
a grant under this part, except Federal agencies or institutions not 
specifically authorized by law to receive such a grant.


<R05>
Sec. 87.4  For what purposes may grants be awarded?

    (a) The Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes grants for 
research, experiments, and demonstrations relating to occupational 
safety and health, including studies of the psychological factors 
involved. This authority includes projects to develop innovative 
methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety 
and health problems.
    (b) The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act authorizes grants for 
research projects designed to:
    (1) Improve working conditions and practices affecting health in 
coal or other mines and to prevent occupational diseases originating in 
the mining industry.
    (2) Develop epidemiological information to (i) identify and define 
positive factors involved in occupational diseases of miners, (ii) 
provide information on the incidence and prevalence of pneumoconiosis 
and other respiratory ailments of miners, and (iii) improve health 
standards.
    (3) Develop techniques for the prevention and control of 
occupational diseases of miners, including tests for hypersusceptibility 
and early detection.
    (4) Evaluate the effect on bodily impairment and occupational 
disability of miners afflicted with an occupational disease.
    (5) Study the relationship between coal or other mine environments 
and occupational diseases of miners.
    (6) Study matters involving the protection of life and the 
prevention of diseases in connection with persons who, although not 
miners, work with or around the products of coal or other mines in areas 
outside of such mines and under conditions which may adversely affect 
the health and well-being of such persons.
    (7) Develop effective respiratory equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 87.5  What information must be included in the grant application?

    The application must contain a complete description of the objective 
of the project and the plan for carrying out the research or 
demonstration, the name and qualifications of the principal investigator 
or project director and principal staff members, the total resources and 
facilities that will be available, and a justification of the amount of 
grant funds requested.


<R05>
Sec. 87.6  How will grant applications be evaluated and the grants awarded?

    (a) The Secretary may award grants to those applicants whose 
approved

[[Page 613]]

projects will best promote the purposes of either the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act or the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act on the 
basis of an evaluation conducted by experts or consultants engaged for 
this purpose.
    (b) This evaluation will take into account the scientific merit and 
significance of the project, the competency of the proposed staff in 
relation to the type of research or demonstration involved, the 
feasibility of the project, the likelihood of its producing meaningful 
results, the proposed project period, the adequacy of the applicant's 
resources available for the project, the amount of grant funds necessary 
for completion, and for mining grant applications, the recommendations 
of the Mine Health Research Advisory Committee.
    (c) The Secretary may evaluate and approve two or more concurrent 
applications, each dealing with one or more specified aspects of the 
project, and make two or more concurrent grant awards for the project. 
This may be necessary when a project involves a number of different but 
related problems, activities, or disciplines which would require 
evaluation by different groups, or when support for a project could be 
more effectively administered by separate handling of various aspects of 
the project.


<R05>
Sec. 87.7  For what period of time will grants be awarded?

    (a) The notice of grant award specifies how long the Secretary 
intends to support the project without requiring the project to 
recompete for funds. This period, called the project period, will 
usually be for 3-5 years.
    (b) Generally, the grant will initially be for 1 year and subsequent 
continuation awards will also be for 1 year at a time. A grantee must 
submit a separate application to have the support continued for each 
subsequent year. Decisions regarding continuation awards and the funding 
level of such awards will be of such factors as the grantee's progress 
and management practices, and the availability of funds. In all cases, 
continuation awards require a determination by the Secretary that 
continued funding is in the best interest of the Federal Government.
    (c) Neither the approval of any application, nor the award of any 
grant commits or obligates the Federal Government in any way to make any 
additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to 
any approved application or portion of an approved application.


<R05>
Sec. 87.8  How may a grantee use grant funds?

    A grantee shall only spend funds it receives under this part 
according to the approved application and budget, the authorizing 
legislation, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the applicable 
cost principles specified in subpart Q of 45 CFR part 74, and the 
regulations of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 87.9  Which other HHS regulations apply?

Sec. 100.2  Average cost of a health insurance policy.

    For purposes of determining the amount of compensation under the 
VICP, section 2115(a)(3)(B) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa.15(a)(3)(B), 
provides that certain individuals are entitled to receive an amount 
reflecting lost earnings, less certain deductions. One of the deductions 
is the average cost of a health insurance policy, as determined by the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary has determined 
that the average cost of a health insurance policy is $158.00 per month. 
This amount will be revised to reflect the changes in the medical care 
component of the Consumer Price Index (All Urban Consumers, U.S. City 
Average), published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
plus 2 percent per year. The revised amounts will be effective upon 
their delivery by the Secretary to the United States Claims Court, and 
the amounts will be published in a notice in the Federal Register from 
time to time as determined by the Secretary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Qualifications and aids to interpretation. The following 
qualifications and aids to interpretation shall apply to the Vaccine 
Injury Table in paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. For purposes of paragraph 
(a) of this section, Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock mean an acute, 
severe, and potentially lethal systemic allergic reaction. Most cases 
resolve without sequelae. Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few 
hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway 
obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be 
associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other significant clinical 
signs and symptoms may include the following: Cyanosis, hypotension, 
bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, edema of the pharynx and/or 
trachea and/or larynx with stridor and dyspnea. Autopsy findings may 
include acute emphysema which results from lower respiratory tract 
obstruction, edema of the hypopharynx, epiglottis, larynx, or trchea and 
minimal findings of eosinophilia in the liver, spleen and lungs. When 
death occurs within minutes of exposure and without signs of respiratory 
distress, there may not be significant pathologic findings.
    (2) Encephalopathy. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a 
vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy 
only if such recipient manifests, within the applicable period, an 
injury meeting the description below of an acute encephalopathy, and 
then a chronic encephalopathy persists in such person for more than 6 
months beyond the date of vaccination.
    (i) An acute encephalopathy is one that is sufficiently severe so as 
to require hospitalization.
    (A) For children less than 18 months of age who present without an 
associated seizure event, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a 
significantly decreased level of consciousness lasting

[[Page 621]]

for at least 24 hours. Those children less than 18 months of age who 
present following a seizure shall be viewed as having an acute 
encephalopathy if their significantly decreased level of consciousness 
persists beyond 24 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state 
(seizure) or medication.
    (B) For adults and children 18 months of age or older, an acute 
encephalopathy is one that persists for at least 24 hours and 
characterized by at least two of the following:
    (1) A significant change in mental status that is not medication 
related; specifically a confusional state, or a delirium, or a 
psychosis;
    (2) A significantly decreased level of consciousness, which is 
independent of a seizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of 
medication; and
    (3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness.
    (C) Increased intracranial pressure may be a clinical feature of 
acute encephalopathy in any age group.
    (D) A ``significantly decreased level of consciousness'' is 
indicated by the presence of at least one of the following clinical 
signs for at least 24 hours or greater (see paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and 
(b)(2)(i)(B) of this section for applicable timeframes):
    (1) Decreased or absent response to environment (responds, if at 
all, only to loud voice or painful stimuli);
    (2) Decreased or absent eye contact (does not fix gaze upon family 
members or other individuals); or
    (3) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not 
recognize familiar people or things).
    (E) The following clinical features alone, or in combination, do not 
demonstrate an acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either 
mental status or level of consciousness as described above: Sleepiness, 
irritability (fussiness), high-pitched and unusual screaming, persistent 
inconsolable crying, and bulging fontanelle. Seizures in themselves are 
not sufficient to constitute a diagnosis of encephalopathy. In the 
absence of other evidence of an acute encephalopathy, seizures shall not 
be viewed as the first symptom or manifestation of the onset of an acute 
encephalopathy.
    (ii) Chronic Encephalopathy occurs when a change in mental or 
neurologic status, first manifested during the applicable time period, 
persists for a period of at least 6 months from the date of vaccination. 
Individuals who return to a normal neurologic state after the acute 
encephalopathy shall not be presumed to have suffered residual 
neurologic damage from that event; any subsequent chronic encephalopathy 
shall not be presumed to be a sequela of the acute encephalopathy. If a 
preponderance of the evidence indicates that a child's chronic 
encephalopathy is secondary to genetic, prenatal or perinatal factors, 
that chronic encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition 
set forth in the Table.
    (iii) An encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition 
set forth in the Table if in a proceeding on a petition, it is shown by 
a preponderance of the evidence that the encephalopathy was caused by an 
infection, a toxin, a metabolic disturbance, a structural lesion, a 
genetic disorder or trauma (without regard to whether the cause of the 
infection, toxin, trauma, metabolic disturbance, structural lesion or 
genetic disorder is known). If at the time a decision is made on a 
petition filed under section 2111(b) of the Act for a vaccine-related 
injury or death, it is not possible to determine the cause by a 
preponderance of the evidence of an encephalopathy, the encephalopathy 
shall be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table.
    (iv) In determining whether or not an encephalopathy is a condition 
set forth in the Table, the Court shall consider the entire medical 
record.
    (3) Residual Seizure Disorder. (i) A petitioner may be considered to 
have suffered a residual seizure disorder for purposes of paragraph (a) 
of this section, if the first seizure or convulsion occurred 5-15 days 
(not less than 5 days and not more than 15 days) after administration of 
the vaccine and 2 or more additional distinct seizure or convulsion 
episodes occurred within 1 year after the administration of the vaccine 
which were unaccompanied by fever (defined as a rectal temperature equal 
to or greater than 101.0 degrees Fahrenheit or an oral temperature equal 
to

[[Page 622]]

or greater than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit). A distinct seizure or 
convulsion episode is ordinarily defined as including all seizure or 
convulsive activity occurring within a 24-hour period, unless competent 
and qualified expert neurological testimony is presented to the contrary 
in a particular case.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a petitioner 
shall not be considered to have suffered a residual seizure disorder, if 
the petitioner suffered a seizure or convulsion unaccompanied by fever 
(defined as a rectal temperature equal to or greater than 101.0 degrees 
Fahrenheit or an oral temperature equal to or greater than 100.0 degrees 
Fahrenheit) before the fifth day after the administration of the vaccine 
involved.
    (4) Seizure and convulsion. For purposes of paragraphs (b) (2) and 
(3) of this section, the terms, ``seizure'' and ``convulsion'' include 
myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal), and simple and complex 
partial seizures. Absence (petit mal) seizures shall not be considered 
to be a condition set forth in the Table. Jerking movements or staring 
episodes alone are not necessarily an indication of seizure activity.
    (5) Sequela. The term ``sequela'' means a condition or event which 
was actually caused by a condition listed in the Vaccine Injury Table.
    (6) Chronic Arthritis. (i) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this 
section, chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no prior 
history of arthropathy (joint disease) on the basis of:
    (A) Medical documentation, recorded within 30 days after the onset, 
of objective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred 
within 42 days after a rubella vaccination; and
    (B) Medical documentation (recorded within 3 years after the onset 
of acute arthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of 
intermittent or continuous arthritis for more than 6 months following 
vaccination.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
shall not be considered as chronic arthritis: Musculoskeletal disorders 
such as diffuse connective tissue diseases (including but not limited to 
rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, 
polymyositis/dermatomyositis, necrotizing vasculitis and vasculopathies 
and Sjogren's Syndrome), degenerative joint disease, infectious agents 
other than rubella (whether by direct invasion or as an immune 
reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms, 
neuropathic disorders, bone and cartilage disorders and arthritis 
associated with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel 
disease, Reiter's syndrome, or blood disorders.
    (iii) Arthralgia (joint pain) or stiffness without joint swelling 
shall not be viewed as chronic arthritis for purposes of paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (c) Effective date provisions. The Table of Injuries set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section applies to petitions for compensation 
under the Program filed with the United States Court of Federal Claims 
on or after March 10, 1995. The Qualifications and Aids to 
Interpretation set forth in paragraph (b) of this section apply to 
petitions filed with the United States Court of Federal Claims on or 
after March 10, 1995. The petitions for compensation filed with the 
United States Court of Federal Claims before March 10, 1995 shall be 
governed by section 2114(a) (initial ``Table'') and section 2114(b) 
(initial ``Qualification and Aids to Interpretation'') of the Public 
Health Service Act as in effect on February 8, 1995.

Sec. 124.503  Compliance level.

    (a) Annual compliance level. Subject to the provisions of this 
subpart, a facility is in compliance with its assurance to provide a 
reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay if it provides 
for the fiscal year uncompensated services at a level not less than the 
lesser of--
    (1) Three percent of its operating costs for the most recent fiscal 
year for which an audited financial statement is available;
    (2) Ten percent of all Federal assistance provided to or on behalf 
of the facility, adjusted by a percentage equal to the percentage change 
in the CPI between the year in which the facility received assistance or 
1979, whichever is later, and the most recent year for which a published 
index is available.
    (b) Deficits. If in any fiscal year a facility fails to meet its 
annual compliance level, it shall provide uncompensated services in an 
amount sufficient to make up that deficit in subsequent

[[Page 632]]

years, and its period of obligation shall be extended until the deficit 
is made up.
    (1) Types of deficits. For purposes of determining the timing and 
amount of any deficit make-up, there are two types of deficits:
    (i) Justifiable deficits. A justifiable deficit is one in which the 
facility did not meet its annual compliance level due to either 
financial inability (as determined under Sec. 124.511(c)) or, although 
otherwise in compliance with this subpart, a lack of eligible applicants 
for uncompensated services during the fiscal year.
    (ii) Noncompliance deficits. A noncompliance deficit is one in which 
the facility failed to meet its annual compliance level due to 
noncompliance with this subpart.
    (2) Timing of deficit make-up--(i) Justifiable deficits. (A) A 
facility assisted under title VI of the Act may make up a justifiable 
deficit at any time during its period of obligation or in the year (or 
years, if necessary) immediately following its period of obligation.
    (B) A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act is not required 
to make up a justifiable deficit.
    (ii) Noncompliance deficits. (A) A facility must begin to make up a 
noncompliance deficit in the fiscal year following the finding of 
noncompliance by the Secretary.
    (B) A facility which claimed financial inability under 
Sec. 124.509(a)(2)(iii) and is found by the Secretary, pursuant to 
Sec. 124.511(c), to have been financially able to provide uncompensated 
services in the year in which the deficit was incurred shall begin to 
make up the deficit beginning in the fiscal year following the 
Secretary's finding.
    (C) A facility required to make up a noncompliance deficit but which 
is determined by the Secretary, pursuant to Sec. 124.511(c), to be 
financially unable to do so in the year following the Secretary's 
finding of noncompliance shall make up the deficit in accordance with a 
schedule set by the Secretary.
    (3) Deficit make-up amount. (i) The amount of a deficit in any 
fiscal year is the difference between the facility's annual compliance 
level for that year and the amount of uncompensated services provided in 
that year.
    (ii) The amount of a justifiable deficit must be adjusted by a 
percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI 
available in the fiscal year in which the deficit was incurred and the 
CPI available in the fiscal year in which it was made up.
    (iii) An amount equal to the result of dividing the amount of any 
noncompliance deficit for a fiscal year by the number of years of 
obligation remaining and adjusting it by a percentage equal to the 
percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in the fiscal 
year in which the deficit was incurred and the CPI available in the 
fiscal year in which it was made up shall be added to a facility's 
annual compliance level for each fiscal year following the fiscal year 
of the finding of noncompliance.
    (4) Affirmative action plan for precluding future deficits. Except 
where a facility reports to the Secretary in accordance with 
Sec. 124.509(a)(2)(iii) that it was financially unable to provide 
uncompensated services at the annual compliance level, a facility that 
fails to meet its annual compliance level in any fiscal year shall, in 
the following year, develop and implement a plan of action that can 
reasonably be expected to enable the facility to meet its annual 
compliance level. Such actions may include special notice to the 
community through newspaper, radio, and television, or expansion of 
service to Category B, or, with respect to nursing homes, Category C, 
persons. The Secretary may require changes to the plan. Where a facility 
fails to comply with this section, the Secretary may require it to make 
up the deficit in the fiscal year following the year in which it was 
required to institute the plan.
    (c) Excesses. (1) Except for facilities certified under 
Sec. 124.513, Sec. 124.514, or Sec. 124.515, if a facility provides in a 
fiscal year uncompensated services in an amount exceeding its annual 
compliance level, it may apply the amount of excess to reduce its annual 
compliance level in any subsequent fiscal year. The facility may use any 
excess amount to reduce its annual compliance level only if the services 
in excess of the annual compliance level are provided in accordance with 
the requirements of this subpart.

[[Page 633]]

    (2) Calculation and adjustment of excess. (i) The amount of an 
excess in uncompensated services in any fiscal year is the difference 
between the amount of uncompensated services the facility provided in 
that year and the facility's annual compliance level for that year.
    (ii) The amount of any excess compliance applied to reduce a 
facility's annual compliance level must be adjusted by a percentage 
equal to the percentage change in the CPI between the CPI available in 
the fiscal year in which the facility provided the excess, and the CPI 
available in the fiscal year in which the facility applies the excess to 
reduce its annual compliance level or satisfy its remaining obligation.
    (3) Except as provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a 
facility assisted under title VI may in any fiscal year apply the amount 
of excess credited under this paragraph to satisfy the remainder of its 
obligation to provide uncompensated services. A facility's remaining 
obligation is determined as follows:
    (i) Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is 
established under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the remaining 
obligation is:
    (A) For grant assistance, 10 percent of each grant under obligation, 
multiplied by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation, 
adjusted as provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, plus any 
deficits required to be made up and less any unused excesses accrued in 
prior years; and
    (B) For loan assistance, the facility's annual compliance level 
multiplied by the number of years remaining in the scheduled life of the 
loan, plus the sum of 10 percent of each yearly cumulative total of 
additional interest subsidy or other payments (which the Secretary will 
have made in connection with the guaranteed loan or a direct loan which 
has been sold) in each subsequent year remaining in the scheduled life 
of the loan, plus any deficits required to be made up, and less any 
unused excesses accrued in prior years; or
    (ii) Where the annual compliance level in such fiscal year is 
established under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the remaining 
obligation is the average of the facility's annual compliance levels in 
the previous three years, multiplied by the number of years remaining in 
its period of obligation, plus any deficits required to be made up under 
this section, and less any unused excesses accrued in prior years.

<R05>
Sec. 124.504  Notice of availability of uncompensated services.

    (a) Published notice. A facility shall publish in a newspaper of 
general circulation in its area notice of its uncompensated services 
obligation before the beginning of its fiscal year. The notice shall 
include:
    (1) The plan of allocation the facility proposes to adopt;
    (2) The amount of uncompensated services the facility intends to 
make available in the fiscal year or a statement that the facility will 
provide uncompensated services to all persons unable to pay who request 
uncompensated services;
    (3) An explanation, if the amount of uncompensated services the 
facility intends to make available in a fiscal year is less than the 
annual compliance level. If a facility has satisfied its remaining 
uncompensated services obligation since the last published notice under 
this paragraph, or will satisfy the remaining obligation during the 
fiscal year, the explanation must include this information; and
    (4) A statement inviting interested parties to comment on the 
allocation plan.
    (b) Posted notice. (1) The facility shall post notices, which the 
Secretary supplies in English and Spanish, in appropriate areas in the 
facility, including but not limited to the admissions areas, the 
business office, and the emergency room.
    (2) If in the service area of the facility the ``usual language of 
households'' of ten percent or more of the population according to the 
most recent figures published by the Bureau of the Census is other than 
English or Spanish, the facility shall translate the notice into that 
language and post the translated notice on signs substantially similar 
in size and legibility to and posted with those supplied under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.

[[Page 634]]

    (3) The facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the 
contents of the posted notice to persons who it has reason to believe 
cannot read the notice.
    (c) Individual written notice. (1) In any period during a fiscal 
year in which uncompensated services are available in the facility, the 
facility shall provide individual written notice of the availability of 
uncompensated services to each person who seeks services in the facility 
on behalf of himself or another. The individual written notice must:
    (i) State that the facility is required by law to provide a 
reasonable amount of care without or below charge to people who cannot 
afford care;
    (ii) Set forth the criteria the facility uses for determining 
eligibility for uncompensated services (in accordance with the financial 
eligibility criteria and the allocation plan);
    (iii) State the location in the facility where anyone seeking 
uncompensated services may request them; and
    (iv) State that the facility will make a written determination of 
whether the person will receive uncompensated services, and the date by 
or period within which the determination will be made.
    (2) The facility shall provide the individual written notice before 
providing services, except where the emergency nature of the services 
provided makes prior notice impractical. If this exception applies, the 
facility shall provide the individual written notice to the next of kin 
or to the patient as soon as practical, but not later than when first 
presenting a bill for services.
    (3) The facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the 
contents of the individual written notice to persons who it has reason 
to believe cannot read the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 124.505  Eligibility criteria.

    (a) A person unable to pay for health services is a person who--
    (1) Is not covered, or receives services not covered, under a third-

Sec. 124.511  Investigation and determination of compliance.

    (a) Complaints. A complaint that a facility is out of compliance 
with the requirements of this subpart may be filed with the Secretary by 
any person.
    (1) A complaint is considered to be filed with the Secretary on the 
date the following information is received in the Office of the HHS 
Regional Health Administrator for the Region in which the facility is 
located:
    (i) The name and address of the person making the complaint or on 
whose behalf the complaint is made;
    (ii) The name and location of the facility;
    (iii) The date or approximate date on which the event occurred; and
    (iv) A statement of what actions the complainant considers to 
violate the requirements of this subpart.
    (2) The Secretary promptly provides a copy of the complaint to the 
facility named in the complaint.
    (3) When the Secretary investigates a facility, the facility, 
including a facility certified under Sec. 124.513, Sec. 124.514, 
Sec. 124.515, or Sec. 124.516, shall provide to the Secretary on request 
any documents, records and other information concerning its operation 
that relate to the requirements of this subpart. A facility will be 
presumed to be out of compliance with its assurance unless it supplies 
documentation sufficient to show compliance with the applicable 
provisions of this subpart.
    (4) Section 1627 of the Act provides that if the Secretary dimisses 
a complaint or the Attorney General has not brought an action for 
compliance within six months from the date on which the compliant is 
filed, the person filing it may bring a private action to effectuate 
compliance with the assurance. If the Secretary determines that he/she 
will be unable to issue a decision on a complaint or otherwise take 
appropriate action within the six month period, the Secretary may, based 
on priorities for the disposition of complaints that are established to 
promote the most effective use of enforcement resources, or on the 
request of the applicant, dismiss the complaint without a finding as to 
compliance prior to the

[[Page 639]]

end of the six month period, but no earlier than 45 days after the 
complaint is filed.
    (b) Assessments. The Secretary periodically investigates and 
assesses facilities to ascertain compliance with the requirements of 
this subpart, including certification of the amount of uncompensated 
services provided in a fiscal year or years, and provides guidance and 
prescribes corrective action to correct noncompliance.
    (1) Compliance after February 1, 1988. (i) The Secretary may certify 
that a facility has substantially complied with its assurance for a 
fiscal year or years, and such certification shall establish that the 
facility provided the amount of uncompensated services certified for the 
period covered by the certification.
    (ii) A certification of substantial compliance shall be based on the 
amount properly claimed by the facility pursuant to Sec. 124.509(a), 
utilizing procedures determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to 
establish that the facility has substantially complied with its 
assurance for the period covered by the certification. The procedures 
will include examination of individual account data to the extent deemed 
necessary by the Secretary.
    (iii) A certification of substantial compliance will be made where 
the Secretary determines that, for the period covered by the 
certification, the facility provided uncompensated services to eligible 
persons who had equal opportunity to apply therefor. In making this 
determination, the Secretary will consider, in descending order of 
importance, whether--
    (A) Corrective action prescribed pursuant to Sec. 124.512(b) has 
been taken by the facility;
    (B) Any noncompliance with the requirements of this subpart may be 
remedied by corrective action under Sec. 124.512(b);
    (C) The facility had procedures in place that complied with the 
requirements of Secs. 124.504(c), 124.505, 124.507, 124.509, 124.510, 
124.513(b)(2), 124.514(b)(2), 124.515, and 124.516 (b)(1) or (b)(2), as 
applicable, and systematically correctly followed such procedures.
    (2) Compliance prior to February 1, 1988. The Secretary will 
determine the amount of creditable services provided prior to the 
effective date of these rules using the compliance standards applicable 
under the rules as promulgated on May 18, 1979, based on procedures 
determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to establish that the 
facility provided such amounts of uncompensated services in the 
period(s) being assessed.
    (c) Determinations of financial inability. In determining whether a 
facility was or is financially able to meet its annual compliance level, 
the Secretary will consider any comments submitted by interested 
parties. In making this determination, the Secretary will consider 
factors such as:
    (1) The ratio of revenues to expenses;
    (2) The occupancy rate;
    (3) The ratio of current assets to current liabilities;
    (4) The average cost per patient day;
    (5) The number of days of operating expenses in accounts payable;
    (6) The number of days of revenues in accounts receivable;
    (7) The sinking fund (or depreciation fund) balance;
    (8) The debt coverage ratio; and
    (9) The availability of restricted or unrestricted funds (such as an 
endowment) available for charitable use.

<R05>
Sec. 124.512  Enforcement.

    (a) If the Secretary finds, based on his/her investigation under 
Sec. 124.511, that a facility did not comply with the requirements of 
this subpart, the Secretary may take any action authorized by law to 
secure compliance, including but not limited to, voluntary agreement or 
a request to the Attorney General to bring an action against the 
facility for specific performance.
    (b) A facility, including a facility certified under Sec. 124.513, 
Sec. 124.514, or Sec. 124.516, that has denied uncompensated services to 
any person because it failed to comply with the requirements of this 
subpart will not be in compliance with its assurance until it takes 
whatever steps are necessary to remedy fully the noncompliance, 
including:
    (1) Provision of uncompensated services to applicants improperly 
denied;

[[Page 640]]

    (2) Repayment of amounts improperly collected from persons eligible 
to receive uncompensated services; and
    (3) Other corrective actions prescribed by the Secretary.
    (c) The Secretary may disallow all of the uncompensated services 
claimed in a fiscal year where the Secretary finds that the facility was 
in substantial noncompliance with its assurance because it failed to:
    (1) Have a system for providing notice to eligible persons as 
required by Sec. 124.504(c), Sec. 124.513(b)(2), Sec. 124.514(b)(2), or 
Sec. 124.516(b)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable;
    (2) Comply with the applicable reporting requirements of 
Sec. 124.509;
    (3) Have a system for maintaining records of uncompensated services 
provided in accordance with Sec. 124.510; or
    (4) Take corrective action prescribed pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (d) In the absence of a finding of substantial compliance or 
substantial noncompliance in a fiscal year, the Secretary may disallow 
uncompensated services claimed by a facility in that fiscal year to the 
extent that the Secretary finds that such services are not documented as 
uncompensated services under Sec. 124.510 or are subject to disallowance 
under Sec. 124.513(d) or Sec. 124.514(d), as applicable.

Sec. 124.513  Public facility compliance alternative.

    (a) Effect of certification. The Secretary may certify a facility 
which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section 
as a ``public facility''. A facility which is so certified is not 
required to comply with this subpart except as otherwise herein 
provided.
    (b) Criteria for qualification. A public facility may qualify for 
certification under this section if all of the following criteria are 
met:
    (1) It is a facility which is owned and operated by a unit of State 
or local government or a quasi-public corporation as defined at 42 CFR 
124.2(m).
    (2) It provides health services without charge or at a substantially 
reduced rate to persons who are determined by the facility to qualify 
therefor under a program of discounted health services. A ``program of 
discounted health services'' must provide for financial and other 
objective eligibility criteria and procedures, including notice prior to 
nonemergency service, that assure effective opportunity for all persons 
to apply for and obtain a determination of eligibility for such 
services, including a determination prior to service where requested; 
provided that, such criteria and procedures are not required where the 
facility makes all services available to all persons at no or nominal 
charge.
    (3)(i) It received, for the three most recent fiscal years, at least 
10 percent of its total operating revenue (net patient revenue plus 
other operating revenue, exclusive of any amounts received, or if not 
received, claimed, as reimbursement under titles XVIII and XIX of the 
Social Security Act) from State and local tax appropriations or other 
State and local government revenues, or from a quasi-public corporation 
as defined at 42 CFR 124.2(m), to cover operating deficits attributable 
to the provision of discounted services; or
    (ii) If provided, in each of the three most recent fiscal years, 
uncompensated services under this subpart or under programs described by 
the documentation provided under Sec. 124.513(c)(2) in an amount not 
less than twice the annual compliance level computed under 
Sec. 124.503(a).
    (c) Procedures for certification. To be certified under this 
section, a facility must submit to the Secretary, in addition to other 
materials that the Secretary may from time to time require, copies of 
the following:
    (1) Audited financial statements or official State or local 
government documents (such as annual reports or budget documents), for 
the three most recent fiscal years, sufficient to show that the facility 
meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (2) A complete description of its program(s) of discounted health 
services, including charging and collection policies of the facility, 
and eligibility criteria and notice and determination procedures used 
under its program(s) of discounted services.

[[Page 641]]

    (d) Period of effectiveness. (1) A certification by the Secretary 
under this section remains in effect until withdrawn. The Secretary may 
disallow credit under this subpart when the Secretary determines that 
there has been a material change in any factor upon which certification 
was based or substantial noncompliance with this subpart. The Secretary 
may withdraw certification where the change or noncompliance has not 
been adequately remedied or otherwise continues.
    (2) Deficits--(i) Title VI-assisted facilities with assessed 
deficits. Where a facility assisted under title VI of the Act has been 
assessed as having a deficit under Sec. 124.503(b) that has not been 
made up prior to certification under this section, the facility may make 
up that deficit by either--
    (A) Demonstrating to the Secretary's satisfaction, that it met the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for each year in which a 
deficit was assessed; or
    (B) Providing an additional period of service under this section on 
the basis of one (or portion of a) year of certification for each year 
(or portion of a year) of deficit assessed. The period of obligation 
applicable to the facility under Sec. 124.501(b) shall be extended until 
the deficit is made up in accordance with the preceding sentence.
    (ii) Title VI-assisted facilities which have not been assessed. 
Where any period of compliance under this subpart of a facility assisted 
under title VI of the Act has not been assessed, the facility will be 
presumed to have no allowable credit for such period. The facility may 
either--
    (A) Make up such deficit in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 
this section; or
    (B) Submit an independent certified audit, conducted in accordance 
with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's records 
maintained pursuant to Sec. 124.510. If the audit establishes to the 
Secretary's satisfaction that no, or a lesser, deficit exists for the 
period in question, the facility will receive credit for the period so 
justified. Any deficit which the Secretary determines still remains must 
be made up in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Title XVI-assisted facilities. (A) A facility assisted under 
title XVI of the Act which has an assessed deficit which was not made up 
prior to certification under this section shall make up that deficit in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section. If it cannot 
make the showing required by that paragraph, it shall make up the 
deficit when its certification under this section is withdrawn.
    (B) A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act whose compliance 
with this subpart has not been completely assessed will be presumed to 
have no allowable credit for the unassessed period. The facility may 
make up the deficit by--
    (1) Following the procedure of subparagraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section; or
    (2) Submitting an independent certified audit, conducted in 
accordance with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's 
records maintained pursuant to Sec. 124.510. If the audit establishes to 
the Secretary's satisfaction that no, or a lesser, deficit exists for 
the period in question, the facility will receive credit for the period 
so justified. Any deficit which the Secretary determines still remains 
must be made up in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section.

Sec. 124.514  Compliance alternative for facilities with small annual obligations.

    (a) Effect of certification. The Secretary may certify a facility 
which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section 
as a ``facility with a small annual obligation.'' A facility which is so 
certified is not required to comply with this subpart except as 
otherwise herein provided.
    (b) Criteria for qualification. A facility may qualify for 
certification under this section if all of the following criteria are 
met:
    (1)(i) Title VI-assisted facilities. (A) For the facility's fiscal 
year in which this section becomes effective, the level, computed under 
Sec. 124.503(c) (3),

[[Page 642]]

divided by the number of years remaining in its period of obligation 
(including an additional year or portion of a year for each year or 
portion of a year in which a deficit was incurred and has not been made 
up), is not more than $10,000;
    (B) For a subsequent fiscal year, the level computed under paragraph 
(A) of this paragraph (b)(1)(i), is at or less than $10,000, adjusted by 
a percentage equal to the percentage change in the CPI available in the 
year in which this section becomes effective and the most recent year 
for which a published index is available.
    (ii) Title XVI-assisted facilities. (A) For the facility's fiscal 
year in which this section becomes effective, the level under 
Sec. 124.503(a), plus the amount of any noncompliance deficits which 
have not been made up, is at or less than $10,000.
    (B) For a subsequent fiscal year, the level, computed under 
paragraph (A) of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), is at or less than $10,000, 
adjusted as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (2) It provides health services without charge or at a substantially 
reduced rate to persons who are determined by the facility to qualify 
threrefor under a program of discounted health services. A ``program of 
discounted health services'' must provide for financial and other 
objective eligibility criteria and procedures, including notice prior to 
nonemergency service, that assure effective opportunity for all persons 
to apply for and obtain a determination of eligibility for such 
services, including a determination prior to service where requested; 
Provided that, such criteria and procedures are not required where the 
facility makes all services available to all persons at no or nominal 
charge.
    (c) Procedures for certification. To be certified under this 
section, a facility must submit to the Secretary, in addition to other 
materials that the Secretary may from time to time require, a complete 
description of its program(s) of discounted health services, including 
charging and collection policies of the facility, and eligibility 
criteria and notice and determination precedures used under its 
program(s) of discounted services.
    (d) Period of effectiveness. A certification by the Secretary under 
this section remains in effect until withdrawn. During the period in 
which such certification is in effect, the facility must provide 
uncompensated services in an amount not less than the level applicable 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for each fiscal year. The 
Secretary may disallow credit under this subpart when the Secretary 
determines that there has been a material change in any factor upon 
which certification was based or substantial noncompliance with this 
subpart. The Secretary may withdraw certification where the change or 
noncompliance cannot be or has not been adequately remedied or 
noncompliance otherwise continues.
    (e) Deficits. (1) Where the compliance level of a facility assisted 
under title VI of the Act is computed under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of 
this section as including additional year(s) or a portion of a year, the 
facility's period of obligation under this subpart shall be extended by 
such additional period, until certification is withdrawn.
    (2) Where a facility has been assessed as having a deficit under 
Sec. 124.503(b) that has not been made up prior to withdrawal of 
certification under this section or fails to provide services as 
required by paragraph (d) of this section, the facility must make up the 
deficit in accordance with Sec. 124.503(b) following withdrawal of 
certification.

its annual compliance level in accordance with the requirements of this 
subpart and shall not be required otherwise to comply with the 
requirements of this subpart for that fiscal year. This provision also 
applies to any facility that has signed a memorandum of agreement with 
the Secretary under section 334 of the Act if the services provided by 
the National Health Service Corps professional(s) assigned pursuant to 
that agreement constitute all of the medical services provided by the 
facility.
    (b) Deficits--(1) Title VI-assisted facilities with assessed 
deficits. Where a facility assisted under title VI of the Act has been 
assessed as having a deficit under Sec. 124.503(b) that has not been 
made up prior to certification under this section, the facility may make 
up that deficit by either--

requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for each year in which a 
deficit was assessed; or
    (ii) Providing an additional period of service under this section on 
the basis of one (or portion of a) year of certification for each year 
(or portion of a year) of deficit assessed. The period of obligation 
applicable to the facility under Sec. 124.501(b) shall be extended until 
the deficit is made up in accordance with the preceding sentence.
    (2) Title VI-assisted facilities which have not been assessed. Where

section; or
    (ii) Submit an independent certified audit, conducted in accordance 
with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's records

period in question, the facility will receive credit for the period so 
justified. Any deficit which the Secretary determines still remains must 
be made up in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) Title XVI-assisted facilities. (i) A facility assisted under 
title XVI of the Act which has an assessed deficit which was not made up 
prior to certification under this section shall make up that deficit in

the showing required by that paragraph, it shall make up the deficit 
when it is no longer certified under this section.
    (ii) A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act whose compliance 
with this subpart has not been completely assessed will be presumed to 
have no allowable credit for the unassessed period. The facility may 
make up the deficit by--

or
    (B) Submitting an independent certified audit, conducted in 
accordance with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's

may withdraw certification where the change or noncompliance has not 
been in the Secretary's judgment adequately remedied or otherwise 
continues.
    (2) Deficits--(i) Title VI-assisted facilities with assessed 
deficits. Where a facility assisted under title VI of the Act has been

extended until the deficit is made up in accordance with the preceding 
sentence.
    (ii) Where any period of compliance under this subpart of a facility

this section; or
    (B) Submit an independent certified audit, conducted in accordance 
with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's records 
maintained pursuant to Sec. 124.510. If the audit establishes to the 
Secretary's satisfaction that no, or a lesser, deficit exists for the 
period in question, the facility will receive credit for the period so 
justified. Any deficit which the Secretary determines still remains must 
be made up in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Title XVI-assisted facilities. (A) A facility assisted under 
title XVI of the Act which has an assessed deficit which was not made up 
prior to certification under this section shall make up that deficit in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section. If it cannot 
make the showing required by that paragraph, it shall make up the 
deficit when its certification under this section is withdrawn.
    (B) A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act whose compliance 
with this subpart has not been completely assessed will be presumed to 
have no allowable credit for the unassessed period. The facility may 
make up the deficit by--
    (1) Following the procedure of paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section; or
    (2) Submitting an independent certified audit, conducted in 
accordance with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's 
records maintained pursuant to Sec. 124.510. If the audit establishes 
that no, or a lesser, deficit exists for the period in question, the 
facility will receive credit for the period so justified. Any deficit 
which the Secretary determines still remains must be made up in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.

                      Subpart G--Community Service

    Authority: Secs. 215, 1525, 1602(6), Public Health Service Act as 
amended; 58 Stat 690, 88 Stat. 2249, 2259; 42 U.S.C. 216, 300m-4, 300o-
1(6).

    Source: 44 FR 29379, May 18, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 124.601  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart apply to any recipient of Federal 
assistance under title VI or XVI of the Public Health Service Act that 
has given an assurance that it would make the facility or portion 
thereof assisted available to all persons residing (and, in the case of 
title XVI assisted applicants, employed), in the territorial area it 
serves. This assurance is referred to in this subpart as the ``community 
service assurance.''


<R05>
Sec. 124.602  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Act means the Public Health Service Act, as amended.
    Facility means the an entity that received assistance under title VI 
or title XVI of the Act and provided a community service assurance.
    Fiscal year means facility's fiscal year.
    Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services or his 
delegatee.
    Service area means the geographic area designated as the area served 
by the facility in the most recent State plan approved by the Secretary 
under title VI, except that, at the request of the facility, the 
Secretary may designate a different area proposed by the facility when 
he determines that a different area is appropriate based on the criteria 
in 42 CFR 53.1(d).
    State agency means the agency of a state fully or conditionally 
designated by the Secretary as the State health planning and development 
agency of the State under section 1521 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 124.603  Provision of services.

    (a) General. (1) In order to comply with its community service 
assurance, a facility shall make the services provided in the facility 
or portion thereof constructed, modernized, or converted with Federal 
assistance under title VI or XVI of the Act available to all persons 
residing (and, in the case of facilities assisted under title XVI of the 
Act, employed) in the facility's service area without discrimination on 
the ground of race, color, national origin, creed, or any other ground 
unrelated to an individual's need for the service or the availability of 
the needed service in the facility. Subject to paragraph (b) (concerning 
emergency services) a facility may deny services to persons who are 
unable to pay for them unless those persons are required to be provided 
uncompensated services under the provisions of Subpart F.
    (2) A person is residing in the facility's service area for purposes 
of this section if the person:
    (i) Is living in the service area with the intention to remain there 
permanently or for an indefinite period;
    (ii) Is living in the service area for purposes of employment; or
    (iii) Is living with a family member who resides in the service 
area.
    (b) Emergency services. (1) A facility may not deny emergency 
services to any person who resides (or, in the case of facilities 
assisted under title XVI of the Act, is employed) in the facility's 
service area on the ground that the person is unable to pay for those 
services.
    (2) A facility may discharge a person that has received emergency 
services, or may transfer the person to another facility able to provide 
necessary services, when the appropriate medical personnel determine 
that discharge or transfer will not subject the person to a substantial 
risk of deterioration in medical condition.
    (c) Third party payor programs. (1) The facility shall make 
arrangements, if eligible to do so, for reimbursement for services with:
    (i) Those principal State and local governmental third-party payors 
that provide reimbursement for services that is not less than the actual 
costs, as determined in accordance with accepted cost accounting 
principles; and
    (ii) Federal governmental third-party programs, such as medicare and 
medicaid.
    (2) The facility shall take any necessary steps to insure that 
admission

[[Page 647]]

to and services of the facility are available to beneficiaries of the 
governmental programs specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
without discrimination or preference because they are beneficiaries of 
those programs.
    (d) Exclusionary admissions policies. A facility is out of 
compliance with its community service assurance if it uses an admission 
policy that has the effect of excluding persons on a ground other than 
those permitted under paragraph (a) of this section. Illustrative 
applications of this requirement are described in the following 
paragraphs:
    (1) A facility has a policy or practice of admitting only those 
patients who are referred by physicians with staff privileges at the 
facility. If this policy or practice has the effect of excluding persons 
who reside (or for title XVI facilities, are employed) in the community 
from the facility because they do not have a private family doctor with 
staff privileges at the facility, the facility would not be in 
compliance with its assurance. The facility is not required to abolish 
its staff physician admissions policy as a usual method for admission. 
However, to be in compliance with its community service assurance it 
must make alternative arrangements to assist area residents who would 
otherwise be unable to gain admission to obtain services available in 
the facility. Examples of alternative arrangements a facility might use 
include:
    (i) Authorizing the individual's physician, if licensed and 
otherwise qualified, to treat the patient at the facility even though 
the physician does not have staff privileges at the facility;
    (ii) For those patients who have no physician, obtaining the 
voluntary agreement of physicians with staff privileges at the facility 
to accept referrals of such patients, perhaps on a rotating basis;
    (iii) If an insufficient number of physicians with staff privileges 
agree to participate in a referral arrangement, requiring acceptance of 
referrals as a condition to obtaining or renewing staff privileges;
    (iv) Establishing a hospital-based primary care clinic through which 
patients needing hospitalization may be admitted; or
    (v) Hiring or contracting with qualified physicians to treat 
patients who do not have private physicians.
    (2) A facility, as required, is a qualified provider under the title 
XIX medicaid program, but few or none of the physicians with staff 
privileges at the facility or in a particular department or sub-
department of the facility will treat medicaid patients. If the effect 
is that some medicaid patients are excluded from the facility or from 
any service provided in the facility, the facility is not in compliance 
with its community service assurance. To be in compliance a facility 
does not have to require all of its staff physicians to accept medicaid. 
However, it must take steps to ensure that medicaid beneficiaries have 
full access to all of its available services. Examples of steps that may 
be taken include:
    (i) Obtaining the voluntary agreement of a reasonable number of 
physicians with staff privileges at the facility and in each department 
or sub-department to accept referral of medicaid patients, perhaps on a 
rotating basis;
    (ii) If an insufficient number of physicians with staff privileges 
agree to participate in a referral arrangement, requiring acceptance of 
referrals as a condition to obtaining or renewing staff privileges;
    (iii) Establishing a clinic through which medicaid beneficiaries 
needing hospitalization may be admitted; or
    (iv) Hiring or contracting with physicians to treat medicaid 
patients.
    (3) A facility requires advance deposits (pre-admission or pre-
service deposits) before admitting or serving patients. If the effect of 
this practice is that some persons are denied admission or service or 
face substantial delays in gaining admission or service solely because 
they do not have the necessary cash on hand, this would constitute a 
violation of the community service assurance. While the facility is not 
required to forego the use of a deposit policy in all situations, it is 
required to make alternative arrangements to ensure that persons who 
probably can pay for the services are not denied them simply because 
they do not have the available cash at the time services are requested. 
For example, many employed persons and persons with other

[[Page 648]]

collateral do not have savings, but can pay hospital bills on an 
installment basis, or can pay a small deposit. Such persons may not be 
excluded from admission or denied services because of their inability to 
pay a deposit.


<R05>
Sec. 124.604  Posted notice.

    (a) The facility shall post notices, which the Secretary supplies in 
English and Spanish, in appropriate areas of the facility, including but 
not limited to the admissions area, the business office and the 
emergency room.
    (b) If in the service area of the facility the ``usual language of 
households'' of ten percent or more of the population, according to the 
most recent figures published by the Bureau of the Census, is other than 
English or Spanish, the facility shall translate the notice into that 
language and post the translated notice on signs substantially similar 
in size and legibility to, and posted with, those supplied under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The facility shall make reasonable efforts to communicate the 
contents of the posted notice to persons who it has reason to believe 
cannot read the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 124.605  Reporting and record maintenance requirements.

    (a) Reporting requirements--(1) Timing of reports--(i) A facility 
shall submit to the Secretary a report to assist the Secretary in 
determining compliance with this subpart once every three fiscal years, 
on a schedule to be prescribed by the Secretary. The report required by 
this section shall be submitted not later than 90 days after the end of 
the fiscal year, unless a longer period is approved by the Secretary for 
good cause shown.
    (ii) A facility shall also submit the required report whenever the 
Secretary determines, and so notifies the facility in writing, that a 
report is needed for proper administration of the program. In this 
situation the facility shall submit the report specified in this section 
for the filing of reports, within 90 days after receiving notice from 
the Secretary, or within 90 days after the close of the fiscal year, 
whichever is later.
    (2) Content of report. The report must be submitted on a form 
prescribed by the Secretary and must include information that the 
Secretary prescribes to permit a determination of whether a facility has 
met its obligations under this subpart.
    (3) The facility shall provide a copy of any report to the HSA for 
the area when submitting it to the Secretary.
    (4) Institution of suit. Not later than 10 days after being served 
with a summons or complaint, the applicant shall notify the Regional 
Health Administrator for the Region of HHS in which it is located of any 
legal action brought against it alleging that it has failed to comply 
with the requirements of this subpart.<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1 The addresses of the Regional Office of HHS are set out in 45 CFR 
5.31.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Record maintenance requirements. (1) A facility shall maintain, 
make available for public inspection consistent with personal privacy, 
and provide to the Secretary on request, any records necessary to 
document its compliance requirements of this subpart in any fiscal year, 
including documents from which information required to be reported under 
paragraph (a) of this section was obtained. A facility shall maintain 
these records until 180 days following the close of the Secretary's 
investigation under Sec. 124.606(a).


<R05>
Sec. 124.606  Investigation and enforcement.

    (a) Investigations. (1) The Secretary periodically investigates the 
compliance of facilities with the requirements of this subpart, and 
investigates complaints.
    (2)(i) A complaint is filed with the Secretary on the date on which 
the following information is received in the Office of the Regional 
Health Administrator for the Region of HHS in which the facility is 
located:
    (A) The name and address of the person making the complaint or on 
whose behalf the complaint is made;
    (B) The name and location of the facility;
    (C) The date or approximate date on which the event complained of 
occurred, and
    (D) A statement of what actions the complainant considers to violate 
the requirements of this subpart.

[[Page 649]]

    (ii) The Secretary promptly provides a copy of the complaint to each 
facility named in the complaint.
    (3) When the Secretary investigates a facility, the facility shall 
provide to the Secretary on request any documents, records and other 
information concerning its operations that relate to the requirements of 
this subpart.
    (4) The Act provides that if the Secretary dismisses a complaint or 
the Attorney General has not brought an action for compliance within six 
months from the date on which the complaint is filed, the person filing 
it may bring a private action to effectuate compliance with the 
assurance. If the Secretary determines that he will be unable to issue a 
decision on a complaint or otherwise take appropriate action within the 
six month period, he may, based on priorities for the disposition of 
complaints that are established to promote the most effective use of 
enforcement resources, or on the request of the complainant, dismiss the 
complaint without a finding as to compliance prior to the end of the six 
month period, but no earlier than 45 days after the complaint is filed.
    (b) Enforcement. (1) If the Secretary finds, based on his 
investigation under paragraph (a) of this section, that a facility did 
not comply with the requirements of this subpart, he may take any action 
authorized by law to secure compliance, including but not limited to 
voluntary agreement or a request to the Attorney General to bring an 
action against the facility for specific performance.
    (2) If the Secretary finds, based on his investigation under 
paragraph (a) of this section, that a facility has limited the 
availability of its services in a manner proscribed by this subpart, he 
may, in addition to any other action that he is authorized to take in 
accordance with the Act, require the facility to establish an effective 
affirmative action plan that in his judgment is designed to insure that 
its services are made available in accordance with the requirements of 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 124.607  Agreements with State agencies.

    (a) Where the Secretary finds that it will promote the purposes of 
this subpart, and the State agency is able and willing to do so, he may 
enter into an agreement with the State agency for the State agency to 
assist him in administering this subpart in the State.
    (b) Under an agreement, the State agency will provide the Secretary 
with any assistance he requests in any one or more of the following 
areas, as set out in the agreement:
    (1) Investigation of complaints of noncompliance;
    (2) Monitoring the compliance of facilities with the requirements of 
this subpart;
    (3) Review of affirmative action plans submitted under 
Sec. 124.606(b);
    (4) Review of reports submitted under Sec. 124.605;
    (5) Making initial decisions for the Secretary with respect to 
compliance, subject to appeal by any party to the Secretary or review by 
the Secretary on his own initiative; and
    (6) Application of any sanctions available to it under State law 
(such as license revocation or termination of State assistance) against 
facilities determined to be out of compliance with the requirements of 
this subpart.
    (c) A State agency may use funds received under section 1525 of the 
Act to pay for expenses incurred in the course of carrying out this 
agreement.
    (d) Nothing in this subpart precludes any State from taking any 
action authorized by State law regarding the provision of services by 
any facility in the State as long as the action taken does not prevent 
the Secretary from enforcing the requirements of this subpart.

  Appendix to Subpart G--Interim Procedures and Criteria for Review by 
Health Systems Agencies of Applications Under Section 1625 of the Public 
                           Health Service Act

    In performing reviews under section 1513 (e) of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 3001-2(c)) of applications for grants under 
section 1625 of the Act, health systems agencies shall use the 
procedures and criteria stated below. A health systems agency may not 
conduct such reviews until the procedures and criteria to be used in 
conducting the reviews have been adopted by the agency and published in 
newspapers of general circulation within the health service area or 
other public information channels.

[[Page 650]]

                               procedures

    The procedures adopted and utilized by a health systems agency for 
conducting reviews of applications for grants under section 1625 of the 
Act shall include at least the following: 1. Except as provided below, 
notification of the beginning of a review within seven days of the 
receipt by the health systems agency of the application. Where the 
application was received by the health systems agency prior to 
publication of this subpart in the Federal Register, notification must 
be made within seven days of the date on which the health systems agency 
adopts its procedures and criteria. The notification shall include the 
proposed schedule for the review, the period within which a public 
hearing during the course of the review may be requested (which must be 
a reasonable period from the transmittal of the written notification 
required above), and the manner in which notification will be provided 
of the time and place of any hearings so requested. Written notification 
to members of the public may be provided through newspapers of general 
circulation in the area and public information channels. Notification to 
the applicant whose application is being reviewed and all other 
applicants for assistance under section 1625 of the Act providing health 
service in the health service area shall be by mail (which may be as 
part of a newsletter). The health systems agency must simultaneously 
notify the Federal funding agency of the beginning of the review.
    2. Schedules for reviews which provide that such reviews shall not 
exceed 60 days from the date of notification made in accordance with 
paragraph 1 of this section to the date of the written findings made in 
accordance with paragraph 4 of this section. This does not preclude a 
health systems agency from conducting its review in less than 60 days.
    3. Provision for applicants to submit to the health systems agency 
(in such form and manner as the agency shall require) such information 
as the agency deems necessary in order to conduct its review.
    4. Written findings which state the basis for the approval or 
disapproval of the application by the health systems agency. Such 
findings shall be sent to the applicant, the State health planning and 
development agency (or agencies), and the Secretary, and shall be 
available to other upon request.
    5. Access by the general public to all such applications reviewed by 
the health systems agency and to all other written materials pertinent 
to the agency review.
    6. Public hearings in the course of agency review, if requested by 
one or more persons directly affected by the review. For purposes of 
this paragraph, a ``person directly affected by the review'' is as 
defined in 42 CFR 122.306 (a)(7).

                                criteria

    The specific criteria adopted and utilized by a health systems of 
this agency to conduct reviews of applications for grants under section 
1625 of the Act shall include at least the following:
    1. The relationship of the health services of the facility to the 
applicable health systems plan and annual implementation plan.
    2. The relationship of the health services of the facility to the 
long-range development plan (if any) of the applicant.
    3. The need that the population served or to be served by the 
facility has for the health services of such facility.
    4. The availability of alternative, less costly, or more effective 
methods of providing the health services which the facility provides.
    5. The relationship of the health services provided by the facility 
to the existing health care system of the area.
    6. The availability of resources (including health manpower, 
management personnel, and funds for capital and operating needs) for the 
provision of services by the facility and the availability of 
alternative uses of such resources for the provision of other health 
services.
    7. The special needs and circumstances of those entities which 
provide a substantial portion of their services or resources, or both, 
to individuals not residing in the health service area in which the 
entities are located or in adjacent health service areas. Such entities 
may include medical and other health professions schools, 
multidisciplinary clinics, and other speciality centers.
    8. The special needs and circumstances of health maintenance 
organizations for which assistance may be provided under title XIII.
    9. The costs and methods of the proposed construction or 
modernization, including the costs and methods of energy provision.
    10. The probable impact of the project reviewed on the applicant's 
costs of providing health services.

    (a) If any facility is at any time within 20 years after the 
completion of the grant-assisted construction or modernization sold or 
transferred to any entity which is either not qualified for a grant 
under the statute pursuant to which the grant was awarded or not 
approved as a transferee by the State agency, the United States shall be 
entitled to recover on the basis of joint and several liability from any 
transferor, transferee, or successive transferee of the facility an 
amount determined in accordance with this subpart.
    (b) If any facility at any time within 20 years after the completion

<R05>
Sec. 124.704  Notification of sale, transfer, or change of use.

    (a) The transferor of a facility that is sold or transferred as 
described in Sec. 124.703(a), or the owner of a facility which ceases to 
be a public or other nonprofit facility as described in Sec. 124.703(b), 
shall provide the Secretary written notice of such sale, transfer, or

management responsibilities with respect to the facility which, in the 
Secretary's judgment, are so pervasive as to constitute operation of the 
facility. The manager will not be deemed to be the operator of the 
facility if the management agreement contains both of the following 
provisions:

    The Board of Directors of the facility retains authority to 
terminate the agreement at any time upon reasonable notice to the 
contractor.
    No employee of the contractor may be a member of the facility's 
Board of Directors.

In the absence of either of these provisions the Secretary will consider

contracts or other documents pertinent to the event giving rise to the 
notice;
    (3) Estimates of current assets, current liabilities, book value of 
equipment, the expected value of land on the new owner's books, and the 
remaining depreciation for all fixed assets involved in the transaction 
calculated on a straight line basis using commonly adopted expected 
useful lifetimes.
    (c) Failure to provide notice. Failure to provide the information 
required by paragraph (b) of this section, will be considered failure to 
provide the notice required by this section. In any case in which such 
information has not been provided, the Secretary will, promptly upon 
receiving an incomplete notice or otherwise discovering that a sale, 
transfer or other event giving rise to a recovery may have occurred, 
send a letter to the owner of the facility requesting the information 
needed to calculate a recovery amount.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0915-0099)


<R05>
Sec. 124.705  Amount of recovery.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 124.706, the amount that the United 
States shall be entitled to recover under this subpart is that amount 
bearing the same ratio to the then value of so much of the facility as 
constituted an approved project (or projects) as the amount of Federal 
participation bore to the cost of the construction or modernization 
under such project (or projects).
    (b) The then value of the facility will be based on:
    (1) The transaction value in the case of an arms-length sale or 
transfer, or
    (2) A depreciated reproduction value in the absence of an arms-
length sale or transfer or if the buyer fails to provide, within 60 days 
after the date of the Secretary's letter described in Sec. 124.704(c), 
the information which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is necessary to 
establish, adjust, and apportion a transaction value. As used in this 
section, ``transaction value'' means in the case of a sale, the sale 
price, and in the case of a lease, the value of the lease plus the 
residual value of the facility at the termination of the lease (i.e., 
the reproduction value or, if appropriate, an alternative use value).
    (c) The transaction value will be adjusted to account for the 
purchase or lease of other assets and the assumption of liabilities 
associated with the transaction. To determine the amount of Federal 
recovery, the adjusted value will be apportioned to the grant-aided 
assets by the ration of the remaining useful lifetime values of those 
assets to the sum of the remaining useful lifetime values of all assets 
not previously accounted for in adjusting the transaction value.
    (d) A depreciated reproduction value will be established by 
calculating a reproduction value using construction cost indexes or 
current costs per square foot for construction, depending on which is 
more relevant to the type of construction associated with the grant. 
This reproduction value will then be adjusted by the ratio of the 
remaining useful life to the total useful life for the assets involved.
    (e) In calculating the recovery amount, the Secretary will include 
as

[[Page 653]]

Federal participation any grant assistance received by the facility 
under an authority listed in Sec. 124.701 and any assistance 
supplementary to that assistance received for the construction or 
modernization of the facility under the Public Works and Economic 
Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121, et seq.) or the Local Public 
Works Capital Development Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-369).


<R05>
Sec. 124.706  Calculation of interest.

    (a) In addition to the amount of recovery calculated under 
Sec. 124.705, the United States shall be entitled to recover interest on 
such amount in accordance with this section at the rate determined by 
the Secretary based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 
ninety-day U.S. Treasury bill auction rate for the quarter previous to 
the quarter in which interest begins to accrue under this section.
    (1) Change of status before July 18, 1984. For facilities that were 
sold or transferred or which ceased to be public or other nonprofit 
facilities before July 18, 1984, interest will be charged beginning 
August 17, 1984, or 180 days after the date of such sale, transfer or 
other, whichever is later, and ending on the date the amount the United 
States is entitled to recover is collected.
    (2) Change of status after July 17, 1984. For facilities that are 
sold or transferred or which cease to be public or other nonprofit 
facilities after July 17, 1984, interest will be charged beginning 180 
days after receipt by the Department of the notice required under 
Sec. 124.704; Provided, That if such notice is not provided as 
prescribed, interest will be charged beginning on the date of the sale, 
transfer, or change of use, and ending on the date the amount which the 
United States is entitled to recover is collected.
    (b) The Secretary may waive interest charges that result from delays 
caused solely by the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 124.707  Waiver of recovery where facility is sold or transferred to a proprietary entity.

    (a) Conditions of the waiver. The Secretary may waive the recovery 
rights of the United States arising under Sec. 124.703(a) if the entity 
to which the facility was sold or transferred:
    (1) Has filed a written request for the waiver within the time 
limits prescribed by this section;
    (2) Has established an irrevocable trust in accordance with this 
section, in an amount equal to the greater of the amount that would 
otherwise have been recovered pursuant to Sec. 124.705 (including 
accrued interest as calculated under Sec. 124.706) or twice the cost of 
the remaining uncompensated services obligation of the facility as of 
the date of the change of status, that will be used by the entity only 
to provide services to those unable to pay in accordance with the 
requirements of subpart F of this part; and
    (3) Has agreed to comply with the community service regulations set 
out in subpart G of this part.
    (b) Procedures for obtaining waiver. (1) Within 30 days after the 
date of receipt of the information described in Sec. 124.704(b), the 
Secretary will send a letter to the new owner of the facility advising 
of the United States' right of recovery and the opportunity to obtain a 
waiver. For the purpose of advising the new owner of the amount to be 
placed in the irrevocable trust should the owner wish to obtain a 
waiver, the letter will also state the dollar amount of the remaining 
uncompensated care obligation and the amount that would be due under 
Sec. 124.705, computed as follows:
    (i) Computation of uncompensated care obligation. (A) For a facility 
which changes status before the date that subpart F of this part is 
effective for the facility, the remaining uncompensated services 
obligation is zero.
    (B) For a facility which changes status after the date that subpart 
F of this part is effective for the facility, the Secretary will 
multiply the annual compliance level, computed under the 10% method 
specified in 42 CFR 124.503(a)(1)(ii), for the fiscal year in which the 
change of status occurs times the number of years remaining in the 
facility's uncompensated services obligation. From this amount, the 
Secretary will subtract amounts of excess or add amounts of deficit for 
each fiscal year prior to the change of status for which the Secretary 
has previously

[[Page 654]]

conducted an audit of uncompensated services accounts. Excess and 
deficits will be adjusted by the percent change in the National Consumer 
Price Index for Medical Care between the year in which the excess or 
deficit occurred and the year in which the status change occurred. For 
each fiscal year prior to the change of status which the Secretary has 
not audited, the Secretary will add to the remaining obligation an 
amount equal to the annual compliance level in each such year adjusted 
by the percent change in the National Consumer Price Index for Medical 
Care between that year and the year of the status change. The amount 
computed as the total remaining obligation will then be multiplied by 
two. If the transferee chooses to accept the Secretary's calculation, no 
further assessments will be made of uncompensated care provided prior to 
the change of status date. If the transferee does not accept the 
calculation, the transferor or transferee may hire, and may charge 
against the irrevocable trust established under this section, an 
independent auditor to certify the compliance level and any excess or 
deficit for the period from May 18, 1979, up to and including the date 
of the change of status, using standard Departmental procedures 
supplemented with instructions provided by the Secretary, and submit the 
results in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The 
audit may be conducted for any years not included in a previous site 
assessment conducted by the Department. If the Secretary agrees that a 
change is appropriate, the Secretary will use this information to adjust 
the calculation as set out in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. If the 
independent auditor certifies that qualified care was rendered either at 
the facility or at a replacement facility operated by the transferee 
between the date of the change of status and the date of establishment 
of the trust, and the Secretary agrees, the post transfer level of care 
shall not affect the calculation of the total remaining uncompensated 
care obligation to be doubled, but instead shall be recognized as a 
credit to be drawn from the trust as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section. In the case of a facility with respect to which a grant 
was made under title XVI of the Act, the remaining period of obligation 
will be the remainder of the expected useful life of the facility, as 
follows: 40 years for buildings, 30 years for additions, 20 years for 
building renovations, 20 years for fixed equipment and 12 years for 
major movable equipment.
    (ii) Computation of recovery amount. The Secretary will determine 
the recovery amount as provided in Sec. 124.705.
    (2) Within 60 days following the date of the Secretary's letter 
provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner of the 
facility shall notify the Secretary in writing that it either:
    (i) Accepts the trust fund amount for the waiver as offered by the 
Secretary;
    (ii) Provides a detailed statement of an alternative determination 
of the recovery amount or an independent audit of the remaining 
uncompensated services obligation as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section; or
    (iii) Does not seek a waiver under Sec. 124.707. Failure to provide 
a timely response to the Secretary under this subparagraph will be 
considered an election not to seek the waiver.
    (3) Within 30 days following the receipt of the owner's views 
concerning the calculation, and after considering those views, the 
Secretary will send a final letter providing the Secretary's 
determination of twice the remaining uncompensated care obligation and 
the recovery amount under Sec. 124.705. The amount to be placed in the 
irrevocable trust will be the higher of those two figures. (See 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)
    (4) Within 30 days of the date of the final letter, the owner of the 
facility shall notify the Secretary in writing whether or not it accepts 
the terms of the waiver. Failure to provide timely notice to the 
Secretary under this subparagraph will be considered an election not to 
accept the waiver.
    (c) Establishment of the trust. (1) Within 60 days of the date of 
its acceptance of a waiver under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4) of this 
section, the owner shall begin delivering services to those unable to 
pay in accordance with subpart F of this part under an irrevocable

[[Page 655]]

trust established in the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section. Provided, That
    (i) The owner shall provide a copy of the trust documents to the 
Secretary and no trust shall be considered established until the trust 
documents have been approved by the Secretary; and
    (ii) The owner may credit against the trust any uncompensated 
services provided in accordance with subpart F of this part between the 
date of the change of status of the facility and the establishment of 
the trust. For an owner to receive the credit before the establishment 
of the trust and deposit of funds therein, the auditor's report covering 
the post-transfer period shall be submitted with the notification of 
acceptance of the waiver, and in any event, not later than 30 days from 
the date of the Secretary's final letter described in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section. Within 30 days following the receipt of the auditor's 
report, the Secretary will notify the owner of the allowable credit, if 
any. If the auditor's report is not timely submitted, the trust must be 
established and fully funded, in accordance with the time limits imposed 
by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the Secretary will notify the 
owner of the allowable credit, if any, within 30 days of the date of the 
establishment of the trust or within 30 days of the receipt of the 
report, whichever is later.
    (2) The trust shall be administered by a Trustee who is neither an 
employee of the transferee nor an employee of a subsidiary or of the 
parent institution of the transferee.
    (3) The trust shall provide that the trust corpus and income may be 
invested only in U.S. Government or U.S. Government insured securities.
    (d) Use of the trust. The corpus and income of the irrevocable trust 
shall be used to pay for the costs of uncompensated services, which may 
include reasonable costs of establishing and administering the trust and 
the cost of the independent audit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section, until the trust is exhausted.

<R05>
Sec. 124.708  Waiver of recovery--good cause for other use of facility.

    The Secretary may for good cause waive the recovery rights of the 
United States arising under Sec. 124.703(b). In determining whether 
there is good cause under this section for releasing the applicant or 
other owner of the facility from its obligation, the Secretary will take 
into consideration the extent to which:
    (a) The facility will be devoted by the applicant or other owner to 
use for another public or nonprofit purpose whch will promote the 
purpose of the Act;
    (b) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of the 
20-year period other public or nonprofit facilities not previously 
utilized for the purpose for which the facility was constructed will be 
so utilized and are substantially equivalent in nature and purpose.
    (c) The facility has been acquired from an agency of the United 
States (e.g., the Federal Housing Administration under its mortgage 
insurance commitment program) which has made a reasonable effort to 
dispose of it for operation as a public or nonprofit health care 
facility.

[51 FR 7939, Mar. 7, 1986, as amended at 57 FR 8272, Mar. 9, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 124.709  Withdrawal of waiver.

    (a) Any waiver granted under this subpart is conditioned upon the 
recipient of the waiver carrying out the obligations imposed by 
Sec. 124.707 or Sec. 124.708 as applicable.
    (b) The Secretary will monitor compliance with the community service 
and uncompensated care obligations of any entity that receives a waiver.
    (c) Should a recipient of a waiver fail to comply with the 
applicable conditions, the Secretary will withdraw the waiver and seek 
recovery based on the value of the facility on the date the right of 
recovery first arose under Sec. 124.703.
    (d) No waiver will be withdrawn until the recipient has been 
notified in writing by the Secretary of the noncompliance and has failed 
to take corrective action within 90 days after the date of such notice.

[[Page 656]]

    (e) Should the waiver be withdrawn, the amount of the Government's 
recovery will be the amount set out in the Secretary's determination 
letter as described in Sec. 124.707 (b)(1) or (b)(3) as applicable plus 
interest from the date of the notification sent in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section.
