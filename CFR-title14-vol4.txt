                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2006), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

        Subpart B_Certificate Terms, Conditions, and Limitations


<R05>

    Unless the certificate or the order authorizing its issuance shall 
otherwise provide, such terms, conditions and limitations as are set

<R05>
Sec. 201.7  General certificate conditions.

    (a) It shall be a condition upon the holding of a certificate that 
any intentional failure by the holder to comply with any provision of 
Statute or any order, rule, or regulation issued thereunder or any term, 
condition, or limitation of such certificate shall be a failure to 
comply with the terms, conditions, and limitations of the certificate 
within the meaning of section 41110 of the Statute even though the 
failure to comply occurred outside the territorial limits of the United 
States, except to the extent that such failure shall be necessitated by 
an obligation, duty, or liability imposed by a foreign country.
    (b) Failure to file the reports required by part 241, 291, or 298 of 
this chapter shall be sufficient grounds to revoke a certificate.
    (c) The authority to transport U.S. mail under a certificate is 
permissive, unless the Department, by order or rule, directs a carrier 
or class of carriers to transport mail on demand of the U.S. Postal 
Service; such certificate confers no right to receive subsidy, for the 
carriage of mail or otherwise.
    (d) An all-cargo air transportation certificate shall confer no 
right to carry passengers, other than cargo attendants accompanying a 
shipment, or to engage in any air transportation outside the 
geographical scope of interstate cargo transportation. Such certificate 
shall not, however, restrict the right of the holder to provide 
scheduled, charter, contract, or other transportation of cargo, by air, 
within that geographical scope.
    (e) It shall be a condition upon the holding of a certificate that 
the holder have and maintain in effect and on file with the Department a 
signed counterpart of Agreement 18900 (OST Form 4523), and a tariff (for 
those carriers otherwise generally required to file tariffs) that 
includes its terms, and that the holder comply with all other 
requirements of part 203. OST Form 4523 may be obtained from the Office 
of Aviation Analysis, Special Authorities Division.

    (c) Participation in the Montreal Agreement, whether by signing the 
Agreement, filing a signed counterpart to it under Sec. 203.3, or by

between the carrier and its passengers as a condition of carriage that a 
liability limit of not less than $75,000 (U.S.) shall apply under 
Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention for passenger injury and death. 
Such participation also constitutes a waiver of the defense under 
Article 20(1) of the Convention that the carrier was not negligent.

this subpart. Notwithstanding any failure to file that counterpart and 
such tariff, any such air carrier or foreign air carrier issued license 
authority (including exemptions) by the Department or operating in air

had in fact filed a properly executed counterpart to that Agreement and 
tariff.

Sec. 204.5  Certificated and commuter air carriers undergoing or 
proposing to undergo substantial change in operations, ownership, 
or management.

    (a) A certificated or commuter air carrier proposing a substantial 
change in operations, ownership or management shall file the data set 
forth in Sec. 204.3. These data must be submitted in cases where:
    (1) The proposed change requires new or amended authority, or
    (2) Although the carrier's existing certificate or commuter 
authority is adequate for the performance of its planned services, the 
change substantially alters the factors upon which its latest fitness 
finding is based.
    (b) Information which a carrier has previously formally filed with 
the Department, or with another Federal agency where they are available 
to the Department, which continues to reflect the current state of the 
carrier's fitness may be omitted. The carrier instead should identify 
the data and provide a citation for the date(s) and place(s) of filing. 
Prior to filing any data, the carrier may contact the Department (Air 
Carriers Fitness Division) to ascertain what data required by this 
section, if any, are already available to the Department or are not 
applicable to the substantial change in question and need not be 
included in the filing.
    (c) Information filings pursuant to this section made to support an 
application for new or amended certificate authority shall be filed with 
the application and addressed to the Documentary Services Division, 
Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20590. Information filed in support of a certificated or commuter air 
carrier's continuing fitness to operate under its existing authority in 
light of substantial changes in its operations, ownership or management 
shall be addressed to the Chief,

Sec. 204.6  Certificated and commuter air carriers proposing a change 
in operations, ownership, or management which is not substantial.

    Carriers proposing to make a change which would not substantially 
affect their operations, management, or ownership, such as certificated 
carriers applying for additional authority which would not substantially 
change their operations, will be presumed to be fit and need not file 
any information relating to their fitness at time of the change. 
However, if the Department concludes, from its own analysis or based on 
information submitted by third parties, that such change may bring the 
carrier's fitness into question, the Department may require the 
applicant carrier to file additional information.


<R05>
Sec. 204.7  Revocation for dormancy.

    (a) An air carrier that has not commenced any type of air 
transportation operations for which it was found fit, willing, and able 
within one year of the date of that finding, or an air carrier that, for 
any period of one year after the date of such a finding, has not 
provided any type of air transportation for which that kind of finding 
is required, is deemed no longer to continue to be fit to provide the 
air transportation for which it was found fit and, accordingly, its 
authority to provide such air transportation shall be revoked.
    (b) An air carrier found fit which commences operations within one 
year after being found fit but then ceases operations, shall not resume 
operations without first filing all of the data required by Sec. 204.3 
at least 45 days before it intends to provide any such air 
transportation. Such filings shall be addressed to the Documentary 
Services Division, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, 
SW., Washington, DC 20590. The Department will entertain requests for 
exemption from this 45-day advance filing requirement for good cause 
shown. If there has been no change in fitness data previously formally 
filed with the Department, the carrier shall file a sworn statement to 
that effect signed by one of its officers. The carrier may contact the 
Department (Air Carrier Fitness Division) to ascertain which data are 
already available to the Department and need not be refiled. A carrier 
to which this paragraph applies shall not provide any air transportation 
for which it is required to be found fit, willing, and able until the 
Department decides that the carrier continues to be fit, willing, and 
able to perform such air transportation. During the pendency of the 
Department's consideration of a data submission under this paragraph, 
the expiration period set out in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
stayed. If the decision or finding by the Department on the issue of the 
carrier's fitness is favorable, the date or that decision or finding 
shall be the date considered in applying paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the date of a Department decision 
or finding shall be the service date of the Department's order 
containing such decision or finding, or, in cases where the Department's 
decision or finding is made by letter, the date of such letter.
    (d) For purposes of this section, references to operations and to 
the providing of air transportation shall refer only to the actual 
performance of flight operations under an operating certificate issued 
to the carrier by the FAA.

<R05>
Sec. 205.3  Basic requirements.

    (a) A U.S. or foreign direct air carrier shall not engage in air 
transportation unless it has in effect aircraft accident liability 
insurance coverage that meets the requirements of this part for its air 
carrier or foreign air carrier operations. The minimum amounts of 
coverage required by this part may be provided either by insurance 
policies or by self-insurance plans. The currently effective policy of 
insurance or complete plan for self-insurance shall be available for 
inspection by the Department at the carrier's principal place of 
business. The current certificate of insurance or a summary of the 
complete self-insurance plan on file with the Department, as required by 
Sec. 205.4, shall be available for public inspection at the carrier's 
principal place of business.
    (b) For purposes of this part, a certificate of insurance is one or 
more certificates showing insurance by one or more insurers (excluding 
reinsurers) of currently effective and properly endorsed policies of 
aircraft accident liability insurance in compliance with this part. When 
more than one such insurer is providing coverage, the limits and types 
of liability assumed by each insurer (excluding reinsurers) shall be 
clearly stated in the certificate of insurance. Insurance policies and 
self-insurance plans named in a certificate of insurance that 
accompanies an application for initial registration or for operating 
authority shall become effective not later than the proposed starting 
date for air carrier operations as shown in the application.
    (c) The certificate of insurance shall list the types or classes of 
aircraft, or the specific aircraft by FAA or foreign government 
registration number, with respect to which the policy of insurance 
applies, or shall state that the policy applies to all aircraft owned or 
operated by the carrier in its air transportation operations. With 
respect to certificates of insurance that list aircraft by government 
registration number, the policy or self-insurance plan shall state that, 
while an aircraft owned or leased by the carrier and declared in the 
policy is withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, or 
servicing, such insurance as is provided by the policy or plan for that 
aircraft shall apply also to another aircraft of similar type, 
horsepower, and seating capacity, whether or not owned by the insured, 
while temporarily used as a substitute aircraft.
    (d) Each certificate of insurance shall be signed by an authorized 
officer, agent, or other representative of the insurer or the insurance 
broker.
    (e) Insurance coverage to meet the requirements of this part shall 
be obtained from one or more of the following:
    (1) An insurer licensed to issue aircraft accident liability 
policies in any State, Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States, 
or in the District of Columbia;
    (2) Surplus line insurers named on a current list of such insurers 
issued and approved by the insurance regulatory authority of any State, 
Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States or of the District of 
Columbia; or
    (3) Insurers licensed or approved by a foreign government.

receipt if the certificate or plan does not meet the requirements of 
this part. Certificates of Insurance shall be filed on OST Form 6410 for 
U.S. air carriers, including commuter air carriers and air taxi 
operators, and OST Form 6411 for foreign air carriers, including 
Canadian air taxi operators. The Department may return the certificate 
or self-insurance plan to the carrier if it finds for good cause that 
such certificate or plan does not show adequate evidence of insurance 
coverage under this part. Forms may be obtained from and should be filed 
with the Department at the addresses specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section. Forms may also be obtained on the Internet at http://
ostpxweb.dot.gov.
    (b) If the coverage is by type or class of aircraft or by specific 
aircraft, endorsements that add previously unlisted aircraft or aircraft 
types or classes to coverage, or that delete listed aircraft, types, or 
classes from coverage, shall be filed with the Department at the 
addresses specified in paragraph (c) of this section not more than 30 
days after the effective date of the endorsements. Aircraft shall not be 
listed in the carrier's operations specifications with the FAA and shall 
not be operated unless liability insurance coverage is in force.
    (c) Certificates of insurance and endorsements required in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be submitted to the 
Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Program 
Management Branch, AFS-260, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC

required total passenger coverages stipulated in paragraph (b) of this 
section for U.S. and foreign direct air carriers and commuter carriers, 
paragraph (c) of this section for U.S. air taxi operators, or paragraph 
(d) of this section for Canadian charter air taxi operators.\1\ The 
single-limit liability policy for the required aircraft accident 
liability coverage may be provided by a single policy or by a 
combination of primary and excess policies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ For example: the minimum single limit of liability acceptable 
for any aircraft in air taxi passenger service with 16 passenger seats 
would be computed on the basis of limits set forth in paragraph (c) as 
follows: 16 x .75 equals 12; 12 x $75,000 equals $900,000; $900,000 plus 
$300,000 (nonpassenger liability per occurrence) plus $100,000 (property 
damage per occurrence) equals $1,300,000. The latter amount is the 
minimum in which a single-limit liability policy may be written.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) The liability coverage shall not be contingent upon the 
financial condition, solvency, or freedom from bankruptcy of the 
carrier. The limits of the liability for the amounts required by this 
part shall apply separately to each occurrence. Any payment made under 
the policy or plan because of any one occurrence shall not reduce the 
coverage for payment of other damages resulting from any other 
occurrence.

<R05>
Sec. 205.6  Prohibited exclusions of coverage.

    (a) No warranty or exclusion in the policy or plan or in any 
endorsement or amendment to the policy or plan, nor any violation of the 
policy or plan by the carrier, shall remove the liability coverage 
required by this part, except as specifically approved by the 
Department. This requirement shall not limit the right of insurers to 
recover from the carrier for amounts paid.
    (b) A policy of insurance or a self-insurance plan required by this 
part shall not contain the following exclusions:
    (1) Violation of any safety-related requirement imposed by statute 
or by rule of a government agency.
    (2) Liability assumed by the carrier under an agreement to raise the 
liability limitations of the Warsaw Convention by signing a counterpart 
to the agreement of carriers (such as the Montreal Agreement, 18900, as 
approved by Board Order E-23680, May 13, 1966, agreeing to a limit on 
the carrier's liability for injury or death of passengers of $75,000 per 
passenger), or any amendment to such agreement that may be approved by 
the Department and to which the carrier becomes a party.

<R05>
Sec. 205.7  Cancellation, withdrawal, modification, expiration, or 
replacement of insurance coverage.

    (a) Each policy of aircraft accident liability insurance and plan 
for self insurance shall specify that it shall remain in force, and may 
not be replaced, canceled, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce 
the minimum standards set forth in this part, or to change the extent of 
coverage, by the insurer or the carrier, nor expire by its own terms, in 
regard to coverage for the carrier in its common carrier operations in 
air transportation, until 10 days after written notice by the insurer 
(in the event of replacement, by the retiring insurer), or by the 
insurer's representative, or by the carrier, describing the change, to 
the Department at the addresses specified in Sec. 205.4(c), which 10-
day notice period shall start to run from the date such notice is 
actually received at the Department. For purposes of this part, a policy 
will not be considered to have expired if the same insurer renews its 
coverage without reduction in the extent of coverage or amounts of 
coverage, and without a break in coverage, whether or not a new policy 
is issued, and notice to the Department is not required in that event. 
If the coverage being changed is by type or class of aircraft or by 
specific aircraft, endorsements adding or deleting specific aircraft or 
types or classes of aircraft, for which prior notice would be required 
by this paragraph, shall be filed in accordance with Sec. 205.4(b), and 
prior notice of the change need not be given under this paragraph.
    (b) The requirements of this section shall not apply if the policy 
contains a lesser time period for cancellation in a war risk exclusion. 
If the war risk exclusion is activated by the insurer, the insurer or 
its representative shall immediately notify the Department.

<R05>
Sec. 205.8  Cargo liability disclosure statement.

    Every direct U.S. or foreign air carrier providing air cargo service 
in air transportation shall give notice in writing to the shipper, when 
a shipment is accepted, of the existence or absence of cargo liability 
insurance, and the limits on the extent of its liability, if any. The 
notice shall be clearly and conspicuously included on or attached to all 
of its rate sheets and airwaybills.

Article IX of the Federal Programs and Services Agreement, implementing 
section 221(a)(5) of the Compact of Free Association between the United

this part, documentation clearly establishing:
    (a) That the carrier is organized under the laws of the Federated 
States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau or the United States;

are held by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall 
Islands, Palau and/or the United States;

<R05>
Sec. 211.32  Issuance of permit.

    If the Department is satisfied that the applicant meets the 
requirements of Sec. 211.31 (a) through (e), and that grant of all or 
part of the requested authority would otherwise be in the public 
interest, the Department may, subject to Presidential review under 
section 801(a) of the Federal Aviation Act, issue a ``Freely Associated 
State Foreign Air Carrier Permit'' to the applicant, including such 
terms, conditions or limitations as the Department may find to be in the 
public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 211.33  Interstate and interstate authority.

    (a) An application under this subpart may include a request, in 
addition to other foreign air transportation, for authority to engage in 
interstate air transportation between Guam, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands and Honolulu, Hawaii, and interstate air 
transportation within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. 
A request for all or part of such limited interstate air transportation 
authority shall be supported by documentation establishing:
    (1) The impact of such interstate air transportation services on the 
economic projections of the carrier's proposed operations;
    (2) The need for such proposed interstate air transportation by the 
affected U.S. points;
    (3) The economic impact of such interstate air transportation on

within the scope of part 272 of this chapter.
    (b) The Department may grant a Freely Associated State Air Carrier 
authority to engage in all or part of the interstate air transportation 
requested in paragraph (a) of this section provided that the Department 
finds:
    (1) That grant of such interstate air transportation authority would 
be in furtherance of the objectives of the Compact of Free Association 
and related agreements between the United States and the Freely 
Associated States, and would otherwise be in the public interest; and
    (2) That grant of such interstate air transportation authority would 
not significantly impair the economic viability of existing services 
providing essential air transportation to any eligible Freely Associated 
State point within the scope of part 272 of this chapter,

[[Page 29]]

or significantly increase compensation that may be required to maintain 
any such essential air transportation.
    (c) The Department may, at any time, subject to Presidential review 
under section 41307, suspend, modify, or revoke such interstate 
authority if it concludes that the requirements specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section are not then being met.

of the Department to issue a foreign air carrier permit, other than a 
Freely Associated State Foreign Air Carrier Permit, to a carrier owned 
or controlled, in whole or in part, by citizens of the Federated States 
of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, that does not meet the 
requirements of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 211.35  Termination of eligibility.

    The eligibility of a carrier owned or controlled, in whole or in 
part, by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall 
Islands or Palau, respectively, for issuance of a Freely Associated 
State Foreign Air Carrier Permit under this subpart shall exist only for 
such period as subparagraphs (a), (d), and (e) (eligibility for Freely 
Associated State essential air transportation subsidy compensation), or 
subparagraph (c) (limited interstate air transportation authority), of 
paragraph (5) of the Agreement on Civil Aviation Economic Services and 
Related Programs (Article IX of the Federal Programs and Services

the Government of the United States, insofar as authority is conferred 
by such permits for purposes specified in those subparagraphs.

(or on the main deck or in the belly of passenger charter flights), 
subject to the requirements of this chapter and any orders of, or 
specific conditions imposed by, the Department.
    (b) Charter flights may be operated on a round-trip or one-way 
basis, with no minimum group, shipment, or contract size.
    (c) Contracts to perform charter flights must be in writing and

air carrier and the charterer prior to the operation of the flights 
involved. The written agreement shall include:
    (i) The name and address of either the surety whose bond secures 
advance charter payments received by the carrier, or of the carrier's 
depository bank to which checks or money orders for the advance charter 
payments are to be made payable as escrow holder pending completion of 
the charter trip; and
    (2) A statement that unless the charterer files a claim with the 
carrier, or, if the carrier is unavailable, with the surety, within 60 
days after the cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the 
charterer's advance payments are secured by the bond, the surety shall 
be released from all liability under the bond to such charterer for such 
trips.
    (d) A certificated or foreign air carrier must make a reasonable 
effort to

[[Page 31]]

verify that any charterer with which it contracts, and any charter it 
conducts, meets the applicable requirements of this chapter.
    (e) The certificated or foreign air carriers shall require full 
payment of the total charter price, including payment for the return 
portion of a round trip, or the posting of a satisfactory bond for full 
payment, prior to the commencement of any portion of the air

require full payment of the total charter price, including payment for 
the return portion of a round trip, from the charterers not less than 10 
days prior to the commencement of any portion of the transportation, and 
such payment shall not be refundable unless the charter is canceled by 
the carrier or unless the carrier accepts a substitute charterer for one 
which has canceled a charter, in which case the amount paid by the 
latter shall be refunded. For the purpose of this section, payment to 
the carrier's depository bank, as designated in the charter contract, 
shall be deemed payment to the carrier.
    (f) A certificated or foreign air carrier operating a U.S.-
originating passenger charter shall be responsible to return to his or 
her point of origin any passenger who purchased round trip 
transportation on that charter and who was transported by that carrier

authorization under paragraph (e) of that section, neither it, not any 
charter operator, or any other person shall advertise or sell any 
passenger charter services except those that have been specifically 
authorized by the Department.

operations would result in a substantial change in the scope of its 
operations within the meaning of part 204 of this chapter.

expeditiously moving to an emergency exit for evacuation of an aircraft.
    (k) A certificated air carrier holding a certificate to conduct only 
cargo operations may not conduct passenger charters.
    (l) A certificated air carrier may not perform any charter in 
interstate commerce within the State of Alaska.
    (m) A foreign air carrier may operate charters in foreign air 
transportation only to the extent authorized by its foreign air carrier

whose business is the formation of groups for transportation or 
solicitation or sale of transportation services, for the purpose of 
providing air transportation to its members and their immediate 
families.
    (b) The charter must be organized by the organization itself, or by 
a person or company who acts not as a principal, but as an agent for the 
chartering organization or the certificated or foreign air carrier.
    (c) No solicitation, sales, or participation may take place beyond 
the bona fide members of an eligible chartering organization, and their 
immediate families (spouse, children, and parents). All printed 
solicitation materials shall contain the following notice in boldface, 
10-point or larger type--
    Some of the Federal rules that protect against tour changes and loss 
of passengers' money in publicly sold charters do not apply to this 
charter flight.
    (d) ``Bona fide members'' are members of an organization who: Have 
not joined the organization merely to travel on a charter flight; and

provided, that the ``six month'' rule does not apply to:
    (1) Employees of a single commercial establishment, industrial 
plant, or government agency, or
    (2) Students and employees of a single school.
    (e) The charter price due the direct air carrier shall be prorated

of any state, territory or possession of the United States, or by a 
foreign government, or

casino, hotel, or cruise line.
    (b) The casino, hotel, or cruise line or its agents, may not require 
a passenger to incur any expense in taking the trip, provided, that this 
provision shall not preclude the casino, hotel, or cruise line or its 
agents, from requiring prospective passengers to pay nominal reservation 
fees that are duly refundable by the casino, hotel, or cruise line 
before the flight, establish a minimum line-of-credit at the casino, 
hotel, or cruise line, bring (but not necessarily spend) a specified

a fee.


<R05>

    (2) A depository agreement shall comply with Sec. 380.34a (d) and 
(f);
    (3) A security agreement shall comply with Sec. 380.34 (c) and (d); 
and
    (i) If no depository agreement is used, protect charter participant 
payments (including those for ground accommodations and services) and 
assure the certificated or foreign air carrier's contractual and 
regulatory responsibilities to charter participants in an unlimited 
amount (except that the liability of the securer with respect to any 
charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on 
behalf of such participant);
    (ii) If used in combination with a depository agreement, protect 
charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations 
and services) and assure the certificated or foreign air carrier's 
contractual and regulatory responsibilities to charter participants in 
the amount of at least $10,000 times the number of flights, except that 
the amount need not be more than $200,000. The liability of the securer 
with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter 
price paid by or on behalf of such participant.
    (c) The Department reserves the right to limit or prohibit the 
operation of direct sales Public Charters by a foreign air carrier upon

payment in connection with any such charter trip, unless there is on 
file with the Department a copy of a currently effective agreement made 
between said carrier and a designated bank, by the terms of which all 
sums payable in advance to the carrier by charterers, in connection with 
any such trip to be performed by said carrier, shall be deposited with 
and maintained by the bank, as escrow holder, the agreement to be 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The charterer (or its agent) shall pay the carrier either by 
check or money order made payable to the depository bank. Such check or 
money order and any cash received by the carrier from a charterer (or 
its agent) shall be deposited in, or mailed to, the bank no later than 
the close of the business day following the receipt of the check or 
money order or the cash, along with a statement showing the name and 
address of the charterer (or its agent); provided, however, that where 
the charter transportation to be performed by a carrier is sold through 
a travel agent, the agent may be authorized by the carrier to deduct its 
commission and remit the balance of the advance payment to the carrier 
either by check or money order made payable to the designated bank.
    (2) The bank shall pay over to the carrier escrowed funds with 
respect to a specific charter only after the carrier has certified in 
writing to the bank that such charter has been completed; provided, 
however, that the bank may be required by the terms of the agreement to 
pay over to the carrier a specified portion of such escrowed funds, as 
payment for the performance of the outbound segment of a round-trip 
charter upon the carrier's written certification that such segment has 
been so completed.
    (3) Refunds to a charterer from sums in the escrow account shall be 
paid directly to such charterer its assigns. Upon written certification 
from the carrier that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall turn 
over directly to the charterer or its assigns all escrowed sums (less 
any cancellation penalties as provided in the charter contract) which 
the bank holds with respect to such canceled charter, provided however, 
that in the case of a split charter escrowed funds shall be turned over 
to a charterer or its assigns only if the carrier's written 
certification of cancellation of such charter includes a specific 
representation

[[Page 34]]

that either the charter has been canceled by the carrier or, if the 
charter has been canceled by the charterer, that the carrier has 
accepted a substitute charterer.
    (4) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter 
flight.
    (5) As used in this section the term ``bank'' means a bank insured 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
    (b) The escrow agreement required under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall not be effective until approved by the Department. Claims 
against the escrow may be made only with respect to the non-performance 
of air transportation.
    (c) The carrier may elect, in lieu of furnishing an escrow agreement 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to furnish and file with the 
Department a surety bond with guarantees to the United States Government 
the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) 
originating in the United States and of all overseas military personnel 
charter trips, as defined in part 372 of this chapter, to be performed, 
in whole or in part, by such carrier pursuant to any contracts entered 
into by such carrier. The amount of such bond shall be unlimited.\1\ 
Claims under the bond may be made only with respect to the non-
performance of air transportation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While the face amount of the bond is unlimited, claims are 
limited to amounts that are paid to carrier for U.S.-originating 
passenger charter flights that carrier fails to perform or to refund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) The bond permitted by this section shall be in the form set 
forth as the appendix to this part. Such bond shall be issued by a 
bonding or surety company--
    (1) Which is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty) 
with a general policyholders' rating of ``A'' or better or
    (2) Which is listed in the U.S. Department of Treasury's notice 
listing companies holding Certificates of Authority as acceptable 
sureties on Federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies, 
published in the Federal Register on or about July 1. The bonding or 
surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that 
type in the State in which there is located the office or usual 
residence of the agency designated by the carrier under 49 U.S.C. 46103 
to receive service of notices, process and other documents issued by or 
filed with the Department of Transportation. For the purposes of this 
section the term ``State'' includes any territory or possession of the 
United States, or the District of Columbia. If the bond does not comply 
with the requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to 
provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the 
Department will notify the certificated or foreign air carrier by 
registered or certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond. 
Unless such deficiencies are corrected within the time limit set forth 
in the notification, no amounts payable in advance by customers for the 
subject charter trips shall be accepted by the carrier.
    (e) The bond required by this section shall provide that unless the 
charterer files a claim with the carrier, or, if the carrier is 
unavailable, with the surety, within 60 days after cancellation of a 
charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are 
secured by the bond, the surety shall be released from all liability 
under the bond to such charterer for such charter trip. The contract 
between the carrier and the charterer shall contain notice of this 
provision.

Sec. 212.9  Prior authorization requirements.

    (a) Certificated air carriers shall obtain a statement of 
authorization for each long-term wet lease to a foreign air carrier.
    (b) Foreign air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization 
for each:
    (1) Fifth freedom charter flight to or from the United States;
    (2) Long-term wet lease;
    (3) Charter flight for which the Department specifically requires 
prior authorization under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section; or
    (4) Part charter.
    (c) The Department may issue blanket statements of authorization to 
foreign air carriers to conduct fifth freedom charters. The standards 
for issuing such blanket authorizations

[[Page 35]]

shall be those stated in Sec. 212.11. The Department may revoke any 
authority granted under this paragraph at any time without hearing.
    (d) The Department may at any time, with or without hearing, but 
with at least 30 days' notice, require a foreign air carrier to obtain a 
statement of authorization before operating any charter flight. In 
deciding whether to impose such a requirement, the Department will 
consider (but not be limited to considering) whether the country of the 
carrier's nationality:
    (1) Requires prior approval for third or fourth freedom charter 
flights by U.S. air carriers;
    (2) Has, over the objection of the U.S. Government, denied rights of 
a U.S. air carrier guaranteed by a bilateral agreement; or
    (3) Has otherwise impaired, limited, or denied the operating rights 
of U.S. air carriers, or engaged in unfair, discriminatory, or 
restrictive practices with respect to air transportation services to, 
from, through, or over its territory.
    (e) The Department, in the interest of national security, may 
require a foreign air carrier to provide prior notification or to obtain 
a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight over 
U.S. territory.


<R05>
Sec. 212.10  Application for statement of authorization.

    (a) Application for a statement of authorization shall be submitted

    (c)(1) Applicants for statements of authorization filed by foreign 
air carriers shall include documentation to establish the extent to 
which the country of the applicant's nationality deals with U.S. air 
carriers on the basis of reciprocity for similar flights, if such 
flights are not subject to a bilateral agreement, and

reciprocity;
    (ii) The Department has found reciprocity defective in the most 
recent prior approval application involving the country; or
    (iii) Changes in reciprocity have occurred since the most recent 
Department finding for the country in question.
    (2) Applications filed by certificated or foreign air carriers to 
conduct long-term wet leases shall include, for the country of the 
lessee's nationality, the documentation specified in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section.
    (d)(1) Applications shall be filed at least 5 business days before

    (2) Applications for a part charter or for a long-term wet lease 
shall be filed

[[Page 36]]

at least 45 calendar days before the date of the first proposed flight.
    (3) Applications specifically required under Sec. 212.9(d) shall be 
filed at least 30 calendar days before the proposed flight or flights 
(10 calendar days for cargo charters), unless otherwise specified by the 
Department.
    (4) Applications required by a Department order under Sec. 212.9(e) 
shall be filed at least 14 calendar days before the proposed flight or 
flights, unless otherwise specified by the Department.

this part and/or order of the Department, only one application need be 
filed, but it must conform to the earliest applicable filing deadline.
    (6) The Department may require service of applications as it deems 
necessary.
    (e)(1) Any part in interest may file a memorandum supporting or 
opposing an application. Three copies of each memorandum shall be filed 
within 7 business days after service of the application or before the 
date of the proposed flight or flights, whichever is earlier. 
Memorandums will be considered to the extent practicable; the Department 
may act on an application without waiting for supporting or opposing 
memorandums to be filed.
    (2) Each memorandum shall set forth the reasons why the application 
should be granted or denied, accompanied by whatever data, including 
affidavits, the Department is requested to consider.
    (3) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the certified or 
foreign air carrier applying for approval.
    (f)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Department, each application 
and memorandum filed in response will be available for public inspection 
at the Office of International Aviation immediately upon filing. Such 
information with respect to codeshare applications and responsive 
pleadings will be available for public inspection at DOT Dockets or at 
the DOT Dockets website. Notice of the filing of all applications shall 
be published in the Department's Weekly List of Applications Filed.
    (2) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in 
an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in 
writing. If the Department finds that disclosure of all or part of the 
information would adversely affect the objecting person, and that the 
public interest does not require disclosure, it will order that the 
injurious information be withheld.

[Docket No. OST-97-2356, 63 FR 28236, May 22, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 
3213, Jan. 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 212.11  Issuance of statement of authorization.

    (a) The Department will issue a statement of authorization if it 
finds that the proposed charter flight, part charter, or wet lease meets 
the requirements of this part and that it is in the public interest. 
Statements of authorization may be conditioned or limited.
    (b) In determining the public interest the Department will consider 
(but not be limited to) the following factors:
    (1) The extent to which the authority sought to covered by and 
consistent with bilateral agreements to which the United States is a 
party.
    (2) The extent to which an applicant foreign air carrier's home 
country (and, in the case of a long-term wet lease, the lessee's home 
country) deals with U.S. air carriers on the basis of substantial 
reciprocity.
    (3) Whether the applicant or its agent has previously violated the 
provisions of this part.
    (4) Where the application concerns a long-term wet lease:
    (i) Whether the lessor (applicant) or its agent or the lessee 
(charterer) or its agent has previously violated the provisions of the 
Department's charter regulations.
    (ii) Whether, because of the nature of the arrangement and the 
benefits involved, the authority sought should be the subject of a 
bilateral agreement.
    (iii) To what extent the lessor owns and/or controls the lessee, or 
is owned and/or controlled by the lessee.
    (c) The Department will submit any denial of an authorization 
specifically required of a foreign air carrier under Sec. 212.9(d) to 
the President of the United States at least 10 days before the proposed 
departure. The denial will be subject to stay or disapproval by the

[[Page 37]]

President within 10 days after it is submitted. A shorter period for 
Presidential review may be specified by the Department where the 
application for authorization is not timely or properly filed. Denial of 
a late-filed application need not be submitted to the President. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, an application filed by a foreign air 
carrier under Sec. 212.9(d) to conduct a cargo charter will be 
considered as timely filed only if it is filed at least 30 calendar days 
before the proposed flight, notwithstanding the 10-day filing 
requirement for cargo charters in Sec. 212.10(d)(3).
    (d) The Department will publish notice of its actions on 
applications for statements of authorization in its Weekly List of 
Applications Filed. Interested persons may upon request obtain copies of 
letters of endorsed forms advising applicants of action taken on their 
applications.


<R05>
Sec. 212.12  Waiver.

    The Department may grant a waiver of any of the provisions of this 
part upon a finding that such waiver is in the public interest. A 
certificated or foreign air carrier may request a waiver by filing a 
written application with the Department, citing the specific provision 
to be waived and providing justification for such waiver.

  Appendix A to Part 212--Certificated or Foreign Air Carrier's Surety 
      Bond Under Part 212 of the Regulations of the Department of 
                    Transportation (14 CFR Part 212)

    Know all persons by these presents, that we -------------------- 
(Name of certificated or foreign air carrier) of --------------------, 
(City) -------------------- (State or Country) as Principal (hereinafter 
called Principal), and -------------------- (name of Surety) a 
corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of --------
-------- (State) as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and 
firmly bound unto the United States of America in an unlimited amount, 
as required by 14 CFR 212.8, for which payment, well and truly to be 
made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, 
successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these 
presents.
    Whereas the principal, a certificated air carrier holding a 
certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under 49 U.S.C. 
41102, or a foreign air carrier holding a foreign air carrier permit 
issued under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 
40109 authorizing that foreign air carrier to engage in charter trips in 
foreign air transportation, is subject to rules and regulations of the 
Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of 
charterers of civil aircraft and has elected to file with the Department 
of Transportation such a bond as will guarantee to the United States 
Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo 
charter trips) originating in the United States and of all Overseas 
Military Personnel Charters, as defined in 14 CFR part 372, to be 
performed, in whole or in part, by such certificated or foreign air 
carrier pursuant to contracts entered into by such carrier after the 
execution date of this bond, and
    Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal 
with rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating 
to security for the protection of charterer of civil aircraft for 
charter trips (other than cargo charters) originating in the United 
States or of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips and shall inure 
to the benefit of any and all such charterers to whom the Principal may 
be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.
    Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the 
Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to such charterer any sum or 
sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the 
Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill, and carry out all 
contracts made by the Principal while this bond is in effect for the 
performance of charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) 
originating in the United States and of Overseas Military Personnel 
Charter trips, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain 
in full force and effect.
    The liability of the Surety shall not be discharged by any payment 
or succession of payments hereunder in any specified amount. The surety 
agrees to furnish written notice to the Department of Transportation 
forthwith of all suits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made by 
said Surety under this bond.
    This bond is effective the ------ day of ----------------, --------, 
12:01 a.m., standard time at the address of the Principal as stated 
herein and shall continue in force until terminated as hereinafter 
provided. The Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this 
bond by written notice to the Department of Transportation at its office 
in Washington, D.C., such termination to become effective thirty (30) 
days after actual receipt of said notice by the Department. The Surety 
shall not be liable hereunder for

[[Page 38]]

the payment of the damages hereinbefore described which arise as the 
result of any contracts for the performance of air transportation 
services made by the Principal after the termination of this bond 
becomes effective, as herein provided, but such termination shall not 
affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for the payment of any such 
damages arising as the result of contracts for the performance of air 
transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of 
this bond becomes effective. Liability of the Surety under this bond 
shall in all events be limited only to a charterer who shall within 
sixty (60) days after the cancellation of a charter trip with respect to 
which the charterer's advance payments are secured by this bond give 
written notice of claim to the certificated or foreign air carrier, or, 
if it is unavailable, to the Surety, and all liability on this bond for 
such charter trip shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after 
the termination date thereof except for claims filed within the time 
provided herein.
    In witness whereof, the said Principal and Surety have executed this 
instrument on the ------ day of ----------------, --------.

<R05>
Sec. 213.3  Filing and approval of schedules.

    (a) In the absence of provisions to the contrary in the permit and 
of Department action pursuant to this section, a foreign air carrier may 
determine the schedules (including type of equipment used) pursuant to 
which it engages in transportation between points in the United States 
and points outside thereof.
    (b) In the case of a foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air 
transportation which is not the subject of an air transport agreement 
between the United States and the government of the holder, the 
Department, if it finds that the public interest so requires, may with 
or without hearing order the foreign air carrier to file with it within 
7 days after service of such order, an original and three copies of any 
or all of its existing schedules of service between any point in the 
United States and any point outside thereof, and may require such 
carrier thereafter to file an original and three copies of any proposed 
schedules of service between such points at least 30 days prior to the 
date of inauguration of such service. Such schedules shall contain all 
schedules of aircraft which are or will be operated by such carrier 
between each pair of points set forth in the order, the type of 
equipment used or to be used, the time of arrival and departure at each 
point, the frequency of each schedule, and the effective date of any 
proposed schedule.
    (c) In the case of any foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air 
transportation which is the subject of an air transport agreement 
between the United States and the government of the holder, the 
Department may with or without hearing issue an order, similar to that 
provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, if it makes the findings 
provided for in that subsection and, in addition, finds that the 
government or aeronautical authorities of the government of the holder, 
over the objections of the U.S. Government, have: (1) Taken action which 
impairs, limits, terminates, or denies operating rights, or (2) 
otherwise denied or failed to prevent the denial of, in whole or in 
part, the fair and equal opportunity to exercise the operating rights, 
provided for in such air transport agreement, of any U.S. air carrier 
designated thereunder with respect to flight operations to, from, 
through, or over the territory of such foreign government.
    (d) The carrier may continue to operate existing schedules, and may 
inaugurate operations under proposed schedules 30 days after the filing 
of such schedules with the Department, unless the Department with or 
without hearing issues an order, subject to stay or disapproval by the 
President of the United States within 10 days after adoption, notifying 
the carrier that such operations, or any part of them, may be contrary 
to applicable law or may adversely affect the public interest. If the 
notification pertains to a proposed schedule, service under such 
schedule shall not be inaugurated; if the notification pertains to 
existing schedules, service under such schedules shall be discontinued 
on the date specified in the Department's order. Such date shall be not 
less than ten days after adoption of the Department's order unless 
affirmative Presidential approval is obtained at an earlier date.
    (e) No petitions for reconsideration may be filed with respect to 
Department orders issued pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this 
section. Nevertheless, if the Department serves a notification under 
paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier may make application to the 
Department for approval of any or all existing or proposed schedules, 
pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 213.5. The Department may with or 
without hearing withdraw, in whole or in part, its notification at any 
time and may permit existing or proposed schedules to be operated for 
such period or periods as the Department may determine.
    (f) The date of service on a foreign air carrier of orders and 
notifications pursuant to this section shall be the date of mailing 
thereof, by certified or registered mail, to the agent designated by the 
foreign air carrier pursuant to

[[Page 40]]

49 U.S.C. 46103 or, if the foreign air carrier has failed to designate 
an agent, the date of mailing by registered air mail to the foreign air 
carrier's home office.

seven (7) true copies shall be filed with the Department's Docket 
Facility. Unless otherwise provided by the Department, further pleadings 
will not be entertained.

    Any violation by the foreign air carrier of applicable provisions of 
Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the U.S. Code or of orders, rules or 
regulations issued thereunder, or of the terms, conditions or 
limitations applicable to the exercise of the privileges granted by the 
permit shall constitute a failure to comply with the terms, conditions 
and limitations of such permit: Provided, That upon a showing that a 
violation of a provision not mandatorily prescribed by law resulted from 
the observance by the holder of an obligation, duty or liability imposed 
by a foreign country, the Department may excuse the violation.

    Source: 53 FR 17923, May 19, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 215.1  Applicability.

    This part applies to all certified air carriers, commuter air 
carriers, and foreign direct air carriers and to initial or amended 
applications for authority, applications for certificate or permit 
transfers or reissuances, and registration of business names.


<R05>
Sec. 215.2  Purpose.

    This part sets rules under which direct air carriers may use the 
names in their operating authorizations and change those names. It 
further provides for notification to air carriers that may be affected 
by the use by other air carriers of the same or similar names. Its 
purpose is to place the responsibility for resolving private disputes 
about the use of similar names with the air carriers involved, through 
recourse to the trade names statutes and the courts. These rules do not 
preclude Department intervention or enforcement action should there be 
evidence of a significant potential for, or of actual, public confusion.


<R05>
Sec. 215.3  Use of name.

    In holding out to the public and in performing air transportation 
services, a direct air carrier or foreign direct air carrier subject to 
this part shall use only the name in which its operating authorization 
is issued or trade name is registered, and shall not operate or hold out 
to the public in a name not acknowledged by the Department to be so 
registered. Minor variations in the use of this name, including 
abbreviations, contractions, initial letters, or other variations of the 
name that are identifiable with the authorized name, are permitted. 
Slogans and service marks shall not be considered names for the purpose 
of this part, and their use is not restricted.

<R05>
Sec. 215.4  Change of name or use of trade name.

    (a) Registrations. Any air carrier subject to this part that desires 
to change the name in which its operating authorization has been issued, 
or to use a trade name, or to obtain initial operating authority must 
register the name with the Department. The Department will construe any 
application for initial, reissued, or transferred authority as 
containing a ``registration'' of the intended name. A separate name 
registration document need not be filed. A carrier registering use of a 
trade name, without seeking reissuance of its underlying certificate 
commuter or foreign air carrier permit or exemption authority, must file 
a statement that complies with Sec. Sec. 302.3 and 302.4 of this 
chapter registering its intended name with the Air Carrier Fitness 
Division if it is a U.S. certificated or commuter carrier, or within the 
Licensing Division if it is a foreign air carrier.
    (b) Montreal Agreement. Each registration under this section shall 
be accompanied by three copies of a counterpart to the Montreal 
Agreement (Agreement 18900) (OST Form 4523) signed by the carrier using 
the proposed name. Upon arrival of the application, the Department will 
place a copy of the signed OST form 4523 in Docket 17325.

(Reporting and recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (b) were approved 
by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3024-0064.)

<R05>
Sec. 215.5  Procedure in case of similarity of names.

    The Department will compare the proposed name in any registration 
filed under this part or in an application for new, reissued, or 
transferred authority with a list of names used by existing 
certificated, commuter and foreign direct air carriers. The Department 
will notify the applicant of any other certificated, foreign or commuter 
carriers that may have an identical or similar name. The registrant must 
then notify those carriers of its registration. The notification will 
identify the applicant and state its proposed name or the name 
requested, area of operation or proposed area of operation, type of 
business, and other pertinent matters. The registrant must then file a 
certificate of service of the notification with the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 215.6  Acknowledgment of registration.

    After completion of the filing and notification requirements of this 
part, the Department may acknowledge the registration by notice in the 
action granting the application for initial operating authority, 
transfer, or reissuance or by separate notice in the case of use of a 
trade name. Non-action under this provision shall not be construed as an 
adjudication of any rights or liabilities.

216.1 Definitions.
216.2 Applicability.
216.3 Prohibition.
216.4 Special authorizations.
216.5 Existing permits.
216.6 Existing unauthorized operations.

<R05>
Sec. 216.1  Definitions.

    (a) As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires:
    Act means the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended.
    Blind sector traffic means revenue traffic, carried by a foreign air 
carrier on a flight operating in air transportation, which is enplaned 
at one foreign point and deplaned at another foreign point, where at 
least one of such points is not named as a terminal or intermediate 
point in the carrier's applicable foreign air carrier permit.
    Note: This definition shall not be deemed to include the carriage of 
authorized beyond homeland traffic (i.e., traffic carried between a 
point named in a carrier's foreign air carrier permit and a point beyond 
a homeland terminal point authorized under such permit).

[[Page 43]]

    Revenue traffic means persons, property or mail carried for 
compensation or hire.
    (b) Terms defined in section 101 of the Act have the meaning 
expressed in such definitions.


<R05>
Sec. 216.2  Applicability.

    This part sets forth the requirements applicable to foreign air 
carriers for obtaining a Special Authorization from the Board with 
respect to any deviation from an authorized foreign air transportation 
route for the purpose of commingling blind sector traffic with air 
transportation traffic carried pursuant to a foreign air carrier permit 
issued by the Board. The deviation by a foreign air carrier from its 
authorized route for the purpose of combined carriage to or from the 
United States of nonrevenue or other traffic, the carriage of which does 
not constitute engaging in foreign air transportation, is governed by 
the provisions of part 375 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 216.3  Prohibition.

    No foreign air carrier shall carry any blind sector traffic, as 
defined in this part, on any flight operating in air transportation 
pursuant to the authority of a foreign air carrier permit issued under 
section 402 of the Act, unless the combined carriage of such traffic has 
been specifically authorized by such permit, or by a Special 
Authorization issued under Sec. 216.4.


<R05>
Sec. 216.4  Special authorizations.

    (a) Applications. Any foreign air carrier may apply to the Board for 
a Special Authorization, as required by this part, for the carriage of 
blind sector traffic on a particular flight, series of flights, or for a 
specified or indefinite period of time between specified points. 
Applications shall be submitted directly to the Board, addressed to the 
attention of the Director, Bureau of International Aviation. One 
original and two copies in conformity with the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 302.3(b) and 302.4 (a) and (b) of this chapter shall be 
filed. The applications shall contain a proper identification of the 
applicant; the flight or flights upon which it is proposed to carry such 
blind sector traffic, including routing, nontraffic stops, and dates or 
duration of the authority sought; a full description of such traffic, 
and points between which such traffic will be carried; information or 
documentation as to whether the country of which the applicant is a 
national grants reciprocal privileges to U.S. carriers; and the reasons 
for requesting such authorization together with such additional 
information as will establish that the grant of such authority will 
otherwise be in the public interest. Such additional information as may 
be specifically requested by the Board shall also be furnished.
    (b) Service. Applications shall be served upon each direct U.S. air 
carrier certificated to engage in individually ticketed or waybilled 
foreign air transportation over any portion of the route to which the 
application pertains, and on such other persons as the Board may 
require, and proof of such service shall accompany the application as 
provided in Sec. 302.7 of this chapter. Notice of such applications 
shall also be published in the Board's Weekly List of Applications 
Filed.
    (c) Memoranda in support or opposition. Any interested person may 
file a memorandum in support of or in opposition to the grant of an 
application. Such memorandum shall set forth in detail the reasons why 
it is believed that the application should be granted or denied and 
shall be accompanied by such data, including affidavits, which it is 
desired that the Board consider. Copies of the memorandum shall be 
served upon the applicant. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed 
to preclude the Board from granting or denying an application when the 
circumstances so warrant without awaiting the filing of memoranda in 
support of or in opposition to the application.
    (d) Time for filing. (1) Applications seeking authority to engage in 
blind sector operations for a period of 3 months or longer, shall be 
submitted at least 60 days in advance of the proposed commencement of 
such operations. Memoranda in response to such an application shall be 
submitted within 15 days after the date of filing thereof.
    (2) Applications seeking authority to engage in blind sector 
operations for a period less than three months shall be filed at least 
20 days in advance of the

[[Page 44]]

proposed commencement of such operations, and memoranda in response 
thereto within 7 days after the date of filing thereof: Provided, That 
the Board may consider late filed applications upon a showing of good 
cause for failure to adhere to this requirement.
    (e) General procedural requirements. Except as otherwise provided 
herein, the provisions of part 302, subpart A, of this chapter shall 
apply to the extent applicable.
    (f) Issuance of Special Authorization. A Special Authorization 
authorizing the carriage of blind sector traffic will be issued only if 
the Board finds that the proposed carriage is fully consistent with 
applicable law and this part, and that grant of such authority would be 
in the public interest. The application may be granted or denied in 
whole or in part without hearing, and a Special Authorization made 
subject to any conditions or limitations, to the extent that such action 
is deemed by the Board to be in the public interest. Special 
Authorizations are not transferable.
    (g) Nature of the privilege conferred. A Special Authorization 
issued pursuant to this section shall constitute a privilege conferred 
upon a carrier, which may be enjoyed only to the extent that its 
continued exercise remains in the interest of the public. Accordingly, 
any Special Authorization issued pursuant to this section may be 
revoked, suspended, amended or restricted without hearing.

Sec. 216.5  Existing permits.

    ``Foreign aircraft permits'' issued by the Board under the 
provisions of part 375 of the Board's Special Regulations, authorizing 
the combined carriage of blind sector traffic as defined in this part, 
shall continue in effect in accordance with their terms until their 
expiration date unless sooner terminated, revoked or modified by the 
Board. Such permits shall, upon the effective date of this part, be 
deemed to constitute a Special Authorization issued pursuant to Sec. 
216.4.


<R05>
Sec. 216.6  Existing unauthorized operations.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 216.3, if within 30 days 
after the effective date of this part a carrier files an application for 
a Special Authorization to continue to perform existing blind sector 
operations which have been regularly performed by such carrier 
commencing on a date prior to August 9, 1967, such carrier may continue 
to engage in such blind sector operations until final decision by the 
Board on such application: Provided, That any such application shall, in 
addition to the requirements of Sec. 216.4(a), contain a statement that 
the carrier is relying upon this section for continuance of preexisting 
blind sector operations, and shall fully describe such operations 
including the date inaugurated, and the frequency and continuity of 
performance.

the submission of a written request of the air carrier to the Director, 
Office of Airline Information, when such a waiver is in the public 
interest.
    (b) Each request for waiver must demonstrate that: Existing 
peculiarities or unusual circumstances warrant a departure from the 
prescribed procedure or technique; a specifically defined alternative 
procedure or technique will result in substantially equivalent or more 
accurate portrayal of the operations reported; and the application of 
such alternative procedure will not adversely affect the uniformity in 
reporting applicable to all air carriers.

floppy discs produced on microcomputers or on other ADP media, such as 
magnetic tape, or hardcopy reports.
    (b) The detailed instructions for preparing Schedule T-100(f) are 
contained in the Appendix to this section. Blank copies of Schedule T-
100(f) are available from the Office of Airline Information, K-25, Room 
4125, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh St., SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.

 Appendix to Section 217.10 of 14 CFR Part 217--Instructions to Foreign 
  Air Carriers for Reporting Traffic Data on Form 41 Schedule T-100(f)

    (a) General instructions.
    (1) Description. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) provides flight stage 
data covering both passenger/cargo and all cargo operations in scheduled 
and nonscheduled services. The schedule is used to report all flights 
which serve points in the United States or its territories as defined in 
this part.
    (2) Applicability. Each foreign air carrier holding a Sec. 41302 
permit or exemption authority shall file Schedule T-100(f).
    (3) Address for filing reports: Office of Airline Information, K-25, 
Room 4125, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh St., SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.
    (4) Filing period. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) shall be filed monthly 
and is due at the Department thirty (30) days following the end of the 
reporting month to which the data are applicable.
    (5) Number of copies. A single set of legible Form 41 Schedule T-
100(f) data and certification shall be submitted.
    (6) Foreign air carrier certification. Each foreign air carrier 
shall submit a certification statement (illustrated at the end of this 
Appendix) as an integral part of each monthly Schedule T-100(f), as 
prescribed in Sec. 217.5 of this part.
    (7) Alternative filing on Automatic Data Processing (ADP) media. 
Foreign air carriers are encouraged to use ADP equipment to reduce the 
manual effort of preparing Schedule T-100(f). Foreign air carriers may 
use the floppy disk medium. ADP submission requirements for floppy discs 
are prescribed in paragraph (f).
    (b) Preparation of Form 41 Schedule T-100(f):
    (1) Explanation of nonstop segments and on-flight markets. There are 
two basic categories of data, one pertaining to nonstop segments and the 
other pertaining to on-flight markets. For example, the routing (A-B-C-
D) consists of three nonstop segment records A-B, B-C, and C-D, and six 
on-flight market records A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, and C-D.
    (2) Guidelines for reporting a nonstop segment. A nonstop segment is 
reported when one or both points are in the United States or its 
territories. These data shall be merged with that for all of the other 
reportable nonstop operations over the same segment. Nonstop segment 
data must be summarized by aircraft type, under paragraph (h)(1), and 
class of service, paragraph (g)(1)(v).
    (3) Rules for determining a reportable on-flight market. On-flight 
markets are reportable when one or both points are within the U.S., with 
the following exceptions: (i) Do not report third country to U.S. 
markets resulting from flight itineraries which serve a third country 
prior to a homeland point in flights passing through the homeland bound 
for the U.S.; and (ii) do not report U.S. to third country markets 
resulting from itineraries serving third country points subsequent to a 
homeland point in flights outbound from the U.S. and passing through the 
homeland. In reporting data pertaining to these two exceptions, the 
traffic moving to or from the U.S. relating to the applicable prior or 
subsequent third countries (referred to as ``behind'' or ``beyond'' 
traffic) is to be combined with the applicable foreign homeland gateway 
point, just as though the traffic were actually enplaned or deplaned at 
the homeland gateway, without disclosure of the actual prior or 
subsequent points. Applicable flights are illustrated in examples (6) 
and (7) under paragraph (c).
    (c) Examples of flights. Following are some typical flight 
itineraries that show the reportable nonstop segment and on-flight 
market entries. The carrier's homeland is the key factor in determining 
which on-flight markets are reportable.
    (1) SQ flight <greek-i> 11 LAX--NRT--SIN. This is an example of a 
flight with an intermediate foreign country. It is not necessary to 
report anything on the NRT--SIN leg.

    (3) LB flight <greek-i> 902 LPB-VVI-MAO-CCS-MIA. This flight serves 
two homeland points and two different foreign countries before 
terminating in the U.S. Nonstop segment information is required only for 
the nonstop segment involving a U.S. point. On-flight market information 
is required in 4 of the 10 markets, LPB-MIA and VVI-MIA, since these 
involve homeland and U.S. points; MAO-MIA is necessary to show traffic 
carried into the U.S., and CCS-MIA for the same reason, and also because 
in all cases where a nonstop segment entry is required, a corresponding 
on-flight market entry must also be reported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Provisions to reduce paperwork:
    (1) Nonstop Segment Entries. The flight stage data applicable to 
nonstop segment entries must be summarized to create totals by aircraft 
equipment type, within service class, within pairs-of-points.
    (2) On-flight Market Entries. The applicable on-flight market 
entries shall be summarized to create totals by service class within 
pair-of-points.
    (e) Preparation of hard copy Schedule T-100(f):
    (1) Section A--Indicative and flight pattern information. A copy of 
Schedule T-100(f) is shown at the end of this Appendix. Section A 
defines the origin and destination points and the service class code to 
which the nonstop segment data in Section B and the on-flight market 
data in Section C are applicable. Section A information, along with the 
carrier code and report date, must be included on each schedule.
    (2) Section B--Nonstop segment information. Section B of the 
schedule is used for reporting nonstop segment information by aircraft 
type. To reduce the number of schedules reported, space is provided for 
including data on multiple different aircraft types. Similarly, the on-
flight market section has been included on a single Schedule T-100(f), 
along with the nonstop segment data, rather than on a separate schedule.
    (3) Section C--On-flight market information. Section C of the 
schedule is used for reporting on-flight market data. There will always 
be an on-flight market that corresponds to the nonstop segment. Because 
the on-flight market data are reported at the service class level rather 
than by aircraft type, a specific flight may produce more on-flight 
markets than nonstop segments, (see examples in paragraph (c) of this 
Appendix), resulting in data reported in sections A and C only.
    (f) ADP media reports:
    (1) ADP report format. A foreign air carrier may, in accordance with 
the following guidelines, use personal computers (and in some cases 
mainframe or minicomputers) to report Schedule T-100(f) data.
    (i) Reporting medium. ADP data submission must be on IBM compatible 
disks. Carriers using mainframe or minicomputers shall download 
(transcribe) to the required IBM compatible disk. Carriers wishing to 
use a different ADP procedure or e-mail must obtain written approval to 
do so from the BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information

[[Page 52]]

under the waiver provisions in Sec. 217.9 of this part. Requests for 
approval to use alternative methods must disclose and describe in 
sufficient detail the proposed data transmission methodology.
    (ii) File characteristics. OAI files are reported in ASCII delimited 
format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of 
recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) 
which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks 
(``) and separated by a comma (,); numeric data elements are recorded 
without editing symbols and separated by a comma. The data is identified 
by its juxtaposition within a given record. Each record submitted by an 
air carrier shall contain the specified number of data elements all of 
which must be juxtapositionally correct.
    (iii) Schedule T-100(f) record layout. Each minidisk record shall 
consist of data fields for recording a maximum of eleven (11) elements. 
The order and description of the data fields are as follows:

(1). Carrier code: Alphanumeric
(2). Report date: Numeric
(3). Origin airport: Alphabetic
(4). Destination airport: Alphabetic
(5). Service class code: Alphabetic
(6). Aircraft type code: Numeric
(7). Aircraft departures performed: Numeric
(8). Revenue passengers transported: Numeric
(9). Revenue freight transported: Numeric
(10). Total revenue passengers in market: Numeric
(11). Total revenue freight in market: Numeric

    (A) Fields numbered 1 through 11 must always be provided. Therefore, 
enter a zero (0) or space when there is no reportable data for a given 
element. See paragraph (g)(1) through (g)(3) for a detailed definition 
of each data element.
    (B) The following are sample disk records:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        1        2       3        4       5       6      7      8      9      10     11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample No. 1.......................................................  ``CCC''    8701  ``JFK''  ``LHR''  ``F''    8161     29     59     69     79     89
Sample No. 2.......................................................  ``CCC''    8701  ``JFK''  ``LHR''  ``F''    6901    299    599      0      0      0
Sample No. 3.......................................................  ``CCC''    8701  ``JFK''  ``LHR''  ``G''    7102    299      0    599      0    799
Sample No. 4.......................................................  ``CCC''    8701  ``JFK''  ``LHR''  ``F''       0      0      0      0    699    799
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sample No. 1 represents a full record, using the applicable fields 
for reporting both the nonstop segment (6 through 9) and the on-flight 
market information (10 and 11). The service class is ``F'' indicating 
scheduled passenger/cargo service; the aircraft type code is 8161; the 
816 indicates a Boeing 747-100, and the 1 in the units position 
indicates the standard ``passengers-above and cargo-below'' 
configuration.
    Sample No. 2 contains nonstop segment information only. It is needed 
in this example to report the volumes transported on the same nonstop 
segment, but with a second aircraft type.
    Sample No. 3 contains nonstop segment and on-flight market 
information for the same points, but for another service class (code 
letter ``G'' indicates all-cargo service). Also, the units position of 
aircraft type is a 2, indicating a cargo cabin. Field numbers 8 and 10 
are for reporting passengers. In this case both contain a zero, 
indicating no passengers, while at the same time maintaining the 
required juxtaposition.
    Sample No. 4 shows the reporting of only on-flight market 
information for a pair-of-points for which there is no corresponding 
nonstop segment information.
    (2) External labeling requirements: Physical label. The following 
data must be clearly printed on a label affixed to the minidisk or its 
container.

Carrier Name
Carrier code (as prescribed by DOT, BTS, OAI)
File identification = ``T-100(F) DATA''
Report date (year, month to which data applies)

    (3) Collating sequence, optional. If practical, the records should 
be sorted by origin and destination airport codes, service class, and 
aircraft type. However, the sequence is optional. Data may be submitted 
in any sequence including random.
    (4) Summarization. See summarization rules as specified in paragraph 
(d)(1).
    (g) Data element definitions:
    (1) Service pattern information.
    (i) Line A-1 Carrier code. Use the carrier code established by the 
Department. This code is provided to each carrier in the initial 
reporting letter from the Office of Airline Information (OAI). If there 
are any questions about these codes, contact the OAI Data Administration 
Division at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this Appendix.
    (ii) Line A-2 Report date. This is the year and month to which the 
data are applicable. For example, 200009 indicates the year 2000, and 
the month of September.
    (iii) Line A-3 Origin airport code. This is the departure airport, 
where an aircraft begins a flight segment, and where the passengers 
originate in an on-flight market. Use the 3-letter code from the City/
Airport Codes section of the Official Airline Guide Worldwide Edition. 
If no 3-letter code is available, OAI

[[Page 53]]

will assign one; the address is in paragraph (a)(3) of this Appendix.
    (iv) Line A-4 Destination airport code. This is the arrival airport, 
where an aircraft stops on a flight segment, and where passengers 
deplane (get off the flight) after reaching their destination in a 
market. Use the 3-letter code from the source described in paragraph 
(g)(1)(iii) of this Appendix.
    (v) Line A-5 Service class code. Select one of the following single 
letter codes which describes the type of service being reported on a 
given flight operation.

F = Scheduled Passenger/cargo Service
G = Scheduled All-cargo Service
L = Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo Charter
P = Nonscheduled Civilian All-Cargo Charter
Q = Nonscheduled Services (Other than Charter)

    (2) Nonstop segment information:
    (i) Line B-1 Aircraft type code. Use the four digit numeric code 
prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of this Appendix. If no aircraft type 
code is available, OAI will assign one. The address is in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this Appendix.
    (ii) Line B-2 Aircraft departures performed. This is the total 
number of physical departures performed with a given aircraft type, 
within service class and pair-of-points.
    (iii) Line B-3 Revenue passengers transported. This is the total 
number of revenue passengers transported on a given nonstop segment. It 
represents the total number of revenue passengers on board over the 
segment without regard to their actual point of enplanement.
    (iv) Line B-4 Revenue freight transported. This item is the total 
weight in kilograms (kg) of the revenue freight transported on a given 
nonstop segment without regard to its actual point of enplanement.
    (3) On-flight market information:
    (i) Line C-1 Total revenue passengers in market. This item 
represents the total number of revenue passengers, within service class, 
that were enplaned at the origin airport and deplaned at the destination 
airport.
    (ii) Line C-2 Total revenue freight in market. This item represents 
the total weight in kilograms (kg) of revenue freight enplaned at the 
origin and deplaned at the destination airport.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) Joint Service.
    (1) The Department may authorize joint service operations between 
two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint service operations are:
    Blocked-space agreements;
    Part-charter agreements;
    Code-sharing agreements;
    Wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.
    (2) Joint-service operations shall be reported on BTS Form 41 
Schedules T-100 and T-100(f) by the air carrier in operational control 
of the flight, i.e., the air carrier that uses its flight crew to 
perform the operation. If there are questions about reporting a joint-
service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director--Airline 
Information at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.

Sec. 218.5  Application for disclaimer of jurisdiction.

    The parties to a lease with crew as described in Sec. 218.3(b) may 
apply to the Board for an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the 
matter. The application

[[Page 57]]

shall be filed jointly by both parties to the lease, and shall generally 
conform to the procedural requirements of part 302, subpart A, of this 
chapter. It shall be served upon any air carrier providing services over 
all or any part of the route upon which air transportation services will 
be provided pursuant to the agreement. The application should set forth 
in detail all evidence and other factors relied upon to demonstrate that 
true operational control and safety responsibility for the air 
transportation services to be provided are in the hands of the lessee 
rather than the lessor. A copy of the agreement and all amendments 
thereof, as well as a summary interpretation of its pertinent 
provisions, shall be included with the applications. Any interested 
person may file an answer to the application within 7 days after service 
hereof. Until the Board has acted upon the application, no operations in 
foreign transportation shall be performed pursuant to the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 218.6  Issuance of order disclaiming jurisdiction.

    If the Board finds that true operational control and safety 
responsibility will be vested in the lessee and not in the lessor (i.e., 
that the lease transaction is in substance a true lease of aircraft 
rather than a charter or series of charters), and that the performance 
of the operations provided for in such lease will not result in the 
lessor's being engaged in foreign air transportation, it will issue an 
order disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter. Otherwise the 
application for disclaimer of jurisdiction will be denied.


<R05>
Sec. 218.7  Presumption.

    Whether under a particular lease agreement the lessor of the 
aircraft is engaged in foreign air transportation is a question of fact 
to be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances. 
However, in circumstances where the lessor furnishes both the aircraft 
and the crew, there is a presumption that true operational control and 
safety responsibility are exercised by the lessor, and that the 
agreement constitutes a charter arrangement under which the lessor is 
engaged in foreign air transportation. The burden shall rest upon the 
applicants for disclaimer of jurisdiction in each instance to 
demonstrate by an appropriate factual showing that the operation 
contemplated will not constitute foreign air transportation by the 
lessor.

part, for a period up to one year, and to permit, under such terms and 
conditions as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, 
the applicant carrier to file fare tariffs in a paper format. Such 
waivers shall only be considered where electronic filing, compared to 
paper filing, is impractical and will produce a significant economic 
hardship for the carrier due to the limited nature of the carrier's 
operations subject to the requirements of this part, or other unusual 
circumstances. Paper filings pursuant to this paragraph shall normally

night coach, tourist, economy or whatever other class or type of service 
is provided

[[Page 64]]

under the tariff), the tariff shall specify the type of aircraft and the 
seating configuration used on such aircraft for each class or type of 
passenger service. When two or more classes or types of passenger 
service are performed in a single aircraft, the seating configuration 
for each type or class shall be stated and described.
    (2) Rule numbers. Each rule or regulation shall have a separate 
designation. The same designation shall not be assigned to more than one 
rule in the tariff.
    (3) Penalties. Where a rule provides a charge in the nature of a 
penalty, the rule shall state the exact conditions under which such 
charge will be imposed.
    (4) Vague or indefinite provisions. Rules and regulations shall not 
contain indefinite statements to the effect that traffic of any nature 
will be ``taken only by special arrangements'', or that services will be 
performed or penalties imposed ``at carrier's option'', or that the 
carrier ``reserves the right'' to act or to refrain from acting in a 
specified manner, or other provisions of like import; instead, the rules 
shall state definitely what the carrier will or will not do under the 
exact conditions stated in the rules.
    (5) Personal liability rules. Except as provided in this part, no 
provision of the Department's regulations issued under this part or 
elsewhere shall be construed to require the filing of any tariff rules 
stating any limitation on, or condition relating to, the carrier's 
liability for personal injury or death. No subsequent regulation issued 
by the Department shall be construed to supersede or modify this rule of 
construction except to the extent that such regulation shall do so in 
express terms.
    (6) Notice of limitation of liability for death or injury under the 
Warsaw Convention. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section, each air carrier and foreign air carrier shall publish in 
its tariffs a provision stating whether it avails itself of the 
limitation on liability to passengers as provided in Article 22(1) of 
the Warsaw Convention or whether it has elected to agree to a higher 
limit of liability by a tariff provision. Unless the carrier elects to 
assume unlimited liability, its tariffs shall contain a statement as to 
the applicability and effect of the Warsaw Convention, including the 
amount of the liability limit in dollars. Where applicable, a statement 
advising passengers of the amount of any higher limit of liability 
assumed by the carrier shall be added.
    (7) Extension of credit. Air carriers and foreign air carriers shall 
not file tariffs that set forth charges, rules, regulations, or 
practices relating to the extension of credit for payment of charges 
applicable to air transportation.
    (8) Individual carrier provisions governing joint fares. Provisions 
governing joint fares may be published for account of an individual 
carrier participating in such joint fares provided that the tariff 
clearly indicates how such individual carrier's provisions apply to the 
through transportation over the applicable joint routes comprised of 
such carrier and other carriers who either do not maintain such 
provisions or who maintain different provisions on the same subject 
matter.
    (9) Passenger property which cannot lawfully be carried in the 
aircraft cabin. Each air carrier shall set forth in its tariffs 
governing the transportation of persons, including passengers' baggage, 
charges, rules, and regulations providing that such air carrier 
receiving as baggage any property of a person traveling in air 
transportation, which property cannot lawfully be carried by such person 
in the aircraft cabin by reason of any Federal law or regulation, shall 
assume liability to such person, at a reasonable charge and subject to 
reasonable terms and conditions, within the amount declared to the air 
carrier by such person, for the full actual loss or damage to such 
property caused by such air carrier.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 221.41  Routing.

    (a) Required routing. The route or routes over which each fare 
applies shall be stated in the tariff in such manner that the following 
information can be definitely ascertained from the tariff:
    (1) The carrier or carriers performing the transportation,

[[Page 65]]

    (2) The point or points of interchange between carriers if the route 
is a joint route (via two or more carriers),
    (3) The intermediate points served on the carrier's or carriers' 
routes applicable between the origin and destination of the fare and the 
order in which such intermediate points are served.
    (b) Individually stated routings--Method of publication. The routing 
required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be shown directly in 
connection with each fare or charge for transportation, or in a routing 
portion of the tariff (following the fare portion of the tariff), or in 
a governing routing tariff. When shown in the routing portion of the 
tariff or in a governing routing tariff, the fare from each point of 
origin to each point of destination shall bear a routing number and the 
corresponding routing numbers with their respective explanations of the 
applicable routings shall be arranged in numerical order in the routing 
portion of the tariff or in the governing routing tariff.

respective fares and charges stated in cents or dollars of the United 
States.
    (2) Each record containing fares and charges shall clearly indicate 
the respective currencies in which the fares and charges thereon are 
stated, and
    (3) The fares and charges stated in cents or dollars of the United 
States are published separately from those stated in currencies of other 
countries. This shall be done in a systematic manner and the fares and 
charges in the respective currencies shall be published in separate

    (b) Directional application. A tariff shall specifically indicate 
directly in connection with the fares therein whether they apply 
``from'' and ``to'' or ``between'' the points named. Where the fares 
apply in one direction, the terms ``From'' and ``To'' shall be shown in 
connection with the point of origin and point of destination, 
respectively, and, where the fares apply in both directions between the

    (b) A tariff may provide that fares from (or to) particular points 
shall be determined by the addition of add-ons to, or the deduction of 
add-ons from, fares therein which apply from (or to) a base point. 
Provisions for the addition or deduction of such add-ons shall be shown 
either directly in connection with the fare applying to or from the base 
point or in a separate provision which shall specifically name the base 
point. The tariff shall clearly and definitely state the manner in which 
such add-ons shall be applied.

[[Page 66]]

    (c) Restrictions upon beyond points or connecting carriers. If an 
add-on fare is intended for use only on traffic originating at and/or 
destined to particular beyond points or is to apply only in connection 
with particular connecting carriers, such application shall be clearly 
and explicitly stated directly in connection with such add-on fare.


<R05>
Sec. 221.54  Fares stated in percentages of other fares; other 
relationships prohibited.

    (a) Fares for foreign air transportation of persons or property

fares and baggage charges.
    (b) A basis of fares for refund purposes may be stated, by rule, in 
the form of percentages of other fares.

to the same points, via the same routes, and for the same class of 
service and same type of aircraft to which the applicable base fares 
apply, and shall apply to all such base fares in a fares tariff.
    (2) Fares shall not be stated as percentages of base fares for the 
purpose of establishing fares applying from and to points, or via 
routes, or on types of aircraft, or for classes of service different 
from the points, routes, types of aircraft, or classes of service to 
which the base fares are applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 221.55  Conflicting or duplicating fares prohibited.

    The publication of fares or charges of a carrier which duplicate or 
conflict with the fares of the same carrier published in the same or any 
other tariff for application over the same route or routes is hereby 
prohibited.


<R05>
Sec. 221.56  Applicable fare when no through local or joint fares.

    Where no applicable local or joint fare is provided from point of 
origin to point of destination over the route of movement, whichever 
combination of applicable fares provided over the route of movement

<R04>
                       Subpart G_Governing Tariffs


<R05>
Sec. 221.60  When reference to governing tariffs permitted.

    (a) Reference to other tariffs prohibited except as authorized. A 
tariff shall not refer to nor provide that it is governed by any other 
tariff, document, or publication, or any part thereof, except as 
specifically authorized by this part.
    (b) Reference by fare tariff to governing tariffs. A fare tariff may 
be made subject to a governing tariff or governing tariffs authorized by 
this subpart: Provided, that reference to such governing tariffs is 
published in the fare tariff in the manner required by Sec. 221.20(h).
    (c) Participation in governing tariffs. A fare tariff may refer to a 
separate governing tariff authorized by this subpart only when all 
carriers participating in such fare tariff are also shown as 
participating carriers in the governing tariff: Provided, that:
    (1) If such reference to a separate governing tariff does not apply 
for account of all participating carriers and is restricted to apply 
only in connection with local or joint fares applying over routes 
consisting of only particular carriers, only the carriers for whom such 
reference is published are required to be shown as participating 
carriers in the governing tariff to which such qualified reference is 
made.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Maximum number of governing tariffs. A single fare tariff shall 
not make reference to conflicting governing tariffs.

[[Page 67]]


<R05>
Sec. 221.61  Rules and regulations governing foreign air transportation.

    Instead of being included in the fares tariffs, the rules and 
regulations governing foreign air transportation required to be filed by 
Sec. Sec. 221.20 and 221.30 and/or Department order which do not govern 
the applicability of particular fares may be filed in separate governing 
tariffs, conforming to this subpart. Governing rules tariffs shall 
contain an index of rules.


<R05>
Sec. 221.62  Explosives and other dangerous or restricted articles.

    Carriers may publish rules and regulations governing the 
transportation of explosives and other dangerous or restricted articles 
in separate governing tariffs, conforming to this subpart, instead of 
being included in the fares tariffs or in the governing rules tariff 
authorized by Sec. 221.61. This separate governing tariff shall contain 
no other rules or governing provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 221.63  Other types of governing tariffs.

    Subject to approval of the Department, carriers may publish other 
types of governing tariffs not specified in this subpart, such as

                     Subpart H_Amendment of Tariffs


<R05>
Sec. 221.70  Who may amend tariffs.

    A tariff shall be amended only by the carrier or agent who issued 
the tariff (except as otherwise authorized in subparts P and Q).


<R05>
Sec. 221.71  Requirement of clarity and specificity.

    Amendments to tariffs shall identify with specificity and clarity 
the material being amended and the changes being made. Amendments to 
paper tariffs shall be accomplished by reissuing each page upon which a 
change occurs with the change made and identified by uniform amendment 
symbols. Each revised page shall identify and cancel the previously 
effective page, show the effective date of the previous page, and show 
the intended effective date of the revised page. Amendments in 
electronic format shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 221.202 and 
other applicable provisions of subpart R.


<R05>
Sec. 221.72  Reinstating canceled or expired tariff provisions.

    Any fares, rules, or other tariff provisions which have been 
canceled or which have expired may be reinstated only by republishing 
such provisions and posting and filing the tariff publications 
(containing such republished provisions) on lawful notice in the form 
and manner required by this part.


<R04>
         Subpart I_Suspension of Tariff Provisions by Department


<R05>
Sec. 221.80  Effect of suspension by Department.

    (a) Suspended matter not to be used. A fare, charge, or other tariff 
provision which is suspended by the Department, under authority of 
chapter 415 of the statute, shall not be used during the period of 
suspension specified by the Department's order.
    (b) Suspended matter not to be changed. A fare, charge, or other 
tariff provision which is suspended by the Department shall not be 
changed in any respect or withdrawn or the effective date thereof 
further deferred except by authority of an order or special tariff 
permission of the Department.
    (c) Suspension continues former matter in effect. If a tariff 
publication containing matter suspended by the Department directs the 
cancellation of a tariff or any portion thereof, which contains fares, 
charges, or other tariff provisions sought to be amended by the 
suspended matter, such cancellation is automatically suspended for the 
same period insofar as it purports to cancel any tariff provisions 
sought to be amended by the suspended matter.
    (d) Matter continued in effect not to be changed. A fare, charge, or 
other tariff provision which is continued in effect as a result of a 
suspension by the Department shall not be changed during the period of 
suspension unless the change is authorized by order or special tariff 
permission of the Department, except that such matter may be reissued 
without change during the period of suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 221.81  Suspension supplement.

    (a) Suspension supplement. Upon receipt of an order of the 
Department

[[Page 68]]

suspending any tariff publication in part or in its entirety, the 
carrier or agent who issued such tariff publication shall immediately 
issue and file with the Department a consecutively numbered supplement 
for the purpose of announcing such suspension.
    (b) The suspension supplement shall not contain an effective date 
and it shall contain the suspension notice required by paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (c) Suspension notice. The suspension supplement shall contain a 
prominent notice of suspension which shall:
    (1) Indicate what particular fares, charges, or other tariff 
provisions are under suspension,
    (2) State the date to which such tariff matter is suspended,
    (3) State the Department's docket number and order number which 
suspended such tariff matter, and
    (4) Give specific reference to the tariffs (specifying their D.O.T. 
or other identifying numbers), original or revised records and 
paragraphs or provisions which contain the fares, charges, or other 
tariff provisions continued in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 221.82  Reissue of matter continued in effect by suspension to 
be canceled upon termination of suspension.

    When tariff provisions continued in effect by a suspension are 
reissued during the period of such suspension, the termination of the 
suspension and the coming into effect of the suspended matter will not 
accomplish the cancellation of such reissued matter. In such 
circumstances, prompt action shall be taken by the issuing agent or 
carrier to cancel such reissued provisions upon the termination of the 
suspension in order that they will not conflict with the provisions 
formerly under suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 221.83  Tariff must be amended to make suspended matter effective.

    (a) When the Department vacates an order which suspended certain 
tariff matter in full or in part, such matter will not become effective 
until the termination of the suspension period unless the issuing agent 
or carrier amends the pertinent tariffs in the manner prescribed in this 
subpart (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).
    (b) If the Department vacates its suspension order prior to the 
original published effective date of the tariff provisions whose 
suspension is vacated, such provisions will become effective on their 
published effective date.


<R05>
Sec. 221.84  Cancellation of suspended matter subsequent to date to 
which suspended.

    (a) Endeavor to cancel prior to expiration of suspension period. 
When an order of the Department requires the cancellation of tariff 
provisions which were suspended by the Department and such cancellation 
is required to be made effective on or before a date which is after the 
date to which such tariff provisions were suspended, the issuing carrier 
or agent shall, if possible, make the cancellation effective prior to 
the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended.
    (b) When necessary to republish matter continued in effect by 
suspension. If suspended tariff provisions become effective upon 
expiration of their suspension period and thereby accomplish the 
cancellation of the tariff provisions continued in effect by the 
suspension, the issuing agent or carrier shall republish and reestablish 
such canceled tariff provisions effective simultaneously with the 
cancellation of the suspended provisions in compliance with the 
Department's order. The tariff amendments which reestablish such 
canceled tariff provisions shall bear reference to this subpart and the 
Department's order.


<R04>
          Subpart J_Filing Tariff Publications With Department


<R05>
Sec. 221.90  Required notice.

    (a) Statutory notice required. Unless otherwise authorized by the

    (1) At least 30 days before they are to become effective, for 
tariffs stating a passenger fare within the zone created by section 
41509(e) of the statute or

[[Page 69]]

stating a rule that affects only such a fare;
    (2) At least 25 days before they are to become effective, for

Department on or before the designated issued date.


<R05>
Sec. 221.91  Delivering tariff publications to Department.

    Tariff publications will be received for filing only by delivery 
thereof to the Department electronically, through normal mail channels, 
or by delivery thereof during established business hours directly to 
that office of the Department charged with the responsibility of 
processing tariffs. No tariff publication will be accepted by the 
Department unless it is delivered free from all charges, including 
claims for postage.


<R05>
Sec. 221.92  Number of copies required.

    Two copies of each paper tariff, tariff revision and adoption notice 
to be filed shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation, 
Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20428. All such copies

to accompany tariff transmittal.

    When a tariff is filed on behalf of a carrier participating therein 
under authority of its concurrence or power of attorney, such 
concurrence or power of attorney shall, if not previously filed with the 
Department, be transmitted at the same time such tariff is submitted for 
filing.


<R05>
Sec. 221.94  Explanation and data supporting tariff changes and new 
matter in tariffs.

    When a tariff is filed with the Department which contains new or 
changed local or joint fares or charges for foreign air transportation, 
or new or changed classifications, rules, regulations, or practices 
affecting such fares or charges, or the value of the service thereunder, 
the issuing air carrier, foreign air carrier, or agent shall submit with 
the filing of such tariff:
    (a) An explanation of the new or changed matter and the reasons for 
the filing, including (if applicable) the basis of rate making employed. 
Where a tariff is filed pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved 
by the Department, the explanation shall identify such agreement by DOT 
Docket number, DOT order of approval number, IATA resolution number, or 
if none is designated, then by other definite identification. Where a 
tariff is filed on behalf of a foreign air carrier pursuant to a 
Government order, a copy of such order shall be submitted with the 
tariff.
    (b) Appropriate Economic data and/or information in support of the 
new or changed matter.
    (c) Exceptions. (1) The requirement for data and/or information in 
paragraph (b) of this section will not apply to tariff publications 
containing new or changed matter which are filed:
    (i) In response to Department orders or specific policy 
pronouncements of the Department directly related to such new or changed 
matter;
    (ii) Pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the 
Department setting forth the fares, charges (or specific formulas 
therefor) or other matter: Provided that the changes are submitted with 
the number of the DOT order of approval and fully comply with any 
conditions set forth in that order;
    (iii) To the extent fares for scheduled passenger service are within 
a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility; and
    (iv) To meet competition: Provided, that
    (A) Changed matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet 
competition only when it effects decreases in fares

[[Page 70]]

or charges and/or increases the value of service so that the level of 
the fares or charges and the services provided will be substantially 
similar to the level of fares or charges and the services of a competing 
carrier or carriers.
    (B) New matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition 
only when it establishes or affects a fare or charge and a service which 
will be substantially similar to the fares or charges and the services 
of a competing carrier or carriers.
    (C) When new or changed matter is filed to meet competition over a 
portion of the filing air carrier's system and is simultaneously made 
applicable to the balance of the system, such matter, insofar as it 
applies over the balance of the system, will be deemed to be within the 
exception in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if such 
carrier submits an explanation as to the necessity of maintaining 
uniformity over its entire system with respect to such new or changed 
matter.
    (D) In any case where new or changed matter is filed to meet 
competition, the filing carrier or agent must supply, as part of the 
filing justification, the complete tariff references which will serve to 
identify the competing tariff matter which the tariff purports to meet. 
In such case the justification or attachment shall state whether the new 
or changed matter is identical to the competing tariff matter which it 
purports to meet or whether it approximates the competing tariff matter. 
If the new or changed matter is not identical, the transmittal letter or 
attachment shall contain a statement explaining, in reasonable detail, 
the basis for concluding that the tariff publication being filed is 
substantially similar to the competing tariff matter.

where such station, office, or location is situated, including tariffs 
covering any terminal services, charges, or practices whatsoever, which 
apply to passenger traffic from or to such point.

<R05>
Sec. 221.105  Special notice of limited liability for death or injury 
under the Warsaw Convention.

    (a)(1) In addition to the other requirements of this subpart, each 
air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself 
of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by the Warsaw 
Convention, shall, at the time of delivery of the ticket, furnish to 
each passenger whose transportation is governed by the Convention and 
whose place of departure or place of destination is in the United 
States, the following statement in writing:

     Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of Liability

    Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate 
destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure 
are advised that the provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw 
Convention may be applicable to their entire journey including the 
portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The 
Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers to 
passengers for death or personal injury to approximately $10,000.
    Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing 
insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any 
limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention. For 
further information please consult your airline or insurance company 
representative.

    (2) Provided, however, That when the carrier elects to agree to a

(including the size of type) specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section and the requirement with respect to travel agents specified in

application and showing by the carrier that special and unusual 
circumstances render the enforcement of the regulations impractical and 
unduly burdensome and that adequate alternative means of giving notice 
are employed.

<R04>
               Subpart L_Rejection of Tariff Publications


<R05>
Sec. 221.110  Department's authority to reject.

    The Department may reject any tariff which is not consistent with 
section 41504 of the statute, with the regulations in this part, or with 
Department orders.


<R05>
Sec. 221.111  Notification of rejection.

    When a tariff is rejected, the issuing carrier or agent thereof will 
be notified electronically or in writing that the tariff is rejected and 
of the reason for such rejection.


<R05>
Sec. 221.112  Rejected tariff is void and must not be used.

    A tariff rejected by the Department is void and is without any force 
or effect whatsoever. Such rejected tariff must not be used.


<R04>
   Subpart M_Special Tariff Permission To File on Less Than Statutory 
                                 Notice


<R05>
Sec. 221.120  Grounds for approving or denying Special Tariff Permission 
applications.

    (a) General authority. The Department may permit changes in fares, 
charges or other tariff provisions on less than

[[Page 75]]

the statutory notice required by section 41505 of the statute.
    (b) Grounds for approval. The following facts and circumstances 
constitute some of the grounds for approving applications for Special 
Tariff Permission in the absence of other facts and circumstances 
warranting denial:
    (1) Clerical or typographical errors. Clerical or typographical 
errors in tariffs constitute grounds for approving applications for 
Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the 
tariff changes necessary to correct such errors. Each application for 
Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify 
the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts 
and circumstances, and such application shall be presented to the 
Department with reasonable promptness after issuance of the defective 
tariff.
    (2) Rejection caused by clerical or typographical errors or 
unintelligibility. Rejection of a tariff caused by clerical or 
typographical errors constitute grounds for approving applications for 
Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice, 
effective not earlier than the original effective dates in the rejected 
tariff, all changes contained in the rejected tariff but with the errors 
corrected. Each application for the grant of Special Tariff Permission 
based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a 
complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and 
such application shall be filed with the Department within five days 
after receipt of the Department's notice of rejection.
    (3) Newly authorized transportation. The fact that the Department 
has newly authorized a carrier to perform foreign air transportation 
constitutes grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff 
Permission to file on less than statutory notice the fares, rates, and 
other tariff provisions covering such newly authorized transportation.
    (4) The fact that a passenger fare is within a statutory or 
Department-established zone of fare flexibility constitutes grounds for 
approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff 
stating that fare and any rules affecting them exclusively, on less than 
statutory notice. The Department's policy on approving such applications 
is set forth in Sec. 399.35 of this chapter.
    (5) Lowered fares and charges. The prospective lowering of fares or 
charges to the traveling public constitutes grounds for approving an 
application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory 
notice a tariff stating the lowered fares or charges and any rules 
affecting them exclusively. However, the Department will not approve the 
application if the proposed tariff raises significant questions of 
lawfulness, as set forth in Sec. 399.35 of this chapter.
    (c) Filing notice required by formal order. When a formal order of 
the Department requires the filing of tariff matter on a stated number 
of days' notice, an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on 
less notice will not be approved. In any such instance a petition for 
modification of the order should be filed in the formal docket.


<R05>
Sec. 221.121  How to prepare and file applications for Special Tariff 
Permission.

    (a) Form. Each application for Special Tariff Permission to file a 
tariff on less than statutory notice shall conform to the requirements 
of Sec. 221.212 if filed electronically.
    (b) Number of paper copies and place of filing. For paper format 
applications, the original and one copy of each such application for 
Special Tariff Permission, including all exhibits thereto and amendments 
thereof, shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation, 
Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
    (c) Who may make application. Applications for Special Tariff 
Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than 
statutory notice shall be made only by the issuing carrier or agent 
authorized to issue and file the proposed tariff. Such application by 
the issuing carrier or agent will constitute application on behalf of 
all carriers participating in the proposed fares, or other tariff 
provisions.
    (d) When notice is required. Notice in the manner set forth in 
paragraph (e) of this section is required when a carrier files an 
application for Special Tariff Permission:

[[Page 76]]

    (1) To offer passenger fares that would be outside a Department-
established zone of price flexibility or, in markets for which the 
Department has not established such a zone, outside the statutory zone 
of price flexibility; or
    (2) To file any price increase or rule change that the carrier 
believes is likely to be controversial.
    (e) Form of notice. When notice of filing of a Special Tariff 
Permission application affecting passenger fares is required by 
paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier shall, when it files the 
application, give immediate telegraphic notice or other notice approved 
by the Office of International Aviation, to all certificated and foreign 
route carriers authorized to provide nonstop or one-stop service in the 
markets involved, and to civic parties that would be substantially 
affected. The application shall include a list of the parties notified.


<R05>
Sec. 221.122  Special Tariff Permission to be used in its entirety 
as granted.

    Each Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff 
provisions on less than statutory notice shall be used in its entirety 
as granted. If it is not desired to use the permission as granted, and 
lesser or more extensive or different permission is desired, a new 
application for Special Tariff Permission conforming with Sec. 221.121 
in all respects and referring to the previous permission shall be filed.


<R05>
Sec. 221.123  Re-use of Special Tariff Permission when tariff is rejected.

    If a tariff containing matter issued under Special Tariff Permission 
is rejected, the same Special Tariff Permission may be used in a tariff 
issued in lieu of such rejected tariff provided that such re-use is not 
precluded by the terms of the Special Tariff Permission, and is made 
within the time limit thereof or within seven days after the date of the 
Department's notice of rejection, whichever is later, but in no event 
later than fifteen days after the expiration of the time limit specified 
in the Special Tariff Permission.


<R04>
                 Subpart N_Waiver of Tariff Regulations


<R05>
Sec. 221.130  Applications for waiver of tariff regulations.

    Applications for waiver or modification of any of the requirements 
of this part 221 or for modification of chapter 415 of the statute with 
respect to the filing and posting of tariffs shall be made by the 
issuing carrier or issuing agent.


<R05>
Sec. 221.131  Form of application for waivers.

    Applications for waivers shall be in the form of a letter addressed 
to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation 
Washington, DC 20590, and shall:
    (a) Specify (by section and paragraph) the particular regulation 
which the applicant desires the Department to waive.
    (b) Show in detail how the proposed provisions will be shown in the 
tariff under authority of such waiver if granted (submitting exhibits of 
the proposed provision where necessary to clearly show this 
information).
    (c) Set forth all facts and circumstances on which the applicant 
relies as warranting the Department's granting the authority requested. 
No tariff or other documents shall be filed pursuant to such application 
prior to the Department's granting the authority requested.


<R04>
         Subpart O_Giving and Revoking Concurrences to Carriers


<R05>
Sec. 221.140  Method of giving concurrence.

    (a) A concurrence prepared in a manner acceptable to the Office of 
International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to 
another carrier to issue and file with the Department tariffs which 
contain joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such 
fares or charges, applying to, from, or via points served by the carrier 
giving the concurrence. A concurrence shall not be used as authority to 
file joint fares or charges in which the carrier to whom the concurrence 
is given does not participate, and

[[Page 77]]

it shall not be used as authority to file local fares or charges.
    (b) Number of copies. Each concurrence shall be prepared in 
triplicate. The original of each concurrence shall be filed with the 
Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the carrier in whose 
favor the concurrence is issued, and the third copy shall be retained by 
the carrier who issued the concurrence.
    (c) Conflicting authority to be avoided. Care should be taken to 
avoid giving authority to two or more carriers which, if used, would 
result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 221.141  Method of revoking concurrence.

    (a) A concurrence may be revoked by filing with the Department a 
Notice of Revocation of Concurrence prepared in a form acceptable to the 
Office of International Aviation.
    (b) Sixty days' notice required. Such Notice of Revocation of 
Concurrence shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the 
Department. A Notice of Revocation of Concurrence will be deemed to be 
filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the period of 
notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.
    (c) Number of copies. Each Notice of Revocation of Concurrence shall 
be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed with the 
Department and, at the same time that the original is transmitted to the 
Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to the carrier to whom 
the concurrence was given. The third copy shall be retained by the 
carrier issuing such notice.
    (d) Amendment of tariffs when concurrence revoked. When a 
concurrence is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or 
tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing carrier of such tariffs, 
on not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than 
the effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Concurrence. In 
the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the provisions 
therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.


<R05>
Sec. 221.142  Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred 
by concurrence.

    If a carrier desires to issue a concurrence conferring less 
authority than a previous concurrence given to the same carrier, the new 
concurrence shall not direct the cancellation of such previous 
concurrence. In such circumstances, such previous concurrence shall be 
revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of Revocation of Concurrence in a 
form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation. Such revocation 
notice shall include reference to the new concurrence.


<R04>
       Subpart P_Giving and Revoking Powers of Attorney to Agents


<R05>
Sec. 221.150  Method of giving power of attorney.

    (a) Prescribed form of power of attorney. A power of attorney 
prepared in accordance with a form acceptable to the Office of 
International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to 
an agent and (in the case of the agent being an individual) such agent's 
alternate to issue and file with the Department tariffs which contain 
local or joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such 
fares or charges, applicable via and for account of such carrier. Agents 
may be only natural persons or corporations (other than incorporated 
associations of air carriers). The authority conferred in a power of 
attorney may not be delegated to any other person.
    (b) Designation of tariff issuing person by corporate agent. When a 
corporation has been appointed as agent it shall forward to the 
Department a certified excerpt of the minutes of the meeting of its 
Board of Directors designating by name and title the person responsible 
for issuing tariffs and filing them with the Department. Only one such 
person may be designated by a corporate agent, and the title of such 
designee shall not contain the word ``Agent''. When such a designee is 
replaced the Department shall be immediately notified in like manner of 
his successor. An officer or employee of an incorporated tariff-
publishing agent may not be authorized to act as tariff agent in his/her 
individual capacity. Every tariff issued

[[Page 78]]

by a corporate agent shall be issued in its name as agent.
    (c) Number of copies. Each power of attorney shall be prepared in 
triplicate. The original of each power of attorney shall be filed with 
the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the agent in 
whose favor the power of attorney is issued, and the third copy shall be 
retained by the carrier who issued the power of attorney.
    (d) Conflicting authority prohibited. In giving powers of attorney, 
carriers shall not give authority to two or more agents which, if used, 
would result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 221.151  Method of revoking power of attorney.

    (a) A power of attorney may be revoked only by filing with the 
Department in the manner specified in this section a Notice of 
Revocation of Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of 
International Aviation.
    (b) Sixty days' notice required. Such Notice of Revocation of Power 
of Attorney shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the 
Department. A Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney will be deemed 
to be filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the 
period of notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.
    (c) Number of copies. Each Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney 
shall be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed 
with the Department and, at the same time that the original is 
transmitted to the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to 
the agent in whose favor the power of attorney was issued (except, if 
the alternate agent has taken over the tariffs, the duplicate of the 
Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be sent to the alternate 
agent). The third copy of the notice shall be retained by the carrier.
    (d) Amendment of tariffs when power of attorney is revoked. When a 
power of attorney is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or 
tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing agent of such tariffs, on 
not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than the 
effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney. 
In the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the 
provisions therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.


<R05>
Sec. 221.152  Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred 
by power of attorney.

    If a carrier desires to issue a power of attorney conferring less 
authority than a previous power of attorney issued in favor of the same 
agent, the new power of attorney shall not direct the cancellation of 
such previous power of attorney. In such circumstances, such previous 
power of attorney shall be revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of 
Revocation of Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of 
International Aviation. Such revocation notice shall include reference 
to the new power of attorney.


<R04>
  Subpart Q_Adoption Publications Required To Show Change in Carrier's 
                  Name or Transfer of Operating Control


<R05>
Sec. 221.160  Adoption notice.

    (a) When the name of a carrier is changed or when its operating 
control is transferred to another carrier (including another company 
which has not previously been a carrier), the carrier which will 
thereafter operate the properties shall immediately issue, file with the 
Department, and post for public inspection, an adoption notice in a form 
and containing such information as is approved by the Office of 
International Aviation. (The carrier under its former name or the 
carrier from whom the operating control is transferred shall be referred 
to in this subpart as the ``former carrier'', and the carrier under its 
new name or the carrier, company, or fiduciary to whom the operating 
control is transferred shall be referred to in this subpart as the 
``adopting carrier''.)
    (b) The adoption notice shall be prepared, filed, and posted as a 
tariff. The adoption notice shall be issued and filed by the adopting 
carrier and not by an agent.
    (c) Copies to be sent to agents and other carriers. At the same time 
that the adoption notice is transmitted to the

[[Page 79]]

adoption notice to each agent and carrier to whom the former carrier has 
given a power of attorney or concurrence. (See Sec. 221.163.)


<R05>
Sec. 221.161  Notice of adoption to be filed in former carrier's tariffs.

    At the same time that the adoption notice is issued, posted, and 
filed pursuant to Sec. 221.160, the adopting carrier shall issue, post 
and file with the Department a notice in each effective tariff issued by 
the former carrier providing specific notice of the adoption in a manner 
authorized by the Office of International Aviation and which shall 
contain no matter other than that authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 221.162  Receiver shall file adoption notices.

    A receiver shall, immediately upon assuming control of a carrier, 
issue and file with the Department an adoption notices as prescribed by 
Sec. Sec. 221.160 and 221.161 and shall comply with the requirements of 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 221.163  Agents' and other carriers' tariffs shall reflect adoption.

    If the former carrier is shown as a participating carrier under 
concurrence in tariffs issued by other carriers or is shown as a 
participating carrier under power of attorney in tariffs issued by 
agents, the issuing carriers and agents of such tariffs shall, upon 
receipt of the adoption notice, promptly file on statutory notice the 
following amendments to their respective tariffs:
    (a) Cancel the name of the former carrier from the list of 
participating carriers.
    (b) Add the adopting carrier (in alphabetical order) to the list of 
participating carriers. If the adopting carrier already participates in 
such tariff, reference to the substitution notice shall be added in 
connection with such carrier's name in the list of participating 
carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 221.164  Concurrences or powers of attorney to be reissued.

    (a) Adopting carrier shall reissue adopted concurrences and powers 
of attorney. Within a period of 120 days after the date on which the 
change in name or transfer of operating control occurs, the adopting 
carrier shall reissue all effective powers of attorney and concurrences 
of the former carrier by issuing and filing new powers of attorney and 
concurrences, in the adopting carrier's name, which shall direct the 
cancellation of the respective powers of attorney and concurrences of 
the former carrier. The adopting carrier shall consecutively number its 
powers of attorney and concurrences in its own series of power of 
attorney numbers and concurrence numbers (commencing with No. 1 in each 
series if it had not previously filed any such instruments with the 
Department), except that a receiver or other fiduciary shall 
consecutively number its powers of attorney or concurrences in the 
series of the former carrier. The cancellation reference shall show that 
the canceled power of attorney or concurrence was issued by the former 
carrier.
    (b) If such new powers of attorney or concurrences confer less 
authority than the powers of attorney or concurrences which they are to 
supersede, the new issues shall not direct the cancellation of the 
former issues; in such instances, the provisions of Sec. Sec. 221.142 
and 221.152 shall be observed. Concurrences and powers of attorney which 
will not be replaced by new issues shall be revoked in the form and 
manner and upon the notice required by Sec. Sec. 221.141 and 221.151.
    (c) Reissue of other carriers' concurrences issued in favor of 
former carrier. Each carrier which has given a concurrence to a carrier 
whose tariffs are subsequently adopted shall reissue the concurrence in 
favor of the adopting carrier. If the carrier which issued the 
concurrence to the former carrier desires to revoke it or desires to 
replace it with a concurrence conferring less authority, the provisions 
of Sec. Sec. 221.141 and 221.142 shall be observed.


<R05>
Sec. 221.165  Cessation of operations without successor.

    If a carrier ceases operations without having a successor, it shall:
    (a) File a notice in each tariff of its own issue and cancel such 
tariff in its entirety.

[[Page 80]]

    (b) Revoke all powers of attorney and concurrences which it has 
issued.

<R05>
Sec. 221.170  Applicability of the subpart.

    (a) Every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall file its 
international passenger fares tariffs consistent with the provisions of 
this subpart, and part 221 generally. Additionally, any air carrier and 
any foreign air carrier may file its international passenger rules 
tariffs electronically in machine-readable form as an alternative to the 
filing of printed paper tariffs as provided for elsewhere in part 221. 
This subpart applies to all carriers and tariff publishing agents and 
may be used by either if the carrier or agent complies with the 
provisions of subpart R. Any carrier or agent that files electronically 
under this subpart must transmit to the Department the remainder of the 
tariff in a form consistent with part 221, Subparts A through Q, on the 
same day that the electronic tariff would be deemed received under Sec. 
221.190(b).
    (b) To the extent that subpart R is inconsistent with the remainder 
of part 221, subpart R shall govern the filing of electronic tariffs. In 
all other respects, part 221 remains in full force and effect.

indemnify and hold harmless the Department and the U.S. Government from 
any claims or liabilities resulting from defects in the equipment, its 
installation or maintenance.
    (3) The filer shall provide public access to its on-line tariff 
database, at Departmental headquarters, during normal business hours.
    (4) The access required at Departmental headquarters by this subpart

Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, as the case may be, on 
Sundays, when necessary, for maintenance or for operational reasons.
    (6) The filer shall ensure that the Department shall have the sole 
ability to approve or disapprove electronically any tariff filed with 
the Department and the ability to note, record and retain electronically 
the reasons for approval or disapproval. The carrier or agent shall not 
make any changes in data or delete data after it has been transmitted 
electronically, regardless of whether it is approved, disapproved, or 
withdrawn. The filer shall be required to make data fields available to 
the Department in any record which is part of the on-line tariff 
database.
    (7) The filer shall maintain all fares and rules filed with the 
Department and all Departmental approvals, disapprovals and other 
actions, as well as all Departmental notations concerning such 
approvals, disapprovals or other actions, in the on-line tariff database

[[Page 81]]

for a period of two (2) years after the fare or rule becomes inactive. 
After this period of time, the carrier or agent shall provide the 
Department, free of charge, with a copy of the inactive data on a 
machine-readable tape or other mutually acceptable electronic medium.
    (8) The filer shall ensure that its on-line tariff database is 
secure against destruction or alteration (except as authorized by the 
Department), and against tampering.
    (9) Should the filer terminate its business or cease filing tariffs,

handle electronic data transmissions to the Department. Further, the 
filer must provide for a secondary or a redundancy circuit in the event 
of the failure of the dedicated circuit. The secondary or redundancy 
circuit must be equal to or greater than 14.4K baud rate. In the event 
of a failure of the primary circuit the filer must notify the Chief of 
the Pricing and Multilateral Affairs Division of the Department's Office 
of International Aviation, as soon as possible, after the failure of the 
primary circuit, but not later than two hours after failure, and must 
provide the name of the contact person at the telephone company who has 
the responsibility for dealing with the problem.
    (c) Each time a filer's on-line tariff database is accessed by any 
user during the sign-on function the following statement shall appear:

    The information contained in this system is for informational 
purposes only, and is a representation of tariff data that has been 
formally submitted to the Department of Transportation in accordance

service shall not preclude the offering of additional services by the 
filer or its agent.

[[Page 86]]

    (c) The filer at its option may establish a charge for providing the 
required subscription service to subscribers: Provided that the charge

the machine-readable data (raw tariff data) of all daily transactions 
made to its on-line tariff database. The terms and prices for such

relationship with, the carrier actually providing the surface 
transportation.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
with respect to control by a direct foreign air carrier, any U.S. or

forwarder may provide the surface portion of intermodal cargo services 
without limitation as to geographic area within the United States.
    (d) The Board may withdraw the authority of an indirect foreign air 
carrier to provide the surface portion of intermodal cargo services, or 
the authority of a direct foreign air carrier to offer intermodal cargo 
services pursuant to joint fares with other carriers providing the 
surface transportation, at any time, with or without hearing, if the 
Board finds it in the public interest.


<R05>

Authorization shall file their objections with the Regulatory Affairs 
Division, Bureau of International Aviation, within 28 days of the filing

    (4) Disapprove the application or approve it subject to such terms, 
conditions, or limitations as may be required by the public interest; or
    (5) Reject the application on the grounds that there is no agreement 
by the United States authorizing the proposed services.
    (b) An order disapproving an application or subjecting it to 
conditions or limitations shall be transmitted to the President for stay 
or disapproval. If the President does not stay or disapprove the Board's

<R05>
Sec. 234.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to set forth required data that certain 
air carriers must submit to the Department and to computer reservations 
system vendors in computerized form, except as otherwise provided, so 
that information on air carriers' quality of service can be made 
available to consumers of air transportation. This part also requires 
that service quality data be disclosed directly to consumers.


<R05>
Sec. 234.2  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part:
    Cancelled flight means a flight operation that was not operated, but 
was listed in a carrier's computer reservation system within seven 
calendar days of the scheduled departure.
    Discontinued flight means a flight dropped from a carrier's computer 
reservation system more than seven calendar days before its scheduled 
departure.
    Diverted flight means a flight which is operated from the scheduled 
origin point to a point other than the scheduled destination point in 
the carrier's published schedule. For example, a carrier has a published 
schedule for a flight from A to B to C. If the carrier were to actually 
fly an A to C operation, the A to B segment is a diverted flight, and 
the B to C segment is a cancelled flight.
    Extra-section flight means a flight conducted as an integral part of 
scheduled passenger service, that has not been provided for in published 
schedules and is required for transportation of traffic that cannot be 
accommodated on the regularly scheduled flight.
    Flight means any nonstop scheduled passenger flight segment with a 
specific flight number scheduled to be operated pursuant to a published 
schedule within a specific origin-destination city pair, other than 
transborder or foreign air transportation. In the case of reporting to 
computer reservations system vendors, flight also means one-stop or 
multi-stop single plane scheduled operations that include any flight 
segments for which performance is reported pursuant to this part.
    Late or late flight means a flight that arrives at the gate 15 
minutes or more after its published arrival time.
    Mishandled-baggage report means a report filed with a carrier by or 
on behalf of a passenger that claims loss, delay, damage or pilferage of 
baggage.
    New flight means a flight added to a carrier's schedule to operate 
in a specific origin-destination city pair and not scheduled to depart 
within 30 minutes of any discontinued flight that was contained in the 
carrier's published schedules for the same city pair during the previous 
month.
    On-time means a flight that arrives less than 15 mintues after its 
published arrival time.
    On-time performance means the percentage of scheduled operations of 
a specific flight that an air carrier operates on-time during a month.
    On-time performance code means a single character determined in 
accordance with the provisions of this part that reflects the monthly 
on-time performance of certain nonstop flights and single plane one-stop 
or multi-stop flights, the schedule and availability of which are listed 
in a computer reservation system (CRS) regulated by 14 CFR part 255.
    Reportable flight means any nonstop flight, including a mechanically 
delayed flight, to or from any airport within the contiguous 48 states 
that accounts for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled-passenger 
enplanements in the previous calendar year, as reported to the 
Department pursuant to part 241 of this title. Qualifying airports will 
be specified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued 
by the Office of Airline Information.
    Reporting carrier means an air carrier certificated under 49 U.S.C. 
41102 that accounted for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled-
passenger revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 of each year, as 
reported to the Department pursuant to part 241 of this title. Reporting 
carriers will be identified periodically in accounting and reporting 
directives issued by the Office of Airline Information.

[[Page 97]]

    Wet-leased flight means a flight operated with a leased aircraft and 
crew.

[Amdt. 234-1, 52 FR 34071, Sept. 9, 1987, as amended by Docket No.

<R05>
Sec. 234.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to certain domestic scheduled passenger flights 
that are held out to the public by certificated air carriers that 
account for at least 1 percent of domestic scheduled passenger revenues. 
Certain provisions also apply to voluntary reporting to on-time 
performance by carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 234.4  Reporting of on-time performance.

    (a) Each reporting carrier shall file BTS Form 234 ``On-Time Flight 
Performance Report'' with the Office of Airline Information on a monthly 
basis, setting forth the information for each of its reportable flights 
held out in the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in the computer 
reservations systems (CRS), or in other schedule publications. The 
reportable flights include, but are not limited to, cancelled flights, 
mechanically cancelled flights, diverted flights, new flights and wet-
leased flights. The report shall be made in the form and manner set 
forth in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Director, 
Office of Airline Statistics, and shall contain the following 
information:
    (1) Carrier and flight number.
    (2) Aircraft tail number.
    (3) Origin and Destination airport codes.
    (4) Published OAG departure and arrival times for each scheduled 
operation of the flight.
    (5) CRS scheduled arrival and departure time for each scheduled 
operation of the flight.
    (6) Actual departure and arrival time for each operation of the 
flight.
    (7) Difference in minutes between OAG and CRS scheduled arrival 
times.
    (8) Difference in minutes between OAG and CRS scheduled departure 
times.
    (9) Actual wheels-off and wheels-on times for each operation of the 
flight.
    (10) Date and day of week of scheduled flight operation.
    (11) Scheduled elapsed time, according to CRS schedule.
    (12) Actual elapsed time.
    (13) Amount of departure delay, if any.
    (14) Amount of arrival delay, if any.
    (15) Amount of elapsed time difference, if any.
    (16) Causal code for cancellation, if any.
    (17) Minutes of delay attributed to the air carrier, if any.
    (18) Minutes of delay attributed to extreme weather, if any.
    (19) Minutes of delay attributed to the national aviation system, if 
any.
    (20) Minutes of delay attributed to security, if any.
    (21) Minutes of delay attributed to a previous late arriving 
aircraft, if any.
    (b) When reporting the information specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section for a diverted flight, a reporting carrier shall use the 
original scheduled flight number and the original scheduled origin and 
destination airport codes. Carriers are not required to report causal 
information for diverted flights.
    (c) A reporting carrier shall report the information specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section for a new flight beginning with the first 
day of the new scheduled operation.
    (d) A reporting carrier shall not report the information specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section for any discontinued or extra-section 
flight.
    (e) Actual arrival, departure and elapsed times shall be measured by 
the times at which the aircraft arrived at and departed from the gate or 
passenger loading area.
    (f) The published arrival time and departure time of a flight shall 
be, respectively, the scheduled arrival and departure times in effect on 
the date of the scheduled operation of the flight, as shown in the most 
recent Official Airline Guide, and in computer reservations systems. 
Each carrier shall designate a single computer reservations system in 
addition to the Official Airline Guide as the sources of scheduled 
arrival time and departure time data in its reports to the Department 
and shall report the scheduled arrival times and departure times listed 
in those sources for each flight. Scheduled elapsed

[[Page 98]]

times, amount of departure and/or arrival delay, and elapsed time 
difference shall be calculated using the scheduled times shown in the 
designated CRS source.
    (g) Reporting carriers should use the following codes to identify 
causes for cancelled flights:

Code
A--Air Carrier
B--Extreme Weather
C--National Aviation System (NAS).
D-Security

    (1) Air Carrier cancellations are due to circumstances that were 
within the control of the air carrier (e.g., lack of flight crew, 
maintenance, etc.).
    (2) Extreme weather cancellations are caused by weather conditions 
(e.g., significant meteorological conditions), actual or forecasted at 
the point of departure, en route, or point of arrival that, in 
accordance with applicable regulatory standards and/or in the judgment 
of the air carrier, prevents operation of that flight and/or prevents 
operations of subsequent flights due to the intended aircraft being out 
of position as a result of a prior cancellation or delay attributable to 
weather.
    (3) NAS cancellations are caused by circumstances within the 
National Aviation System. This term is used to refer to a broad set of 
conditions: weather-non-extreme, airport operations, heavy traffic 
volume, air traffic control, etc.
    (4) Security cancellations may be the result of malfunctioning 
screening or other security equipment or a breech of security that 
causes the evacuation of the airport or individual concourses, or the 
need to re-screen passengers.
    (h) Reporting carriers should use the following causes to identify 
the reasons for delayed flights:

CAUSE
Air Carrier
Extreme weather
NAS
Security
Late arriving aircraft

    (1) Air carrier delays are due to circumstances within the control 
of the air carrier.
    (2) Extreme weather delays are caused by weather conditions (e.g., 
significant meteorological conditions, actual or forecasted at the point 
of departure, en route, or point of arrival that, in accordance with 
applicable regulatory standards and/or in the judgment of the air 
carrier, prevents operation of that flight and/or prevents operations of 
subsequent flights due to the intended aircraft being out of position as 
a result of a prior cancellation or delay attributable to weather.
    (3) NAS delays are caused by circumstances within the National 
Aviation System. This term is used to refer to a broad set of 
conditions: weather-non-extreme, airport operations, heavy traffic 
volume, air traffic control, etc.
    (4) Security delays may be the result of malfunctioning screening or 
other security equipment or a breech of security that causes the 
evacuation of the airport or individual concourses or the need to re-
screen passengers.
    (5) Late arriving aircraft delays are the result of a late incoming 
aircraft from the previous flight.
    (i) When reporting causal codes in paragraph (a) of this section, 
reporting carriers are required to code delays only when the arrival 
delay is 15 minutes or greater; and reporting carriers must report each 
causal component of the reportable delay when the causal component is 5 
minutes or greater.

that is being voluntarily submitted. A carrier that files a voluntary 
report must continue to do so for a period of not less than 12 
consecutive months.


<R05>
Sec. 234.8  Calculation of on-time performance codes.

    (a) Each reporting carrier shall calculate an on-time performance 
code in accordance with this section and as provided in more detail in 
accounting and reporting directives issued by the Director, Office of 
Airline Information. The calculations shall be performed for each 
reportable flight, except those scheduled to operate three times or less 
during a month. In addition, each reporting carrier shall assign an on-
time performance code to each of its single plane one-stop or multi-stop 
flights, or portion thereof, that the carrier holds out to the public 
through a CRS, the last segment of which is a reportable flight.
    (b) The on-time performance code shall be calculated as follows:
    (1) Based on reportable flight data provided to the Department, 
calculate the percentage of on-time arrivals of each nonstop flight. 
Calculations shall not include discontinued or extra-section flights for 
which data are not reported to the Department.
    (2) Based upon the on-time performance percentage calculated in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, assign a single digit code to each 
flight that reflects the percentile of on-time performance achieved by 
the flight, as set forth in the following table:

                           On Time Performance
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Code:                             Percentage
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        9...............................................          90-100
        8...............................................         80-89.9
        7...............................................         70-79.9

        1...............................................         10-19.9
        0...............................................           0-9.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) For a one-stop or multi-stop flight, or portion thereof, listed 
in a CRS, the performance code for the nonstop flight segment arriving 
at the destination listed in the CRS shall be used.
    (4) In the case of a new flight, carriers shall assign a performance 
code consisting of the letter ``N.'' A flight that is not a new flight 
shall be assigned the performance code calculated for the flight that it 
replaces, even if the two flights do not have the same flight number. In 
the case of a flight scheduled to operate three times or less during a 
month, carriers shall assign a performance code consisting of the letter 
``U.''
    (c) Carriers shall calculate on-time performance percentages and 
assign on-time performance codes on a monthly basis. This process shall 
be completed no later than the 15th day of each month, when the reports 
required by this part are due to the Department,

[[Page 100]]

and the codes shall reflect the previous month's operations.

Section 01  Authority Under Which Accounting and Reporting Rules and 
Regulations are Prescribed and Administered

    This Uniform System of Accounts and Reports for Large Certificated 
Air Carriers is issued, prescribed and administered under the following 
provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (72 Stat. 
731, 49 U.S.C. 1301):

                             General Powers

    Sec. 204. (a) The Board is empowered to perform such acts, to 
conduct such investigations, to issue and amend such orders, and to make 
and amend such general or special rules, regulations, and procedure, 
pursuant to and consistent with the provisions of this Act, as it shall 
deem necessary to carry out the provisions of, and to exercise and 
perform its powers and duties under, this Act.

                            filing of reports

    Sec. 407. (a) The Board is empowered to require annual, monthly, 
periodical, and special reports from any air carrier; to prescribe the 
manner and form in which such reports shall be made; and to require from 
any air carrier specific answers to all questions upon which the Board 
may deem information to be necessary. Such reports shall be under oath 
whenever the Board so requires. The Board may also require any air 
carrier to file with it a true copy of each or any contract, agreement, 
understanding, or arrangement, between such air carrier and any other 
carrier or person, in relation to any traffic affected by the provisions 
of this Act.

                      Disclosure of Stock Ownership

    Sec. 407. (b) Each air carrier shall submit annually, and at such 
other times as the Board shall require, a list showing the names of each 
of its stockholders or members holding more than 5 per centum of the 
entire capital stock or capital, as the case may be, of such air 
carrier, together with the name of any person for whose account, if 
other than the holder, such stock is held; and a report setting forth a 
description of the shares of stock, or other interest, held by such air 
carrier, or for its account, in persons other than itself.

                            Form of Accounts

    Sec. 407. (d) The Board shall prescribe the forms of any and all 
accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by air carriers, including 
the accounts, records, and memoranda of the movement of traffic, as well 
as of the receipts and expenditures of money, and the length of time 
such accounts, records, and memoranda shall be preserved; and it shall 
be unlawful for air carriers to keep any accounts, records, or memoranda 
other than those prescribed or approved by the Board: Provided, That any 
air carrier may keep additional accounts, records, or memoranda if they 
do not impair the integrity of the accounts, records, or memoranda 
prescribed or approved by the Board and do not constitute an undue 
financial burden on such air carrier.

                   Inspection of Accounts and Property

    Sec. 407. (e) The Board shall at all times have access to all lands, 
buildings, and equipment of any carrier and to all accounts, records, 
and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and correspondence, now 
or hereafter existing, and kept or required to be kept by air carriers; 
and it may employ special agents or auditors, who shall have authority 
under the orders of the Board to inspect and examine any and all such 
lands, buildings, equipment, accounts, records, and memoranda. The 
provisions of this section shall apply, to the extent found by the Board 
to be reasonably necessary for the administration of this Act, to 
persons having control over any air carrier, or affiliated with any air 
carrier within the meaning of section 5(8) of the Interstate Commerce 
Act, as amended.

                             Classification

    Sec. 416. (a) The Board may from time to time establish such just 
and reasonable classifications or groups of air carriers for the 
purposes of this title as the nature of the services performed by such 
air carriers shall require; and such just and reasonable rules and 
regulations, pursuant to and consistent with the provisions of this 
title, to be observed by each such class or group, as the Board finds 
necessary in the public interest.

                  Safety, Economic and Postal Offenses

    Sec. 901. (a)(1) Any person who violates (A) any provision of Title 
III, IV, V, VI, VII, or XII of this Act, or any rule, regulation, or 
order issued thereunder, or under section 1002(i), or any term, 
condition or limitation of any permit or certificate issued under Title 
IV, or (B) any rule or regulation issued by the Postmaster General under 
this Act, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 
for each such violation. If such violation is a continuing one, each day 
of

[[Page 104]]

such violation shall constitute a separate offense: Provided, That this 
subsection shall not apply to members of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, or those civilian employees of the Department of Defense who are 
subject to the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, while 
engaged in the performance of their official duties; and the appropriate 
military authorities shall be responsible for taking any necessary 
disciplinary action with respect thereto and for making to the 
Administrator or Board, as appropriate, a timely report of any such 
action taken.
    (2) Any such civil penalty may be compromised by the Administrator 
in the case of violations of Titles III, V, VI, or XII, or any rule, 
regulation, or order issued thereunder, or by the Board in the case of 
violations of Titles IV or VII, or any rule, regulation or order issued 
thereunder, or under section 1002(i), or any term, condition, or 
limitation of any permit or certificate issued under Title IV, or by the 
Postmaster General in the case of regulations issued by him. The amount 
of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in 
compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to 
the person charged.

            Failure To File Reports; Falsification of Records

    Sec. 902. (e) Any air carrier, or any officer, agent, employee, or 
representative thereof, who shall, knowingly and willfully, fail or 
refuse to make a report to the Board or Administrator as required by 
this Act, or to keep or preserve accounts, records, and memoranda in the 
form and manner prescribed or approved by the Board or Administrator, or 
shall, knowingly and willfully, falsify, mutilate, or alter any such 
report, account, record, or memorandum, or shall knowingly and willfully 
file any false report, account, record, or memorandum, shall be deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be subject for 
each offense to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $5,000.

                           Refusal To Testify

    Sec. 902. (g) Any person who shall neglect or refuse to attend and 
testify, or to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce books, papers, 
or documents, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpena or 
lawful requirement of the Board or Administrator, shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of 
not less than $100 nor more than $5,000, or imprisonment for not more 
than one year, or both.

                     Filing of Complaints Authorized

    Sec. 1002. (a) Any person may file with the Administrator or the 
Board, as to matters within their respective jurisdictions, a complaint 
in writing with respect to anything done or omitted to be done by any 
person in contravention of any provisions of this Act, or of any 
requirement established pursuant thereto. If the person complained 
against shall not satisfy the complaint and there shall appear to be any 
reasonable ground for investigating the complaint, it shall be the duty 
of the Administrator or the Board to investigate the matters complained 
of. Whenever the Administrator or the Board is of the opinion that any 
complaint does not state facts which warrant an investigation or action, 
such complaint may be dismissed without hearing. In the case of 
complaints against a member of the Armed Forces of the United States 
acting in the performance of his official duties, the Administrator or 
the Board, as the case may be, shall refer the complaint to the 
Secretary of the department concerned for action. The Secretary shall, 
within ninety days after receiving such a complaint, inform the 
Administrator or the Board of his disposition of the complaint, 
including a report as to any corrective or disciplinary actions taken.

         Investigations on Initiative of Administrator or Board

    Sec. 1002. (b) The Administrator or Board, with respect to matters 
within their respective jurisdictions, is empowered at any time to 
institute an investigation, on their own initiative, in any case and as 
to any matter or thing within their respective jurisdictions, concerning 
which complaint is authorized to be made to or before the Administrator 
or Board by any provision of this Act, or concerning which any question 
may arise under any of the provisions of this Act, or relating to the 
enforcement of any of the provisions of this Act. The Administrator or 
the Board shall have the same power to proceed with any investigation 
instituted on their own motion as though it had been appealed to by 
complaint.

                 Entry or Orders for Compliance With Act

    Sec. 1002. (c) If the Administrator or the Board finds, after notice 
and hearing, in any investigation instituted upon complaint or upon 
their own initiative, with respect to matters within their jurisdiction, 
that any person has failed to comply with any provision of this Act or 
any requirement established pursuant thereto, the Administrator or the 
Board shall issue an appropriate order to compel such person to comply 
therewith.

<R05>
Section 04  Air Carrier Groupings

    (a) All large certificated air carriers are placed into three basic 
air carrier groupings based upon their level of operations and the 
nature of these operations. In order to determine the level of 
operations, total operating revenues for a twelve-month period are used. 
The following operating revenue ranges are used to establish air carrier 
groupings:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Carrier Group               Total Annual Operating Revenues
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I..............................  0-$100,000,000
II.............................  $100,000,001-$1,000,000,000
III............................  $1,000,000,001+
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 113]]

    For reporting purposes, Group I air carriers are further divided 
into two subgroups: (1) Air carriers with total annual operating 
revenues from $20,000,000 to $100,000,000 and (2) Air carriers with 
total annual operating revenues below $20,000,000.
    (b) Both the criteria for establishing air carrier groupings and the 
assignment of each air carrier to a specific group of carriers will be 
reviewed periodically by the Director, Office of Airline Information, to 
assure the maintenance of appropriate standards for the grouping of 
carriers. When an air carrier's level of operations passes the upper or 
lower limit of its currently assigned carrier grouping, the carrier is 
not automatically transferred to a different group and a new level of 
reporting. The Office of Airline Statistics will issue an updated 
listing of the carrier groups on an annual basis. A carrier may petition 
for reconsideration of its assigned carrier grouping or request a waiver 
from the accounting and reporting requirements that are applicable to a 
particular group under the provisions of section 1-2 of this Uniform 
System of Accounts and Reports.

                      General Accounting Provisions


<R05>
Section 1  Introduction to System of Accounts and Reports


<R05>
Sec. 1-1  Applicability of system of accounts and reports.

    Each large certificated air carrier shall keep its books of account, 
records and memoranda and make reports to the BTS in accordance with 
this system of accounts and reports. The BTS reserves the right, 
however, under the provisions of sections 49 U.S.C. 41701 and 41708, to 
expand or otherwise modify the classes of carriers subject to this 
system of accounts and reports.

[ER-1400, 50 FR 11, Jan. 2, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 
1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1-2  Waivers from this system of accounts and reports.

    A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts or reports 
may be made by the BTS upon its own initiative or upon the submission of 
written request therefor from any air carrier, or group of air carriers, 
provided that such a waiver is in the public interest and each request 
for waiver expressly demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or 
unusual circumstances warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or 
technique; a specifically defined alternative procedure or technique 
will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of 
operating results or financial condition, consistent with the principles 
embodied in the provisions of this system of accounts and reports; and 
the application of such alternative procedure will maintain or improve 
uniformity in substantive results as between air carriers.

[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 
26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1-3  General description of system of accounts and reports.

    (a) This system of accounts and reports is designed to permit 
limited contraction or expansion to reflect the varying needs and 
capacities of different air carriers without impairing basic accounting 
comparability as between air carriers. In its administration three air 
carrier groups, designated Group I, Group II, and Group III, 
respectively (see section 04), are established by the BTS. This grouping 
will be reviewed from time to time upon petition of individual air 
carriers or by initiative of the BTS with the view of a possible 
regrouping of the air carriers.
    (b) Under the system of accounts prescribed, balance sheet elements 
are accounted for by all air carrier groups within a fixed uniform 
pattern of specific accounts. All profit and loss elements are accounted 
for within specific objective accounts established for each air carrier 
group resulting from dual classifications, designated for each air 
carrier group, which are descriptive of both basic areas of financial 
activity, or functional operation, and objective served. The profit and 
loss elements of the three air carrier groups can be reduced to broad 
objectives and general or functional classifications which are 
comparable for all air carrier groups. Both balance sheet and profit and 
loss accounts and account groupings are designed, in general, to embrace 
all activities, both air transport and other than air transport, in 
which the air carrier engages and provide for the separation of elements 
identifiable exclusively with other than air transport activities. 
Profit and loss elements which

[[Page 114]]

are recorded during the current accounting year are subclassified as 
between (1) those which relate to the current accounting year and 
adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to prior accounting years, 
and (2) extraordinary items of material magnitude.
    (c) In order to afford air carriers as much flexibility and freedom 
as possible in establishing ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet their 
individual needs, a minimum number of account subdivisions have been 
prescribed in this Uniform System of Accounts. It is intended, however, 
that each air carrier, in maintaining its accounting rec ords, will 
provide subaccount and subsidiary account segregations of accounting 
elements which differ in nature of accounting characteristics, in a 
manner which will render individual elements readily discernible and 
traceable throughout the accounting system, and will provide for 
relating profit and loss elements to applicable balance sheet 
counterparts.

[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 
26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1-4  System of accounts coding.

    (a) A four digit control number is assigned for each balance sheet 
and profit and loss account. Each balance sheet account is numbered 
sequentially, within blocks, designating basic balance sheet 
classifications. The first two digits of the four digit code assigned to 
each profit and loss account denote a detailed area of financial 
activity or functional operation. The first two digits, thus assigned to 
each profit and loss account, are numbered sequentially within blocks, 
designating more general classifications of financial activity and 
functional operation. The second two digits assigned to profit and loss 
accounts denote objective classifications.
    (b) A fifth digit, appended as a decimal, has been assigned for 
internal control by the BTS of prescribed subdivisions of the primary 
objective balance sheet and profit and loss classifications. A different 
fifth digit code number from that assigned by the BTS may be adopted for 
internal recordkeeping by the air carrier provided the prescribed 
subclassification of objective accounts is not impaired and the code 
number assigned by the BTS is employed in reporting to the BTS on Form 
41 Reports.

    (a) The general books of account and all books, records, and 
memoranda which support in any way the entries therein shall be kept in 
such manner as to provide at any time full information relating to any 
account. The entries in each account shall be supported by such detailed 
information as will render certain the identification of all facts 
essential to a verification of the nature and character of each entry 
and its proper classification under the prescribed Uniform System of 
Accounts. Registers, or other appropriate records, shall be maintained 
of the history and nature of each note receivable and each note payable.

sections 21(g) and for each separate corporate or organizational 
division of the air carrier. For purposes of this Uniform System of 
Accounts and Reports, each nontransport entity conducting an activity 
which is not related to the air carrier's transport activities and each 
transport-related activity or group of activities qualifying as a 
nontransport venture pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, whether 
or not formally organized within a distinct organizational unit, shall 
be treated as a separately operated organizational division; except that 
provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (b) shall not apply to 
leasing activities.
    (b) As a general rule, any activity or group of activities 
comprising a transport-related service provided for in transport-related 
revenue and expense accounts 09 through 18 shall be considered a 
separate nontransport venture under circumstances in which either: (1) A 
separate corporate or legal entity has been established to perform such 
services, (2) the aggregate annual revenue rate, as determined in 
section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater 
of $1 million per annum or one percent of the air carrier's total annual 
transport revenues, or (3) the aggregate annual expense rate, as 
determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years 
exceeds the greater of $1 million or one percent of the carrier's total 
annual operating expenses: Provided, That revenues and expenses from in-
flight sales, and interchange sales shall be considered related to air 
transportation and accounted for accordingly, regardless of the revenue 
or expense standard set forth above.
    (c) The records for each required accounting entity shall be 
maintained with sufficient particularity to permit a determination that 
the requirements of section 2-1 have been complied with.

Section 2  General Accounting Policies


<R05>
Sec. 2.1  Generally accepted accounting principles.

    (a) The accounting provisions contained in this part are based on 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Persons subject to this 
part are authorized to implement, as prescribed by the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board, newly issued GAAP pronouncements until and 
unless the Director, Office of Airline Information (OAI), issues an 
Accounting Directive making an initial determination that implementation 
of a new pronouncement would adversely affect the Department's programs.
    (b) The Director, OAI, shall review each newly issued GAAP 
pronouncement to determine its affect on the Department's regulatory 
programs. If adopting a specific change in GAAP would adversely affect 
the Department's programs, the Director will issue the results of the 
review in the form of an Accounting Directive. The directive will state 
the reasons why the particular change should not be incorporated in the 
uniform system of accounts and contain accounting guidance for 
maintaining the integrity of the Department's air carrier accounting 
provisions.
    (c) Objections and comments relating to the Department's decision 
not to implement a change in generally accepted principles may be 
addressed to Director, Office of Airline Information,

[[Page 116]]

K-25, Room 4125, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh St., 
SW., Washington, DC 20590. If significant objections are raised urging 
adoption of a particular GAAP pronouncement, the Department will 
institute a rulemaking.

Sec. 2-2  Basis of allocation between entities.

    (a) The provisions of this section shall apply to each person 
controlling an air carrier, each person controlled by the air carrier, 
as well as each transport entity and organizational division of the air 
carrier for which separate records must be maintained pursuant to 
section 1-6.
    (b) Each transaction shall be recorded and placed initially under 
accounting controls of the particular air transport entity or 
organizational division of the air carrier or member of an affiliated 
group to which directly traceable. If applicable to two or more 
accounting entities, a proration shall be made from the entity of 
original recording to other participating entities on such basis that 
the statements of financial condition and operating results of each 
entity are comparable to those of distinct legal entities. The 
allocations involved shall include all debits and credits associated 
with each entity.
    (c) For purposes of this section, investments by the air carrier in 
resources or facilities used in common by the regulated air carrier and 
those transport-related revenue services defined as separate 
nontransport ventures under section 1-6(b) shall not be allocated 
between such entities but shall be reflected in total in the appropriate 
accounts of the entity which predominately uses those investments. Where 
the entity of predominate use is a nontransport venture, the air carrier 
shall reflect the investment in account 1510.3, Advances to Associated 
Companies.
    (d) For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, all 
revenues shall be assigned to or apportioned between accounting entities 
on bases which will fully recognize the services provided by each 
entity, and expenses, or costs, shall be apportioned between accounting 
entities on such bases as will result: (1) With respect to transport-
related services, in the assignment thereto of proportionate direct 
overheads, as well as direct labor and materials, of the applicable 
expense functions prescribed by this system of accounts and reports, and 
(2) with respect to separate ventures, in the assignment thereto of 
proportional general and administrative overheads as well as the direct 
overheads, labor, and materials.

Sec. 2-3  Distribution of revenues and expenses within entities.

    (a) Revenues and expenses attributable to a single natural objective 
account or functional classification shall be assigned accordingly.
    (b) Revenue and expense items which are common to two or more 
natural objective accounts shall be recorded in the objective accounts 
to which they predominantly relate.
    (c) Expense items contributing to more than one function shall be 
charged to the general overhead functions to which applicable except 
that where only incidental contribution is made to more than a single 
function an item may be included in the function to which primarily 
related, provided such function is not distorted by including an 
aggregation of amounts applicable to other functions. When assignment of 
expense items on the basis of the primary activity to which related does 
not in the aggregate result in a fair presentation of the expenses 
applicable to each function, apportionment shall be made between 
functions based upon a study of the contribution to each function during 
a representative period.

of Accounts shall be the calendar year unless otherwise approved by the 
BTS.
    (b) Each air carrier shall keep its financial accounts and records 
on a full accrual basis for each quarter so that all transactions, as 
nearly as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be fully reflected in the 
air carrier's books for the quarter in which revenues have been earned 
and the costs attaching to the revenues so earned in each quarter have 
been incurred independently of the incidence of sales or purchases and 
settlement with debtors or creditors.
    (c) Expenditures incurred during the current accounting year which 
demonstrably benefit operations to be performed during subsequent 
accounting years to a significant extent shall be deferred and amortized 
to the period in which the related operations are performed when of 
sufficient magnitude to distort the accounting results of the year in 
which incurred.
    (d) Expenditures charged directly or amortized to operations within 
one accounting year shall not be reversed in a subsequent accounting 
year and reamortized or charged directly against operations of 
subsequent years except that retroactive adjustments are permitted where 
necessary to conform with adjustments required by the DOT for ratemaking 
purposes.

determine earned revenue, the analysis supporting the physical inventory 
verification shall include:
    (1) The cutoff date for the liability to be verified; such cutoff 
date shall be at the end of a calendar month.
    (2) A trial balance as of the cutoff date of all subaccounts 
supporting the Air Traffic Liability control account; the subsidiary 
trial balance must agree with the Air Traffic Liability control account 
or a reconciliation statement furnished.

all unmatched auditor coupons has been compiled and compared to the 
general ledger control figure; the statement required by this 
subparagraph shall indicate whether or not the value of the unmatched

allocated, or if of minor significance in relation to the cost of such 
property, such amounts may be charged to balance sheet account 1890 
Other Assets and Deferred Charges and cleared either by a suitable 
``loading charge'' as the parts are used or by current charges to 
appropriate expense or property accounts; so long as the method of 
application does not cause material distortion in operating expenses 
from one accounting period to another.
    (c) Reusable spare parts and supplies recovered in connection with 
construction, maintenance, or retirement of property and equipment shall 
be included in this account at fair and reasonable values but in no case 
shall such values exceed original cost. Recoveries of normally reparable 
and reusable parts of a type for which losses in value may be covered on 
a practical basis through valuation allowance provisions shall be 
included in this account on an original cost basis. Scrap and nonusable 
parts, expensed from this account and recovered, shall be included at

this account which ordinarily are repaired and reused and possess a 
service life approximating that of the primary property types to which 
related shall not be recorded in this account but in balance sheet 
account 1608 Flight Equipment Rotable Parts and Assemblies. For purposes 
of identifying rotable parts and assemblies of insignificant unit value 
which may be included in this account, a reasonable maximum unit value 
limitation may be established.
    (e) Any losses sustained or gains realized upon the abandonment or 
other disposition of flight equipment expendable parts shall be taken up 
as capital gains or losses in the periods in which sustained or 
realized. (See balance sheet account 1311.)

accounts as issued for use. Profit and loss on sales of inventory items 
as a routine service to others shall be included in profit and loss 
accounts 14 General Service Sales--Associated Companies, or 16 General 
Service Sales--Outside, and the parts sold shall be removed from this 
accounts at full cost.
    (g) Materials and supplies held in small supply and purchased 
currently may be charged to appropriate expense accounts when purchased.
    (h) An allowance for inventory adjustment applicable to materials

1311 Allowance for Obsolescence--Spare Parts and Supplies.
    (a) Accruals shall be made to this account when allowances are 
established for losses in the value of expendable parts. The accruals to 
this account shall be made by charges to profit and loss account 73 
Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration--Expendable Parts. Records 
shall be maintained with sufficient detail to permit association of the 
allowances with each class or type of expendable parts.
    (b) The accruals to this account shall be based upon a 
predetermination by the air carrier of that portion of the total 
inventory of each class and type of expendable parts against which an 
allowance for loss is to be accrued. Expendable parts issued for use in 
operations shall be charged to operating expenses as issued and shall 
not be charged to this account. If at the end of any calendar year the 
amount of the allowance exceeds the product of the applicable inventory 
for the year determined consistently on a year-end or average basis, and 
the sum of the standard percentage accrual rates for all prior years 
including the current, the allowance shall be adjusted downward by the 
amount of the excess. Such adjustments shall be charged to this account 
and credited to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence 
and Deterioration--Expendable Parts.
    (c) Where changing conditions necessitate a revision or adjustment 
in rates of accrual, such revision or adjustment shall be made 
applicable to current and subsequent accounting periods and shall not be 
applied retroactively to prior accounting periods. Following retirement 
of airframe or aircraft engine types to which related, any balance 
remaining in this account shall be offset against related balances 
carried in balance sheet account 1300 Spare Parts and Supplies and the 
net cleared to profit and loss accounts 88.5 Capital Gains and Losses--
Operating Property or 88.6 Capital Gains and Losses--Other.

carrier; (2) those related to services conducted by the air carrier 
which are extraneous to or are not otherwise related to the air

suspense pending status determination in terms of possible contribution 
to the air transportation services and inauguration of the service or 
operation to which related.
    (e) Amounts included in this account which contribute to or protect 
the position of the normal air transportation services currently 
conducted by the carrier shall be amortized to profit and loss account

for the depreciated cost of property damaged or destroyed, costs for 
clearing wrecks and damaged property and equipment, including salaries 
and wages for the repair thereof, and payments for damages to property 
of others. The cost of casualties shall not be charged directly against 
retained earnings or appropriations thereof, but shall be cleared 
through the applicable profit and loss accounts in accordance with the 
foregoing.

Section 8  General

    (a) The profit and loss accounts are designed to reflect, through 
natural groupings, the elements entering into the derivation of income 
or loss accruing to the proprietary interests during each accounting 
period.
    (b) The prescribed system of accounts provides for the co-ordinate 
grouping of all revenues and expenses in terms of

[[Page 135]]

both major natural objectives and functional activities and for 
subdivision of both to provide varying degrees of detail for air 
carriers of differing accounting capacities and/or requirements.
    (c) The detailed objective accounts established for each air carrier 
group, by the dual subdivision of profit and loss elements in terms of 
both natural objectives and functional activities, are set forth in 
section 7, Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts.
    (d) The prescribed system of accounts provides generally that profit 
and loss elements shall be grouped in accordance with their inherent 
characteristics within the following primary classifications:
    (1) Operating revenues. (i) This primary classification shall 
include revenues of a character usually and ordinarily derived from the 
performance of air transportation and air transportation-related 
services, which relate to services performed during the current 
accounting year, and adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to 
services performed in prior accounting years.
    (ii) Operating revenues shall be subclassified in terms of 
functional activities as provided in section 9.
    (2) Operating expenses. (i) This primary classification shall 
include expenses of a character usually and ordinarily incurred in the 
performance of air transportation and air transportation-related 
services, which relate to services performed during the current 
accounting year, and adjustments of a recurring nature attributable to 
services performed in prior accounting years.
    (ii) Operating expenses shall be subclassified in terms of 
functional activities as provided in sections 10 and 11.
    (3) Nonoperating income and expense--net. This primary 
classification (8100) shall include income and loss incident to 
commercial ventures not inherently related to the performance of the 
common carrier air transport services of the accounting entity; other 
revenues and expenses attributable to financing or other activities 
which are extraneous to and not an integral part of air transportation 
or its incidental services; and special recurrent items of a nonperiod 
nature.
    (4) Income taxes for current period. This primary classification 
(9100) shall include provisions for Federal, state, local, and foreign 
taxes which are based upon the net income of the air carrier for the 
current period together with refunds for excess profits credits or 
carryback of losses and increases or reductions of income taxes of prior 
years of a magnitude which will not distort net income of the current 
accounting year. Income taxes applicable to special income credits or 
debits recorded in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary 
Items, and other material income tax items not allocable to income of 
the current accounting year, shall not be included in this 
classification but in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary 
Items.
    (5) Discontinued operations. This primary classification (9600) 
shall include earnings and losses of discontinued nontransport 
operations and gains or losses from the disposal of nontransport 
operations the result of which are customarily accounted for through 
profit and loss objective accounts 86, 87 and 88.2.
    (6) Extraordinary items. This primary classification (9700) shall 
include material items characterized by their unusual nature and 
infrequent occurrence.
    (7) Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. This 
primary classification (9800) shall include the cumulative effect of 
material changes in accounting principles.

    (e) Each Group I air carrier shall maintain the following 
subfunctions:

[[Page 137]]

                        5200 Direct Maintenance.

    a. This subfunction shall include the costs of labor, materials and 
outside services consumed directly in periodic maintenance operations 
and the maintenance and repair of property and equipment, of all types 
and classes, regardless of the location at which incurred, exclusive of 
costs specifically identified with maintenance property and equipment 
expenses in balance sheet accounts 1630 Equipment, 1639 Improvements to 
Leased Buildings and Equipment, and 1640.1 Maintenance Buildings and 
Improvements which shall be included in subfunction 5300 Maintenance 
Burden.
    b. The cost of direct labor, materials and supplies, as well as 
outside repairs, used in the maintenance and repair of property and 
equipment shall be recorded on running job orders or tickets covering 
repairs and periodic inspections except servicing. Where a number of 
like items are maintained on a group basis, it will be necessary to 
maintain only one job order for each group.
    c. When supervisory personnel such as crew chiefs, inspectors and 
foremen are engaged in direct labor in connection with equipment 
maintenance, a proportionate part of their salaries and wages shall be 
charged to the appropriate direct labor accounts. The cost of 
transporting property to and from shops for repair and maintenance shall 
be included as a part of the cost of the materials and supplies used in 
the repair or maintenance of such property and equipment. Transportation 
charges, customs and duties, etc.; shall be included in the cost of 
repairs and maintenance operations when made by outside parties.

                        5300 Maintenance Burden.

    a. This subfunction shall include all overhead or general expenses 
which are specifically identified with activities involved in periodic 
maintenance operations and the maintenance and repair of property and 
equipment of all types and classes, including the cost of direct labor, 
materials and outside services identified with the maintenance and 
repair of maintenance property and equipment included in balance sheet 
accounts 1630 Equipment, 1639 Improvements to Leased Buildings and 
Equipment, and 1604.1 Maintenance Buildings and Improvements. It shall 
include expenses specifically related to the administration of 
maintenance stocks and stores, the keeping of pertinent maintenance 
operations records, and the scheduling, controlling, planning and 
supervision of maintenance operations.
    b. This subfunction shall not include expenses related to financial 
accounting, purchasing or other overhead activities which are of general 
applicability to all operating functions. Such expenses shall be 
included in function 6900 General Services and Administration.
    c. This subfunction shall include only those expenses attributable 
to the current air transport operations of the air carrier. Maintenance 
burden associated with capital projects of the air carrier, other than 
overhauls of airframes and aircraft engines shall be allocated to such 
projects. Maintenance burden incurred in common with services to other 
companies and operating entities shall be allocated to such services on 
a pro rata basis unless the services are so infrequent in performance or 
small in volume as to result in no appreciable demands upon the air 
carrier's maintenance facilities. When overhauls of airframes or 
aircraft engines are as a consistent practice accounted for on an 
accrual basis instead of being expensed directly, maintenance burden 
shall be allocated to such overhauls on a pro rata basis. Standard 
burden rates may be employed for quarterly allocations of maintenance 
burden provided the rates are reviewed at the close of each calendar 
year. When the actual burden rate for the year differs materially from 
the standard burden rate applied, adjustment shall be made to reflect 
the actual cost incurred for the full accounting year. Allocations of 
maintenance burden to capital projects, and service sales to others 
shall be made through the individual maintenance burden objective 
accounts, except that the air carrier may make such allocations by 
credits to profit and loss account 77 Uncleared Expense Credits provided 
that use of that account will not undermine the significance of the 
individual maintenance burden objective accounts in terms of the expense 
levels associated with the air carrier's air transport services. 
Maintenance burden allocated to overhauls shall be credited to profit 
and loss subaccounts 5372.1 or 5372.6 Airworthiness Allowance 
Provisions.

Section 12  Objective Classification--Operating Revenues and Expenses

00 General Instructions.
    (a) Basic objective accounts, applicable to all air carrier groups, 
are established for recording all revenue and expense elements. These 
basic accounts are in certain areas subdivided to provide greater detail 
for indicated air carrier groups.
    (b) Each air carrier shall credit the gross revenues accruing from 
services ordinarily associated with air transportation and 
transportation-related services to the appropriate account established 
for each revenue source. Expenses incident to transport and transport-
related services shall be charged to the accounts established in this 
section in accordance with the objectives served by each expenditure. 
However, direct costs of forwarding traffic as a result of interrupted 
trips, and refunds of sales, shall be charged to the applicable revenue 
account.
    (c) To the end that the integrity of the prescribed objective 
accounts shall not be impaired, each air carrier shall:
    (1) Charge the appropriate account prescribed for each service 
purchased or expense element incurred expressly for the benefit of the 
air carrier regardless of whether incurred directly by the air carrier 
or through an agent or other intermediary, and (2) except as provided in 
objective account 77, Uncleared Expense Credits, credit or charge, as 
appropriate, the account prescribed for each expense element which may 
be involved in distributions of expenses between (i) separate operating 
entities of the air carrier, (ii) transport-related services and 
transport services, or transport functions, (iii) balance sheet and 
profit and loss elements, and (iv) the air carrier and others, when the 
expenses are incurred initially by or for the benefit of the air 
carrier. At the option of the air carrier, standard rates applicable to 
each objective account comprising a particular pool of expenses subject 
to assignment between two or more activities, may be established for 
proration purposes, provided the rates established are predicated upon 
the experience of the air carrier and are reviewed and modified as 
appropriate at least once each year.

                           Transport Revenues

01 Passenger.
    (a) Record here revenue from the transportation of passengers by 
air, including infants transported at reduced fares, berth charges,

Sec. 19-7  Passenger origin-destination survey.

    (a) All U.S. large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled 
passenger operations (except helicopter carriers) shall participate in a 
Passenger Origin-Destination ( O & D) Survey covering domestic and 
international operations, as described in the instructions manual 
entitled, Instructions to Air Carriers for Collecting and Reporting 
Passenger Origin-Destination Survey Statistics (Appendix A to this 
section), and in Passenger Origin-Destination Directives issued by the 
Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), Office of 
Airline Information (OAI). Copies of these Instructions and Directives 
are provided to each large carrier participating in the Survey. Copies 
are also available from the Office of Airline Information, K-25, Room 
4125, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh St., SW., 
Washington, DC 20590.
    (b) Those participating air carriers that have access to automatic 
data processing (ADP) services shall utilize magnetic tape, cartridge, 
floppy diskette or other ADP media for transmitting the prescribed data. 
Those carriers without ADP capability should contact the Office of 
Airline Information for further instructions ((202) 366-4373).
    (c) A statistically valid sample of light coupons shall be selected 
for reporting purposes. The sample shall consist of at least 1 percent 
of the total lifted ticket flight coupons for all large domestic markets 
listed in the Instructions and 10 percent for all others--including 
domestic and international markets. The sample shall be selected and 
reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of their 
section, except that the participating O & D carriers with nonstandard 
ticketing procedures, or other special operating characteristics, may 
propose alternative procedures. Such departures from standard O & D 
Survey practices shall not be authorized unless approved in writing by 
the Director, Office of Airline Information under the procedures in Sec. 
1-2 of 14 CFR part 241. The data to be recorded and reported from 
selected lifted ticket flight coupons, as stipulated in the Instructions 
and Directives shall include the

[[Page 165]]

following data elements: Point of origin, carrier on each flight-coupon 
stage, fare-basis code for each flight-coupon stage, points of stopover 
or connection (interline and intraline), point of destination, number of 
passengers, and total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax).
    (d) Data covering the operations of foreign air carriers that are 
similar to the information collected in the Passenger Origin-Destination 
Survey are generally not available to the Department, the U.S. carriers, 
or U.S. interests. Therefore, because of the damaging competitive impact 
on U.S. carriers and the adverse effect upon the public interest that 
would result from unilateral disclosure of the U.S. survey data, the 
Department has determined its policy to be that the international data 
in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey shall be disclosed only as 
follows:
    (1) To an air carrier directly participating in and contributing 
input data to the Survey or to a legal or consulting firm designated by 
an air carrier to use on its behalf O & D data in connection with a 
specific assignment by such carrier.
    (2) To parties to any proceeding before the Department to the extent 
that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding 
upon a determination to this effect by the Administrative Law Judge or 
by the Department's decision-maker. Any data to which access is granted 
pursuant to this section may be introduced into evidence subject to the 
normal rules of admissability of evidence.
    (3) To agencies and other components of the U.S. Government.
    (4) To other persons upon a showing that the release of the data 
will serve specifically identified needs of U.S. users which are 
consistent with U.S. interests.
    (5) To foreign governments and foreign users as provided in formal 
reciprocal arrangements between the foreign and U.S. governments for the 
exchange of comparable O & D data.
    (e) The Department reserves the right to make such other disclosures 
of the O & D data as is consistent with its regulatory functions and 
responsibilities.

                        B. Narrative Description

    A single O&D Survey is conducted continuously by the large U.S. 
certificated air carriers. Foreign air carriers do not directly 
participate in the Survey, although some of their data are captured in 
the Survey, since passengers who share a ticketed itinerary between a 
U.S. carrier and a foreign carrier may be sampled by the U.S. carrier. 
The authority for these instructions is found in 14 CFR part 241, 
section 19-7, and in the CAB Sunset Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 94-443).
    The Survey samples revenue passenger trips moving in whole or in 
part on domestic and/or international scheduled services of the carriers 
participating in the Survey. In general, these requirements do not apply 
to small certificated, all-cargo and all charter carriers.
    The source documents for the Survey data are passenger tickets. 
These data are collected from the ``lifted'' flight coupons of tickets 
(a portion of a multi-part ticket booklet of three \1\ or more coupons, 
including one for each stage of the passenger's trip itinerary which is 
lifted by the carrier as the passenger boards a particular flight 
segment).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Each ticket booklet is comprised of one or more flight coupons 
for passenger travel in a city-pair market, plus a passenger coupon (the 
traveler's receipt) and the auditor coupon (for the carrier's internal 
controls).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Survey data are taken from the coupon that is lifted by a 
participating carrier, unless it is apparent from the lifted coupon that 
another participating carrier has already recorded and reported the 
data, in which instance the ticket coupon is non-reportable for the 
second honoring/participating carrier. The complete passenger itinerary, 
and related data on type of fare and dollar value of the ticket, is 
recorded as

[[Page 167]]

one entry from the sampled, reportable flight coupon.
    The recording of data from the sampled flight coupon normally 
consists of transcribing the information exactly as indicated on the 
ticket. The detail recorded for each trip shows the complete routing 
from the origin city (airport code) to the destination city (airport 
code) including, in sequence from the origin, each point of transfer and 
stopover (intraline and interline), the summarized fare-basis code shown 
for each flight coupon stage of the itinerary, and the total dollar 
value of the fare and tax for the entire ticket.
    Prior to 1987, the Survey was generally based on a 10-percent sample 
of passenger tickets. Beginning July 1, 1987, the Survey is collected 
primarily on the basis of a stratified, scientific sample of at least 1 
percent of tickets in domestic major markets and 10 percent of tickets 
in all other domestic and in all international city-pair markets. The 
Survey data are taken from the selected flight coupons of the tickets 
sampled: single-coupon or double-coupon round trips in domestic major 
markets where the ticket serial number ends in double zero (00) and all 
other ticket coupons ending in zero (0). This procedure yields a ``two-
tiered'' stratified sample.
    Group tickets are included on the basis of a 10-percent sample when 
the number of passengers on such a group ticket is 10 or less. Group 
tickets with more than 10 passengers on each ticket are included on the 
basis of a 100 percent census, i.e., all such tickets are sampled, 
regardless of serial number, and the total data listed are conformed to 
a 10 percent sample for inclusion in the O&D Survey.
    Following the selection of reportable flight coupons and the 
recording of data, each participating carrier shall edit and summarize 
\2\ the data into a quarterly report to the Department.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ These summarization procedures include showing two or more 
passengers with the same itinerary as one O&D record and compressing 
extremely lengthy itineraries (such as around-the-world tickets) into a 
standard trip stage length limit (which may be either seven or twenty-
three stages, at the carrier's option), as explained in Section V.D.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   II. Effective Date of Instructions

    These data collection and reporting instructions are effective on 
and after July 1, 1987 and apply to all flight coupons lifted on or 
after July 1, 1987.

                  III. Carriers Participating in Survey

    A. Participating carriers. As defined in section 19-7 of the 
Department's Economic Regulations (14 CFR part 241), the participants in 
the O&D Survey include all large certificated air carriers conducting 
scheduled passenger services (except helicopter carriers). These 
participating carriers collect and report data in accordance with these 
Instructions, and supplemental Passenger Origin-Destination Directives 
that may be issued periodically. The list of participating carriers will 
be issued by reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 
385.27(b).
    B. Amendments to list of participating carriers. As new carriers 
begin service, they will be required to file O&D Survey Data. These 
carriers will not be added to the participating carrier list 
automatically, but will be added when the next annual review is made.

                        IV. Submission of Reports

    A. Period covered by reports. Reports are to be filed for each 
calendar quarter of the year as shown below:

    (1) ADP media including magnetic tapes and floppy discs.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Magnetic tapes, floppy discs and similar media will be returned 
to the carriers, upon request, following completion of the processing 
cycle by the Department.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Hard copy BTS Form 2787, in typewritten form, for carriers that 
lack computer capability. Sample formats of the required data appear in 
Sections IX and XII. Supplies of blank Form 2787 are available, upon 
request, from the Director, Office of Airline Information (address on 
inside cover). Any reasonable facsimile of Form 2787 will be acceptable 
in lieu of Form 2787, if approved in advance by the Director.
    D. Number of copies of report to be filed. A participating carrier 
shall file with the Department a single copy of its quarterly O&D data 
report. When ADP submissions are transmitted, the package is to contain 
a transmittal letter describing the contents, and stating the overall 
record and passenger

[[Page 168]]

counts included in the submission. Each submission is to be labeled 
externally as to submitting carrier and time period of the O&D Survey 
data.
    E. Address for filing reports. Reports should be submitted to the 
Director, Office of Airline Information (address on inside cover).

            V. Selection of Sample and Recording of Data.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Upon approval of the Director, Office of Airline Information, 
carriers may continue current reporting procedures (up to twenty-three 
stages of a passenger flight) and may report a uniform 10 percent sample 
of tickets lifted (each zero ending lifted coupon) without reducing the 
sample size from 10 percent to 1 percent for domestic major markets. 
Note that the domestic major markets will be reviewed each year at June 
30, based on the prior 12 months O&D data, and the list amended as 
necessary. The list could remain static for more than a year, although 
it will be reviewed annually. Necessary amendments will be effective on 
January 1 of the following year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A. Sampling Basis. Each participating carrier in this O&D Survey 
shall search all listed flight coupons, whether the coupons are its own 
ticket stock or on the ticket stock of another U.S. or foreign carrier 
(either standard IATA and ARC ticket stock or nonstandard ticket stock), 
and is to select for reporting purposes the following flight coupons:
    (1) Major domestic markets. All single-passenger flight coupons that 
are either a single flight coupon ticket or part of a round trip, two 
coupon ticket where the ticket serial number ends in the digits double-
zero (00). Note.--The list of major domestic markets will be issued by 
reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27(b).
    (2) International markets and all other domestic markets. (a) All 
single-passenger flight coupons with ticket serial numbers ending with 
the digit zero (0);
    (b) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 10 or fewer passengers 
with ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0);
    (c) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 11 or more passengers 
without regard to serial number; and
    (d) Itineraries in major domestic markets that comprise more than 
two coupons are sampled on a uniform 10 percent basis, by selecting all 
ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0).
    B. Selection of Reportable Flight Coupons. The flight coupons 
identified above are to be examined to isolate the reportable flight 
coupons, i.e. coupons from which data are to be recorded. Flight coupon 
data are reported only by the first honoring and participating carrier 
(operating carrier). Such carriers shall report the required data for 
the entire ticketed itinerary.
    If a participating carrier has preceded an examining carrier on any 
stage in the trip itinerary, including any stage in a conjunction 
itinerary and any stage in a reissued ticket (either before or after 
reissue) that coupon is not reportable.
    For conjunction tickets, the ticket number for the first ticket 
booklet determines if the conjunction tickets should be reported in the 
Survey. Otherwise, conjunction tickets do not require special treatment 
and are governed by the rules for regular tickets.
    No adjustment is made in the Survey for alterations or changes in 
the trip itinerary subsequent to the stage covered by the reportable 
coupon.
    C. Optional Use of Other Sampling Procedures.
    (1) Alternative sampling procedures or alternative O&D data systems 
may be proposed by participating carriers with nonstandard ticketing 
procedures, or other special operating characteristics. Data reported 
under proposed alternative procedures must approximate the usefulness 
and statistical validity of the O&D Survey.
    (2) Such departures from the prescribed O&D Survey practices shall 
not be authorized unless approved in writing by the Director, Office of 
Airline Information (address inside front cover). The proposed 
alternative O&D Survey procedures must be described in detail in the 
letter requesting the waiver.
    D. Recording of Data from Reportable Flight Coupons. (1) The 
following items are to be reported from the reportable flight coupons:
    (a) Point of origin,
    (b) Operating carrier on each flight stage (if unknown, identify 
ticketed carrier),
    (c) Ticketed carrier on each flight stage,
    (d) Fare-basis on each flight coupon, C, D, F, G, X or Y,
    (e) Points of stopover or connection (interline and intraline),
    (f) Point of destination,
    (g) Number of passengers, and
    (h) Total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax and other charges, 
such as Passenger Facility Charges).
    (2) The individual items are to be recorded in the sequence of 
occurrence in the itinerary as follows:
    (a) All entries for points (airport codes \5\) in an itinerary are 
to be recorded in three-letter airport code data to fit into the stage-
length limitation (seven or twenty-three stages at the carrier's 
option), all airport codes are to be reported, including data on

[[Page 169]]

commuter, foreign, intra-state and other carriers' portions of 
itineraries. Normally codes are recorded as they appear on the ticket. 
However, if a code is obviously incorrect, record the correct code. For 
instance, if a ticket is coded DCA-NYC or Washington/National to New 
York when the flight stage actually operated from Washington, Dulles to 
Newark (EWR), record the correct airport code. When only name spellings 
of a city appear on the ticket for multi-airport cities (such as 
Washington, New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles), record the 
specific three letter airport code. In cases where two airport codes are 
shown on the ticket for a point, such as when the passenger arrives at 
an airport such as San Francisco and departs from another local airport 
such as Oakland, record the code for the arrival airport, enter a 
surface segment indicator (--) to the departure airport, and record the 
departure airport code. (When the surface portion is at the beginning or 
end of an itinerary, the surface indicator is to be omitted). For 
example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Codes to be used are those appearing in the Official Airline 
Guide at the time the data are being recorded. If a code is not found in 
the OAG, contact the Director, Office of Airline Information (address 
inside front cover).

    In the above example, the passenger trip stages or segments are 
compressed into the maximum of 7 stages so that several intermediate 
city-pairs (Los Angeles to Seattle to Anchorage, or LAX--SEA--Anc) and 
the related carriers have not been recorded, as prescribed below in this 
Section V.D.(3)(e). In addition, after the fourth city-pair (Los 
Angeles-Salt Lake City), the passenger trip itinerary moves from the 
initial four-part ticket booklet onto another ``conjunction'' ticket, 
and the summary fare code data are not recorded beyond the initial four-
part ticket.
    (b) All entries for operating and ticketed carriers for a coupon 
stage of an itinerary are to be recorded using two character IATA-
assigned or DOT codes, as in the above example. Note that the fare code 
summary was properly inserted after the ticketed carrier's code, i.e., 
UA for United Air Lines and Y for unrestricted coach class service. When 
a two-character carrier code is shown on the ticket, record that code 
for the ticketed carrier. However, if a code is obviously incorrect, 
record the correct carrier code. If the reporting carrier does not know 
the operating carrier on a downline code-share segment, it would use the 
ticketed carrier's code for both the operating and ticketed carriers. 
The reporting carrier is not responsible for knowing the operating 
carrier of a downline code-share where it is not a party to the code-
share segment. Except for the infrequent compression of data to fit into 
the stage-length limitation (7 or 23 stages at the carrier's option), 
all carrier codes are to be recorded, including data on air taxis, 
commuters, intra-state, and other carrier portions of itineraries. On 
tickets involving interchange service or other cooperative carrier 
arrangements, the juncture point(s) where the passenger moves from one 
carrier

[[Page 170]]

system to another is to be recorded as an intermediate point in the 
itinerary, even when not shown on the ticket and even though the flight 
may overfly the juncture point.
    (c) Entries for fare-basis codes are to be taken from the ``fare 
basis'' and ``fare description'' portions of the ticket and simplified 
into the appropriate category, as shown below. No attempt shall be made 
to determine and record fare-basis codes for that portion of a 
conjunction ticket appearing in the ticket. Fare-basis codes are to be 
recorded in one-character alphabetic codes. The fare-basis codes are 
recorded as follows:

C--Unrestricted Business Class
D--Restricted Business Class
F--Unrestricted First Class
G--Restricted First Class
X--Restricted Coach/Economy Class
Y--Unrestricted Coach/Economy Class
U--Unknown (This fare category is used when none is shown on a ticket 
coupon, or when a fare category is not discernible, or when two or more 
carrier fare codes are compressed into a single stage of a passenger 
trip).

    (d) In recording the number of passengers, each single-passenger 
ticket is to be recorded as one passenger. Tickets for infants under two 
years of age not occupying a seat are not to be counted. A revenue 
passenger is defined in Section X.
    For group tickets of 10 or fewer passengers per ticket record the 
actual number of passengers on each ticket, i.e., either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9 or 10. For group tickets with 11 or more passengers (those 
sampled at a 100-percent rate) record the actual number of passengers 
traveling on each ticket, but keep these entries separate from the group 
ticket records with 10 or fewer passengers and from the single-passenger 
ticket records. Group tickets with 11 or more passengers are to be 
sorted and summarized to combine all passengers for all itineraries 
which are identical in every respect, i.e., points, carriers, fare basis 
codes, and average dollar value (as defined in paragraph (e), below). 
The total number of passengers on each summarized record is to be 
divided by 10, rounding to the nearest whole passenger. If the quotient 
ends in 0.5 or more, raise to the next whole passenger. If the quotient 
ends in less than 0.5, drop the fraction. These large group-ticket 
records, after division by 10 for compatibility with the other data, are 
to be merged with the single-passenger records and with the group-ticket 
entries from tickets of 10 or fewer passengers for the quarterly O&D 
Survey report.
    (e) The total dollar value shall be taken from the ``Total'' box on 
each ticket and shall be the sum of the fare plus tax for the entire 
ticket. Record this amount in whole U.S. dollars, with the cents 
dropped. Do not round cents to nearest whole dollar.
    Amounts on tickets stated in foreign currency are to be converted to 
U.S. dollar equivalents. For all group tickets, the dollar value to be 
recorded shall be the average amount per passenger, determined by 
dividing the total dollar value for the entire group by the number of 
passengers on the group ticket, dropping cents in the average amount.
    (3) The length of the itineraries to be recorded is limited to a 
maximum of seven stages or twenty-three stages, at the carrier's option. 
This recognizes that the vast majority of tickets sampled have seven 
stages or fewer and that the rare occurrences of extremely lengthy 
itineraries do not impact the overall Survey results enough to justify 
their reporting burden. Therefore, trips longer than these limits are 
compressed to fall within the stated maximums. The ticketed origin and 
destination are retained, but the intermediate routing is compressed by 
applying the following rules, in sequence:
    (a) Combine any contiguous open, unknown carrier, or surface stages 
eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if 
different:
    (b) Combine any contiguous stages via the same non-U.S. carrier, 
eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if 
different;
    (c) Combine any contiguous stages via different non-U.S. carrier, 
making the carrier ``UK'', eliminating the connecting point, and 
ignoring fare-basis codes, if different:
    (d) Combine any contiguous stages via the same U.S. carrier, 
eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if 
different, and;
    (e) If the trip, after applying the four steps above, is still too 
long, record the compressed routing through to the stage length 
limitation city (seventh or twenty-third city), enter UK as the final 
carrier, and then record the ticketed destination as the next (the 8th 
or 24th) city.

                   VI. Summarization of Recorded Data

    A. General. Prior to the submission of each quarterly report to the 
Department, each carrier is to summarize the data in accordance with the 
rules in Section VI.B. In special hardship cases, carriers may submit a 
waiver request (with justification under Section 1-2 of 14 CFR part 241) 
requesting permission to report their flight coupon records exactly as 
represented on their lifted tickets. Waiver requests must provide the 
documentation described in Section VI.C. so that the Department can 
develop the necessary procedures and edit routines to ensure the 
accuracy and reliability of the overall O&D Survey results. The granting 
of such waivers will depend upon the availability of resources for the 
Department to assume this

[[Page 171]]

additional burden, which can only be determined on a case by case basis, 
after evaluating each carrier's need.
    B. Rules for Summarization. Sort the recorded entries into sequence 
by the entire record (excluding the passenger field), i.e., by origin, 
complete routing (including fare-basis codes), tickets destination, and 
dollars value of ticket. All identical records are then to be combined 
into one summary record. The number of passengers on the summary record 
is to be the sum of the passenger amounts of all the individual records 
combined. Passengers are only summarized where records are identical in 
all respects except in number of passengers including dollar value of 
ticket. NOTE: DO NOT SUMMARIZE DOLLARS OVER IDENTICAL RECORDS. This 
summarization is to include the entries from group tickets, but only 
after the entries for group tickets with 11 or more passengers have been 
summarized and divided by 10, as stated in Section V.D.(2)(d). Carriers 
submitting quarterly O&D Survey reports on magnetic tapes or similar 
formats such as ``floppy discs'' will follow the ADP INSTRUCTIONS in 
Section IX. Carriers filing reports on hardcopy BTS Forms 2787 are to 
enter, on the last page of the report, the overall total of the number 
of passengers in the report.
    C. Waiver Requests. Requests for permission to depart from the 
required O&D Survey procedures should include a procedural statement 
describing the process the carrier proposed to employ in examining, 
selecting and editing the data from reportable flight coupons for the 
O&D Survey, as well as a flow chart diagramming the proposed procedures.
    D. Quantity and Quality Controls. Carriers are expected to establish 
and maintain continuous quantity and quality controls on the flow of all 
lifted flight coupons through their system processes to determine the 
total number of coupons handled and the number of reportable coupons 
selected. Such data controls and tests have not been specified by the 
Department, and necessarily must be developed by each carrier. Each 
participating carrier shall develop and use on a continuous basis such 
control tests as are necessary to ensure that all reportable coupons are 
being selected, recorded and reported as intended by these O&D Survey 
Instructions. Such controls should extend over all ADP processing, both 
in-house and that from external service bureaus.

                      VII. Editing of Recorded Data

    A. City and Airport Codes. Prior to submission of O&D Survey 
reports, each carrier is to edit the recorded data to validate city and 
airport codes. This edit is to verify that the codes recorded are valid 
official codes, and it is independent of whether or not the carriers 
shown actually operated into or out of the airport shown. Any questions 
about airport codes should be addressed to the Director, Office of 
Airline Information (see inside of cover).
    B. Edit Responsibility of Carriers. Each carrier is responsible for 
developing edit procedures and internal controls over its data entry and 
processing procedures so that valid and reliable data are captured in 
the O&D Survey inputs and are properly summarized in the outputs. Since 
the carriers have many different statistical systems, it is not 
practicable for the Department of Transportation to prescribe specific 
controls in this area, and each carrier is responsible for developing 
the appropriate internal control procedures to edit the O&D Survey data 
and ensure the integrity of these data. The Department will control the 
accuracy of its processing of the sampled data upon receipt from the 
carriers.
    C. System Documentation of Edits. Carriers are required to maintain 
written O&D Survey procedural statements and flow charts. As provided in 
Section VIII, these must be established, or re-certified as of July 1, 
1987, and thereafter when significant procedural revisions occur.

          VIII. Control of Sample Selection and Data Recording

    A. Sample Accuracy and Reliability. In order to maximize the 
accuracy and reliability of the sample selection and data recording, 
each carrier is to:
    (1) Develop a written statement describing the procedures it will 
employ in examining and selecting reportable flight coupons and in 
recording, summarizing, editing, and testing the Survey data.
    (2) Submit any proposed changes in the above procedures to the 
Department's Office of Airline Information, prior to implementation of 
such changes.
    (3) Establish continuous quantity controls on the flow of all lifted 
flight coupons through the carrier's accounting processing to determine 
the total number of coupons handled, and the number of reportable 
coupons selected. Tests are to be made continuously to assure that all 
reportable coupons are being selected and the data recorded. Such tests 
should be completed while the ``lifted'' flight coupons (representing 
earned passenger revenues for flight segments operated) remain in the 
possession of the carrier. Establish such other internal control 
procedures as are necessary for supervising and monitoring the accuracy 
of the recording of data from reportable flight coupons.
    B. Staff Review. The OAI staff will review the carrier procedures 
and practices and may request modifications or the use of special 
procedures necessary to improve the sample or to bolster the controls 
for accuracy and reliability.

                          IX. ADP Instructions

    Each carrier electing to submit its Survey reports in machine 
listing form or magnetic media in lieu of hardcopy BTS Form 2787 is to 
be governed by the following instructions:

        A. Instructions for Submitting Records on Magnetic Media

    (1) Identification record. This identification record is to include 
the reporting carrier and the reporting period. It is designed to fall

    (2) Detail record. (a) All records are to be summarized on the 
complete itinerary \7\ (columns 7 through 200) and the summary record 
only for each itinerary is to be submitted. The tape file, including the 
identification record, is to be in sequence by complete itinerary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Itinerary includes total dollar value of ticket.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The tape record layout is shown on the following page.
    (3) Magnetic Tape Instructions: (a) All tapes are to be written 
using the standard IBM extended binary coded decimal interchange code 
(EBCDIC).
    (b) The recording density can be either 6250 or 1600 B.P.I.
    (c) All tape will contain standard IBM volume header, and trailer 
records.
    (d) External labels will contain the carrier, name, the report date, 
file identification, and an address for returning the tapes.
    (4) Transmittal letter. The tape shall be accompanied by a 
transmittal letter which shows the number of records reported and the 
total number of passengers contained in the report.
    B. Editing of Tape Records. Prior to submission of data, each 
carrier is requested to edit and correct its data so that its O&D Survey 
report may be as error-free as is reasonably practicable. The methods to 
be used in editing are left to the carriers' discretion, but with 
assistance available upon request from the Department's Office of 
Airline Information (OAI). To aid the carriers in maintaining a current 
file of editing criteria, OAI will re-issue, as needed, the city/
airport-carrier file to each participating carrier. There will be a 
five-position field to denote the city/airport-carrier. The first three 
positions denotes the airport and the last two positions denotes the air 
carrier.
    C. Standard Formats for Floppy Disk or Cartridge Submissions. 
Carriers should use the 200 position format with the standard length 
fields prescribed for magnetic media submissions. The record layout is 
detailed in subsection A(1) of this section. However, to simplify the PC 
submissions, the submitter may report the dollar value of the ticket in 
the field immediately after the last reported city code, rather than in 
positions 196-200. Submitters may separate fields by using commas or 
tabs (comma delimited ASCII or tab delimited ASCII format).

                          X. Glossary of Terms

      General Reporting Provisions--Large Certificated Air Carriers


<R05>
Section 21  Introduction to System of Reports

    (a) Each large certificated air carrier subject to the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, shall file with the BTS, monthly, 
quarterly, semiannually, and annually BTS Form 41 Reports of financial 
and operating statistics as prescribed herein unless waiver has been 
made by the Civil Aeronautics Board.
    (b) The system prescribed provides for the submission by each air 
carrier of four classes of financial and operating statistics, on 
individual schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report, grouped as follows:

A. Certification.
B. Balance Sheet Elements.
P. Profit and Loss Elements.
T. Traffic and Capacity Elements.


[[Page 176]]


    (c) The prescribed system of reports provides that the frequency of 
reporting shall be monthly for some schedules, quarterly for some, 
semiannually for some and annually for others. It also provides in some 
areas for the classification of large certificated air carriers into 
Group I, Group II, and Group III with the form and content 
differentiated as between groups.
    (d) Each schedule of the prescribed BTS Form 41 Report has been 
assigned a specific code. The prefix alphabetical codes A, B, P and T, 
respectively, have been employed to denote certification, balance sheet, 
profit and loss, and traffic and capacity. The digits immediately 
following the alphabetical prefix designate the particular schedule.
    (e) Upon approval by the Director, Office of Airline Information, a 
carrier may:
    (1) Supply its own computer prepared formats provided each schedule 
conforms with the size and format of the forms prescribed in this part.
    (2) Use telefacsmile, or fax, equipment to submit the forms 
prescribed by this part; however, forms transmitted by fax must conform 
to an 8\1/2\ x 14 inch size. With prior approval, larger forms may be 
reduced in size of 8\1/2\ x 14 for transmission to the Department.
    (f) In submitting each schedule prescribed by this part to the 
Department, each reporting air carrier shall adhere to the following 
guidelines:
    (1) A good quality black ribbon shall be used in preparing the 
original copy of each schedule.
    (2) In no event shall any information be typed on the reverse side 
of copies submitted to the Department.
    (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, no 
photocopy or similar process shall be used.
    (g) Four separate air carrier entities shall be established for 
large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled service for the 
purpose of submitting the prescribed reports. They are as follows: (1) 
Domestic operations; (2) operations via the Atlantic Ocean; (3) 
operations via the Pacific Ocean; and (4) operations in Latin American 
areas. With respect to the first classification, the domestic entity 
shall embrace all operations within and between the 50 States of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and shall also include Canadian transborder 
operations. The reports to be submitted by each entity shall be 
comparable to those required of a distinct legal entity whether the 
reporting entity constitutes such an entity, a semiautonomous physically 
separated operating division of the carrier, or an entity established 
for reporting purposes only.
    (h) Two separate entities shall be established for large 
certificated air carriers predominantly engaged in conducting charter 
activities for the purpose of submitting the prescribed reports: (1) 
Domestic operations; and (2) international operations. The domestic 
entity includes all operations within and between the 50 States of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All other operations will be in the 
international entity.
    (i) The entities for which separate reports shall be made by the 
different route and charter air carriers will be set semiannually by the 
Office of Airline Information.
    (j) As a general rule separate reports shall be filed for the air 
carrier and for each associated company air carriers as defined in 
section 03 which is an air carrier. However, transactions of associated 
companies in which 100 percent equity control resides in the reporting 
air carrier shall be consolidated with transactions of the reporting air 
carrier when such associated companies perform services related to the 
transport operations of the reporting air carrier almost exclusively and 
are not engaged in air transportation for their own account.
    (k) Generally, route air carriers' nonscheduled services shall be 
treated as an integral part of the reporting entity to which most 
closely related without regard to the geographic area in which such 
nonscheduled services may actually be performed. However, supplemental 
reports shall be made of nonscheduled services (including service for 
the Department of Defense) in areas not encompassed by the prescribed 
reporting entity in any month in which

[[Page 177]]

the available ton-miles of such nonscheduled services exceed 5 percent 
of the available ton-miles of the reporting entity. Such supplemental 
reports shall continue until waived by the BTS upon a showing that such 
nonscheduled operations will not in the subsequent 12-month period 
exceed the 5-percent limit. The supplemental reports to be filed each 
month or calendar quarter, as applicable, shall be comprised of report 
Schedules P-5, T-1, and T-2. Transport and nontransport revenues 
pertaining to such separately reported nonscheduled services shall be 
reported on Schedule P-2 each quarter.
    (l) When and as required in the national interest, any air carrier 
which performs nonscheduled transport services for the Department of 
Defense shall, when directed by the Department, make separate reports 
for such services as if they were conducted by a physically separate 
transport entity, such reports shall consist of Schedules P-1 through P-
7, T-1, and T-2. The letter ``D'' shall be inserted on such reports, 
following the schedule number of each P and T schedule. When a carrier 
has more than one reporting entity, nonscheduled transport and 
nonscheduled Defense services shall be assigned to the reporting entity 
to which more closely related.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Due dates falling on a Saturday, Sunday or national holiday will
  become effective the first following work day.
\2\ Reporting due dates on Form 41 Schedules B and P are extended to
  March 30 if preliminary schedules are filed at the Department by
  February 10

    (b) Each large certificated air carrier shall file the applicable 
schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report with the BTS in accordance with the 
above instructions with the following exceptions:
    (1) The time for filing B and P report schedules for the final 
quarter or semiannual period of each calendar year may be extended to 
the following March 30 if the preliminary Schedules B-1 or B-1.1 and P-
1.1 or P-1.2 are submitted, as applicable, and are received on or before 
their respective due dates.
    (2) For the third month of any calendar quarter, Schedule P-1(a) 
need not be filed if Schedule P-1.1 or P-1.2 for the quarter or 
semiannual period, as applicable, is received on the due date prescribed 
for Schedule P-1(a).
    (3) Income and expense data on Schedule P-1(a) for each month will 
be withheld by the BTS from public disclosure, until such time as (i) 
the semiannual or quarterly financial reports are due, (ii) the 
semiannual or quarterly financial reports are filed, or (iii) 
information covered by monthly reports is publicly released by the 
carrier concerned, whichever occurs first. Before that time, income and 
expense data reported on Schedule P-1(a) will be disclosed to parties to 
any proceeding before the DOT to the extent that such data are relevant 
and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to 
this effect by the administrative law judge assigned to the case or by 
the DOT. Any data to which access is granted may be introduced into 
evidence, subject to the normal rules of admissibility of evidence. The 
DOT will make other disclosure of these data upon its own motion or upon 
application of any interested person, when the DOT finds the public 
interest so requires. The BTS may, from time to time, publish summary 
information compiled from Schedule P-1(a) in a form which will not 
identify the individual carrier. At the request of an air carrier, and 
upon a showing by such air carriers that public disclosure of its 
preliminary year-end report would adversely affect its interests and 
would not be in the public interest, the BTS will withhold such 
preliminary year-end report from public disclosure until such time as 
(i) the final report is filed, (ii) the final report is due, or (iii) 
information covered by the preliminary report is publicly released by 
the carrier concerned, whichever occurs first.
    (c) If circumstances prevent the filing of a report on or before the 
prescribed due date, consideration will be given to the granting of an 
extension

[[Page 179]]

upon receipt of a written request therefor. To provide ample time for 
consideration and communication to the air carrier of the action taken, 
such a request must be delivered to the Board in writing at least three 
(3) days in advance of the due date, setting forth good and sufficient 
reason to justify the granting of the extension and the date when the 
report can be filed. Except in cases of emergency, no such request will 
be entertained which is not in writing and received by the BTS at least 
three (3) days before the prescribed due date. If a request is denied, 
the air carrier remains subject to the filing requirements to the same 
extent as if no request for extension of time had been made.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) All financial data reported on B, P and G schedules shall 
reflect the status of the air carrier's books of account for the period 
for which the report is being made and shall conform to the instructions 
contained in this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports. At the option 
of the air carrier, Group III air carriers may round reported financial 
data to the nearest thousands of dollars by typing ``($000)'' at the top 
of each amount column. All Group I and Group II air carriers may, at 
their option, round reported financial data to the nearest whole dollars 
by dropping the cents. All rounded amounts must be balanced within and 
between schedules. This option applies only to the submission of 
hardcopy reports. Instructions for the submission of data in ADP format 
are contained in the Accounting and Reporting Directives, which are 
available from OAI.
    (f) Traffic and other operational statistics included in schedules 
of the BTS Form 41 reports shall reflect data pertaining to the month, 
quarter or 12-months-to-date period for which the report is being made.
    (g) Adjustments correcting errors in previously reported traffic and 
other operational statistics shall not be included in data reported in 
schedules for the current period but shall be effected by submission of 
corrected schedules for the period to which applicable or, if only a few 
items are involved, by written notice and authorization to the BTS to 
correct previously filed reports except that any correction which 
amounts to less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the corrected 
amount for the month to which related may be included in the report for 
the current month provided the amount of the correction is clearly noted 
on the Form 41 Report.
    (h) All letters and statements of correction or revision of reported 
data shall be a part of the BTS Form 41 reports.
    (i) All changes in accounting methods having a material impact upon 
the particular financial elements involved, and all changes in methods 
of computing and reporting traffic and capacity statistics having a 
material impact upon the particular statistic involved shall be 
adequately explained and identified in the report first reflecting such 
changes. Such explanations related to financial position or financial 
results shall be made on BTS Form 41 Schedule P-2. Changes in methods 
for computing or reporting traffic and capacity statistics shall be 
identified and explained on a separate sheet attached to the first 
report affected. (See sec. 2-16.) The reporting requirements shall not 
be construed, in any sense, as relieving the air carrier of the 
responsibility for conforming its procedures to those otherwise 
prescribed in this system of accounts and reports.
    (j) All financial statements released by carriers to the public 
reflecting a financial position or operating results for dates or 
reporting periods not covered by reports on file with the Board shall be 
filed with the Board simultaneously with their public release.

                        Schedule A--Certification

    (a) The certification of the BTS Form 41 Report shall be signed by 
an elective corporate officer, executive, or director. Other

[[Page 180]]

persons may be authorized by the carrier to sign the certification 
provided a written authorization disclosing the individual's name and 
title is forwarded to the Department of Transportation. Since 
corrections or revisions of reported data are a part of the BTS Form 41 
Report, all correspondence relating to such matters shall be signed only 
by the person(s) authorized to sign the certification.
    (b) The certification of the Form 41 reports, embodied in Schedule A 
thereof, shall read as follows:
    I, the undersigned (Title of officer in charge of accounts) -------- 
of the (Full name of the reporting company) ------ do certify that this 
report and all schedules, ADP-media submissions, Passenger Origin-
Destination Survey submissions and supporting documents which are 
submitted herewith or have been submitted heretofore as parts of this 
report filed for the above indicated period have been prepared under my 
direction; that I have carefully examined them and declare that they 
correctly reflect the accounts and records of the company, and to the 
best of my knowledge and belief are a complete and accurate statement, 
after adjustments to reflect full accruals, of the operating revenues 
and expenses, income items, assets, liabilities, capital, retained 
earnings, and operating statistics for the periods reported in the 
several schedules, the Schedule T-100 ADP-media submissions, and the 
Passenger Origin-Destination Survey; that the various items herein 
reported were determined in accordance with the Uniform System of 
Accounts and Reports for Large Certificated Air Carriers prescribed by 
the Department of Transportation; and that the data contained herein are 
reported on a basis consistent with that of the preceding report except 
as specifically noted in the financial and statistical statements.

                       Schedule B-1 Balance Sheet

    (a) This schedule shall be filed by all Group II and Group III air 
carriers and Group I air carriers that have annual operating revenues of 
$20 million or more.
    (b) This schedule shall reflect the balances at the close of 
business on the last day of each calendar quarter for the overall or 
system operations of each air carrier in conformance with the provisions 
of sections 4, 5 and 6.
    (c) Individual proprietors or partners shall report the aggregate 
capital contributed by the proprietor or partners in account 2890 
Additional Capital Invested.

                      Schedule B-1.1--Balance Sheet

    (a) This schedule shall be filed semiannually by Group I air 
carriers with annual operating revenues below $20 million.
    (b) Each carrier shall insert in the space provided for ``OAG Code'' 
its carrier code as contained in the Official Airlines Guide (OAG). If 
the OAG does not contain a carrier code for the reporting carrier, a 
code will be provided by the Office of Airline Information upon request. 
This code will then be inserted in the space provided for ``carrier 
code.''
    (c) This schedule shall show the account balances at the close of 
business on June 30 or December 31, as applicable, of each semiannual 
reporting period.
    (d) ``Current Assets'' shall include all resources that may 
reasonably be expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed within 
one year. This group of assets is classified into three basic accounts:
    (1) ``Cash and Equivalents'' shall include cash on hand and on 
deposit, U.S. Government securities, and other temporary cash 
investments.
    (2) ``Notes and Accounts Receivable-Net'' shall include general 
traffic accounts receivable, government receivables, notes and 
receivables from associated companies, officers, employees and others, 
and a deduction for a reasonable allowance for bad debts.

not provided for in the above classifications. This account shall 
include, but is not limited to, short-term prepayments, expendable spare 
parts, supplies and other inventories of flight equipment replacement 
parts that are usually replaced rather than repaired, and materials and 
supplies held in stock, such as fuel and oil, expendable tools, office 
supplies and food service supplies. Spare parts may be reduced by an 
allowance for obsolescence to provide for losses in value.
    (e) ``Property and Equipment'' shall be segregated into that which 
is owned and that which is leased under capital leases. All property and 
equipment, with the deception of land, shall be reported net of 
accumulated depreciation or amortization.
    (f) ``Other Assets'' shall included all assets not included in the 
above categories, such as long-term investments, long-term prepayments, 
long-term receivables, deferred charges, intangible assets, equipment 
purchase deposits, and construction work in progress.
    (g) ``Current Liabilities'' shall include all obligations, the 
liquidation of which is reasonably expected to require the use of 
existing resources within one year. This group of liabilities is 
classified into three basic accounts:
    (1) ``Notes and Accounts Payable'' shall include any payments on 
long-term debt, short-term notes and accounts payable, and accrued 
expenses that are payable within one year.
    (2) ``Accrued Taxes'' shall include tax liabilities, such as those 
imposed on income,

[[Page 181]]

property and payroll, which are reasonably expected to be liquidated 
within one year.
    (3) ``Other Current Liabilities'' shall include all current

liabilities for unused transportation sold (includes sales of 
transportation on both the reporting carrier and other carriers).
    (h) ``Long-Term Debt'' shall include all obligations which are not 
reasonably expected to be liquidated within one year. Typical examples 
include bonds payable, long-term notes payable, lease obligations, and 
pension obligations.
    (i) ``Other Liabilities'' shall include any debts or obligations 
which are not properly listed in the ``Current Liabilities'' or ``Long-
Term Debt'' sections.
    (j) ``Deferred Credits'' shall include all credit balances of a 
general clearing nature, including credits held in suspense pending 
receipt of further information necessary for final disposition. Included 
in this account are deferred income taxes and deferred investment tax 
credits.
    (k) ``Stockholder's Equity'' shall be reported as follows:
    (1) ``Capital Stock'' shall be segregated as between common and 
preferred. The number of shares outstanding, along with the par or 
stated value of the stock, shall be reported. In the case of no-par 
stock without stated value, the full consideration received shall be 
reported.
    (2) ``Other Paid-In Capital'' shall include the difference between 
the price at which the capital stock is sold and the par or stated value 
of the stock.
    (3) ``Retained Earnings'' shall represent the net income or loss 
from all operations of the corporate entity less dividends.
    (4) ``Treasury Stock'' shall represent the cost of stock issued by 
the carrier and reacquired by it but not retired or cancelled.
    (l) The statement of certification shall be signed by the carrier's 
chief accounting officer.
    (m) All substantive matters that may materially influence 
interpretations or conclusions in regard to the financial condition or 
the earnings position of the air carrier which are not clearly 
identified in the body of the schedule or which represent information 
that cannot be expressed adequately in monetary terms shall be 
completely and clearly stated in a note attached to this schedule and 
cross-referenced to the affected account or accounts.

 Schedule B-7 Airframe and Aircraft Engine Acquisitions and Retirements

    (a) This schedule shall be filed by all Group II and Group III air 
carriers.
    (b) Data applicable to acquisitions and data applicable to 
retirements shall be grouped and reported separately. The data reported 
within each group (acquisitions; retirements) shall be further 
subgrouped and reported as follows:
    (1) Acquisitions: the indicated data shall be reported for each 
individual airframe, identified by type, model, and design of cabin as 
to use for passengers exclusively, cargo exclusively, or both passengers 
and cargo in combination. Data pertaining to aircraft engines shall be 
reported in aggregate for each type or model; however, leased aircraft 
engines shall be separately reported under captions entitled: Capital 
Leases--Aircraft Engines; and Operating Leases--Aircraft Engines. 
Airframe units leased from others for a period of more than 90 days 
shall be reported in a separate subsection of this schedule, captioned 
as follows: Capital Leases--Airframe Units; and Operating Leases--
Airframe Units. In addition, a notation shall be made by license number 
of airframe units of the air carrier returned after lease to others for 
a period of more than 90 days. Airframe units obtained through 
interchange lease arrangements shall not be so reported.
    (2) Retirements: The indicated data shall be reported for the sale 
or retirement of each airframe, each type of aircraft engine (stating 
the number of units retired) and, to the extent retired along with 
airframes and engines, in aggregates by accounts, operating property and 
equipment included in accounts 1607 and 1608 and nonoperating property 
and equipment included in accounts 1707 and 1708. Disposition of 
properties in accounts 1608 and 1708 not related to airframe and 
aircraft engine retirements shall be reported in a separate group for 
each account. Airframe units leased from others for a period of more 
than 90 days shall be reported, upon return to the lessor, in a separate 
subsection of this schedule and captioned as follows: Capital Leases--
Airframe Units; and Operating Leases--Airframe Units. In addition, a 
notation shall be made by license number and name of lessee of airframe 
units leased to others for a period of more than 90 days; moreover, 
airframe units leased to others under sales-type or direct financing 
leases shall be separately captioned and reported on this schedule. 
Airframe units leased under interchange arrangements shall not be so 
reported. Aircraft engines leased from others for a period of more than 
90 days shall be reported, upon return to the lessor, in a separate 
subsection of this schedule and captioned as follows: Capital Leases--
Aircraft Engines; and Operating Leases--Aircraft Engines. In addition, a 
notation shall be made by model number, number of units, and name of 
lessee of aircraft engines leased to others for a period of more than 90 
days; moreover, aircraft engines leased to others under sales-type or 
direct financing leases shall be separately captioned and reported on 
this schedule. Aircraft engines leased under interchange arrangements 
shall not be so reported.

[[Page 182]]

    (c) All dates shall indicate the day, the month and the year; shall 
be provided on a unit basis for airframes only, and, shall be reported 
for each aircraft engine group by date of transaction.
    (d) Column 1, ``Year of First Delivery--Airframe,'' shall reflect, 
for each reported airframe, the year that the airframe was first 
delivered by its manufacturer.
    (e) Column 2, ``Airframe Manufacturer's Serial Number,'' shall 
reflect the serial number assigned to each reported airframe by its 
manufacturer.
    (f) Column 4, ``Acquisitions or Retirements,'' shall be used to 
indicate, for each item entered, whether it represents an acquisition or 
retirement. This shall be indicated by inserting in Column 4 an ``A'' 
for acquisition or an ``R'' for retirement.
    (g) Column 8, ``Maximum Seating Capacity,'' shall reflect the number 
of passenger seats installed in each airframe acquired. When airframes 
are designed for multiple adjustable seating configurations, the maximum 
number of seats for which designed shall be reported. When the seating 
configuration of airframes is modified subsequent to original 
acquisition, the revised passenger capacity of each airfame shall be 
reported in the quarter in which modified and referenced to identify 
original capacity reported.
    (h) Column 9, ``Cost,'' shall reflect the book cost of reported 
airframe and aircraft engine acquisitions and retirements.
    (i) Column 10, ``Amortization/Depreciated Cost,'' shall reflect the 
book cost, less amortization or depreciation expense, for airframes and 
aircraft engines that have been retired.
    (j) Column 11, ``Realization,'' shall reflect the proceeds from the 
disposition of airframes and aircraft engines, including any insurance 
proceeds.
    (k) Column 12, ``Acquired From/Disposition,'' shall reflect: (1) for 
acquisitions: the name of the person or organization from which 
airframes and aircraft engines are acquired and (2) for dispositions 
(retirements): the name of the person or organization to which airframes 
and aircraft engines are sold or a notation as to the nature of the 
retirement and the account to which any depreciated cost has been 
charged, if not sold. Items included in accounts 1607, 1608, 1707, and 
1708, sold as a part of an airframe or aircraft sales transaction, shall 
also be identified by the name of the buyer. Other sales of items 
included in these accounts shall be reported in a separate group in 
aggregate for each property account affected.

                 Schedule B-12--Statement of Cash Flows

    (a) This Schedule shall be filed quarterly by all Group II and Group 
III air carriers and Group I air carriers that have annual operating 
revenues of $20 million or more.
    (b) This schedule shall be filed for the overall or system 
operations of the air carrier.
    (c) The statement of cash flows shall separately disclose the amount 
of net cash provided or used during the reporting period from the 
carrier's operating activities, investing activities and financing 
activities. The effect on cash and cash equivalents of the total amount 
of net cash provided or used during the quarter from each of the above 
activities shall be clearly disclosed so as to reconcile beginning and 
ending cash and cash equivalents.
    (d) Carriers may use either the direct or indirect method of 
reporting cash flows. Under either method, the reporting of cash flows 
from investing and financing activities will remain the same. However, 
the reporting of cash flows from operating activities does differ 
between the two methods.
    (e) For carriers electing to use the direct method, cash flows from 
operating activities are reported as gross amounts of the principal 
components of cash receipts and cash payments from operating activities, 
such as cash received from passengers and shippers, cash paid to 
suppliers, and cash paid to employees. Each carrier using the direct 
method shall provide as part of its statement of cash flows, a separate 
schedule that reconciles net income (as reported on Schedule P-1.2 in 
Account 9899) to cash flow from operating activities.
    (f) For carriers electing to use the indirect method, cash flows 
from operating activities shall reflect net income (as reported on 
Schedule P-1.2 in Account 9899) along with the adjustments necessary to 
reconcile net income (Account 9899) to net cash for the period (Net Cash 
Provided or Used By Operating Activities).
    (g) Regardless of the method used, the statement of cash flows shall 
reflect the amount of net cash flow provided or used by operating 
activities during the reporting period.
    (h) The balance of ``Cash and Cash Equivalents,'' at the beginning 
and ending of the quarterly period covered by the report, should equal 
the sum of Accounts 1010, ``Cash,'' and 1100, ``Short-term 
Investments,'' as reported on the immediately preceding and current 
quarterly Schedule B-1, ``Balance Sheet.'' If the sum of these two 
accounts does not equal the total ``Cash and Cash Equivalents'' reported 
on the statement of cash flows, then a footnote explaining the 
difference shall be provided as part of the statement of cash flows.

       Schedule B-43--Inventory of Airframes and Aircraft Engines

    (a) This schedule shall be filed by all Group I, Group II and Group 
III air carriers.
    (b) The indicated data shall be reported for each individual 
airframe, identified by type, model and design of cabin (main deck) as 
to

[[Page 183]]

use for passengers exclusively, cargo exclusively, or both passengers 
and cargo in combination. Type and model refers to aircraft models such 
as B-707-100, B-707-200, DC-10-40, Beech-18, Piper PA-32, etc. Aircraft 
type designations are prescribed in Accounting and Reporting Directive 
No. 178, ``List of Aircraft Type Numeric Codes.'' Copies of this 
directive and subsequent updates to the list of aircraft type codes are 
available from the Department's Office of Airline Information. Airframes 
that are authorized for operation over water under FAA regulation FAR 
121 shall be so indicated by asterisk.
    (c) Data pertaining to aircraft engines shall be reported on a group 
basis by type of engine and by type of aircraft to which related.
    (d) Data in this schedule shall be grouped and subtotaled as data 
pertaining to airframes and data pertaining to aircraft engines. Data 
pertaining to nonoperating airframes and aircraft engines shall be 
reported in a group below the data for operating equipment. Data 
pertaining to airframes and aircraft engines obtained under operating 
and capital leases shall be reported, by type of lease, in a separately 
captioned grouping below nonoperating airframes and aircraft engines and 
subgrouped within those groups according to operating and nonoperating 
equipment.
    (e) Column 1, ``Year of First Delivery--Airframe,'' shall reflect, 
for each reported airframe, the year that the airframe was first 
delivered by its manufacturer.
    (f) Column 2, ``Airframe Manufacturer's Serial Number,'' shall 
reflect the serial number assigned to each reported airframe by its 
manufacturer.
    (g) Data pertaining to airframes and aircraft engines obtained under 
operating leases shall be listed in Columns 1 through 9; the cost of 
improvements to equipment under operating leases shall be reported in 
Columns 10 through 12.
    (h) Column 9, ``Available Capacity (Weight),'' shall reflect, for 
each reported aircraft type, the available capacity (stated in pounds) 
that is used in computing the available ton-miles reported on Schedules 
T-100, T-1, and T-2.
    (i) Column 10, ``Acquired Cost or Capitalized Value,'' shall include 
(1) the acquisition cost of owned airframes and aircraft engines; (2) 
the total capitalized cost of obtaining airframes and engines under 
capital leases; and (3) the cost of improvements to airframes and 
engines obtained under operating leases.
    (j) Column 11, ``Allowance for Depreciation or Amortization,'' shall 
include (1) the accumulations of all provisions for losses due to use 
and obsolescence that are applicable to owned airframes and aircraft 
engines, (2) the amount of amortization recorded for amortizing the 
value of airframes and engines obtained under capital leases, and (3) 
the amount of amortization recorded for amortizing the value of 
improvements to airframes and aircraft engines obtained under operating 
leases.
    (k) Column 12, ``Depreciated Cost or Amortized Value,'' shall be 
calculated as either (1) Acquired Cost (Column 10) less the Allowance 
for Depreciation (Column 11) or (2) Capitalized Value (Column 10) less 
Amortization (Column 11).
    (l) Column 13, ``Estimated Residual Value,'' shall state, in 
dollars, the residual value assigned to owned and capital-leased 
airframes and aircraft engines, including any overhaul value not subject 
to depreciation.
    (m) Column 14, ``Estimated Depreciable or Amortizable Life 
(Months),'' shall state the estimated depreciable or amortizable life 
from the date of acquisition of each airframe and each group of aircraft 
engines.

Section 24  Profit and Loss Elements

                 Schedule P-1.1--Statement of Operations

    (a) This schedule shall be filed semiannually by Group I air 
carriers with annual operating revenues below $20 million. Data reported 
on this schedule shall be for the overall or system operations of the 
air carrier.
    (b) This schedule shall show the results of operations for six-month 
periods ending June 30 and December 31. Data reported in the ``12 
Months-to-Date'' column shall represent for each individual item the sum 
of the amount reported in the ``Current Period'' column and the next 
previous six-month period.
    (c) Each carrier shall insert in the space provided for ``OAG Code'' 
its carrier code as contained in the Official Airlines Guide (OAG). If 
the OAG does not contain a carrier code for the reporting carrier, a 
code will be provided by the Office of Airline Information upon request. 
This code will then be placed in the space provided for ``carrier 
code.''
    (d) ``Operating Revenue'' shall be put in categories as follows:
    (1) ``Transport Revenue'' shall include the revenue generated by the 
performance of air transportation services. This category shall be 
subdivided as follows:
    (i) ``Scheduled Service'' shall include all transport revenue 
derived from operations between pairs of points which are served on a 
regularly scheduled basis. Transport revenue received from scheduled 
service operations shall be subdivided as follows:
    (A) Passengers. Revenue generated from the transportation of 
passengers shall be included in this category.

[[Page 184]]

    (B) Other. Revenue generated by the transportation of property and 
mail shall be included in this category.
    (ii) ``Nonscheduled Service'' shall include all transport revenue 
derived from operations between pairs of points which are not served on 
a regularly scheduled basis.
    (2) ``Transport-Related Revenue'' shall include monies received for 
providing air transportation facilities associated with the performance 
of services which flow from and are incidental to air transportation

gallonage levies assessed by or against the fuel vendor or 
concessionaire and passed on to the carrier in a separately identifiable 
form and (2) nonrefundable Federal and State excise taxes. However, 
``through-put'' and ``in to plane'' charges that cannot be identified or 
segregated from the cost of fuel shall remain a part of the cost of fuel 
as reported on this schedule.
    (h) Each air carrier shall maintain records for each station showing 
the computation of fuel inventories and consumption for each fuel type. 
The periodic average cost method shall be used in computing fuel 
inventories and consumption. Under this method, an average unit cost for 
each fuel type shall be computed by dividing the total cost of fuel 
available (Beginning Inventory plus Purchases) by the total gallons 
available. The resulting unit cost shall then be used to determine the 
ending inventory and the total consumption costs to be reported on this 
schedule.
    (i) Where amounts reported for a specific entity include other than 
Jet A fuel, a footnote shall be added indicating the number of gallons 
and applicable costs of such other fuel included in amounts reported for 
that entity.
    (j) Where any adjustment(s) recorded on the books of the carrier 
results in a material distortion of the current month's schedule, 
carriers shall file a revised schedule P-12(a) for the month(s) 
affected.
    (k) Data reported on this schedule shall be withheld from public 
release until the quarterly Form 41 P schedules for the calendar quarter 
to which the monthly schedules relate are due at the BTS. However, 
aggregate data may be released before that time without identifying 
individual carriers. Provisions governing the due dates for submitting 
the quarterly P schedules are contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
section 22 of this part. Individual carrier fuel data withheld from 
public disclosure may be disclosed by the BTS to:
    (1) Parties to any proceeding before the DOT to the extent such 
material is relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a 
determination to this effect by the administrative law judge assigned to 
the case or by the DOT;
    (2) Agencies and other components of the Federal Government for 
their internal use only; and
    (3) Such persons and in such circumstances as the BTS determines to 
be in the public interest or consistent with its regulatory functions 
and responsibilities.

 Appendix to Section 241.25 of 14 CFR Part 241-Instructions to U.S. Air 
 Carriers for Reporting Traffic and Capacity Data on Form 41 Schedule T-
                                   100

    (a) Applicability. Each large U.S. air carrier that holds a 49 
U.S.C. ``41102 certificate must file the monthly Schedule T-100.
    (b) Schedules, Frequency, and entity: (1) Schedule T-100 collects 
summarized flight stage data by reporting entity for scheduled and 
nonscheduled passenger, and cargo operations. The term entity refers to 
the geographic location designator prescribed by the Department in 
``241.19-5(c)(2). Thus, domestic entity operations are distinguished 
from international entity operations.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) Format of reports:
    (1) Automatic Data Processing (ADP) magnetic tape. Refer to 
paragraph (f) of this appendix for instructions pertaining to mainframe 
and minicomputer reporting. The Department will issue ``Accounting and 
Reporting Directives'' to make necessary technical changes to these T-
100 instructions. Technical changes which are minor in nature do not 
require public notice and comment.
    (2) Microcomputer diskette--(i) Optional specification. If an air 
carrier desires to use its personal computers (PC's), rather than 
mainframe or minicomputers to prepare its data submissions, the 
following specifications for filing data on diskette media apply:
    (ii) Reporting medium. Microcomputer ADP data submission of T-100 
information must be on IBM compatible disks. Carriers wishing to use a 
different ADP procedure must obtain written approval to do so from the 
BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information. Requests for approval to 
use alternate methods must disclose and describe the proposed data 
transmission methodology. Refer to paragraph (k) of this appendix for 
microcomputer record layouts.
    (iii) Microcomputer file characteristics. The files will be created 
in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format 
(DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields 
(data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by 
quotation marks (``) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data 
elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by 
a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by its juxtaposition within 
a given record. Therefore, each record must contain the exact number of 
data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. Personal 
computer software including most spreadsheets, data base management 
programs, and BASIC are capable of producing files in this format.
    (d) Filing date for reports. The reports must be received at BTS 
within 30 days following the end of each reporting period.
    (e) Address for filing: Data Administration Division, K-14, Room 
4125, Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., 
Washington, DC 20590-0001.
    (f) ADP format for magnetic tape--(1) Magnetic tape specifications. 
IBM compatible 9-track EBCDIC recording. Recording density of 6250 or 
1600 bpi. The order of recorded information is:

Volume label
Header label
Data records
Trailer label

    (2) [Reserved]
    (g) External tape label information:

Carrier name
Report date
File identification
Carrier address for return of tape reel

    (h) Standards. It is the policy of the Department to be consistent 
with the American National Standards Institute and the Federal Standards 
Activity in all data processing and telecommunications matters. It is 
our intention that all specifications in this application be in 
compliance with standards promulgated by these organizations.
    (i) Volume, header, and trailer label formats:
    (1) Use standard IBM label formats. The file identifier field of the 
header labels should be ``T-100.SYSTEM''.
    (2) [Reserved]

    (k) Record layouts for microcomputer diskettes. The record layouts 
for diskettes are generally identical to those shown for magnetic tape, 
with the exception that delimiters (quotation marks, tabs and commas) 
are used to separate fields. It is necessary that the order of fields be 
maintained in all records.
    (1) File characteristics. The files will be created in ASCII 
delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This 
form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data 
elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by 
quotation marks (``) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data 
elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by 
a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition 
within a given record. Therefore, it is critical that each record 
contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be 
juxtapositionally correct. PC software including most spreadsheets, data 
base management programs, and BASIC produce minidisk files in this 
format.
    (2) File naming conventions for diskettes. For microcomputer 
reports, each record type shall be contained in a separate DOS file on 
the same physical diskette. The following DOS naming conventions should 
be followed:

Record type S = SEGMENT.DAT
Record type M = MARKET.DAT

    (l) Discussion of Reporting Concept. (1) Schedule T-100 collects 
summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data. All traffic 
statistics shall be compiled in terms of each revenue flight stage as 
actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a 
manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two 
basic groupings. The first grouping, the nonstop segment information, is 
to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within 
pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second 
grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken 
out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be 
summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard 
for equipment type or flight number.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (m) Joint Service--(1) Joint-service operations. The Department may 
authorize joint-service operations between two direct air carriers. 
Examples of these joint-service operations are: Blocked-space 
agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease 
agreements, and other similar arrangements.
    (i) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in 
operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its 
flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving 
under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any 
other traffic on the aircraft.
    (ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service 
operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information (fax 
no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373).
    (iii) Operational control. The air carrier in operational control of 
the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crew under its own FAA 
operating authority) must report joint-service operations.
    (2) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 243.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to ensure that the U.S. government has 
prompt and adequate information in case of an aviation disaster on 
covered flight segments.


<R05>
Sec. 243.3  Definitions.

    Air piracy means any seizure of or exercise of control over an 
aircraft, by force or violence or threat of force or violence, or by any 
other form of intimidation, and with wrongful intent.
    Aviation disaster means:
    (1) An occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft that 
takes place between the time any passengers have boarded the aircraft 
with the intention of flight and the time all such persons have 
disembarked or have been removed from the aircraft, and in which any 
person suffers death or serious injury, and in which the death or injury 
was caused by a crash, fire, collision, sabotage or accident;
    (2) A missing aircraft; or
    (3) An act of air piracy.
    Contact means a person not on the covered flight or an entity that 
should be contacted in case of an aviation disaster. The contact need 
not have any particular relationship to a passenger.
    Covered airline means:
    (1) certificated air carriers, and
    (2) foreign air carriers, except those that hold Department of 
Transportation authority to conduct operations in foreign air 
transportation using only small aircraft (i.e., aircraft designed to 
have a maximum passenger capacity of not more than 60 seats or a maximum 
payload capacity of not more than 18,000 pounds).
    Covered flight segment means a passenger-carrying flight segment 
operating to or from the United States (i.e., the flight segment where 
the last point of departure or the first point of arrival is in the 
United States). A covered flight segment does not include a flight 
segment in which both the point of departure and point of arrival are in 
the United States.
    Full name means the given name, middle initial or middle name, if 
any, and family name or surname as provided by the passenger.
    Passenger means every person aboard a covered flight segment 
regardless of whether he or she paid for the transportation, had a 
reservation, or occupied a seat, except the crew. For the purposes of 
this part, passenger includes, but is not limited to, a revenue and non-
revenue passenger, a person holding a confirmed reservation, a standby 
or walkup, a person rerouted from another flight or airline, an infant 
held upon a person's lap and a person occupying a jump seat. Airline 
personnel who are on board but not working on that particular flight 
segment would be considered passengers for the purpose of this part.
    United States means the States comprising the United States of 
America, the District of Columbia, and the territories and possessions 
of the United States, including the territorial sea and the overlying 
airspace.
    U.S. citizen means United States nationals as defined in 8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(22).

pursuant to oversight of this part. This paragraph does not preempt 
other governments or governmental agencies that have an independent, 
legal right to obtain this information.
    (d) The contact information collected pursuant to section 
243.7(a)(2) of this part shall only be used by covered airlines for 
notification of family members or listed contacts following an aviation 
disaster. The information shall not be used for commercial or marketing 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 243.11  Transmission of information after an aviation disaster.

    (a) Each covered airline shall inform the Managing Director of 
Overseas Citizen Services, Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department

<R05>
Sec. 243.17  Enforcement.

    The U.S. Department of Transportation may at any time require a 
covered airline to produce a passenger manifest including emergency 
contacts and phone numbers for a specified covered flight segment to 
ascertain the effectiveness of the carrier's system. In addition, it may 
require from any covered airline further information about collection, 
storage and transmission procedures at any time. If the Department finds 
a covered airline's system to be deficient, it will require appropriate 
modifications, which must be implemented within the period specified by 
the Department. In addition, a covered airline not in compliance with 
this part may be subject to enforcement action by the Department.

    For the purposes of this part:

[[Page 196]]

    Authorized representatives of the DOT means any persons, including 
special agents and auditors, designated by the DOT to perform 
inspections, audits, or examinations within the purview of the DOT's 
authority.
    Certificated air carrier means the holder of a certificate of public 
convenience and necessity issued by the Department of Transportation 
under 49 U.S.C. 41102 or a certificate for all-cargo air service issued 
by the Department of Transportation under 49 U.S.C. 41103.
    Final adjudication means the expiration date of the last possible 
period of review or reconsideration of a given case, by the DOT or by a 
court, that is provided by applicable statute or regulation.
    Open mail rate period means the time interval between the date of 
institution of a new mail rate proceeding or the start of service over a 
new route for which no mail rate has previously been fixed, and the date 
upon which a DOT order setting the final mail rate becomes legally 
effective.
    Pending case means any case that the DOT is empowered to hear before 
its final adjudication.
    Records include all documents that are related to, or constitute 
integral links in developing the history of, or facts regarding, 
financial transactions or physical operations of a particular segment, 
operating division, or entire system of the carrier's operations. The 
term includes any copy of initially prepared documents which bear 
approvals, comments, or notations which were added and are of 
significance to a full explanation of recorded facts or information. The 
term records means not only accounting records in a limited technical 
sense but all other evidentiary accounts of events such as memoranda, 
correspondence, working sheets, tabulating equipment listings punched 
cards, computer-produced listings, microfilm, and magnetic storage media 
(i.e., magnetic tapes, disks). The term records also means microform

<R05>
Sec. 249.3  Preservation of records.

    (a) All records listed in Sec. Sec. 249.20 and 249.21 may be 
preserved on either paper or nonerasable microfilm (see Sec. 249.4). 
However, a paper or microfilm record need not be created to satisfy the 
requirements of this part if the record is initially prepared in a 
machine-readable medium such as punched cards, magnetic tapes, and 
disks. The records maintained in machine-readable media and the 
underlying data used in their preparation shall be preserved for the 
periods prescribed in Sec. Sec. 249.20 and 249.21. A paper or microfilm 
record shall not be destroyed after transfer to a machine-readable 
medium before expiration of the prescribed period: however, a waiver 
permitting the early destruction of paper or microfilm records 
transferred to a machine-readable medium may be granted by the Director, 
Office of Airline Information, when it is demonstrated by the requesting 
carrier that the substantive purpose of the retention requirement will 
be met by retention of the information in machine-readable form (see 
Sec. 249.10).
    (b) Each record kept in a machine-readable medium shall be 
accompanied by a statement clearly indicating the type of data included 
in the record and certifying that the information contained in it is 
complete and accurate. This statement shall be executed by a person 
having personal knowledge of the facts contained in the records. The 
records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner so that they are 
easily accessible, and the carrier shall have the facilities available 
to locate, identify and reproduce the records in readable form without 
loss of clarity. Authorized representatives of the DOT shall be given 
immediate access to the carrier's facilities upon request.
    (c) If any record which must be retained under the provisions of 
Sec. Sec. 249.20

[[Page 197]]

and 249.21 is included as an exhibit to another document which must also 
be retained, the carrier need only keep in its files one copy of the 
record to satisfy these record retention requirements. In these cases, 
the carrier shall establish adequate cross-references to assist in 
locating the record.
    (d) The provisions in this part do not excuse noncompliance with 
requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, 
prescribing longer retention periods for any rec ords.

[ER-1214, 46 FR 25415, May 6, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 66725, Dec. 26,

<R05>
Sec. 249.4  Photographic copies.

    (a) Any record may be transferred to nonerasable microfilm 
(including microfiche, computer output microfilm, and aperture cards) at 
any time. Rec ords so maintained on microfilm shall satisfy the minimum 
requirements listed in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
    (b) The microfilm shall be of a quality that can be easily read and 
that can be reproduced in paper similar in size to an original without 
loss of clarity or detail during the periods the rec ords are required 
to be retained in Sec. Sec. 249.20 and 249.21.
    (c) Microfilm records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner 
as will render them readily accessible, and the company shall have 
facilities available to locate, identify and read the microfilm and 
reproduce in paper form. Authorized representatives of the DOT shall be 
given immediate access to these facilities upon request.
    (d) Any significant characteristic, feature, or other attribute 
which microfilm will not preserve shall be clearly indicated at the 
beginning of each roll of film or series of microfilm records if 
applicable to all records on the roll or series, or on the individual 
record, as appropriate.
    (e) The printed side of printed forms need not be microfilmed for 
each record if nothing has been added to the printed matter common to 
all such forms, but an identified specimen of the form shall be on the 
film for reference.
    (f) Each roll of film or series of microfilm records shall include a 
microfilm of a certificate stating that the photographs are direct and 
facsimile reproductions of the original records and they have been made 
in accordance with prescribed regulations. Such a certificate shall be 
executed by a person having personal knowledge of these facts. Where the 
microfilm is computer output, the microfilm certificate shall state that 
the information is complete and accurate.

    (a) Upon the expiration of the period of preservation prescribed in 
this regulation, records may be destroyed at the option of the carrier.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified, duplicate copies of records may be 
destroyed at any time if they contain no significant information not 
shown on the originals.


<R05>
Sec. 249.7  Restrictions on record destruction.

    (a) Each carrier that has been named a party to a pending mail rate 
case shall retain all records remaining in its custody as of the 
beginning of an ``open mail rate period'' until the occurrence of one of 
the following contingencies, whichever is first:
    (1) Final adjudication of a DOT order fixing the final mail 
compensation payable for services rendered during an ``open mail rate 
period.''
    (2) Receipt of a notice issued by the Director, Office of Airline 
Information in response to a written application filed by the carrier, 
authorizing the destruction of specifically identified categories of rec 
ords. An application should be filed when the carrier believes that 
certain categories of records are not relevant to the proper processing 
of a pending mail proceeding. The application should list those 
categories of records which the carrier wants to destroy and its reasons 
for believing that the rec ords are not necessary or useful in 
determining its satutory mail pay.

[[Page 198]]

    (b) Each carrier shall preserve rec ords supporting the computation 
of subsidy mail pay in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 249.20 
unless the carrier has been advised that these computations are subject 
to further review and disposition by the Board. When the DOT is still 
reviewing the compensation amount after expiration of the normal 
retention period specified in Sec. 249.20, these records must be 
retained until the carrier is notified by the Director, Office of 
Airline Information, that the records may be destroyed.
    (c) Each carrier that has been named a party to an enforcement 
proceeding or against whom a third-party complaint has been filed shall 
retain all records relating to the case until the receipt of formal 
notification from the Director, Office of Airline Information, following 
a written application from the carrier, which authorizes the destruction 
of these records.
    (d) Each carrier that has been named a party to a pending case which 
is not of a type discussed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this 
section, shall preserve all records according to the provisions of Sec. 
249.20 unless the Director, Office of Airline Information, notifies the 
carrier in writing that specific records shall be preserved until final 
adjudication of the pending case.
    (e) Each carrier that is a party to litigation in a Federal court of 
which the DOT is also a party shall retain all records relating to the 
case until the receipt of formal notification from the Director, Office 
of Airline Information, following a written application from the 
carrier, which authorizes the destruction of these records.

1995]


<R05>
Sec. 249.8  Premature loss or destruction of records.

    If records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the 
prescribed retention period, a statement shall be prepared and submitted 
to the Director, Office of Airline Information, which lists, as 
accurately as possible, the unavailable records and describes the 
circumstances under which they became unavailable.

[ER-1214, 46 FR 25415, May 6, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 66725, Dec. 26,

<R05>
Sec. 249.9  Carriers going out of business.

    The records referred to in these regulations may be destroyed after 
the business is discontinued and the carrier is completely liquidated. 
The records may not be destroyed until dissolution is final and all 
transactions and litigations are completed. When a carrier is merged 
with another company which is regulated by the DOT, the successor 
company shall preserve rec ords of the merged company in accordance with 
these regulations.

[ER-1214, 46 FR 25415, May 6, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 66725, Dec. 26,

<R05>
Sec. 249.10  Waiver of requirements.

    A waiver from any provision of this regulation may be made by the 
Director, Office of Airline Information, upon the Director's own 
initiative or upon submission of a written request by a carrier or group 
of carriers. Each request for waiver shall demonstrate that unusual 
circumstances warrant a departure from prescribed retention periods, 
procedures, or techniques, or that compliance with the prescribed 
requirements would impose an unreasonable burden on the carrier, and 
that granting the waiver would be in the public interest.

[ER-1214, 46 FR 25415, May 6, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 66726, Dec. 26,

volunteers and who willingly accepts the carriers' offer of 
compensation, in any amount, in exchange for relinquishing the confirmed 
reserved space. Any other passenger denied boarding is considered for 
purposes of this part to have been denied boarding involuntarily, even 
if that passenger accepts the denied boarding compensation.
    (b) If an insufficient number of volunteers come forward, the 
carrier may deny boarding to other passengers in accordance with its 
boarding priority rules. However, the carrier may not deny boarding to 
any passenger involuntarily who was earlier asked to volunteer without 
having been informed

about the danger of being denied boarding involuntarily and the amount 
of DOT-mandated compensation.

Sec. 250.3  Boarding priority rules.

    (a) Every carrier shall establish priority rules and criteria for 
determining which passengers holding confirmed reserved space shall be 
denied boarding on an oversold flight in the event that an insufficient 
number of volunteers come forward. Such rules and criteria shall reflect 
the obligations of the carrier set forth in Sec. Sec. 250.2a and 250.2b 
to minimize involuntary denied boarding and to request volunteers, and 
shall be written in such manner as to be understandable and meaningful 
to the average passenger. Such rules and criteria shall not make, give, 
or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any 
particular person or subject any particular person to any unjust or 
unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.

Sec. 250.5  Amount of denied boarding compensation for passengers 
denied boarding involuntarily.

    (a) Subject to the exceptions provided in Sec. 250.6, a carrier as 
defined in Sec. 250.1, shall pay compensation to passengers denied 
boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight at the rate of 200 
percent of the sum of the values of the passenger's remaining flight 
coupons up to the passenger's next stopover, or if none, to the 
passenger's final destination, with a maximum of $400. However, the 
compensation shall be one-half the amount described above, with a $200 
maximum, if the carrier arranges for comparable air transporation, or 
other transportation used by the passenger that, at the time either such 
arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the 
passenger's next stopover or if none, at the airport of the passenger's 
destination, not later than 2 hours after the time the direct or 
connecting flight on which confirmed space is held is planned to arrive 
in the case of interstate air transportation, or 4 hours after such time 
in the case of foreign air transportation.
    (b) Carriers may offer free or reduced rate air transportation in 
lieu of the cash due under paragraph (a) of this section, if (1) the 
value of the transportation benefit offered is equal to or greater than 
the cash payment otherwise required, and (2) the carrier informs the 
passenger of the amount of cash compensation that would otherwise be due 
and that the passenger may decline the transportation benefit and 
receive the cash payment.

Sec. 250.6  Exceptions to eligibility for denied boarding compensation.

    A passenger denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight 
shall not be eligible for denied boarding compensation if:
    (a) The passenger does not comply fully with the carrier's contract 
of carriage or tariff provisions regarding ticketing, reconfirmation, 
check-in, and acceptability for transportation;
    (b) The flight for which the passenger holds confirmed reserved 
space is unable to accommodate that passenger because of substitution of 
equipment of lesser capacity when required by operational or safety 
reasons;
    (c) The passenger is offered accommodations or is seated in a 
section of the aircraft other than that specified on the ticket at no 
extra charge, except that a passenger seated in a section for which a 
lower fare is charged shall be entitled to an appropriate refund; or
    (d) The carrier arranges comparable air transportation, or other 
transportation used by the passenger at no extra cost to the passenger, 
that at the time such arrangements are made is planned to arrive at the 
airport of the passenger's next stopover or, if none, at the airport of 
the final destination not later than 1 hour after the planned arrival 
time of the passenger's original flight or flights.

check for the appropriate amount of compensation provided in Sec. 
250.5.
    (b) Where a carrier arranges, for the passenger's convenience, 
alternate means of transportation that departs before the payment can be 
prepared and given to the passenger, tender shall be made by mail or 
other means within 24 hours after the time the denied boarding occurs.

<R05>
Sec. 250.9  Written explanation of denied boarding compensation and 
boarding priorities.

    (a) Every carrier shall furnish passengers who are denied boarding 
involuntarily from flights on which they hold confirmed reserved space 
immediately after the denied boarding occurs, a written statement 
explaining the terms, conditions, and limitations of denied boarding 
compensation, and describing the carriers' boarding priority rules and 
criteria. The carrier shall also furnish the statement to any person 
upon request at all airport ticket selling positions which are in the 
charge of a person employed exclusively by the carrier, or by it jointly 
with another person or persons, and at all boarding locations being used 
by the carrier.
    (b) The statement shall read as follows:

                    Compensation For Denied Boarding

    If you have been denied a reserved seat on (name of air carrier), 
you are probably entitled to monetary compensation. This notice explains 
the airline's obligation and the passenger's rights in the case of an 
oversold flight, in accordance with regulations of the U.S. Department 
of Transportation.

                   Volunteers and Boarding Priorities

    If a flight is oversold (more passengers hold confirmed reservations 
than there are seats available), no one may be denied boarding against 
his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who 
will give up their reservation willingly, in exchange for a payment of 
the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, other 
passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with the 
following boarding priority of (name of air carrier): (In this space 
carrier inserts its boarding priority rules or a summary thereof, in a 
manner to be understandable to the average passenger.)

               Compensation of Involuntary Denied Boarding

    If you are denied boarding involuntarily, you are entitled to a 
payment of ``denied boarding compensation'' from the airline unless:
    (1) You have not fully complied with the airline's ticketing, check-
in, and reconfirmation requirements, or you are not acceptable for 
transportation under the airline's usual rules and practices, or (2) you 
are denied boarding because the flight is canceled; or (3) you are 
denied boarding because a smaller capacity aircraft was substituted for 
safety or operational reasons; or (4) you are offered accommodations in 
a section of the aircraft other than specified in your ticket, at no 
extra charge, (a passenger seated in a section for which a lower fare is 
charged must be given an appropriate refund); or (5) the airline is able 
to place you on another flight or flights that are planned to reach your 
final destination within one hour of the scheduled arrival of your 
original flight.

                 Amount of Denied Boarding Compensation

    Passengers who are eligible for denied boarding compensation must be 
offered a payment equal to the sum of the face values of their ticket 
coupons, with a $200 maximum. However, if the airline cannot arrange 
``alternate transportation'' (see below) for the passenger, the 
compensation is doubled ($400 maximum). The ``value'' of a ticket coupon 
is the one-way fare for the flight shown on the coupon including any 
surcharge and air transportation tax, minus any applicable discount. All 
flight coupons, including connecting flights, to the passenger's final 
destination or first 4-hour stopover are used to compute the 
compensation.
    ``Alternate transportation'' is air transportation (by an airline 
licensed by DOT) or other transportation used by the passenger which, at 
the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the 
passenger's next scheduled stopover (of 4 hours or longer) or final 
destination no later than 2 hours (for flights within U.S. points, 
including territories and possessions) or 4 hours (for international 
flights) after the passenger's originally scheduled arrival time.

[[Page 204]]

                            Method of Payment

    The airline must give each passenger who qualifies for denied 
boarding compensation a payment by cash or check for the amount 
specified above, on the day and place the involuntary denied boarding 
occurs. However, if the airline arranges alternate transportation for 
the passenger's convenience that departs before the payment can be made, 
the payment will be sent to the passenger within 24 hours. The air 
carrier may offer free tickets in place of the cash payment. The 
passenger may, however, insist on the cash payment, or refuse all 
compensation and bring private legal action.

                           Passenger's Options

    Acceptance of the compensation may relieve (name of air carrier) 
from any further liability to the passenger caused by its failure to 
honor the confirmed reservation. However, the passenger may decline the 
payment and seek to recover damages in a court of law or in some other 
manner.

Sec. 250.11  Public disclosure of deliberate overbooking and boarding 
procedures.

    (a) Every carrier shall cause to be displayed continuously in a 
conspicuous public place at each desk, station, and position in the 
United States which is in the charge of a person employed exclusively by 
it, or by it jointly with another person, or by any agent employed by 
such air carrier or foreign air carrier to sell tickets to passengers, a 
sign located so as to be clearly visible and clearly readable to the 
traveling public, which shall have printed thereon the following 
statement in boldface type at least one-fourth of an inch high:

                     Notice--Overbooking of Flights

    Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that 
a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a 
confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be 
denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing 
to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's 
choosing. If there are not enough volunteers the airline will deny 
boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding 
priority. With few exceptions persons denied boarding involuntarily are 
entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of 
compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all 
airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not 
apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, 
although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your 
airline or your travel agent.

    (b) Every carrier shall include with each ticket sold in the United 
States the notices set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, printed 
in at least 12-point type. The notice may be printed on a separate piece 
of paper, on the ticket stock, or on the ticket envelope. The last two 
sentences of the notice shall be printed in a type face contrasting with 
that of the rest of the notice.
    (c) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to ensure that 
travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for that carrier 
comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier engaged in foreign air 
transportation that complies fully with this part for inbound traffic to

    This part implements a ban on smoking of tobacco products on air 
carrier and foreign air carrier flights in scheduled intrastate, 
interstate and foreign air transportation, as required by 49 USC 41706. 
It also addresses smoking on charter flights. Nothing in this regulation

(a) of this section on the basis that paragraph (a) provides for 
extraterritorial application of the laws of the United States may 
request and obtain a waiver of paragraph (a) from the Assistant 
Secretary of Transportation for Transportation Policy, provided that an 
alternative smoking prohibition resulting from bilateral negotiations is 
in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 252.7  No-smoking sections.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, air 
carriers operating nonstop flight segments to which Sec. Sec. 252.3 and 
252.13 do not apply shall provide, at a minimum:
    (1) A no-smoking section for each class of service;
    (2) A sufficient number of seats in each no-smoking section to 
accommodate all persons in that class of service who wish to be seated 
there;
    (3) Expansion of no-smoking sections to meet passenger demand; and
    (4) Special provisions to ensure that if a no-smoking section is 
placed between smoking sections, the nonsmoking passengers are not 
unreasonably burdened.
    (b) On flights for which passengers may make confirmed reservations 
and on which seats are assigned before boarding, an air carrier need not 
provide a seat in a no-smoking section to a passenger who has not met 
the carrier's requirements as to time and method of obtaining a seat on 
the

[[Page 206]]

flight, or who does not have a confirmed reservation. If a seat is 
available in the established no-smoking section, however, an air carrier

bought tickets at those locations without the notice required in Sec. 
253.5 are given that notice not later than check-in for the travel in 
interstate or overseas air transportation, and that conspicuous notice 
is included on or with the ticket stating that the price for that travel 
is refundable without penalty.
    (b) An air taxi operator (including a commuter air carrier) not 
operating under subpart I of part 298 of this chapter shall not be 
considered to have incorporated terms by reference into its contract of 
carriage merely because a passenger has purchased a flight segment on 
that carrier that appears on ticket stock that contains a statement that 
terms have been incorporated by reference. However, such an air taxi 
operator may not claim the benefit as against the passenger of, and the 
passenger shall not be bound by, any contract term incorporated by 
reference if notice of the term has not been provided to the passenger 
in accordance with this part.

between a ticket agent and the internal reservations systems of 
individual carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 255.4  Display of information.

    (a) All systems shall provide at least one integrated display that 
includes the schedules, fares, rules, and availability of all 
participating carriers in accordance with the provisions of this 
section. This display shall be at least as useful for subscribers, in 
terms of functions or enhancements offered and the ease with which such 
functions or enhancements can be performed or implemented, as any other 
displays maintained by the system vendor. No system shall make available 
to subscribers any integrated display unless that display complies with 
the requirements of this section.
    (1) Each system must offer an integrated display that uses the same 
editing and ranking criteria for both on-line and interline connections 
and does not give on-line connections a system-imposed preference over 
interline connections. This display shall be at least as useful for 
subscribers, in terms of functions or enhancements offered and the ease 
with which such functions or enhancements can be performed or 
implemented, as any other display maintained by the system vendor.
    (2) Each integrated display offered by a system must either use 
elapsed time as a significant factor in selecting service options from 
the database or give single-plane flights a preference over connecting 
services in ranking services in displays.
    (b) In ordering the information contained in an integrated display, 
systems shall not use any factors directly or indirectly relating to 
carrier identity.
    (1) Systems may order the display of information on the basis of any 
service criteria that do not reflect carrier identity and that are 
consistently applied to all carriers and to all markets.
    (2) When a flight involves a change of aircraft at a point before 
the final destination, the display shall indicate that passengers on the 
flight will change from one aircraft to another.
    (3) Each system shall provide to any person upon request the current 
criteria used in editing and ordering flights for the integrated 
displays and the weight given to each criterion and the specifications 
used by the system's programmers in constructing the algorithm.
    (c) Systems shall not use any factors directly or indirectly 
relating to carrier identity in constructing the display of connecting 
flights in an integrated display.
    (1) Systems shall select the connecting points (and double connect 
points) to be used in the construction of connecting flights for each 
city pair on the basis of service criteria that do not reflect carrier 
identity and that are applied consistently to all carriers and to all 
markets.
    (2) Systems shall select connecting flights for inclusion (``edit'') 
on the basis of service criteria that do not reflect carrier identity 
and that are applied consistently to all carriers.
    (3) Systems shall provide to any person upon request current 
information on:
    (i) All connecting points and double connect points used for each 
market;
    (ii) All criteria used to select connecting points and double 
connect points;
    (iii) All criteria used to ``edit'' connecting flights; and
    (iv) The weight given to each criterion in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section.
    (4) Participating carriers shall be entitled to request that a 
system use up to five connect points (and double connect points) in 
constructing connecting flights for the display of service in a

[[Page 211]]

market. The system may require participating carriers to use specified 
procedures for such requests, but no such procedures may be unreasonably 
burdensome, and any procedures required of participating carriers must 
be applied without unreasonable discrimination between participating 
airlines.
    (5) When a system selects connecting points and double connect 
points for use in constructing connecting flights it shall use at least 
fifteen points and six double connect points for each city-pair, except 
that a system may select fewer such connect or double connect points for 
a city-pair where:
    (i) Fewer than fifteen connecting points and six double connect 
points meet the service criteria described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section; and
    (ii) The system has used all the points that meet those criteria, 
along with all additional connecting points and double connect points 
requested by participating carriers.
    (6) If a system selects connecting points and double connect points 
for use in constructing connecting flights it shall use every point 
requested by a participating carrier up to the maximum number of points 
that the system can use. The system may use fewer than all the connect 
points requested by participating carriers to the extent that:
    (i) Points requested by participating carriers do not meet the 
service criteria described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
    (ii) The system has used all the points that meet those criteria.
    (d) Each system shall apply the same standards of care and 
timeliness to loading information concerning every participating 
carrier. Each system shall display accurately information submitted by 
participating carriers. Each system shall provide to any person upon 
request all current data base update procedures and data formats.
    (e) Systems shall use or display information concerning on-time 
performance of flights as follows:
    (1) Within 10 days after receiving the information from 
participating carriers or third parties, each system shall include in 
all integrated schedule and availability displays the on-time 
performance code for each nonstop flight segment and one-stop or multi-
stop single plane flight, for which a participating carrier provides a 
code.
    (2) A system shall not use on-time flight performance as a ranking 
factor in ordering information contained in an integrated display.
    (f) Each participating carrier shall ensure that complete and 
accurate information is provided each system in a form such that the 
system is able to display its flights in accordance with this section.
    (g) A system may make available to subscribers the internal 
reservations system display of a participating carrier, provided that a 
subscriber and its employees may see any such display only by requesting 
it for a specific transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 255.5  Contracts with participating carriers.

    (a) No system may require a carrier to maintain any particular level 
of participation or buy any enhancements in its system on the basis of 
participation levels or enhancements selected by that carrier in any 
other foreign or domestic computerized reservations system, as a 
condition to participation in the system.
    (b) No system may require any carrier as a condition to 
participation to provide it with fares that the carrier has chosen not 
to sell through that system.


<R05>
Sec. 255.6  Exceptions.

    The obligations of a system under Sec. 255.4 shall not apply with 
respect to a carrier that refuses to enter into and comply with a 
participating airline contract with that system.


<R05>
Sec. 255.7  Prohibition against Carrier Bias.

    No carrier may induce or attempt to induce a system to create a 
display that would not comply with the requirements of Sec. 255.4.


<R05>

written notice required by this part shall be delivered in advance along 
with the ticket. If time does not allow for advance delivery of the 
ticket, or in the case of ticketless travel, the written notice required 
by this part shall be provided no later than the time that they check in 
at the airport for the first flight in their itinerary.
    (4) At the purchaser's request, the notice required by this part may 
be delivered in person or by telecopier, electronic mail, or any other 
reliable method of transmitting written material.
    (d) In any printed advertisement published in or mailed to or from 
the United States (including those published through the Internet) for 
service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing 
arrangement or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall prominently 
disclose that the advertised service may involve travel on another 
carrier and clearly indicate the nature of the service in reasonably 
sized type and shall identify all potential transporting carriers 
involved in the markets being advertised by corporate name and by any 
other name under which that service is held out to the public. In any 
radio or television advertisement broadcast in the United States for 
service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing or

    (d) Ticket agent has the meaning ascribed to it in 49 U.S.C. 
40102(40).


<R05>
Sec. 258.4  Unfair and deceptive practice.

    The holding out or sale of scheduled passenger air transportation 
that involves change-of-gauge service is prohibited as an unfair or 
deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition within the meaning 
of 49 U.S.C. 41712 unless, in conjunction with such holding out or sale, 
carriers and ticket agents follow the requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 258.5  Notice requirement.

    (a) Notice in schedules. Carriers holding out or operating change-
of-gauge services to, from, or within the United States shall ensure 
that in the written and electronic schedule information they provide to 
the public, to the Official Airline Guide and comparable publications, 
and to computer reservations systems, these services are shown as 
requiring a change of aircraft.
    (b) Oral notice to prospective consumers. In any direct oral 
communication with a consumer in the United States concerning a change-
of-gauge service, any carrier or ticket agent doing business in the 
United States shall tell the consumer before booking scheduled passenger 
air transportation to, from, or within the United States that the 
service requires a change of aircraft en route.
    (c) Written notice. At the time of sale in the United States of 
transportation that includes a change-of-gauge service to, from, or 
within the United States, or, if no ticket is issued, no later than the 
time when the passenger checks in at the airport for the first flight in 
an itinerary that includes such a service, the selling carrier or ticket 
agent shall provide the following written notice:

                   Notice: Change of Aircraft Required

    For at least one of your flights, you must change aircraft en route 
even though your ticket may show only one flight number and have only 
one flight coupon for that flight. Further, in the case of some travel, 
one of your flights may not be identified at the airport by the number 
on your ticket, or it may be identified by other flight numbers in 
addition to the one on your ticket. At your request, the seller of this 
ticket will give you details of your change of aircraft, such as where 
it will occur and what aircraft types are involved.

<R05>
Sec. 271.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes the guidelines required by 49 U.S.C. 41736 to 
be used by the Department in establishing the fair and reasonable amount 
of compensation needed to ensure the continuation of essential air 
service to an eligible place under 49 U.S.C. 41731 and 41734. These 
guidelines are intended to cover normal carrier selection cases and rate 
renewal cases, and not necessarily emergency carrier selection cases.

[60 FR 43524, Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Eligible place means a place in the United States that--
    (1) Was an eligible point under section 419 of the Federal Aviation 
Act of 1958 as in effect before October 1, 1988;
    (2) Received scheduled air transportation at any time between 
January 1, 1990, and November 4, 1990; and
    (3) Is not listed in Department of Transportation Orders 89-9-37 and 
89-12-52 as a place ineligible for compensation under Subchapter II of 
Chapter 417 of the Statute.
    Essential air service is that air transportation which the 
Department has found to be essential under Subchapter II of Chapter 417 
of the Statute.

[60 FR 43524, Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.3  Carrier subsidy need.

    In establishing the subsidy for an air carrier providing essential 
air service at an eligible place, the Department will consider the 
following:
    (a) The reasonable projected costs of a carrier in serving that 
place;
    (b) The carrier's reasonable projected revenues for serving that 
place;
    (c) The appropriate size of aircraft for providing essential air 
service at that place; and
    (d) A reasonable profit for a carrier serving that place.

[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, Aug. 
22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.4  Carrier costs.

    (a) The reasonable costs projected for a carrier providing essential 
air service at an eligible place will be evaluated:
    (1) For costs attributable to the carrier's flying operations 
(direct expenses), by comparing the projected costs submitted by the 
carrier with the following:
    (i) The carrier's historical direct operating costs with the same or 
similar aircraft types;
    (ii) The direct operating unit costs of similar carriers using the 
same or similar equipment; and
    (iii) Data supplied by the manufacturer of the carrier's aircraft.
    (2) For other costs, by one or more of the following methods:
    (i) By direct assignment where the indirect costs are attributable 
to the carrier's operations at the eligible place;
    (ii) By comparing the carrier's systemwide indirect operating 
expenses to those submitted by the carrier for the eligible place; or
    (iii) By comparing the indirect operating expenses submitted by the 
carrier with the ratio of indirect to direct costs that have been 
experienced by the carrier in other markets or to costs that are 
representative of the industry.
    (3) By considering the unique circumstances of the carrier or the 
community being served that justify deviations from the costs that would 
otherwise be established for that carrier under this paragraph.
    (4) By determining whether the aircraft to be used by the carrier at 
the eligible place, and on which its costs are derived, are appropriate 
for providing essential air service there. The appropriateness of the 
aircraft to be

[[Page 217]]

used is based on the following characteristics of the eligible place:
    (i) Traffic levels;
    (ii) The level of air service that the Department has decided is 
essential for the eligible place;
    (iii) Distance to the designated hub;
    (iv) The altitude at which the carrier must fly to the designated 
hub; and
    (v) Other operational elements involved.
    (b) When the essential air service would be made part of the 
carrier's linear system, the Department might, instead of the factors in 
paragraph (a) of this section, consider only the incremental costs that 
the carrier will incur in adding that service to its system.

[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, 
Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.5  Carrier revenues.

    (a) The projected passenger revenue for a carrier providing 
essential air service at an eligible place will be calculated by 
multiplying the following:
    (1) A reasonable projected net fare, which is the standard fare 
expected to be charged for service between the eligible place and the 
designated hub less any dilution caused by joint fare arrangements, 
discount fares that it offers, or prorates of fares for through one-line 
passengers; and
    (2) The traffic (including both local and beyond traffic) projected 
to flow between the eligible place and the designated hub or hubs, which 
is based on the carrier's own estimates, Department estimates, and on 
traffic levels in the market at issue when such data are available.
    (b) The reasonableness of a carrier's passenger revenue projections 
will be evaluated by:
    (1) Comparing the carrier's proposed fare with the fare charged in 
other city-pair markets of similar distances and traffic densities; and
    (2) Comparing the carrier's proposed pricing structure with 
historical pricing practices in the market at issue, with the pricing 
practices of that carrier in other markets, and with any standard 
industry pricing guidelines that may be available.
    (c) An estimate of freight and other transport-related revenue will 
be included as a component of projected revenues and will be based on 
recent experience in the market involved and on the experience of the 
carrier involved in other markets.

[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, Aug. 
22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.6  Profit element.

    The reasonable return for a carrier for providing essential air 
service at an eligible place generally will be set at a flat percentage, 
typically 5 percent of that carrier's projected operating costs as 
established under Sec. 271.4, plus any applicable interest expenses on 
flight equipment.

[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, 
Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.7  Subsidy payout formula.

    (a) Subsidy will be paid by the Department to the air carrier 
monthly, based on the subsidy rate established by the Department for the 
carrier under this part. Payments will not vary except as provided in 
this section.
    (b) While a carrier's subsidy rate will not vary even if actual 
revenues or costs differ from projections, the actual amount of each 
payment may vary depending on the following factors:
    (1) Seasonal characteristics of the carrier's operations at the 
eligible place;
    (2) The actual number of flights completed, aircraft miles flown, 
available seat-miles flown, or variations in other operational elements 
upon which the subsidy rate is based; or
    (3) Adjustments to the carrier's subsidy required by Sec. 271.8(b).
    (c) Payments will continue for the duration of the rate term 
established under Sec. 271.8 provided that the carrier continues to 
provide the required service.

[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, 
Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.8  Rate period.

    (a) The subsidy rate generally will be set for a 2-year period, or 
two consecutive 1-year periods. The Department may set the rate for a 
shorter period in the following situations:
    (1) A commuter air carrier is replacing a larger certificated 
carrier at the eligible place;

[[Page 218]]

    (2) Traffic at the eligible place has substantially decreased;
    (3) The Department considers the cost or revenue projections of the 
carrier for the second year to be unrealistic;
    (4) It is likely that there will be changes in the eligible place 
essential air service level; or
    (5) The uncertainties of the market or other circumstances warrant a 
shorter rate period.
    (b) The subsidy rate established for a carrier under this part will 
not be changed during the rate period unless an adjustment is required 
in the public interest.
    (c) At the end of the rate period, the carrier will not have a 
continuing right to receive subsidy for providing essential air service 
at the eligible place.

[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, 
Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 271.9  Discrimination prohibited.

    (a) All air carriers receiving subsidy under this part shall comply 
with the following:
    (1) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975;
    (2) The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 49 CFR part 21; and
    (3) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 49 CFR part 27, and part 382 of 
this chapter.
    (b) Within 1 year after it first receives a subsidy under this part, 
the carrier shall evaluate its practices and procedures for 
accommodating the handicapped in accordance with Sec. 382.23 of this 
chapter.
    (c) All air carriers seeking a subsidy under this part shall include 
in their subsidy application the assurances required by 49 CFR parts 20, 
21, 27 and 29, and Sec. 382.21 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 272.1  Purpose.

    Paragraph 5 of Article IX of the Federal Programs and Services 
Agreement implementing section 221(a)(5) of the Compact of Free 
Association between the United States and the Governments of the 
Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau (the 
Freely Associated States) provides, among other things, for the 
Department of Transportation (Department), as successor to the Civil 
Aeronautics Board (Board), to guarantee essential air service, with 
compensation if necessary, to certain places in these islands. 
Subparagraph 5(h) of the Agreement provides that the Department shall 
adopt rules to implement the provisions of paragraph 5 as it in its 
discretion deems appropriate. Section 221(a)(5) of the Compact, which 
was adopted by Congress as public laws (Pub. L. 99-239, Jan. 14, 1986; 
Pub. L. 99-658, Nov. 14, 1986), provides that the Department (as 
successor to the Board) has the authority to implement the provisions of 
paragraph 5 of the Agreement. This part implements these provisions of 
paragraph 5.

[Amdt. No. 272-1, 52 FR 5443, Feb. 23, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 43525,

<R05>
Sec. 272.2  Applicability.

    This part establishes the provisions applicable to the Department's 
guarantee of essential air service to places in the Federated States of 
Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau, and

[[Page 219]]

the payment of compensation for such services. The rule applies to U.S. 
air carriers and Freely Associated State Air Carriers providing 
essential air service to these places.

[Amdt. No. 272-1, 52 FR 5443, Feb. 23, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 43525,

<R05>
Sec. 272.3  Places eligible for guaranteed essential air service.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of this part, and paragraph 5 of 
Article IX of the Federal Programs and Services Agreement, the 
Department will make provision for the operation of essential air 
service, with compensation if necessary, to the following places in the 
Freely Associated States:
    In the Federated States of Micronesia: Ponape, Truk and Yap.
    In the Marshall Islands: Majuro and Kwajalein.
    In Palau: Koror.
    (b) The places specified herein in the Federated States of 
Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, respectively, shall cease to 
be eligible places under this part if any of those Governments withdraw 
from the subsidy provisions of Article IX of the Federal Programs and 
Services Agreement in accordance with paragraph 8 of Article IX or 
Article XII of that Agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 272.4  Applicability of procedures and policies under 49 
U.S.C. 41731-42.

    Since the authority of the Department to guarantee essential air 
service is derived from the Federal Programs and Services Agreement and 
the Compact of Free Association, the provisions and procedures utilized 
by the Department in implementation of 49 U.S.C. 41731-42 will be 
followed only to the extent determined by the Department to be 
consistent with the obligations assumed by the United States in the 
Agreement and Compact, and the provisions of this part.

[Amdt. No. 272-1, 52 FR 5443, Feb. 23, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 43525,

<R05>
Sec. 272.5  Determination of essential air service.

    Procedures for the determination of essential air service under this 
section, and review of that determination, shall, except to the extent 
otherwise directed by the Department, be governed by Sec. 325.4 (except 
the application of 49 U.S.C. 41737 in Sec. 325.4(b)); Sec. 325.6(a); 
Sec. Sec. 325.8-325.11; Sec. 325.12 (provided that all documents shall 
be served on the President and the designated authorities of the Freely 
Associated State concerned); and Sec. Sec. 325.13 and 325.14 of this

<R05>
Sec. 272.6  Considerations in the determination of essential air service.

    (a) In the determination of essential air service to an eligible 
Freely Associated State place, the Department shall consider, among 
other factors, the following:
    (1) The demonstrated level of traffic demand;
    (2) The amount of compensation necessary to maintain a level of 
service sufficient to meet that demand;
    (3) The extent to which the demand may be accommodated by connecting 
or other services of U.S., Freely Associated State, or foreign carriers 
by air--through U.S., Freely Associated State, or foreign places--that 
provide access to the U.S. air transportation system;
    (4) Alternative modes of transportation that may be available; and
    (5) The peculiar needs of the Freely Associated States for air 
transportation services.
    (b) The Guidelines for Individual Determinations of essential air 
service set forth in part 398 of this chapter shall be applied only to 
the extent the Department concludes that they are applicable to the 
special circumstances affecting transportation to the Freely Associated 
States and reflective of the provisions of this part.
    (c) Nothing in this part shall be construed as providing for a level 
of essential air service that would exceed the level of service 
justified by the considerations set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section.

[[Page 220]]


<R05>
Sec. 272.7  Notice of discontinuance of service.

    (a) An air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier shall not 
terminate, suspend, or reduce air service to any eligible Freely 
Associated State place, unless it has given notice as specified in this 
section, if as a result of the reduction of such service the aggregate 
of the remaining air service provided to such place would be below:
    (1) If the Department has not made a determination of essential air 
service for such place, the level of service specified in Order 80-9-63; 
and
    (2) If the Department has made a determination of essential air 
service for such place, that level of essential air service.
    (b) An air carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier wishing to 
terminate, suspend or reduce air service under paragraph (a) shall file 
a notice of such proposed reduction in service at least 90 days prior to 
such service reduction, in accordance with the procedures specified in 
Sec. Sec. 323.4, 323.6, and 323.7 of this chapter.
    (c) The notice shall be served on the President and the designated 
Authorities of the Freely Associated State concerned, in addition to the 
persons specified in Sec. 323.7.
    (d) The procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 323.9-323.18, to the 
extent applicable to 90-day notices filed by certificated air carriers, 
shall also be applicable to notices of terminations, suspensions or 
reductions in service filed under this section.

[Amdt. No. 272-1, 52 FR 5443, Feb. 23, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 43525, 
Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 272.8  Obligation to continue service.

    (a) If the Department finds that a proposed termination, suspension, 
or reduction in service by an air carrier or Freely Associated State Air 
Carrier will, or may, reduce service to an eligible Freely Associated 
State place below the level of essential air service to such place, 
whether or not the Department has previously determined the level of 
essential air service to such place, the Department may direct the air 
carrier or Freely Associated State Air Carrier concerned to maintain 
service to such place at a level the Department determines will ensure 
essential air service to such place, pending the commencement of 
alternative service as required to maintain the level of essential air 
service previously, or thereafter, determined by the Department.
    (b) During any period the Department requires an air carrier or 
Freely Associated State Air Carrier to maintain a level of service 
proposed to be terminated, suspended or reduced, following the filing of 
a 90 day notice in accordance with Sec. 272.7, the Department will 
provide for the payment of compensation to such carrier for any losses 
incurred by that carrier as a result of such required continuation of 
service in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 271 of this 
chapter. If the carrier is already receiving compensation pursuant to 
Sec. 272.9 of this part, the Department will continue to direct payment 
of such compensation during any period the carrier is required to 
maintain service. Such payments shall be made by the Department of 
Interior from funds appropriated for this purpose.
    (c) The Department will review its order from time to time and will 
revise the level of required service as necessary to maintain only the 
level of essential air service determined by the Department for that 
place, considering all other service to such place in accordance with 
Sec. 272.6(a)(3).
    (d) During the period any such air carrier or Freely Associated 
State Air Carrier is required to maintain service under this section, 
the Department will make every effort to obtain alternative service, 
with compensation if necessary, as required to maintain essential air 
service to such place.

[Amdt. No. 272-1, 52 FR 5443, Feb. 23, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 43525,

<R05>
Sec. 272.9  Selection of a carrier to provide essential air service 
and payment of compensation.

    (a) If the Department finds that essential air service will not be 
maintained to an eligible Freely Associated State place, the Department 
shall invite applications to provide the service required to maintain 
essential air service to such place.

[[Page 221]]

    (b) If the Department determines that essential air service will not 
be provided to such place in the absence of the payment of subsidy 
compensation to a carrier or carriers, the Department shall determine 
the compensation necessary, considering all other service to such place 
in accordance with Sec. 272.6(a)(3), to maintain the level of essential 
air service determined by the Department under Sec. 272.5, and the 
times and manner of the payment of such compensation.
    (c) The compensation determined by the Department to be necessary to 
maintain essential air service to such place shall be paid by the 
Department of Interior out of funds appropriated for that purpose, to 
the carrier or carriers selected by the Department.
    (d) The Department shall continue to specify compensation to be paid 
to a carrier or carriers under this section only as long as the 
Department determines that essential air service will not be provided to 
the Freely Associated State in the absence of the payment of such 
compensation.
    (e) Except as permitted in paragraph (f) of this section, the 
Department shall select a U.S. air carrier or carriers to provide 
essential air service for compensation.
    (f) The Department may select a Freely Associated State Air Carrier, 
holding a foreign air carrier permit issued in accordance with subpart D 
of part 211 of this chapter, to provide essential air service for 
compensation, only if--
    (1) No U.S. air carrier is available to provide the required 
essential air service; or
    (2) The compensation necessary for the provision of the required 
essential air service would be substantially less than the compensation 
necessary if such essential air service were to be provided by a U.S. 
air carrier.
    (g) Any order of the Department selecting a Freely Associated State 
Air Carrier to provide such essential air service shall be submitted to 
the President of the United States not less than 10 days prior to its 
effective date and shall be subject to stay or disapproval by the 
President.
    (h) Among the criteria that will be considered by the Department in 
its determination of the carrier or carriers to be selected to perform 
the required essential air service are:
    (1) The desirability of developing an integrated linear system of 
air transportation whenever such a system most adequately meets the air 
transportation needs of the Freely Associated States concerned;
    (2) The experience of the applicant in providing scheduled air 
service in the vicinity of the Freely Associated States for which 
essential air service is proposed to be provided;
    (3) The amount of compensation that will be required to provide the 
proposed essential air service;
    (4) The impact of the proposed service on service provided to other 
Freely Associated State points; and
    (5) The views of the Governments of the Freely Associated States 
concerned.
    (i) The Department may from time to time, on its own motion, or upon 
application of any carrier or government, review and change its 
selection of a carrier to provide essential air service, or its 
determination as to the compensation necessary to provide such essential 
air service.
    (j) All applications or other documents filed or issued in 
proceedings under this section shall be served upon the President of the 
Freely Associated State concerned and the Authorities designated by that 
Government(s) in accordance with Article II, paragraph 10, of the

Sec. 272.10  Conditions applicable to carriers serving a subsidized 
market.

    (a) The Department may, after providing an opportunity for comment 
by the carrier or carriers affected, impose service, fare or rate 
conditions on any U.S., Freely Associated State, foreign air carrier, or 
foreign carrier by air as

[[Page 222]]

a precondition to the payment of compensation necessary to maintain 
essential air service, whether or not the affected carrier is itself 
receiving subsidy compensation in the market, if it finds that:
    (1) Essential air service in a Freely Associated State market or 
markets will not be provided in the absence of the payment of 
compensation;
    (2) Specified service, rate or fare conditions are or will be 
necessary or desirable to minimize the required subsidy compensation; 
and
    (3) The imposition of such conditions will not unduly impair the 
service provided in the market.
    (b) To the extent the carrier or carriers upon whom the conditions 
are imposed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section do not hold a 
certificate, permit, or other authority from the Department that may be 
amended to effectively implement the specified conditions, the 
Department may notify the Government(s) of the Freely Associated States 
concerned that the imposition of such conditions on those carriers by 
those Governments shall be a precondition to the payment of the subsidy 
compensation required to maintain essential air service in the market in 
question.
    (c) The Department may withhold or suspend its provision for the 
payment of subsidy compensation required to maintain essential air 
service unless and until the Freely Associated State(s) concerned take 
the necessary action to impose the specified conditions on the carriers 
referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, and those carriers have 
complied with the specified conditions.
    (d) Any order of the Department imposing conditions, or requiring 
the imposition of conditions, pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
submitted to the President for review not less than 10 days prior to its 
effective date, and shall be subject to stay or disapproval by the 
President.

Sec. 291.44  BTS Schedule P-12(a), Fuel Consumption by Type of Service 
and Entity.

    (a) For the purposes of BTS schedule P-12(a), type of service shall 
be either scheduled service or nonscheduled service as those terms are 
defined in Sec. 291.45(c)(2) and (3).
    (b) For the purpose of this schedule, scheduled service shall be 
reported separately for:
    (1) Intra-Alaskan operations;
    (2) Domestic operations, which shall include all operations within 
and between the 50 States of the United States (except Intra-Alaska), 
the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United 
States Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession to a place in 
any State of the United States the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, or a 
U.S. territory or possession;
    (3) International operations are flight stages with one or both 
terminals outside the 50 States of the United States, the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin 
Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession.
    (c) For the purpose of this schedule, nonscheduled service shall be 
reported separately for domestic operations and international operations 
as defined in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, except that 
domestic and international Military Airlift Command (MAC) operations 
shall be reported on separate lines.
    (d) The cost data reported on each line shall represent the average 
cost of fuel, as determined at the station level, consumed in that 
geographic entity.
    (e)(1) The cost of fuel shall include shrinkage, but excludes:
    (i) ``Throughput'' and ``in to plane'' fees, i.e., service charges 
or gallonage levies assessed by or against the fuel vendor or 
concessionaire and passed on to the carrier in a separately identifiable 
form; and
    (ii) Nonrefundable Federal and State excise taxes.
    (2) However, ``through-put'' and ``in to plane'' charges that cannot 
be identified or segregated from the cost of fuel shall remain a part of 
the cost of fuel as reported on this schedule.
    (f) Each air carrier shall maintain records for each station showing 
the computation of fuel inventories and consumption for each fuel type. 
The periodic average cost method shall be used in computing fuel 
inventories and consumption. Under this method, an average unit cost for 
each fuel type shall be computed by dividing the total cost of fuel 
available (Beginning Inventory plus Purchases) by the total gallons 
available. The resulting unit cost shall then be used to determine the

[[Page 227]]

ending inventory and the total consumption costs to be reported on this 
schedule.
    (g) Where amounts reported for a specific entity include other than 
Jet A fuel, a footnote shall be added indicating the number of gallons 
and applicable costs of such other fuel included in amounts reported for 
that entity.
    (h) Where any adjustment(s) recorded on the books of the carrier 
results in a material distortion of the current month's schedule, 
carriers shall file a revised Schedule P-12(a) for the month(s) 
affected.

Sec. 291.45  BTS Schedule T-100, U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity 
Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market.

    (a) Each section 41103 all-cargo air carrier shall file Schedule T-
100, ``U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and 
On-Flight Market''.
    (b) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly.
    (1) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-
flight market data for revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be 
compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail 
T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly 
summarization and organization into two basic groupings. First, the 
nonstop segment information which is to be summarized by equipment type, 
within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to 
individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the 
enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units 
called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of 
service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or 
flight number.
    (2) Joint-service operations. The Department may authorize joint-
service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these 
joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter 
agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar 
arrangements.
    (i) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in 
operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its 
flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving 
under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any 
other traffic on the aircraft.
    (ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service 
operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information (fax 
no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations 
are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).
    (iii) Operational control. The air carrier in operational control of 
the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA 
operating authority) must report joint services.
    (c) Service classes.(1) The statistical classifications are designed 
to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each 
distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and 
nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services 
are placed into service classes as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Code                           Type of service
------------------------------------------------------------------------
F................................  Scheduled Passenger/Cargo.
G................................  Scheduled All-Cargo.
L................................  Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo/
 
P................................  Nonscheduled Civilian Cargo.
N................................  Nonscheduled Military Passenger/
                                    Cargo.
R................................  Nonscheduled Military Cargo.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements 
applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published 
schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/
Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first-class, coach, and mixed 
passenger/cargo service.
    (3) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements 
applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and 
other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of 
services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.
    (d) Air transport traffic and capacity elements. Within each of the 
service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and 
capacity elements. The elements are reported on

[[Page 228]]

segment and/or market records as follows:

    (e) These reported items are further described as follows:
    (1) Reporting period date. The year and month to which the reported 
data are applicable.
    (2) Carrier, Carrier entity code. Each air carrier shall report its 
name and entity code (a five digit code assigned by BTS that identifies 
both the carrier and its entity) for its particular operations. The 
Office of Airline Information (OAI) will assign or confirm codes upon 
request. OAI's address is Office of Airline Information, Bureau of 
Transportation Statistics, DOT, Room 4125, K-14, 400 Seventh Street, 
SW., Washington, DC 20590-0001.
    (3) Service class code. The service class codes are prescribed in 
section 298.45(c). In general, classes are divided into two broad 
categories, either scheduled or nonscheduled, where scheduled = F + G 
and nonscheduled = L + N + P + R.
    (4) Record type code. This code indicates whether the data pertain 
to non-stop segment (record type S) or on-flight market (record type M).
    (5) Aircraft type code. This code represents the aircraft types, as 
described in the BTS' Accounting and Reporting Directives.
    (6) Origin, Destination airport code(s). These codes represent the 
industry designators. An industry source of these industry designator 
codes is the Official Airline Guide (OAG). OAI assigns codes, upon 
request, if not listed in the OAG.
    (7) 110 Revenue passengers enplaned. The total number of revenue 
passengers enplaned at the origin point of a flight, boarding the flight 
for the first time; an unduplicated count of passengers in a market.

passengers transported over a single flight stage, including those 
already on the aircraft from a previous flight stage.
    (9) 140 Revenue passenger-miles. Computed by multiplying the inter-
airport distance of each flight stage by the number of passengers 
transported on that flight stage.
    (10) 210 Revenue cargo tons enplaned. The total number of cargo tons 
enplaned. This data element is a sum of the individual on-flight market 
figures for each of the following categories: 217 Freight and 219 Mail. 
This element represents an unduplicated count of the revenue traffic in 
a market.
    (11) 217 Enplaned freight. The total weight of revenue freight 
enplaned at the origin point of a flight, loaded onto the flight for the 
first time; an unduplicated count of freight in a market.

a single flight stage, including mail already on the aircraft from a 
previous flight stage.
    (16) 240 Revenue ton-miles--total. Ton-miles are computed by 
multiplying the revenue aircraft miles flown (410) on each flight stage 
by the number of tons transported on that stage. This element is the sum 
of 241 through 249.
    (17) 241 Revenue ton-miles--passenger. Equals the number of 
passengers times 200, times inter-airport distance, divided by 2000. A 
standard weight of 200 pounds per passenger, including baggage, is used 
for all operations and service classes.
    (18) 247 Revenue ton-miles--freight. Equals the volume of freight in 
whole tons times the inter-airport distance.
    (19) 249 Revenue ton-miles--mail. Equals the volume of mail in whole 
tons times the inter-airport distance.
    (20) 270 Available capacity-payload. The available capacity is 
collected in pounds. This figure shall reflect the payload or total 
available capacity for passengers, mail and freight applicable to the 
aircraft with which each flight stage is performed.

actually performed; miles are generated from the data for scheduled 
aircraft departures (Code 520) times the inter-airport distances (Code 
501).
    (25) 430 Revenue aircraft miles scheduled. The number of revenue 
aircraft miles scheduled. All such data shall be maintained in 
conformity with the airport pairs between which service is scheduled, 
whether or not in accordance with actual performance.
    (26) 501 Inter-airport distance. The great circle distance, in 
official statute miles as prescribed in part 247 of this chapter, 
between airports served by each flight stage. Official inter-airport 
mileage may be obtained from the Office of Airline Information.
    (27) 510 Revenue aircraft departures performed. The number of 
revenue aircraft departures performed.
    (28) 520 Revenue aircraft departures scheduled. The number of 
revenue aircraft departures scheduled, whether or not actually 
performed.

computed from the moment the aircraft leaves the ground until its next 
landing.
    (30) 630 Aircraft hours (ramp-to-ramp). The elapsed time, computed 
from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power from the 
boarding ramp at one airport to the time it comes to rest at the ramp 
for the next point of landing. This data element is also referred to as 
`block' and `block-to-block' aircraft hours.
    (31) 650 Total aircraft hours (airborne). The elapsed time, computed 
from the moment the aircraft leaves the ground until it touches down at 
the next landing. This includes flight training, testing, and ferry 
flights.
    (f) Public availability of Schedule T-100 data. Detailed domestic 
on-flight market and nonstop segment data in Schedule T-100, except 
military data, shall be publicly available after processing. Domestic 
data are defined as data from air transportation operations from a place 
in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory 
or possession to a place in any State of the United States, the District

    Appendix to Sec. 291.45--Instructions to U.S. Air Carriers for 
          Reporting Traffic and Capacity Data on Schedule T-100

    (a) Format of reports--(1) Automatic Data Processing (ADP) magnetic 
tape. Refer to paragraph (d) of this appendix for instructions 
pertaining to mainframe and minicomputer reporting. The Department will 
issue ``Accounting and Reporting Directives'' to make necessary 
technical changes to these T-100 instructions. Technical changes which 
are minor in nature do not require public notice and comment.
    (2) Microcomputer diskette--(i) Optional specification. If an air 
carrier desires to use its personal computers (PC's), rather than 
mainframe or minicomputers to prepare its data submissions, the 
following specifications for filing data on diskette media apply.
    (ii) Reporting medium. Microcomputer ADP data submission of T-100 
information must be on IBM compatible disks. Carriers wishing to use a 
different ADP procedure must obtain written approval to do so from the 
BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information. Requests for approval to 
use alternate methods must disclose and describe the proposed data 
transmission methodology. Refer to paragraph (i) of this appendix for 
microcomputer record layouts.
    (iii) Microcomputer file characteristics. The files will be created 
in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format 
(DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields 
(data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by 
quotation marks (``) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data 
elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by 
a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition 
within a given record. Therefore, each record must contain the exact 
number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. 
Personal computer software including most spreadsheets, data base 
management programs, and BASIC are capable of producing files in this 
format.
    (b) Filing date for reports. The reports must be received at BTS 
within 30 days following the end of each reporting period.
    (c) Address for filing. Data Administration Division, K-14, Room 
4125, Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., 
Washington, DC 20590-0001.
    (d) ADP format for magnetic tape--(1) Magnetic tape specifications. 
IBM compatible 9-track EBCDIC recording. Recording density of 6250 or 
1600 bpi. The order of recorded information is:
    (i) Volume label.
    (ii) Header label.
    (iii) Data records.
    (iv) Trailer label.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) External tape label information. (1) Carrier name.
    (2) Report date.
    (3) File identification.
    (4) Carrier address for return of tape reel.
    (f) Standards. It is the policy of the Department to be consistent 
with the American National Standards Institute and the Federal Standards 
Activity in all data processing and telecommunications matters. It is 
our intention that all specifications in this application are in 
compliance with standards promulgated by these organizations.
    (g) Volume, header, and trailer label formats--(1) Use standard IBM 
label formats. The file identifier field of the header labels should be 
``T-100.SYSTEM''.
    (h) Magnetic tape record layouts for T-100--(1) Nonstop segment 
record layout.

    (i) Record layouts for microcomputer diskettes. The record layouts 
for diskette are generally identical to those shown for magnetic tape, 
with the exception that delimiters (quotation marks, tabs and commas) 
are used to separate fields. It is necessary that the order of fields be 
maintained in all records.
    (1) File characteristics. The files will be created in ASCII 
delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This 
form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data 
elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by 
quotation marks (``) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data 
elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by 
a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition 
within a given record. Therefore, it is critical that each record 
contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be 
juxtapositionally correct. PC software including most spreadsheets, data 
base management programs, and BASIC produce minidisk files in this 
format.
    (2) File naming conventions for diskettes. For microcomputer 
reports, each record type should be contained in a separate DOS file on 
the same physical diskette. The following DOS naming conventions should 
be followed:
    (i) Record type S = SEGMENT.DAT
    (ii) Record type M = MARKET.DAT

                   Subpart G_Public Disclosure of Data


<R05>
Sec. 291.60  Public disclosure of data.

    (a) Detailed domestic on-flight market data and nonstop segment 
data, except military data, shall be made publicly available after 
processing. Domestic data are defined as data from air transportation 
operations from a place in any State of the United States, the District 
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or 
a U.S. territory or possession to a place in any State of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession. Domestic military 
operations are reported under service codes N or R.
    (b) Detailed international on-flight market and nonstop segment data 
in Schedule T-100 and Schedule T-100(f) reports, except military data, 
shall be publicly available immediately following the Department's 
determination that the database is complete, but no earlier than six 
months after the date of the data. Military operations are reported 
under service codes N or R. Data for on-flight markets and nonstop 
segments involving no U.S. points shall not be made publicly available 
for three years. Industry and carrier summary data may be made public 
before the end of six months or the end of three years, as applicable, 
provided there are three or more carriers in the summary data disclosed. 
The Department may, at any time, publish international summary 
statistics without carrier detail. Further, the Department may release 
nonstop segment and on-flight market detail data by carrier before the 
end of the confidentiality period as follows:
    (1) To foreign governments as provided in reciprocal arrangements 
between the foreign country and the U.S. Government for exchange of on-
flight market and/or nonstop segment data submitted by air carriers of 
that foreign country and U.S. carriers serving that foreign country.
    (2) To parties to any proceeding before the Department under Title 
IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, as required by an 
Administrative Law Judge or other decision-maker of the Department. 
Parties may designate agents or consultants to receive the data in their 
behalf, provided the agents or consultants agree to abide by the 
disclosure restrictions. Any data to which access is granted

[[Page 232]]

pursuant to this provision may be introduced into evidence, subject to 
the normal rules of admissibility.
    (3) To agencies or other components of the U.S. Government for their 
internal use only.

and any third country, carriers that are nationals of such country may 
be required to file tariffs, as provided under part 221 or as otherwise 
directed in the notice, for some or all of their services between the 
U.S. and third countries.

<R05>
Sec. 294.1  Applicability and purpose.

    This part establishes a classification of foreign air carriers known 
as ``Canadian charter air taxi operators,'' and establishes registration 
procedures for these carriers operating or seeking to operate 
transborder services between Canada and the United States. This part 
also exempts Canadian charter air taxi operators from certain provisions 
of the Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code 
(Transportation), and establishes rules applicable to their operations 
in the United States. This part does not provide exemption from the 
safety regulatory provisions of the Statute that are administered by the 
U.S. Department of Transportation through the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), and Canadian charter air taxi operators in the 
conduct of their operations must observe all applicable safety standards 
and requirements.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Agreement means the U.S.-Canada Nonscheduled Air Services 
Agreement signed May 8, 1974, and any amendments, supplements, 
reservations, or supersessions to it.
    (b) Canadian charter air taxi operator means a foreign air carrier 
that is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Canadian 
citizens, the Government of Canada, or both, whose foreign air 
transportation operations are limited to charter air service between 
points in Canada and points in the United States, and that does not use 
large aircraft in those operations.
    (c) Charter air service means nonscheduled commercial air 
transportation of persons and their accompanied baggage, and of 
property, on a time, mileage, or trip basis where the entire planeload 
capacity of one or more aircraft has been engaged, or the transportation 
of mail by aircraft.
    (d) Large aircraft means any aircraft that are not small aircraft as 
defined in this section.
    (e) Maximum authorized takeoff weight has the meaning assigned to it 
in regulations of the Canadian Transport Commission.
    (f) Maximum certificated takeoff weight means the maximum takeoff 
weight authorized by the terms of the aircraft airworthiness 
certificate. This weight may be found in the airplane operating record 
or in the airplane flight manual that is incorporated by regulation into 
the airworthiness certificate.
    (g) Maximum passenger capacity means the maximum number of passenger 
seats for which an aircraft is configured.
    (h) Maximum payload capacity means the maximum certificated takeoff 
weight of an aircraft less the empty weight as defined in section 03 of 
part 241 of this chapter, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and 
less the operating load (consisting of minimum fuel load, oil, flight 
crew, steward's supplies, etc.). For purposes of this part, the 
allowance for weight of the crew, oil and fuel is as follows:
    (1) Crew--200 pounds per crew member required under FAA regulations, 
(2) oil--350 pounds, (3) fuel--the minimum weight of fuel required under 
FAA regulations for a flight between domestic points 200 miles apart, 
assuming VFR weather conditions and flights not involving extended 
overwater operations. However, in the case of aircraft for which a 
maximum zero fuel weight is

[[Page 237]]

prescribed by the FAA, maximum payload capacity means the maximum zero 
fuel weight less the empty weight, less all justifiable aircraft 
equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum flight 
crew, steward's supplies, etc., but not including disposable fuel or 
oil).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (i) Small aircraft means any aircraft designed to have:
    (1) A maximum passenger capacity of not more than 30 seats and a 
maximum payload capacity of not more than 7,500 pounds, and/or
    (2) maximum authorized takeoff weight on wheels not greater than 
35,000 pounds.

that country,

[[Page 243]]

individually ticketed or individually waybilled service over that route, 
and provides some scheduled service on any route pursuant to any such 
agreement, and such flights serve either (i) a Canadian terminal point 
on such route, or (ii) any Canadian intermediate point authorized for 
service on the route by the foreign air carrier permit.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 298.1  Applicability of part.

    This part establishes classifications of air carriers known as ``air 
taxi operators'' and ``commuter air carriers,'' provides certain 
exemptions to them from some of the economic regulatory provisions of 
Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), 
specifies procedures by which such air carriers may obtain authority to 
conduct operations, and establishes rules applicable to their operations 
in interstate and/or foreign air transportation in all States, 
Territories and possessions of the United States. This part also 
establishes reporting requirements for commuter air carriers and small 
certificated air carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 298.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Air taxi operator means an air carrier as established by Sec. 
298.3(a).
    Air transportation means interstate air transportation, foreign air 
transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft as defined by 
the Statute.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Interstate air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(25) 
as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common 
carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft (1) 
between a place in (i) a State, territory, or possession of the United 
States and a place in the District of Columbia or another State, 
territory, or possession of the United States; (ii) Hawaii and another 
place in Hawaii through the airspace over a place outside Hawaii; (iii) 
the District of Columbia and another place in the District of Columbia; 
or (iv) a territory or possession of the United States and another place 
in the same territory or possession; and (2) when any part of the 
transportation is by aircraft. Note: Operations wholly within the 
geographic limits of a single State are not considered interstate air 
transportation if in those operations the carrier transports no more 
than a de minimus volume of passengers or property moving as part of a 
continuous journey to or from a point outside the State.
    Foreign air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(23) of the 
Statute as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a 
common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by 
aircraft, between a place in the United States and a place outside the 
United States when any part of the transportation is by aircraft.
    Air transportation also is defined to include the transportation of 
mail by aircraft. Section 5402 of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 
U.S.C. 5402, authorizes the carriage of mail by air taxi operators and 
commuter air carriers in some circumstances under contract with the U.S. 
Postal Service.

performed in accordance with the scheduled pattern.
    Certificated air carrier means an air carrier holding a certificate 
issued under section 41102 of the Statute.
    Citizen of the United States means:

citizens of the United States, which is under the actual control of 
citizens of the United States, and in which at least 75 percent of the 
voting interest is owned or controlled by persons that are citizens of 
the United States.
    Commuter air carrier means an air carrier as established by Sec. 
298.3(b) that carries passengers on at least five round trips per week

subsidized small community air service under section 41736(a) of the 
Statute.
    Flight stage means the operation of an aircraft from takeoff to

airworthiness certificate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Maximum passenger capacity means the maximum number of passenger 
seats for which an aircraft is configured.
    Maximum payload capacity means: (1) The maximum certificated take-

extended overwater operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Provided, however, That in the case of aircraft for which a 
maximum zero fuel weight is prescribed by the FAA,\5\ maximum payload 
capacity means the maximum zero fuel weight, less the empty weight, less 
all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load 
(consisting of minimum flight crew, steward's supplies, etc., but not 
including disposable fuel or oil).

<R05>
Sec. 298.61  Reporting of traffic statistics.

    (a) Each commuter air carrier and small certificated air carrier 
shall file Schedule T-100, AU.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data 
by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market.''
    (b) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly as set forth in ``298.60.
    (1) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-
flight market data from revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be 
compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail 
T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly 
summarization and organization into two basic groupings. The first 
grouping, the nonstop segment information, is to be summarized by 
equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without 
regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that 
the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate 
units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by 
class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment 
type or flight number.
    (2) Joint-service operations. The Department may authorize joint 
service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these 
joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter 
agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar 
arrangements.
    (i) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in 
operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its 
flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving 
under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any 
other traffic on the aircraft.
    (ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service 
operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information (fax 
no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations 
are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).
    (iii) Operational control. The air carrier in operational control of 
the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA 
operating authority) must report joint-service operations.
    (c) Service classes. (1) The statistical classifications are 
designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each 
distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and 
nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services 
are placed into service classes as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Code                           Type of Service
------------------------------------------------------------------------
F................................  Scheduled Passenger/Cargo
G................................  Scheduled All-Cargo
L................................  Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo
P................................  Nonscheduled Civilian Cargo
N................................  Nonscheduled Military Passenger/Cargo
R................................  Nonscheduled Military Cargo
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements 
applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published 
schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/
Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first class, coach, and mixed 
passenger/cargo service.
    (3) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements 
applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and 
other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of 
services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.
    (d) Air transport traffic and capacity elements. (1) Within each of 
the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic 
and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment or market 
records as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             Computed by

    Appendix to Sec. 298.61--Instructions to U.S. Air Carriers for 
          Reporting Traffic and Capacity Data on Schedule T-100

    (a) Format of reports--(1) Automatic Data Processing (ADP) magnetic 
tape. Refer to paragraph (f) of this appendix for instructions 
pertaining to mainframe and minicomputer reporting. The Department will 
issue ``Accounting and Reporting Directives'' to make necessary 
technical changes to these T-100 instructions. Technical changes which 
are minor in nature do not require public notice and comment.
    (2) Microcomputer diskette.--(i) Optional specification. If an air 
carrier desires to use its personal computers (PC's), rather than 
mainframe or minicomputers to prepare its data submissions, the 
following specifications for filing data on diskette media apply.
    (ii) Reporting medium. Microcomputer ADP data submission of T-100 
information must be on IBM compatible disks. Carriers wishing to use a 
different ADP procedure must obtain written approval to do so from the 
BTS Assistant Director--Airline Information. Requests for approval to 
use alternate methods must disclose and describe the proposed data 
transmission methodology. Refer to paragraph (k) of this appendix for 
microcomputer record layouts.
    (iii) Microcomputer file characteristics. The files will be created 
in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format 
(DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields 
(data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by 
quotation marks (``) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data 
elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by 
a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition 
within a given record. Therefore, each record must contain the exact 
number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. 
Personal computer software including most spreadsheets, data base 
management programs, and BASIC are capable of producing files in this 
format.
    (b)-(c) [Reserved]
    (d) Filing date for reports. The reports must be received at BTS 
within 30 days following the end of each reporting period.
    (e) Address for filing. Data Administration Division, K-14, Room 
4125, Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., 
Washington, DC 20590-0001.
    (f) ADP format for magnetic tape--(1) Magnetic tape specifications. 
IBM compatible 9-track EBCDIC recording. Recording density of 6250 or 
1600 bpi. The order of recorded information is:
    (i) Volume label.
    (ii) Header label.
    (iii) Data records.
    (iv) Trailer label.
    (g) External tape label information. (1) Carrier name.
    (2) Report date.
    (3) File identification.
    (4) Carrier address for return of tape reel.
    (h) Standards. It is the policy of the Department to be consistent 
with the American National Standards Institute and the Federal Standards 
Activity in all data processing and telecommunications matters. It is 
our intention that all specifications in this application are in 
compliance with standards promulgated by these organizations.
    (i) Volume, header, and trailer label formats--(1) Use standard IBM 
label formats. The file identifier field of the header labels should be 
``T-100.SYSTEM''.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (j) Magnetic tape record layouts for T-100--(1) Nonstop segment 
record layout.

    (k) Record layouts for microcomputer diskettes. The record layouts 
for diskette are generally identical to those shown for magnetic tape, 
with the exception that delimiters (quotation marks and commas) are used 
to separate fields. It is necessary that the order of fields be 
maintained in all records.
    (1) File characteristics. The files will be created in ASCII 
delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This 
form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data 
elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by 
quotation marks (``) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data 
elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by 
a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition 
within a given record. Therefore, it is critical that each record 
contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be 
juxtapositionally correct. PC software including most spreadsheets, data 
base management programs, and BASIC produce minidisks files in this 
format.
    (2) File naming conventions for diskettes. For microcomputer 
reports, each record type should be contained in a separate DOS file on 
the same physical diskette. The following DOS naming conventions shall 
be followed:
    (i) Record type S = SEGMENT.DAT
    (ii) Record type M = MARKET.DAT

Sec. 298.63  Reporting of aircraft operating expenses and related 
statistics by small certificated air carriers.

    (a) Each small certificated air carrier shall file BTS Form 298-C, 
Schedule F-2 ``Report of Aircraft Operating Expenses and Related 
Statistics.'' This schedule shall be filed quarterly as prescribed in 
Sec. 298.60. Data reported on this report shall be for the overall or 
system operations of the air carrier.
    (b) Each carrier shall indicate in the space provided its full 
corporate name and the quarter for which the report is filed.
    (c) This schedule shall show the direct and indirect expenses 
incurred in aircraft operations. Direct expense data applicable to each 
aircraft type operated by the carrier shall be reported in separate 
columns of this schedule. Each aircraft type reported shall be 
identified at the head of each column in the space provided for 
``Aircraft Type.'' ``Aircraft Type'' refers to aircraft models such as 
Beech-18, Piper PA-32, etc. Aircraft Type designations are prescribed in 
the Accounting and Reporting Directives, which is available from the 
BTS' Office of Airline Information. In the space provided for ``Aircraft 
Code'' carriers shall insert the three digit code prescribed in the 
Accounting and Reporting Directives for the reported aircraft type.

    (a) If circumstances prevent the filing of BTS Form 298-C on or 
before the due date, a written request for an extension may be 
submitted. Except in cases of emergency, the request must be delivered 
to the BTS's Office of Airline Information in writing at least three 
days in advance of the due date. The request must state good and 
sufficient reason to justify the granting of the extension and the date

    (2) A specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will 
result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal; and
    (3) The application of the alternative procedure will maintain or 
improve uniformity in reporting between air carriers.

<R05>
Sec. 300.0  Applicability.

    The rules of conduct set forth in this part except as otherwise 
provided in this or any other DOT regulation shall govern the conduct of 
the parties and their representatives, and the relationships between the 
Office of the Secretary of Transportation, the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and the Office of the 
General Counsel, including regular personnel, and officials, special 
Government employees, consultants, or experts under contract to the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) and administrative law judges 
(hereinafter referred to as ``DOT employee(s)'') and all other persons 
in all DOT matters involving aviation economic and enforcement 
proceedings.

[Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2380, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended by Amdt. 1-261, 59 
FR 10061, Mar. 3, 1994; 60 FR 43528, Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 300.0a  Applicability of 49 CFR part 99.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each DOT 
employee involved in matters covered by this chapter shall comply with 
the rules on ``Employee Responsibilities and Conduct'' in 49 CFR part 
99.
    (b) The rules in this part shall be construed as being consistent 
with those in 49 CFR part 99. If a rule in this part is more restrictive 
than a rule in 49 CFR part 99, the more restrictive rule shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 300.1  Judicial standards of practice.

    Certain of DOT's functions involving aviation economic and 
enforcement proceedings are similar to those of a court, and parties to 
cases before DOT and those who represent such parties are expected--in 
fact and in appearance--to conduct themselves with honor and dignity as 
they would before a court. By the same token, any DOT employee or 
administrative law judge carrying out DOT's quasi-judicial functions and 
any DOT employee making recommendations or advising them are expected to 
conduct themselves with the same fidelity to appropriate standards of 
propriety that characterize a court and its staff. The standing and 
effectiveness of DOT in carrying out its quasi-judicial functions are in 
direct relation to the observance by DOT,

[[Page 267]]

DOT employees, and the parties and attorneys appearing before DOT of the 
highest standards of judicial and professional ethics. The rules of 
conduct set forth in this part are to be interpreted in light of those 
standards.

between any concerned DOT employee and any interested person outside 
DOT, concerning a public proceeding, until after final disposition of 
the proceeding, other than as provided by Federal statute or published 
DOT rule or order.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this part:
    (1) A ``substantive communication'' is any written or oral 
communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding.
    (2) The ``DOT decisionmaker'' is defined in 14 CFR 302.2 and 302.18.
    (3) A ``concerned DOT employee'' is a DOT employee who is or may 
reasonably be expected to be directly involved in a decision which is 
subject to a public proceeding.
    (4) A ``public proceeding'' is one of the following:
    (i) A hearing proceeding (i.e., proceeding conducted on-the record 
after notice and opportunity for an oral evidentiary hearing as provided 
in Sec. Sec. 302.17- 302.38)
    (ii) A rulemaking proceeding involving a hearing as described in 
paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section or an exemption proceeding covered 
by this chapter. (Other rulemaking proceedings are covered by the ex 
parte communication policies of DOT Order 2100.2.)
    (iii) A tariff filing after DOT has ordered an investigation or a 
complaint has been filed or docketed.
    (iv) A proceeding initiated by DOT show-cause order, after the 
filing in the docket of an identifiable written opposition to the

    (v) Any other proceeding initiated by a docket filing, other than a 
petition for generally applicable rulemaking, after the filing in the 
docket of an identifiable written opposition to the initiating document.
    (c) General exceptions. Paragraph (a) of this section shall not 
apply to the following:

determine whether formal enforcement action should be begun.
    (4) Settlement discussions and mediation efforts.
    (5) Information given at the request of a DOT employee acting upon a 
specific direction of DOT, in a case other than a hearing proceeding as 
described in paragraphs (b)(4) (i) and (ii) (a ``nonhearing case''), 
where DOT has decided that emergency conditions exist and this rule 
would otherwise prevent the obtaining of needed information in a timely 
manner.
    (6) Information given at the request of a DOT employee in a tariff 
matter after a complaint is filed but before an investigation is 
ordered.
    (7) Nonhearing cases that are to be decided within 30 days after the

the-record.
    (10) Information given at the request of a DOT career employee in 
the course of investigating or clarifying information filed, or pursuant 
to a waiver granted to an applicant or other interested person, in 
docketed proceedings involving determinations of fitness and/or U.S. 
citizenship only, for that portion of the proceeding that precedes the 
issuance of a show-cause order or

[[Page 268]]

an order instituting a formal proceeding. Motions for such waivers and 
any answers shall be filed in the applicable docket in accordance with 
Sec. 302.11 of the Department's Procedural Regulations (14 CFR 302.11)

302.11 of this chapter.
    (e) National defense and foreign policy. In nonhearing cases, 
paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to communications 
concerning national defense or foreign policy matters, including 
international aviation matters. In hearing cases, any communications on 
those subjects that would be barred by paragraph (a) of this section are 
permitted if the communicator's position with respect thereto cannot 
otherwise be fairly presented, but such communications shall not be 
included as part of the record on which decisions must be made.
    (f) Communications not considered. A communication in violation of 
this section shall not be considered part of a record, or included as 
available material, for decision in any proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 300.4  Separation of functions in hearing cases.

    (a) This section applies after the initiation of a hearing or 
enforcement case by the Department.
    (b) A DOT employee who is participating in a hearing case on behalf 
of an

[[Page 269]]

office that is a party, another DOT employee who is in fact reviewing 
the position taken, or who has participated in developing the position 
taken in that case, or, in cases involving accusatory or disciplinary 
issues (including all enforcement cases) such employees' supervisors 
within that office, shall have no substantive communication with any DOT 
decisionmaker, administrative law judge in the case, or other DOT 
employee advising them, with respect to that or any factually related 
hearing case, except in accordance with a published DOT rule or order. 
In addition, each bureau or office supervisor of a DOT employee who is 
participating in a hearing case on behalf of that office when it is a 
party shall have no substantive communication with any administrative 
law judge in the case, or DOT employee advising the judge, in that or 
any factually related hearing case, except in accordance with a 
published DOT rule or order. For each hearing case, bureau or office 
heads shall maintain a publicly available record of those employees who 
are participating or are in fact reviewing the position taken, or who 
have participated in developing the position taken in that case.
    (c) In hearing cases involving fares or rates, or applications for a 
certificate or permit under 49 U.S.C. 41102 and 41302, or applications 
by a holder for a change in a certificate or permit, a supervisor who 
would not be permitted to advise the DOT decisionmaker under paragraph 
(a) may advise the DOT decisionmaker in the following manner: The 
supervisor's advice must either be made orally in an open DOT meeting or 
by a memorandum placed in the docket or other public file of such 
matter. Oral advice must be summarized in writing by the supervisor and 
placed in the docket or file of the matter. A copy of such written 
memorandum or summary of oral advice must be served on each party to the 
proceeding within 3 business days after such advice is given to the 
concerned DOT decisionmaker. Each of the parties may comment in writing 
on such advice within 5 business days after service or the summary. In 
no event, however, may a supervisor advise the DOT decisionmaker if he 
or she acted as the office's counsel or witness in the matter.
    (d) In enforcement cases, the Office of the Assistant General 
Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, under the supervision 
of the Deputy General Counsel, will conduct all enforcement proceedings 
and related investigative functions, while the General Counsel will 
advise the DOT decisionmaker in the course of the decisional process. 
The Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and 
Proceedings will report to the Deputy General Counsel. To ensure the 
independence of these functions, this Office and the Deputy General 
Counsel, for the purpose of this section, shall be considered an 
``office'' as that term is used in paragraph (a), separate from the 
General Counsel and the rest of the Office of the General Counsel.

<R05>
Sec. 300.7  Conciseness.

    Every oral or written statement made in a DOT proceding shall be as

<R05>
Sec. 300.9  Permanent disqualification of employees from matters in 
which they personally participated before joining DOT or the Civil 
Aeronautics Board.

    Any DOT employee shall permanently disqualify himself or herself 
from participation in every matter before the Department in which he or 
she previously personally and substantially participated for an 
interested person or entity, including other agencies of the United 
States Government, before joining the DOT or the Civil Aeronautics 
Board. Such disqualification shall be applicable also if a person is 
closely related to is a DOT employee as partner, associate, employer, or 
the like, personally and substantially participated in a matter before 
DOT prior to the employee's employment by the Department or the Civil 
Aeronautics Board and the circumstances were such that the DOT 
employee's subsequent participation in the matter as a DOT employee 
could fairly be said to create the appearance that his or her 
participation would be affected by his or her prior relationship. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the disqualification of any DOT employee, 
including any member of a DOT employee's personal staff or a special 
Government employee, whose prior personal and substantial participation 
in a DOT or Civil Aeronautics Board proceeding or whose relationship to 
one who so participated occurred on behalf of another agency of the 
United States Government shall only be applicable with respect to issues 
on which the prior governmental employer took a position in the 
proceeding unless participation could fairly be said to create the 
appearance that his or her participation would be affected by his or her 
prior relationship.


<R05>
Sec. 300.10  Temporary disqualification of employees from matters in 
which they had official responsibility before joining DOT.

    Any DOT employee shall temporarily disqualify himself or herself 
from participation in any matter before DOT if he or she represented, 
was associated with or was employed by an interested person or entity 
including other agencies of the United States Government before joining 
DOT, and, although he or she did not personally and substantially 
participate in the matter, the matter was within his or her ``official 
responsibility,'' as that term is defined in Sec. 300.14 of this 
chapter except that the action referred to therein shall be private 
action as well as ``Government'' action. Such disqualification shall be 
applicable also if a person closely related to the DOT employee as 
partner, associate, employer, or the like, who, while not personally and 
substantially participating in the matter, had it within his or her 
``official responsibility'' as that term is defined in Sec. 300.14 of 
this chapter, and modified above, and the circumstances are such that 
the DOT employee's subsequent participation in the matter as a DOT 
employee could fairly be said to create the appearance that his or her 
participation would be affected by his or her prior relationship. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the disqualification of any DOT employee 
whose prior ``official responsibility'' or relationship to one with such 
responsibility occurred on behalf of another agency of the United States 
Government shall only be applicable with respect to issues on which the 
prior governmental employer took a position in the proceeding. The 
temporary disqualification shall run for a period of one year

[[Page 271]]

from the date of the termination of the representation, association, or 
employment with the interested person or entity.

<R05>
Sec. 300.10a  Permanent and temporary disqualification of DOT employees.

    The terms of Sec. Sec. 300.9 and 300.10 shall not be construed to 
apply to DOT employees who previously personally and substantially 
participated in matters before the Board, which have become the subject 
of DOT proceedings.

<R05>
Sec. 300.11  Disqualification of Government officers and employees.

    No officer or employee of the Federal Government, other than a 
``special Government employee'' as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202, shall 
represent anyone, otherwise than in the proper discharge of his or her 
official duties, in any DOT proceeding or matter in which the United 
States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.

(18 U.S.C. 205)


<R05>
Sec. 300.12  Practice of special Government employees permitted.

    A special Government employee, who qualifies as such under the 
provisions of 18 U.S.C. 202(a), may participate in DOT proceedings only 
to the extent and in the manner specified in 18 U.S.C. 205.


<R05>
Sec. 300.13  Permanent disqualification of former Civil Aeronautics 
Board members and employees and DOT employees from matters in which 
they personally participated.

    No former Board member or employee or DOT employee shall act as 
agent or attorney before DOT for anyone other than the United States in 
connection with any proceeding, application, request for a ruling or 
other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, 
or other particular matter, involving a specific party or parties, in 
which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial 
interest and in which he or she participated personally and 
substantially through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise as a Board member or 
employee or DOT employee.

(18 U.S.C. 207(a))


<R05>
Sec. 300.14  Temporary disqualification of former DOT employees from 
matters formerly under their official responsibility.

    Within one year after termination of employment with DOT, no former 
DOT employee shall appear personally before DOT on behalf of any person 
other than the United States in any DOT proceeding or matter in which 
the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest 
and which was under his or her official responsibility at any time 
within one year preceding termination of such responsibility. The term 
``official responsibility'' means the direct administrative or operating 
authority, whether intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone 
or with others, and either personally or through subordinates, to 
approve, disapprove, or otherwise direct Government action.

(18 U.S.C. 202(b), 207(b))

Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 300.15  Opinions or rulings by the General Counsel.

    (a) The General Counsel is authorized to render opinions or rulings 
to the public on the application of the provisions of this part. When 
written request is made for such opinions and rulings, they shall be 
transmitted to DOT and shall be available to the public in the 
Documentary Services Division after any appeal to or review by the 
Secretary has been completed or after the time for review has expired. 
Identifying details shall normally be stricken from copies available to 
the public unless the public interest requires disclosure of such 
details.
    (b) If any person is disqualified from a particular proceeding under 
the provisions of Sec. Sec. 300.9, 300.10, 300.13, 300.14, and 300.17 
of this chapter by a ruling of the General Counsel, or by such person's 
own action, such disqualification shall be memorialized in a writing 
filed

[[Page 272]]

in the appropriate file of the matter by the General Counsel or such 
person.


<R05>
Sec. 300.16  Waivers.

    (a) A former Board member, Board employee or DOT employee with 
outstanding scientific or technological qualifications who is 
disqualified from acting in a representative capacity under the 
provisions of Sec. 300.13 or Sec. 300.14 of this chapter may 
nevertheless participate in a proceeding in a scientific or 
technological field pursuant to the terms of a certificate issued in 
compliance with the proviso following 18 U.S.C. 207 (a) and (b).
    (b) An employee who believes his or her prior employment 
relationships will not affect the integrity of his or her services may 
request that the prohibition of Sec. 300.9 or Sec. 300.10 of this 
chapter be waived by the appropriate Ethics Counselor under 49 CFR 
99.735-71.


<R05>
Sec. 300.17  Disqualification of partners of DOT employees.

    No partner of a DOT employee shall act as agent or attorney for 
anyone other than the United States in any DOT proceeding or matter in 
which such employee participates or has participated personally and 
substantially through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, 
rendering advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which is the subject 
of his or her official responsibility.


<R05>
Sec. 300.18  Motions to disqualify DOT employee in review of hearing 
matters.

    In cases to be determined on an evidentiary record, a party desiring 
that a concerned DOT employee disqualify himself or herself from 
participating in a DOT decision shall file a motion supported by an 
affidavit setting forth the grounds for such disqualification in the 
form and within the periods prescribed in Sec. 302.11 of this chapter. 
Where review of the administrative law judge's decision can be obtained 
only upon the filing of a petition for discretionary review, such 
motions must be filed on or before the date answers are due pursuant to 
Sec. 302.32. In cases where exceptions are filed to recommended, 
initial, or tentative decisions or where the DOT decisionmaker orders 
review of an initial or recommended decision on his or her own 
initiative, such motions must be filed on or before the date briefs are 
due pursuant to Sec. 302.35 or Sec. 302.218, as applicable. Failure to 
file a timely motion will be deemed a waiver of disqualification. 
Applications for leave to file an untimely motion seeking 
disqualification of a concerned DOT employee must be accompanied by an 
affidavit setting forth in detail why the facts relied upon as grounds 
for disqualification were not known and could not have been discovered 
with reasonable diligence within the prescribed time.

[Doc. No. OST-97-2090, 65 FR 6456, Feb. 9, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 300.19  Use of confidential information.

    No former CAB member or employee or DOT employee, or any person 
associated with him or her, shall ever use or undertake to use in any 
DOT proceeding or matter any confidential facts or information which 
came into the possession of such Member or employee or to his or her 
attention by reason of his or her employment with the CAB or DOT without 
first applying for and obtaining the consent of the appropriate ethics 
counselor for the use of such facts or information.


<R05>
Sec. 300.20  Violations.

    (a) DOT may disqualify, and deny temporarily or permanently the 
privilege of appearing or practicing before it in any way to, any person 
who is found by DOT after written notice of charges and hearing to have 
engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct. Any violation of 
this part shall be deemed to be such conduct.
    (b) When appropriate in the public interest, DOT may deny any 
application or other request of a party in a proceeding subject to this 
part where DOT finds after hearing that such party has, in connection 
with any DOT proceeding, violated any of the provisions of this part or 
any of the provisions of Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States 
Code. DOT may also condition its further consideration of such party's 
application or other request or the effectiveness of any order granting 
such application or other request upon

[[Page 273]]

such party's first taking such action as DOT may deem necessary or 
appropriate to remedy the violation of this part or Chapter 11 of Title 
18 of the United States Code to prevent or deter any repetition of such 
violation. DOT may in addition issue a cease and desist order against 
any repetition of such or similar misconduct.
    (c) The actions authorized by this section may take place within the 
framework of the matter during or concerning which the violations occur 
or in a separate matter, as the DOT decisionmaker or the presiding 
administrative law judge may direct. A complaint alleging that a 
violation has occurred in the course of a matter shall be filed in the 
docket or appropriate public file of such matter unless such complaint 
is made after DOT's decision of the matter has become final, in which 
event such complaint may be filed pursuant to part 302, subpart D of the 
rules of practice. A violation in the course of a matter which may be 
attributable to or affect the fitness of a party will ordinarily either 
be disposed of within the framework of such matter or be considered 
within the context of any subsequent matter involving the interests of 
such party. Other violations will ordinarily be disposed of in a 
separate proceeding.
    (d) In the case of any violation of the provisions of this part, the 
violator may be subject to civil penalties under the provisions of 49 
U.S.C. 46301. The violator may also be subject to a proceeding brought 
under 49 U.S.C. 46101 before the Department, or sections 46106 through 
46108 of the Statute before a U.S. District Court, as the case may be, 
to compel compliance with civil penalties which have been imposed.

before the Department.
    (f) Retention of documents by the Department. All documents filed 
with or presented to the Department Dockets will be retained in the

<R05>
Sec. 302.5  Amendment of documents.

    (a) An application may be amended prior to the filing of answers 
thereto, or, if no answer is filed, prior to the issuance of an order 
establishing further procedures, disposing of the application, or 
setting the case for hearing. Thereafter, applications may be amended 
only if leave is granted pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. 
302.11.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided, if properly amended, a document 
and any statutory deadline shall be made effective as of the date of

<R05>
Sec. 302.7  Service of documents.

    (a) Who makes service--(1) The Department. Formal complaints, 
notices, orders, and similar documents issued by the Department will be 
served by the Department upon all parties to the proceeding.
    (2) The parties. Answers, petitions, motions, briefs, exceptions, 
notices, protests, or memoranda, or any other documents filed by any 
party or other person with the Department shall be served by such party 
or other person upon all parties to the proceeding in which it is filed; 
including, where applicable, all persons who have petitioned for 
intervention in, or consolidation of applications with, such proceeding. 
Proof of service shall accompany all documents when they are filed. The 
Department may require additional service of any document(s).
    (b) How service may be made. Service may be made by first class 
mail, express mail, priority mail, registered or certified mail, 
facsimile transmission, personal delivery, or by electronic mail. The 
Department may prescribe other means of service by order or notice. The 
means of service selected must be done in such manner so as to have the 
same attributes as section 46103 of the Statute, which provides for 
service of notices and processes in a proceeding by personal service or 
registered or certified mail.
    (c) Who may be served. Service upon a party or person may be made 
upon an individual, or upon a member of a partnership or firm to be 
served, or upon the president or other officer of the corporation, 
company, firm, or association to be served, or upon the assignee

[[Page 279]]

or legal successor of any of the foregoing, or upon any attorney of 
record for the party, or upon the agent designated by an air carrier or 
foreign air carrier under section 46103 of the Statute, but it shall be 
served upon a person designated by a party to receive service of 
documents in a particular proceeding in accordance with Sec. 
302.4(a)(2)(iv) once a proceeding has been commenced.
    (d) Where service may be made. Service shall be made at the 
principal place of business of the party to be served, or at his or her 
usual residence if he or she is an individual, or at the office of the 
party's attorney of record, or at the office or usual residence of the 
agent designated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier under section 
46103 of the Statute, or at the post office or electronic address or 
facsimile number stated for a person designated to receive service 
pursuant to Sec. 302.4(a)(2)(iv).
    (e) Proof of service. Proof of service of any document shall consist 
of one of the following:
    (1) A certificate of mailing executed by the person mailing the 
document.
    (2) A certificate of successful transmission executed by the person 
transmitting the document by facsimile or electronic mail, listing the 
facsimile numbers or electronic mail address to which the document was 
sent, and stating that no indication was received that any transmission 
had failed. In the event of an electronic transmission failure, any 
other authorized means of service may be substituted and the appropriate 
proof of service provided.
    (f) Date of service. The date of service by post office or 
electronic mail is the date of mailing. Whenever proof of service by 
personal delivery or facsimile transmission is made, the date of such 
delivery or facsimile transmission shall be the date of service.
    (g) Freely Associated State Proceedings. In any proceeding directly 
involving air transportation to the Federated States of Micronesia, the 
Marshall Islands, or Palau, the Department and any party or participant 
in the proceeding shall serve all documents on the President and the 
designated authorities of the government(s) involved. This requirement 
shall apply to all proceedings where service is otherwise required, and 
shall be in addition to any other service required by this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 302.8  Computation of time.

    In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, 
by notice, order or regulation or by any applicable statute, the day of 
the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time 
begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so 
computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday for the Department, in which event the period runs until the end 
of the next day that is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor holiday. When 
the period of time prescribed is seven (7) days or fewer, intermediate 
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded in the computation, 
unless otherwise specified by the DOT decisionmaker or the 
administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding, as the case may be.


<R05>
Sec. 302.9  Continuances and extensions of time.

    (a) Whenever a party has the right or obligation to take action 
within a period prescribed by this part, by a notice given thereunder, 
or by an order or regulation, the DOT decisionmaker or the 
administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding, as appropriate, 
may:
    (1) Before the expiration of the prescribed period, with or without 
notice, extend such period, or
    (2) Upon motion, permit the act to be done after the expiration of 
the specified period, where good cause for the failure to act on time is 
clearly shown.
    (b) Except where an administrative law judge has been assigned to a 
proceeding, requests for continuance or extensions of time, as described 
in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be directed to the DOT 
decisionmaker. Requests for continuances and extensions of time may be 
directed to the Chief Administrative Law Judge in the absence of the 
administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 302.10  Parties.

    (a) In addition to the persons set forth in Sec. 302.2, in hearing 
cases, parties

[[Page 280]]

shall include Department staff designated to participate in the 
proceeding and any persons authorized to intervene or granted permission 
to participate in accordance with Sec. Sec. 302.19 and 302.20. In any 
proceeding directly involving air transportation to the Federated States 
of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, these governments or their 
designated authorities shall be a party.
    (b) Upon motion and for good cause shown, the Department may order a 
substitution of parties, except that in case of the death of a party, 
substitution may be ordered without the filing of a motion.
    (c) An association composed entirely or in part of air carriers may 
participate in any proceedings of the Department to which the 
Department's procedural regulations apply if the association represents 
members that are identified in any documents filed with the Department, 
and that have specifically authorized the positions taken by the 
association in that proceeding. The specific authorizations may be 
informal and evidence of them shall be provided only upon request of the 
Department. Upon motion of any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, the Department may issue an order requiring an association 
to withdraw from a case on the grounds of significant divergence of 
interest or position within the association.


<R05>
Sec. 302.11  Motions.

    (a) Generally. An application to the DOT decisionmaker or an 
administrative law judge for an order or ruling not otherwise 
specifically provided for in this part shall be by motion. If an 
administrative law judge is assigned to a proceeding and before the 
issuance of a recommended or initial decision or the certification of 
the record to the DOT decisionmaker, all motions shall be addressed to 
the administrative law judge. At all other times, motions shall be 
addressed to the DOT decisionmaker. All motions shall be made at an 
appropriate time depending upon the nature thereof and the relief 
requested therein. This paragraph should not be construed as authorizing 
motions in the nature of petitions for reconsideration.
    (b) Form and contents. Unless made during a hearing, motions shall 
be made in writing in conformity with Sec. Sec. 302.3 and 302.4, shall 
state their grounds and the relief or order sought, and shall be 
accompanied by any affidavits or other evidence desired to be relied 
upon. Motions made during hearings, answers to them, and rulings on 
them, may be made orally on the record unless the administrative law 
judge directs otherwise. Written motions shall be filed as separate 
documents, and shall not be incorporated in any other documents, except 
where incorporation of a motion in another document is specifically 
authorized by the Department, or where a document is filed that requests 
alternative forms of relief and one of these alternative requests is 
properly to be made by motion. In these instances the document filed 
shall be appropriately titled and identified to indicate that it 
incorporates a motion; otherwise, the motion will be disregarded.
    (c) Answers to motions. Within seven (7) days after a motion is 
served, or such other period as the DOT decisionmaker or the 
administrative law judge may fix, any party to the proceeding may file 
an answer in support of or in opposition to the motion, accompanied by 
such affidavits or other evidence as it desires to rely upon. Except as 
otherwise provided, no reply to an answer, reply to a reply, or any 
further responsive document shall be filed.
    (d) Oral arguments; briefs. No oral argument will be heard on 
motions unless the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge 
otherwise directs. Written memoranda or briefs may be filed with motions 
or answers to motions, stating the points and authorities relied upon in 
support of the position taken.
    (e) Requests for expedition. Any interested person may by motion 
request expedition of any proceeding or file an answer in support of or 
in opposition to such motions.
    (f) Effect of pendency of motions. The filing or pendency of a 
motion shall not automatically alter or extend the time to take action 
fixed by this part or by any order of the Department or of an 
administrative law judge (or any extension granted thereunder).

[[Page 281]]

    (g) Disposition of motions. The DOT decisionmaker shall pass upon 
all motions properly submitted to him or her for decision. The 
administrative law judge shall pass upon all motions properly addressed 
to him or her, except that, if the administrative law judge finds that a 
prompt decision by the DOT decisionmaker on a motion is essential to the 
proper conduct of the proceeding, the administrative law judge may refer 
such motion to the DOT decisionmaker for decision.
    (h) Appeals to the DOT decisionmaker from rulings of administrative 
law judges. Rulings of administrative law judges on motions may not be 
appealed to the DOT decisionmaker prior to his or her consideration of 
the entire proceeding except in extraordinary circumstances and with the 
consent of the administrative law judge. An appeal shall be disallowed 
unless the administrative law judge finds, either on the record or in 
writing, that the allowance of such an appeal is necessary to prevent 
substantial detriment to the public interest or undue prejudice to any 
party. If an appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the DOT 
decisionmaker within such period as the administrative law judge 
directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the DOT decisionmaker 
directs otherwise. The rulings of the administrative law judge on a 
motion may be reviewed by the DOT decisionmaker in connection with his 
or her final action in the proceeding or at any other appropriate time 
irrespective of the filing of an appeal or any action taken on it.


<R05>
Sec. 302.12  Objections to public disclosure of information.

    (a) Generally. Part 7 of the Office of the Secretary regulations, 
Public Availability of Information, governs the availability of records 
and documents of the Department to the public. (49 CFR 7.1 et seq.)
    (b) Information contained in written documents. Any person who 
objects to the public disclosure of any information filed in any 
proceeding, or pursuant to the provisions of the Statute, or any 
Department rule, regulation, or order, shall segregate, or request the 
segregation of, such information into a separate submission and shall 
file it separately in a sealed envelope, bearing the caption of the 
enclosed submission, and the notation ``Confidential Treatment Requested 
Under Sec. 302.12.'' At the time of filing such submission (or, when 
the objection is made by a person who is not the filer, within five (5) 
days after the filing of such submission), the objecting party shall 
file a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure, in 
accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) or (f) of this 
section, as appropriate. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, copies of the filed submission and of the motion need not be 
served upon any other party unless so ordered by the Department.
    (c) Information contained in oral testimony. Any person who objects 
to the public disclosure of any information sought to be elicited from a 
witness or deponent on oral examination shall, before such information 
is disclosed, make his or her objection known. Upon such objection duly 
made, the witness or deponent shall be compelled to disclose such 
information only in the presence of the administrative law judge or the 
person before whom the deposition is being taken, as the case may be, 
the official stenographer and such attorneys for and representative of 
each party as the administrative law judge or the person before whom the 
deposition is being taken shall designate, and after all present have 
been sworn to secrecy. The transcript of testimony containing such 
information shall be segregated and filed in a sealed envelope, bearing 
the title and docket number of the proceeding, and the notation 
``Confidential Treatment Requested Under Sec. 302.12 Testimony Given by 
(name of witness or deponent).'' Within five (5) days after such 
testimony is given, the objecting person shall file a motion in 
accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (d) of this section, 
to withhold the information from public disclosure. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this section, copies of the segregated portion of the 
transcript and of the motion need not be served upon any other party 
unless so ordered by the Department.

[[Page 282]]

    (d) Form of motion. Motions to withhold from public disclosure 
information covered by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be 
filed with the Department in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) The motion shall include:
    (i) An index listing the information or document sought to be 
withheld by an identifying number, and including its title, description 
and number of pages, and, if relevant, the specific location within a 
document;
    (ii) A statement explaining how and why the information falls within 
one or more of the exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9)); and
    (iii) A statement explaining how and why public disclosure of the 
information would adversely affect the interests of the objecting 
persons and is not required in the interest of the public.
    (2) Such motion shall be filed with the person conducting the 
proceeding, or with the person with whom said application, report, or 
submission is required to be filed. Such motion will be denied when the 
complete justification required by this paragraph is not provided.
    (3) During the pendency of such motion, the ruling official may, by 
notice or order, allow limited disclosure to parties' representatives, 
for purposes of participating in the proceeding, upon submission by them 
of affidavits swearing to protect the confidentiality of the documents 
at issue.
    (e) Conditions of disclosure. The order, notice or other action of 
the Department containing its ruling upon each such motion will specify 
the extent to which, and the conditions upon which, the information may 
be disclosed to the parties and to the public, which ruling shall become 
effective upon the date stated therein, unless, within five (5) days 
after the date of the entry of the Department's order with respect 
thereto, a petition is filed by the objecting person requesting 
reconsideration by the Department, or a written statement is filed 
indicating that the objecting person in good faith intends to seek 
judicial review of the Department's order.
    (f) Objection by Government departments or representative thereof. 
In the case of objection to the public disclosure of any information 
filed by or elicited from any United States Government department or 
agency, or representative thereof, under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, the department or agency making such objection shall be 
exempted from the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section insofar as said paragraphs require the filing of a written 
objection to such disclosure. However, any department, agency, or 
representative thereof may, if it so desires, file a memorandum setting 
forth the reasons why it is claimed that a public disclosure of the 
information should not be made. If such a memorandum is submitted, it 
shall be filed and handled as is provided by this section in the case of 
a motion to withhold information from public disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 302.13  Consolidation of proceedings.

    (a) Initiation of consolidations. The Department, upon its own 
initiative or upon motion, may consolidate for hearing or for other 
purposes or may contemporaneously consider two or more proceedings that 
involve substantially the same parties, or issues that are the same or 
closely related, if it finds that such consolidation or contemporaneous 
consideration will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business 
and to the ends of justice and will not unduly delay the proceedings. 
Although the Department may, in any particular case, consolidate or 
contemporaneously consider two or more proceedings on its own motion, 
the burden of seeking consolidation or contemporaneous consideration of 
a particular application shall rest upon the applicant and the 
Department will not undertake to search its docket for all applications 
that might be consolidated or contemporaneously considered.
    (b) Time for filing. Unless the Department has provided otherwise in 
a particular proceeding, a motion to consolidate or contemporaneously 
consider an application with any other application shall be filed within 
21 days of the original application in the case of international route 
awards under section 41102 of the Statute (see Sec. 302.212), or, where 
a proceeding has

[[Page 283]]

been set for hearing before an administrative law judge, not later than 
the prehearing conference in the proceeding with which consolidation or 
contemporaneous consideration is requested. If made at such conference, 
the motion may be oral. All motions for consolidation or consideration 
of issues that enlarge, expand, or otherwise change the nature of the 
proceeding shall be addressed to the DOT decisionmaker, unless made 
orally at the prehearing conference, in which event the presiding 
administrative law judge shall present such motion to the DOT 
decisionmaker for his or her decision. A motion that is not timely 
filed, or that does not relate to an application pending at such time, 
shall be dismissed unless the movant shall clearly show good cause for 
failure to file such motion or application on time.
    (c) Answer. If a motion to consolidate two or more proceedings is 
filed with the Department, any party to any of such proceedings, or any 
person who has a petition for intervention pending, may file an answer 
to such motion within such period as the DOT decisionmaker may permit. 
The administrative law judge may require that answers to such motions be 
stated orally at the prehearing conference in the proceeding with which 
the consolidation is proposed.


<R05>
Sec. 302.14  Petitions for reconsideration.

    (a) Department orders subject to reconsideration; time for filing. 
(1) Unless an order or a rule of the Department specifically provides 
otherwise:
    (i) Any interested person may file a petition for reconsideration of 
any interlocutory order issued by the Department that institutes a 
proceeding; and
    (ii) Any party to a proceeding may file a petition for 
reconsideration, rehearing, or reargument of final orders issued by the 
Department (See Sec. 302.38), or an interlocutory order that defines 
the scope and issues of a proceeding or suspends a provision of a tariff 
on file with the Department.
    (2) Unless otherwise provided, petitions for reconsideration shall 
be filed, in the case of a final order, within twenty (20) days after 
service thereof, and, in the case of an interlocutory order, within ten 
(10) days after service. However, neither the filing nor the granting of 
such a petition shall operate as a stay of such final or interlocutory 
order unless specifically so ordered by the DOT decisionmaker. Within 
ten (10) days after a petition for reconsideration, rehearing, or 
reargument is filed, any party to the proceeding may file an answer in 
support of or in opposition. Motions for extension of time to file a 
petition or answer, and for leave to file a petition or answer after the 
time for the filing has expired, will not be granted except on a showing 
of unusual and exceptional circumstances, constituting good cause for 
the movant's inability to meet the established procedural dates.
    (b) Contents of petition. A petition for reconsideration, rehearing, 
or reargument shall state, briefly and specifically, the matters of 
record alleged to have been erroneously decided, the ground relied upon, 
and the relief sought. If a decision by the Secretary or Deputy 
Secretary is requested, the petition should describe in detail the 
reasons for such request and specify any important national 
transportation policy issues that are presented. If the petition is 
based, in whole or in part, on allegations as to the consequences that 
would result from the final order, the basis of such allegations shall 
be set forth. If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new 
matter, such new matter shall be set forth, accompanied by a statement 
to the effect that petitioner, with due diligence, could not have known 
or discovered such new matter prior to the date the case was submitted 
for decision. Unless otherwise directed by the DOT decisionmaker upon a 
showing of unusual or exceptional circumstances, petitions for 
reconsideration, rehearing or reargument or answers thereto that exceed 
twenty-five (25) pages (including appendices) in length shall not be 
accepted for filing by Department of Transportation Dockets.
    (c) Successive petitions. A successive petition for rehearing, 
reargument, reconsideration filed by the same party or person, and upon 
substantially the same ground as a former petition that has been 
considered or denied will not be entertained.

Sec. 302.15  Non-hearing procedures.

    In cases where oral evidentiary hearing procedures will not be used,

not be applicable except to the extent that the DOT decisionmaker shall 
determine that the application of some or all of such rules in the 
particular case will be conducive to the proper dispatch of its business 
and to the public interest. References in these and other sections of 
this part to powers or actions by administrative law judges shall not 
apply.

Sec. 302.17  Administrative law judges.

    (a) Powers and delegation of authority. (1) An administrative law 
judge shall have the following powers, in addition to any others 
specified in this part:
    (i) To give notice concerning and to hold hearings;
    (ii) To administer oaths and affirmations;
    (iii) To examine witnesses;
    (iv) To issue subpoenas and to take or cause depositions to be 
taken;
    (v) To rule upon offers of proof and to receive relevant evidence;
    (vi) To regulate the course and conduct of the hearing;
    (vii) To hold conferences before or during the hearing for the 
settlement or simplification of issues;
    (viii) To rule on motions and to dispose of procedural requests or 
similar matters;
    (ix) To make initial or recommended decisions as provided in Sec. 
302.31;
    (x) To take any other action authorized by this part or by the 
Statute.
    (2) The administrative law judge shall have the power to take any 
other action authorized by part 385 of this chapter or by the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (3) The administrative law judge assigned to a particular case is 
delegated the DOT decisionmaker's function of making the agency decision 
on the substantive and procedural issues remaining for disposition at 
the close of the hearing in such case, except that this delegation does 
not apply in cases where the record is certified to the DOT 
decisionmaker, with or without an initial or recommended decision by the 
administrative law judge, or in cases requiring Presidential approval 
under section 41307 of the Statute. This delegation does not apply to 
the review of rulings by the administrative law judge on interlocutory 
matters that have been appealed to the DOT decisionmaker in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. 302.11.
    (4) The administrative law judge's authority in each case will 
terminate either upon the certification of the record in the proceeding 
to the DOT decisionmaker, or upon the issuance of an initial or 
recommended decision, or when he or she shall have withdrawn from the 
case upon considering himself or herself disqualified.
    (b) Disqualification. An administrative law judge shall withdraw 
from the case if at any time he or she deems himself or herself 
disqualified. If, prior to the initial or recommended decision in the 
case, there is filed with the administrative law judge, in good faith, 
an affidavit of personal bias or disqualification with substantiating 
facts and the administrative law judge does not withdraw, the DOT 
decisionmaker shall determine the matter, if properly presented by 
exception or brief, as a part of the record and decision in the case. 
The DOT decisionmaker shall not otherwise consider any claim of bias or 
disqualification. The DOT decisionmaker, in his or her discretion, may 
order a hearing on a charge of bias or disqualification.


<R05>
Sec. 302.18  DOT decisionmaker.

    (a) Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs. 
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the 
Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs is the

[[Page 285]]

DOT decisionmaker. The Assistant Secretary shall have all of the powers 
set forth in Sec. 302.17(a)(1) and those additional powers delegated by 
the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary may delegate this authority in 
appropriate non-hearing cases to subordinate officials.
    (b) Oral hearing cases assigned to the senior career official. 
Carrier selection proceedings for international route authority that are 
set for oral hearing and such other oral hearing cases as the Secretary 
deems appropriate will be assigned to the senior career official in the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International 
Affairs, who will serve as the DOT decisionmaker. In all such cases, the 
administrative law judge shall render a recommended decision to the 
senior career official, who shall have all of the powers set forth in 
Sec. 302.17(a)(1) and those additional powers delegated by the 
Secretary.
    (1) Decisions of the senior career official are subject to review 
by, and at the discretion of, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and 
International Affairs. Petitions for discretionary review of decisions 
of the senior career official will not be entertained. A notice of 
review by the Assistant Secretary will establish the procedures for 
review. Unless a notice of review is issued, the decision of the senior 
career official will be issued as a final decision of the Department and 
will be served fourteen (14) days after it is adopted by the senior 
career official.
    (2) Final decisions of the senior career official may be reviewed 
upon a petition for reconsideration filed pursuant to Sec. 302.14. Such 
a petition shall state clearly the basis for requesting reconsideration 
and shall specify any questions of national transportation policy that 
may be involved. The Assistant Secretary will either grant or deny the 
petition.
    (3) Upon review or reconsideration, the Assistant Secretary may 
either affirm the decision or remand the decision to the senior career 
official for further action consistent with such order of remand.
    (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of 
this section, final decisions of the senior career official will be 
transmitted to the President of the United States when required under 49 
U.S.C. 41307.
    (c) Secretary and Deputy Secretary. The Secretary or Deputy 
Secretary may exercise any authority of the Assistant Secretary whenever 
he or she believes a decision involves important questions of national 
transportation policy.


<R05>
Sec. 302.19  Participation by persons not parties.

    Any person, including any State, subdivision thereof, State aviation 
commission, or other public body, may appear at any hearing, other than 
in an enforcement proceeding, and present any evidence that is relevant 
to the issues. With the consent of the administrative law judge or the 
DOT decisionmaker, such person may also cross-examine witnesses 
directly. Such persons may also present to the administrative law judge 
a written statement on the issues involved in the proceeding. Such 
written statements shall be filed and served on all parties prior to the 
close of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 302.20  Formal intervention.

    (a) Who may intervene. Any person who has a statutory right to be 
made a party to an oral evidentiary hearing proceeding shall be 
permitted to intervene. Any person whose intervention will be conducive 
to the public interest and will not unduly delay the conduct of such 
proceeding may be permitted to intervene.
    (b) Considerations relevant to determination of petition to 
intervene. In passing upon a petition to intervene, the following 
factors, among other things, will be considered and will be liberally 
interpreted to facilitate the effective participation by members of the 
public in Department proceedings:
    (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the statute to be 
made a party to the proceeding;
    (2) The nature and extent of the property, financial or other 
interest of the petitioner;
    (3) The effect of the order that may be entered in the proceeding on 
petitioner's interest;

[[Page 286]]

    (4) The availability of other means whereby the petitioner's 
interest may be protected;
    (5) The extent to which petitioner's interest will be represented by 
existing parties;
    (6) The extent to which petitioner's participation may reasonably be 
expected to assist in the development of a sound record; and
    (7) The extent to which participation of the petitioner will broaden 
the issues or delay the proceeding.
    (c) Petition to intervene--(1) Contents. Any person desiring to 
intervene in a proceeding shall file a petition in conformity with this 
part setting forth the facts and reasons why he or she thinks he or she 
should be permitted to intervene. The petition should make specific 
reference to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Time for filing. Unless otherwise ordered by the Department:
    (i) A petition to intervene shall be filed with the Department prior 
to the first prehearing conference, or, in the event that no such 
conference is to be held, not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the 
hearing.
    (ii) A petition to intervene filed by a city, other public body, or 
a chamber of commerce shall be filed with the Department not later than 
the last day prior to the beginning of the hearing.
    (iii) A petition to intervene that is not timely filed shall be 
dismissed unless the petitioner shall clearly show good cause for his or 
her failure to file such petition on time.
    (3) Answer. Any party to a proceeding may file an answer to a 
petition to intervene, making specific reference to the factors set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section, within seven (7) days after the 
petition is filed.
    (4) Disposition. The decision granting, denying or otherwise ruling 
on any petition to intervene may be issued without receiving testimony 
or oral argument either from the petitioner or other parties to the 
proceeding.
    (d) Effect of granting intervention. A person permitted to intervene 
in a proceeding thereby becomes a party to the proceeding. However, 
interventions provided for in this section are for administrative 
purposes only, and no decision granting leave to intervene shall be 
deemed to constitute an expression by the Department that the 
intervening party has such a substantial interest in the order that is 
to be entered in the proceeding as will entitle it to judicial review of 
such order.


<R05>
Sec. 302.21  Appearances.

    (a) Any party to a proceeding may appear and be heard in person or 
by a designated representative.
    (b) No register of persons who may practice before the Department is 
maintained and no application for admission to practice is required.
    (c) Any person practicing or desiring to practice before the 
Department may, upon hearing and good cause shown, be suspended or 
barred from practicing.


<R05>
Sec. 302.22  Prehearing conference.

    (a) Purpose and scope of conference. At the discretion of the 
administrative law judge, a prehearing conference may be called prior to 
any hearing. Written notice of the prehearing conference shall be sent 
by the administrative law judge to all parties to a proceeding and to 
other persons who appear to have an interest in such proceeding. The 
purpose of such a conference is to define the issues and the scope of 
the proceeding, to secure statements of the positions of the parties and 
amendments to the pleadings, to schedule the exchange of exhibits before 
the date set for hearing, and to arrive at such agreements as will aid 
in the conduct and disposition of the proceeding. For example, 
consideration will be given to:
    (1) Matters that the DOT decisionmaker can consider without the 
necessity of proof;
    (2) Admissions of fact and of the genuineness of documents;
    (3) Requests for documents;
    (4) Admissibility of evidence;
    (5) Limitation of the number of witnesses;
    (6) Reducing of oral testimony to exhibit form;
    (7) Procedure at the hearing; and
    (8) Use of electronic media as a basis for exchange of briefs, 
hearing transcripts and exhibits, etc., in addition to the official 
record copy.

[[Page 287]]

    (b) Actions during prehearing conference. The administrative law 
judge may require a further conference, or responsive pleadings, or 
both. If a party refuses to produce documents requested by another party 
at the conference, the administrative law judge may compel the 
production of such documents prior to a hearing by subpoena issued in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 302.25 as though at a hearing. 
Applications for the production prior to hearing of documents in the 
Department's possession shall be addressed to the administrative law 
judge, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 302.25(g), in the same 
manner as provided therein for production of documents at a hearing. The 
administrative law judge may also, on his or her own initiative or on 
motion of any party, direct any party to the proceeding (air carrier or 
non-air carrier) to prepare and submit exhibits setting forth studies, 
forecasts, or estimates on matters relevant to the issues in the 
proceeding.
    (c) Report of prehearing conference. The administrative law judge 
shall issue a report of prehearing conference, defining the issues, 
giving an account of the results of the conference, specifying a 
schedule for the exchange of exhibits and rebuttal exhibits, the date of 
hearing, and specifying a time for the filing of objections to such 
report. The report shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding 
and any person who appeared at the conference. Objections to the report 
may be filed by any interested person within the time specified therein. 
The administrative law judge may revise his or her report in the light 
of the objections presented. The revised report, if any, shall be served 
upon the same persons as was the original report. Exceptions may be 
taken on the basis of any timely written objection that has not been met 
by a revision of the report if the exceptions are filed within the time 
specified in the revised report. Such report shall constitute the 
official account of the conference and shall control the subsequent 
course of the proceeding, but it may be reconsidered and modified at any 
time to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice.


<R05>
Sec. 302.23  Hearing.

    The administrative law judge to whom the case is assigned or the DOT 
decisionmaker shall give the parties reasonable notice of a hearing or 
of the change in the date and place of a hearing and the nature of such 
hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 302.24  Evidence.

    (a) Presenting evidence. Presenting evidence at the hearing shall be 
limited to material evidence relevant to the issues as drawn by the 
pleadings or as defined in the report of prehearing conference, subject 
to such later modifications of the issues as may be necessary to protect 
the public interest or to prevent injustice, and shall not be unduly 
repetitious. Evidence shall be presented in such form by all parties as 
the administrative law judge may direct.
    (b) Objections to evidence. Objections to the admission or exclusion 
of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections 
relied upon, and the transcript shall not include argument or debate 
except as ordered by the administrative law judge. Rulings on such 
objections shall be a part of the transcript.
    (c) Exhibits. When exhibits are offered in evidence, one copy must 
be furnished to each of the parties at the hearing, and two copies to 
the administrative law judge, unless the parties previously have been 
furnished with copies or the administrative law judge directs otherwise. 
If the administrative law judge has not fixed a time for the exchange of 
exhibits, the parties shall exchange copies of exhibits at the earliest 
practicable time, preferably before the hearing or, at the latest, at 
the commencement of the hearing. Copies of exhibits may, at the 
discretion of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, be 
furnished by use of electronic media in lieu of or in addition to a 
paper record copy.
    (d) Substitution of copies for original exhibits. In his or her 
discretion, the administrative law judge may permit a party to withdraw 
original documents offered in evidence and substitute true copies in 
lieu thereof.

[[Page 288]]

    (e) Designation of parts of documents. When relevant and material 
matter offered in evidence by any party is embraced in a book, paper, or 
document containing other matter not material or relevant, the party 
offering the same shall plainly designate the matter so offered. The 
immaterial and irrelevant parts shall be excluded and shall be 
segregated insofar as practicable. If the volume of immaterial or 
irrelevant matter would unduly encumber the record, such submission will 
not be received in evidence, but may be marked for identification, and, 
if properly authenticated, the relevant or material matter may be read 
into the record, or, if the administrative law judge so directs, a true 
copy of such matter, in proper form, shall be received as an exhibit, 
and like copies delivered by the party offering the same to opposing 
parties or their attorneys appearing at the hearing, who shall be 
afforded an opportunity to examine the submission, and to offer in 
evidence in like manner other portions of the exhibit.
    (f) Records in other proceedings. In case any portion of the record 
in any other proceeding or civil or criminal action is offered in 
evidence, a true copy of such portion shall be presented for the record 
in the form of an exhibit unless:
    (1) The portion is specified with particularity in such manner as to 
be readily identified;
    (2) The party offering the same agrees unconditionally to supply 
such copies later, or when required by the DOT decisionmaker;
    (3) The parties represented at the hearing stipulate upon the record 
that such portion may be incorporated by reference, and that any portion 
offered by any other party may be incorporated by like reference upon 
compliance with paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section; and
    (4) The administrative law judge directs such incorporation or 
waives the requirement in paragraph (f)(3) of this section with the 
consent of the parties.
    (g) Official notice of facts contained in certain documents. (1) 
Without limiting, in any manner or to any extent, the discretionary 
powers of the DOT decisionmaker and the administrative law judge to 
notice other matters or documents properly the subject of official 
notice, facts contained in any document within the categories enumerated 
in this subdivision are officially noticed in all formal economic 
proceedings except those subject to subpart D of this part. Each such 
category shall include any document antedating the final Department 
decision in the proceeding where such notice is taken. The matters 
officially noticed under the provisions of this paragraph are:

or the Department as part of ER-586 Service Segment Data by U.S.

confidential.
    (vii) All tariffs, including the electronic versions, and amendments 
thereof, of all air carriers, on file with the Department.
    (viii) Service Mail Pay and Subsidy for U.S. Certificated Air 
Carriers published by the CAB and any supplemental data and subsequent

    (2) Any fact contained in a document belonging to a category 
enumerated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall be deemed to have 
been physically incorporated into and made part of the record in such 
proceedings. However, such taking of official notice shall be subject to 
the rights granted to any party or intervener to the proceeding under 
section 7(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 557(d)).
    (3) The decisions of the Department and its administrative law 
judges may officially notice any appropriate matter without regard to 
whether or not such items are contained in a document belonging to the 
categories enumerated in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. However, 
where the decision rests on official notice of a material fact or facts, 
it will set forth such items with sufficient particularity to advise 
interested persons of the matters that have been noticed.
    (h) Receipt of documents after hearing. No document or other 
writings shall be accepted for the record after the close of the hearing 
except in accordance with an agreement of the parties and the consent of 
the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker.
    (i) Exceptions. Formal exceptions to the rulings of the 
administrative law judge made during the course of the hearing are 
unnecessary. For all purposes for which an exception otherwise would be 
taken, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the 
administrative law judge is made or sought, makes known the action he or 
she desires the administrative law judge to take or his or her objection 
to an action taken, and his or her grounds therefor.
    (j) Offers of proof. Any offer of proof made in connection with an 
objection taken to any ruling of the administrative law judge rejecting

such testimony, and if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in 
documentary or written form or of reference to documents or records, a 
copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall 
constitute the offer of proof.


<R05>
Sec. 302.25  Subpoenas.

    (a) An application for a subpoena requiring the attendance of a 
witness at a hearing or the production of documentary evidence may be 
made without notice by any party to the administrative law judge or, in 
the event that an administrative law judge has not been assigned to a 
proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge, for action.
    (b) An application for a subpoena shall be in duplicate except that 
if it is

[[Page 290]]

made during the course of a hearing, it may be made orally on the record 
with the consent of the administrative law judge.
    (c) All such applications, whether written or oral, shall contain a 
statement or showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the 
evidence sought, and shall be accompanied by two copies of a draft of 
the subpoena sought that, in the case of evidence, shall describe the 
documentary or tangible evidence to be subpoenaed with as much 
particularity as is feasible, or, in the case of a witness, the name of 
the witness and a general description of the matters concerning which 
the witness will be asked to testify.
    (d) The administrative law judge or DOT decisionmaker considering 
any application for a subpoena shall issue the subpoena requested if the 
application complies with this section. No attempt shall be made to 
determine the admissibility of evidence in passing upon an application 
for a subpoena, and no detailed or burdensome showing shall be required 
as a condition to the issuance of a subpoena.
    (e) Where it appears during the course of a proceeding that the 
testimony of a witness or documentary evidence is relevant to the issues 
in a proceeding, the administrative law judge, Chief Administrative Law 
Judge or DOT decisionmaker may issue on his or her own initiative a 
subpoena requiring such witness to attend and testify or requiring the 
production of such documentary evidence.
    (f) Subpoenas issued under this section shall be served upon the 
person to whom directed in accordance with Sec. 302.7(b). Any person 
upon whom a subpoena is served may within seven (7) days after service 
or at any time prior to the return date thereof, whichever is earlier, 
file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the administrative 
law judge or, in the event an administrative law judge has not been 
assigned to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker 
or the Chief Administrative Law Judge for action. If the person to whom 
the motion to modify or quash the subpoena has been addressed or 
directed, has not acted upon such a motion by the return date, such date 
shall be stayed pending his or her final action thereon. The DOT 
decisionmaker may at any time review, upon his or her own initiative, 
the ruling of an administrative law judge or the Chief Administrative 
Law Judge denying a motion to quash a subpoena. In such cases, the DOT 
decisionmaker may order that the return date of a subpoena be stayed 
pending action thereon.
    (g) The provisions of this section are not applicable to the 
attendance of DOT employees or the production of documentary evidence in 
the custody thereof at a hearing. The attendance of DOT employees and 
the production of documentary evidence in their custody are governed by 
49 CFR Parts 9 and 7, respectively.


<R05>
Sec. 302.26  Depositions.

    (a) For good cause shown, the DOT decisionmaker or administrative 
law judge assigned to a proceeding may order that the testimony of a 
witness be taken by deposition and that the witness produce documentary 
evidence in connection with such testimony. Ordinarily an order to take 
the deposition of a witness will be entered only if:
    (1) The person whose deposition is to be taken would be unavailable 
at the hearing,
    (2) The deposition is deemed necessary to perpetuate the testimony 
of the witness, or
    (3) The taking of the deposition is necessary to prevent undue and 
excessive expense to a party and will not result in an undue burden to 
other parties or in undue delay.
    (b) Any party desiring to take the deposition of a witness shall 
make application therefor in duplicate to the administrative law judge 
or, in the event that an administrative law judge has not been assigned 
to a proceeding or is not available, to the DOT decisionmaker or Chief 
Administrative Law Judge, setting forth the reasons why such deposition 
should be taken, the name and residence of the witness, the time and 
place proposed for the taking of the deposition, and a general 
description of the matters concerning

[[Page 291]]

which the witness will be asked to testify. If good cause be shown, the 
administrative law judge, the DOT decisionmaker, or the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, may, in his or her 
discretion, issue an order authorizing such deposition and specifying 
the witness whose deposition is to be taken, the general scope of the 
testimony to be taken, the time when, the place where, the designated 
officer (authorized to take oaths) before whom the witness is to 
testify, and the number of copies of the deposition to be supplied. Such 
order shall be served upon all parties by the person proposing to take 
the deposition a reasonable period in advance of the time fixed for 
taking testimony.
    (c) Witnesses whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be sworn 
or shall affirm before any questions are put to them. Each question 
shall be recorded and the answers shall be taken down in the words of 
the witness.
    (d) Objections to questions or evidence shall be in short form, 
stating the grounds of objection relied upon, but no transcript filed by 
the designated officer shall include argument or debate. Objections to 
questions or evidence shall be noted by the designated officer upon the 
deposition, but he or she shall not have power to decide on the 
competency or materiality or relevance of evidence, and he or she shall 
record the evidence subject to objection. Objections to questions or 
evidence not made before the designated officer shall not be deemed 
waived unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been 
obviated or removed if presented at that time.
    (e) The testimony shall be reduced to writing by the designated 
officer, or under his or her direction, after which the deposition shall 
be signed by the witness unless the parties by stipulation waive the 
signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign, and 
certified in usual form by the designated officer. If the deposition is 
not signed by the witness, the designated officer shall state on the 
record this fact and the reason therefor. The original deposition and 
exhibits shall be forwarded to Department of Transportation Dockets and 
shall be filed in the proceedings.
    (f) Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written 
interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by 
oral examination. Ordinarily such procedure will be authorized only if 
necessary to achieve the purposes of an oral deposition and to serve the 
balance of convenience of the parties. The interrogatories shall be 
filed in quadruplicate with two copies of the application and a copy of 
each shall be served on each party. Within seven (7) days after service 
any party may file with the person to whom application was made two 
copies of his or her objections, if any, to such interrogatories and may 
file such cross-interrogatories as he or she desires to submit. Cross-
interrogatories shall be filed in quadruplicate, and a copy thereof 
together with a copy of any objections to interrogatories, shall be 
served on each party, who shall have five (5) days thereafter to file 
and serve his or her objections, if any, to such cross-interrogatories. 
Objections to interrogatories or cross-interrogatories, shall be served 
on the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge considering the 
application. Objections to interrogatories shall be made before the 
order for taking the deposition issues and if not so made shall be 
deemed waived. When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories, 
and cross-interrogatories, no party shall be present or represented, and 
no person other than the witness, a reporter, and the designated officer 
shall be present at the examination of the witness, which fact shall be 
certified by the designated officer, who shall ask the interrogatories 
and cross-interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the 
testimony to writing in the witness's own words. The provisions of 
paragraph (e) of this section shall be applicable to depositions taken 
in accordance with this paragraph.
    (g) All depositions shall conform to the specifications of Sec. 
302.3 except that the filing of three copies thereof shall be 
sufficient. Any fees of a witness, the reporter, or the officer 
designated to take the deposition shall be paid by the person at whose 
instance the deposition is taken.

[[Page 292]]

    (h) The fact that a deposition is taken and filed in a proceeding as 
provided in this section does not constitute a determination that it is 
admissible in evidence or that it may be used in the proceeding. Only 
such part or the whole of a deposition as is received in evidence shall 
constitute a part of the record in such proceeding upon which a decision 
may be based.


<R05>
Sec. 302.27  Rights of witnesses; attendance fees and mileage.

    (a) Any person appearing as a witness in any proceeding governed by 
this part, whether in response to a subpoena or by request or permission 
of the Department, may be accompanied, represented, and advised by 
counsel and may be examined by that counsel after other questioning.
    (b) Any person who submits data or evidence in a proceeding governed 
by this part, whether in response to a subpoena or by request or 
permission of the Department, may retain, or, on payment of lawfully 
prescribed costs, procure, a copy of any document so submitted or a copy 
of any transcript made of such testimony.
    (c) No person whose attendance at a hearing or whose deposition is 
to be taken shall be obliged to respond to a subpoena unless upon a 
service of the subpoena he or she is tendered attendance fees and 
mileage by the party at whose instance he or she is called in accordance 
with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section; 
Provided, That a witness summoned at the instance of the Department or 
one of its employees, or a salaried employee of the United States 
summoned to testify as to matters related to his or her public 
employment, need not be tendered such fees or mileage at that time.
    (1) Witnesses who are not salaried employees of the United States, 
or such employees summoned to testify on matters not related to their 
public employment, shall be paid the same per diem, subsistence, and 
mileage fees paid to witnesses for like service in the courts of the 
United States that are in effect at the time of travel; Provided, That 
no employee, officer, or attorney of an air carrier who travels under 
the free or reduced rate provisions of section 41511 of the Statute 
shall be entitled to any fees or mileage; And provided further, That 
such fees and mileage shall not be applicable for witnesses summoned to 
testify in Alaska, and that, in Alaska, where permitted by section 41511 
of the Statute, the witness may, at his or her option, accept a pass for 
travel by air. Such witnesses shall be furnished appropriate forms and 
instructions for the submission of claims for attendance fees, 
subsistence, and mileage from the Government before the close of the 
proceedings that they are required to attend. Only persons summoned by 
subpoena shall be entitled to claim attendance fees, subsistence, or 
mileage from the Government.
    (2) Witnesses who are salaried employees of the United States and 
who are summoned to testify on matters relating to their public 
employment, irrespective of at whose instance they are summoned, shall 
be paid in accordance with applicable Government regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 302.28  Transcripts of hearings.

    (a) Hearings shall be recorded and transcribed under supervision of 
the administrative law judge, by a reporting firm under contract with 
the Department. Copies of the transcript that may, at the discretion of 
the administrative law judge, be furnished by use of electronic media in 
addition to the official copy, shall be supplied to the parties to the 
proceeding by said reporting firm, at the contract price for copies.
    (b) The administrative law judge shall determine whether ``ordinary 
transcript'' or ``daily transcript'' (as those terms are defined in the 
contract) will be necessary and required for the proper conduct of the 
proceeding and the Department will pay the reporting firm the cost of 
reporting its proceedings at the contract price for such type of 
transcript. If the administrative law judge has determined that ordinary 
transcript is adequate, and has notified the parties of such 
determination (in the notice of hearings, or otherwise), then any party 
may request reconsideration of such determination and that daily 
transcript be

[[Page 293]]

required. In determining what is necessary and required for the proper 
conduct of the proceeding, the administrative law judge shall consider, 
among other things:
    (1) The nature of the proceeding itself;
    (2) The DOT decisionmaker's needs as well as the reasonable needs of 
the parties;
    (3) The cost to the Department; and
    (4) The requirements of a fair hearing.
    (c) If the administrative law judge has determined that ordinary 
transcript is adequate, or, upon reconsideration, has adhered to such 
determination, then any party may request the reporting firm to provide 
daily transcript. In that case, pursuant to its contract with the 
Department, the reporting firm will be obligated to furnish to the 
Department daily transcript upon the agreement by the requesting party 
to pay to the reporting firm an amount equal to the difference between 
the contract prices for ordinary transcript and daily transcript, 
provided that the requesting party makes such agreement with the 
reporting firm at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the date 
for which such transcript is requested.
    (d) Any party may obtain from the Office of the Assistant Secretary 
for Administration, the name and address of the private reporting 
company with which the Department currently has a contract for 
transcripts and copies, as well as the contract prices then in effect 
for such services.
    (e) Copies of transcripts ordered by parties other than the 
Department shall be prepared for delivery to the requesting person at 
the reporting firm's place of business, within the stated time for the 
type of transcript ordered. The requesting party and the reporting firm 
may agree upon some other form or means of delivery (mail, messenger, 
electronic media, etc.) and the reporting firm may charge for such 
special service, provided that such charge shall not exceed the 
reasonable cost of such service.
    (f) Changes in the official transcript may be made only when they 
involve errors affecting substance. A motion to correct a transcript 
shall be filed with Department of Transportation Dockets, within ten 
(10) days after receipt of the completed transcript by the Department. 
If no objections to the motion are filed within ten (10) days 
thereafter, the transcript may, upon the approval of the administrative 
law judge, be changed to reflect such corrections. If objections are 
received, the motion and objections shall be submitted to the official 
reporter by the administrative law judge together with a request for a 
comparison of the transcript with the reporter's record of the hearing. 
After receipt of the report of the official reporter an order shall be 
entered by the administrative law judge settling the record and ruling 
on the motion.


<R05>
Sec. 302.29  Argument before the administrative law judge.

    (a) The administrative law judge shall give the parties to the 
proceeding adequate opportunity during the course of the hearing for the 
presentation of arguments in support of or in opposition to motions, and 
objections and exceptions to rulings of the administrative law judge.
    (b) When, in the opinion of the administrative law judge, the volume 
of the evidence or the importance or complexity of the issues involved 
warrants, he or she may, either on his or her own motion or at the 
request of a party, permit the presentation of oral argument, and may 
impose such time limits on the argument as he or she may determine 
appropriate. Such argument shall be transcribed and bound with the 
transcript of testimony and will be available to the Department 
decisionmaker for consideration in deciding the case.


<R05>
Sec. 302.30  Briefs to the administrative law judge.

    Within such limited time after the close of the reception of 
evidence fixed by the administrative law judge, any party may, upon 
request and under such conditions as the administrative law judge may 
prescribe, file for his or her consideration briefs which may include 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that shall contain 
exact references to the record and authorities relied upon.

[[Page 294]]


<R05>
Sec. 302.31  Initial and recommended decisions; certification of the 
record.

    (a) Action by administrative law judge after hearing. Except where 
the DOT decisionmaker directs otherwise, after the taking of evidence 
and the receipt of briefs which may include proposed findings of fact 
and conclusions of law, if any, the administrative law judge shall take 
the following action:
    (1) Initial decision. If the proceeding does not involve foreign air 
transportation, the administrative law judge shall render an ``initial 
decision.'' Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's 
decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural 
issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.
    (2) Recommended decision. In cases where the action of the 
Department involves foreign air transportation and is subject to review 
by the President of the United States pursuant to section 41307 of the 
Statute, the administrative law judge shall render a ``recommended 
decision.'' Such decision shall encompass the administrative law judge's 
decision on the merits of the proceeding and on all ancillary procedural 
issues remaining for disposition at the close of the hearing.
    (b) Certification to the DOT decisionmaker for decision. At any time 
prior to the close of the hearing, the DOT decisionmaker may direct the 
administrative law judge to certify any question or the entire record in 
the proceeding to the DOT decisionmaker for decision. In cases where the 
record is thus certified, the administrative law judge shall not render 
a decision but shall make a recommendation to the DOT decisionmaker as 
required by section 8(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 
558(a)) unless advised by the DOT decisionmaker that he or she intends 
to issue a tentative decision.
    (c) Every initial or recommended decision issued shall state the 
names of the persons who are to be served with copies of it, the time 
within which exceptions to, or petitions for review of, such decision 
may be filed, and the time within which briefs in support of the 
exceptions may be filed. In addition, every such decision shall recite 
that it is made under delegated authority, and contain notice of the 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this section. In the event the 
administrative law judge certifies the record to the DOT decisionmaker 
without an initial or recommended decision, he or she shall notify the 
parties of the time within which to file with the DOT decisionmaker 
briefs which may include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of 
law.
    (d) Unless a petition for discretionary review is filed pursuant to 
Sec. 302.32, exceptions are filed pursuant to Sec. 302.217, or the DOT 
decisionmaker issues an order to review upon his or her own initiative, 
the initial decision shall become effective as the final order of the 
Department thirty (30) days after service thereof; in the case of a 
recommended decision, that decision shall be transmitted to the 
President of the United States under 49 U.S.C. 41307. If a petition for 
discretionary review or exceptions are timely filed or action to review 
is taken by the DOT decisionmaker upon his or her own initiative, the 
effectiveness of the initial decision or the transmission of the 
recommended decision is stayed until the further order of the DOT 
decisionmaker.


<R05>
Sec. 302.32  Petitions for discretionary review of initial or 
recommended decisions; review proceedings.

    (a) Petitions for discretionary review. (1) Review by the DOT 
decisionmaker pursuant to this section is not a matter of right but is 
at the sole discretion of the DOT decisionmaker. Any party may file and 
serve a petition for discretionary review by the DOT decisionmaker of an 
initial decision or recommended decision within twenty-one (21) days 
after service thereof, unless the DOT decisionmaker sets a different 
period for filing.
    (2) Petitions for discretionary review shall be filed only upon one 
or more of the following grounds:
    (i) A finding of a material fact is erroneous;
    (ii) A necessary legal conclusion is without governing precedent or 
is a departure from or contrary to law, the Department's rules, or 
precedent;
    (iii) A substantial and important question of law, policy or 
discretion is involved; or

[[Page 295]]

    (iv) A prejudicial procedural error has occurred.
    (3) Each issue shall be separately numbered and plainly and 
concisely stated. Petitioners shall not restate the same point in 
repetitive discussions of an issue. Each issue shall be supported by 
detailed citations of the record when objections are based on the 
record, and by statutes, regulations or principal authorities relied 
upon. Any matters of fact or law not argued before the administrative 
law judge, but that the petitioner proposes to argue on brief to the DOT 
decisionmaker, shall be stated.
    (4) Petitions for discretionary review shall be self-contained and 
shall not incorporate by reference any part of another document. Except 
by permission of the DOT decisionmaker, petitions shall not exceed 
twenty (20) pages including appendices and other papers physically 
attached to the petition.
    (5) Requests for oral argument on petitions for discretionary review 
will not be entertained by the DOT decisionmaker.
    (b) Answers. Within fifteen (15) days after service of a petition 
for discretionary review, any party may file and serve an answer of not 
more than fifteen (15) pages in support of or in opposition to the 
petition. If any party desires to answer more than one petition for 
discretionary review in the same proceeding, he or she shall do so in a 
single document of not more than twenty (20) pages.
    (c) Orders declining review. The DOT decisionmaker's order declining 
to exercise the discretionary right of review will specify the date upon 
which the administrative law judge's decision shall become effective as 
the final decision of the Department. A petition for reconsideration of 
a Department order declining review will be entertained only when the 
order exercises, in part, the DOT decisionmaker's discretionary right of 
review, and such petition shall be limited to the single question of 
whether any issue designated for review and any issue not so designated 
are so inseparably interrelated that the former cannot be reviewed 
independently or that the latter cannot be made effective before the 
final decision of the Department in the review proceeding.
    (d) Review proceedings. (1) The DOT decisionmaker may take review of 
an initial or recommended decision upon petition or on his or her own 
initiative or both. The DOT decisionmaker will issue a final order upon 
such review without further proceedings on any or all the issues where 
he or she finds that matters raised do not warrant further proceedings.
    (2) Where the DOT decisionmaker desires further proceedings, he or 
she will issue an order for review that will:
    (i) Specify the issues to which review will be limited. Only those 
issues specified in the order shall be argued on brief to the DOT 
decisionmaker, pursuant to Sec. 302.35, and considered by the DOT 
decisionmaker;
    (ii) Specify the portions of the administrative law judge's 
decision, if any, that are to be stayed as well as the effective date of 
the remaining portions thereof; and
    (iii) Designate the parties to the review proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 302.33  Tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whenever 
the administrative law judge certifies the record in a proceeding 
directly to the DOT decisionmaker without issuing an initial or 
recommended decision in the matter, the DOT decisionmaker shall, after 
consideration of any briefs submitted by the parties, prepare a 
tentative decision and serve it upon the parties. Every tentative 
decision of the DOT decisionmaker shall state the names of the persons 
who are to receive copies of it, the time within which exceptions to 
such decision and briefs, if any, in support of or in opposition to the 
exceptions may be filed, and the date when such decision will become 
final in the absence of exceptions thereto. If no exceptions are filed 
to the tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker within the period 
fixed, it shall become final at the expiration of such period unless the 
DOT decisionmaker orders otherwise.
    (b) The DOT decisionmaker may, in his or her discretion, omit a 
tentative decision in proceedings under subpart

[[Page 296]]

B. Final decisions of the DOT decisionmaker are subject to review as 
provided in Sec. 302.18.


<R05>
Sec. 302.34  Exceptions to tentative decisions of the DOT decisionmaker.

    (a) Time for filing. Within ten (10) days after service of any 
tentative decision of the DOT decisionmaker, any party to a proceeding 
may file exceptions to such decision with the DOT decisionmaker.
    (b) Form and contents of exceptions. Each exception shall be 
separately numbered and shall be stated as a separate point, and 
appellants shall not restate the same point in several exceptions. Each 
exception shall state, sufficiently identify, and be limited to, an 
ultimate conclusion in the decision to which exception is taken (such 
as, selection of one carrier rather than another to serve any point or 
points; points included in or excluded from a new route; imposition or 
failure to impose a given restriction; determination of a rate at a 
given amount rather than another). No specific exception shall be taken 
with respect to underlying findings or statements, but exceptions to an 
ultimate conclusion shall be deemed to include exceptions to all 
underlying findings and statements pertaining thereto; Provided, 
however, That exceptions shall specify any matters of law, fact, or 
policy that were not argued before the administrative law judge but will 
be set forth for the first time on brief to the DOT decisionmaker.
    (c) Effect of failure to file timely and adequate exceptions. No 
objection may be made on brief or at a later time to an ultimate 
conclusion that is not expressly made the subject of an exception in 
compliance with the provisions of this section; Provided, however, That 
any party may file a brief in support of the decision and in opposition 
to the exceptions filed by any other party.


<R05>
Sec. 302.35  Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker.

    (a) Time for filing. Within such period after the date of service of 
any tentative decision by the DOT decisionmaker as may be fixed therein, 
any party may file a brief addressed to the DOT decisionmaker in support 
of his or her exceptions to such decision or in opposition to the 
exceptions filed by any other party. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker on 
initial or recommended decisions of administrative law judges shall be 
filed only in those cases where the DOT decisionmaker grants 
discretionary review and orders further proceedings, pursuant to Sec. 
302.32(d)(2), and only upon those issues specified in the order. Such 
briefs shall be filed within thirty (30) days after date of service of 
the order granting discretionary review unless otherwise specified in 
the order. In cases where, because of the limited number of parties and 
the nature of the issues, the filing of opening, answering, and reply 
briefs will not unduly delay the proceeding and will assist in its 
proper disposition, the DOT decisionmaker may direct that the parties 
file briefs at different times rather than at the same time.
    (b) Effect of failure to restate objections in briefs. In 
determining the merits of an appeal, the DOT decisionmaker will not 
consider the exceptions or the petition for discretionary review but 
will consider only the brief. Each objection contained in the exceptions 
or each issue specified in the DOT decisionmaker's order exercising 
discretionary review must be restated and supported by a statement and 
adequate discussion of all matters relied upon, in a brief filed 
pursuant to and in compliance with the requirements of this section.
    (c) Formal specifications of briefs--(1) Contents. Each brief shall 
discuss every point of law, fact, or precedent that the party submitting 
it is entitled to raise and that it wishes the DOT decisionmaker to 
consider. Each brief shall include a summary of the argument not to 
exceed five (5) pages. Support and justification for every point raised 
shall include itemized references to the pages of the transcript of 
hearing, exhibit or other matter of record, and citations of the 
statutes, regulations, or principal authorities relied upon. If a brief 
or any point discussed in the brief is not in substantial conformity 
with the requirement for such support and justification, no motion to 
strike or dismiss such document shall be made but the DOT decisionmaker 
may disregard the points involved. Copies of

[[Page 297]]

briefs may be furnished by use of electronic media in a format 
acceptable to the Department and the parties.
    (2) Incorporation by reference. Briefs to the DOT decisionmaker 
shall be completely self-contained and shall not incorporate by 
reference any portion of any other brief or pleading; Provided, however, 
That instead of submitting a brief to the DOT decisionmaker a party may 
adopt by reference specifically identified pages or the whole of his or 
her prior brief to the administrative law judge if the latter complies 
with all requirements of this section. In such cases, the party shall 
file with Department of Transportation Dockets a letter exercising this 
privilege and serve all parties in the same manner as a brief to the DOT 
decisionmaker.
    (3) Length. Except by permission or direction of the DOT 
decisionmaker, briefs shall not exceed fifty (50) pages including pages 
contained in any appendix, table, chart, or other document physically 
attached to the brief, but excluding maps and the summary of the 
argument. In this case ``map'' means only those pictorial 
representations of routes, flight paths, mileage, and similar ancillary 
data that are superimposed on geographic drawings and contain only such 
text as is needed to explain the pictorial representation.


<R05>
Sec. 302.36  Oral argument before the DOT decisionmaker.

    (a) If any party desires to argue a case orally before the DOT 
decisionmaker, he or she shall request leave to make such argument in 
his or her exceptions or brief. Such request shall be filed no later 
than the date when briefs before the DOT decisionmaker are due in the 
proceeding. The DOT decisionmaker will rule on such request, and, if 
oral argument is to be allowed, all parties to the proceeding will be 
advised of the date and hour set for such argument and the amount of 
time allowed to each party. Requests for oral argument on petitions for 
discretionary review will not be entertained.
    (b) Pamphlets, charts, and other written data may be offered to the 
DOT decisionmaker at oral argument only in accordance with the following 
rules: All such material shall be limited to facts in the record of the 
case being argued and shall be served on all parties to the proceeding 
with four (4) copies transmitted to Department of Transportation Dockets 
at least five (5) calendar days in advance of the argument.


<R05>
Sec. 302.37  Waiver of procedural steps after hearing.

    The parties to any proceeding may agree to waive any one or more of 
the procedural steps provided in Sec. 302.29 through Sec. 302.36.


<R05>
Sec. 302.38  Final decision of the DOT Decisionmaker.

    When a case stands submitted to the DOT decisionmaker for final 
decision on the merits, he or she will dispose of the issues presented 
by entering an appropriate order that will include a statement of the 
reasons for his or her findings and conclusions. Such orders shall be 
deemed ``final orders'' within the purview of Sec. 302.14(a), in the 
manner provided by Sec. 302.18.

                       Disposition of Applications


<R05>
Sec. 302.207  Cases to be decided on written submissions.

    (a) Applications under this subpart will be decided on the basis of 
written submissions unless the DOT decisionmaker, on petition as 
provided in Sec. 302.208 or on his or her own initiative, determines 
that an oral presentation or an administrative law judge's decision is 
required because:
    (1) Use of written procedures will prejudice a party;
    (2) Material issues of decisional fact cannot adequately be resolved 
without oral evidentiary hearing procedures; or
    (3) Assignment of an application for oral evidentiary hearing 
procedures or an initial or recommended decision by an administrative 
law judge is otherwise required by the public interest.
    (b) The standards employed in deciding cases under Sec. 
302.210(a)(1) or (5) shall be the same as the standards applied in cases

<R05>
Sec. 302.208  Petitions for oral presentation or judge's decision.

    (a) Any person may file a petition for oral evidentiary hearing, 
oral argument, an initial or recommended decision, or any combination of 
these. Petitions shall demonstrate that one or more of the criteria set 
forth in Sec. 302.207 are applicable to the issues for which an oral 
presentation or judge's decision is requested. Such petitions shall be 
supported by a detailed explanation of the following:
    (1) Why the evidence or argument to be presented cannot be submitted 
in the form of written evidence or briefs;
    (2) Which issues should be examined by an administrative law judge 
and why such issues should not be presented directly to the DOT 
decisionmaker for decision;
    (3) An estimate of the time required for the oral presentation and 
the number of witnesses whom the petitioner would present; and
    (4) If cross-examination of any witness is desired, the name of the 
witness, if known, the subject matter of the desired cross-examination 
or the title or number of the exhibit to be cross-examined, what the 
petitioner expects to establish by the cross-examination, and an 
estimate of the time needed for it.
    (b) Petitions for an oral hearing, oral argument, or an 
administrative law judge's decision shall be filed no later than the due 
date for answers in proceedings governed by Sec. 302.211, Sec. 302.212

[[Page 300]]

and Sec. 302.213, and be accompanied with the information specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Filing of the information 
required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section may be deferred 
until the DOT decisionmaker has decided to hold a formal proceeding.
    (c) Where a stipulation of disputed facts would eliminate the need 
for an oral presentation or an administrative law judge's decision, 
parties shall include in their petitions an offer to withdraw the 
request should the stipulation be made.


<R05>
Sec. 302.209  Procedures for deferral of applications.

    Within twenty-eight (28) days after the filing of an application 
under this subpart, the DOT decisionmaker may defer further processing 
of the application until all of the information necessary to process 
that application is submitted. The time periods contained in this 
subpart with respect to the disposition of the application shall not 
begin to run until the application is complete. In addition, the DOT 
decisionmaker may defer action on a foreign air carrier permit 
application for foreign policy reasons.


<R05>
Sec. 302.210  Disposition of applications; orders establishing further 
procedures.

    (a) General requirements. The DOT decisionmaker will take one of the 
following actions with respect to all or any portion of each 
application:
    (1) Issue an Order to Show Cause why the application should not be 
granted, denied or dismissed, in whole or in part.
    (2) Issue a Final Order granting the application if the DOT 
decisionmaker determines that there are no material issues of fact that 
warrant further procedures for their resolution.
    (3) Issue a Final Order dismissing or rejecting the application for 
lack of prosecution or if the application does not comply with this 
subpart or is otherwise materially deficient.
    (4) Issue an order setting the application for oral evidentiary 
hearing. The order will establish the scope of the issues to be 
considered and the procedures to be employed, and will indicate whether 
one or more attorneys from the Office of the Assistant General Counsel 
for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings will participate as a party. 
All of the procedures set forth in Sec. 302.214 through Sec. 302.218 
will apply unless the DOT decisionmaker decides otherwise.
    (5) Begin to make a determination with respect to the application 
under simplified procedures without oral evidentiary hearing. In this 
event, the DOT decisionmaker may indicate which, if any, of the 
procedural steps set forth in Sec. 302.215 through Sec. 302.219 will 
be employed. The DOT decisionmaker may also indicate that other non-oral 
evidentiary hearing procedures will be employed.
    (b) Additional evidence. An order establishing further procedures 
under paragraph (a)(1), (4) or (5) of this section may provide for the 
filing of additional evidence.
    (c) Petitions for reconsideration. Petitions for reconsideration of 
an order issued under this section will not be entertained except to the 
extent that the order dismissed or rejected all or part of an 
application. If a petition for reconsideration results in the 
reinstatement of all or part of an application, the deadline for final 
Department decision established in Sec. 302.220 will be calculated from 
the date of the order reinstating the application.


<R05>
Sec. 302.211  Procedures in certificate cases involving initial or 
continuing fitness.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to cases involving 
certificate authority under sections 41102 and 41103 of the Statute, 
including applications for new authority, renewals, amendments, 
modifications, suspensions, and transfers of such certificates, where 
the issues involve a determination of the applicant's fitness to 
operate. Where such applications propose the operation of scheduled 
service in limited entry international markets, the provisions of Sec. 
302.212 also apply.
    (b) Order establishing further procedures. Within 90 days after a 
complete application is filed, the DOT decisionmaker will take action as

certificates under section 41102 of the Statute that involve 
international routes, including applications to obtain, renew, amend, 
transfer, or remove restrictions in such certificates.
    (b) Answers to applications. Answers shall be filed within twenty 
one (21) days after the filing of the original application.
    (c) Conforming applications or motions to modify scope. Any person 
may file an application for the same authority as sought in an 
application to obtain, renew, or amend a certificate filed under 
paragraph (a) of this section. Requests to modify the issues to be 
decided and to consolidate applications filed in other dockets shall be 
filed as a ``motion to modify scope.'' Motions and applications under 
this section shall include economic data, other facts, and any argument 
in support of the person's position and must be filed within twenty one 
(21) days after the original application is filed. Later-filed competing 
applications shall conform to the base and forecast years used by the 
original applicant and need not contain traffic and financial data for 
markets for which data have already been submitted by another person.
    (d) Answers to conforming applications or motions to modify scope. 
Answers to conforming applications and motions to modify scope filed in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section shall be filed within 
fourteen (14) days after the filing of the conforming application or 
motion. Answers may argue that an application should be dismissed. 
Answers may also seek to consolidate an application filed in another 
docket if that application conforms to the scope of the proceeding 
proposed in the motion to modify scope and includes the information 
prescribed in Sec. 302.202. Answers and applications shall not, 
however, propose the consideration of additional markets.
    (e) Order establishing further procedures. Within 90 days after a 
complete application is filed, the DOT decisionmaker will issue an order 
as provided in Sec. 302.210.


<R05>
Sec. 302.213  Procedures in foreign air carrier permit cases.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to cases involving foreign 
air carrier permits under section 41302 of the Statute, including 
applications for new authority, renewals, amendments, modifications, 
suspensions, and transfers of such permits.
    (b) Executive departments. In addition to the standards set forth in 
Sec. 302.207(b), the views of other executive agencies, such as the 
Department of State, and the Federal Aviation Administration's 
evaluation of the applicant's operational fitness, may be sought in 
determining the appropriate action on applications filed under this 
section.
    (c) Order establishing further procedures. As soon as possible after 
the date that answers are due and all information needed to reach a 
decision is filed, the DOT decisionmaker will issue an order as provided 
in Sec. 302.210.


<R05>
Sec. 302.214  Oral evidentiary hearing.

    If the DOT decisionmaker determines under Sec. 302.210(a)(4) that 
an oral evidentiary hearing should be held, the application or 
applications will be set for oral hearing before an administrative law 
judge. The issues will be those set forth in the order establishing 
further procedures. The procedures in Sec. 302.17 to Sec. 302.38 
governing the conduct of oral evidentiary hearings will apply.


<R05>
Sec. 302.215  Briefs to the administrative law judge.

    Briefs to the administrative law judge shall be filed within the 
following periods, as applicable:
    (a) Fourteen (14) days after the close of the oral evidentiary 
hearing, unless the administrative law judge determines that, under the

will require more time to prepare briefs; or
    (b) Fourteen (14) days after the filing of additional evidence 
called for in the order establishing further procedures if no oral 
evidentiary hearing is called for, unless the DOT decisionmaker 
determines that some other period should be allowed.

[[Page 302]]


<R05>
Sec. 302.216  Administrative law judge's initial or recommended decision.

    (a) In a case that has been set for oral evidentiary hearing under 
Sec. 302.210(a)(4), the administrative law judge shall adopt and serve 
an initial or recommended decision within one hundred thirty-six (136) 
days after the issuance of the order establishing further procedures 
unless:
    (1) The DOT decisionmaker, having found extraordinary circumstances, 
has by order delayed the initial or recommended decision by a period of 
not more than thirty (30) days; or
    (2) An applicant has failed to meet the procedural schedule adopted 
by the judge or the DOT decisionmaker. In this case, the administrative 
law judge may, by notice, extend the due date for the issuance of an 
initial or recommended decision for a period not to exceed the period of 
delay caused by the applicant.
    (b) In a case in which some of the issues have not been set for oral 
hearing under Sec. 302.210(a)(4), the administrative law judge shall 
adopt and serve an initial or recommended decision within the time 
established by the DOT decisionmaker in the order establishing further 
procedures, except that that due date may be extended in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (c) The initial or recommended decision shall be issued by the 
administrative law judge fourteen (14) days after it is served. Unless 
exceptions are filed under Sec. 302.217 or the DOT decisionmaker issues 
an order to review on his or her own initiative, an initial decision 
shall become effective as the final order of the Department the day it 
is issued. Where exceptions are timely filed or the DOT decisionmaker 
takes action to review on his or her own initiative, the effectiveness 
of the initial decision is stayed until further order of the DOT 
decisionmaker.
    (d) In all other respects, the provisions of Sec. 302.31 shall 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 302.217  Exceptions to administrative law judge's initial or 
recommended decision.

    (a) Within seven (7) days after service of any initial or 
recommended decision of an administrative law judge, any party may file 
exceptions to the decision with the DOT decisionmaker.
    (b) If timely and adequate exceptions are filed, review of the 
initial or recommended decision is automatic.

    (a) In a case in which an initial or recommended decision has been 
served and exceptions have been filed, any party may file a brief in 
support of or in opposition to any exceptions. Such briefs shall be 
filed within fourteen (14) days after service of the initial or 
recommended decision.
    (b) In a case in which no exceptions have been filed, briefs shall 
not be filed unless the DOT decisionmaker has taken review of the 
initial or recommended decision on his or her own initiative and has 
specifically provided for the filing of such briefs.
    (c) In all other respect, the provisions of Sec. 302.35 shall 
apply.


<R05>
Sec. 302.219  Oral argument before the DOT decisionmaker.

    If the order establishing further procedures provides for an oral 
argument, or if the DOT decisionmaker otherwise decides to hear oral 
argument, all parties will be notified of the date and hour set for that 
argument and the amount of time allowed each party. The provisions of 
Sec. 302.36(b) shall also apply.


<R05>
Sec. 302.220  Final decision of the Department.

    In addition to the provisions of Sec. 302.38, the following 
provisions shall apply:
    (a) In the case of a certificate application that has been set for 
oral evidentiary hearing under Sec. 302.210(a)(4), the Department will 
issue its final order within ninety (90) days after the initial or 
recommended decision is issued. If an application has failed to meet the 
procedural schedule established by the Department, the DOT decisionmaker 
may, by notice, extend the date for a final decision for a period equal 
to the period of delay caused by the applicant.

[[Page 303]]

    (b) If the DOT decisionmaker does not act in the time period 
established in paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) in the case of an application for a certificate to engage in 
foreign air transportation, the recommended decision shall be 
transmitted to the President of the United States under 49 U.S.C. 41307; 
or
    (2) in the case of an application not subject to review by the 
President of the United States, the initial decision shall become 
effective as the final order of the Department.
    (c) In the case of a certificate application that has been processed 
under Sec. 302.210(a)(1) or (5), the Department will issue its final 
order within one hundred eighty (180) days after the order establishing 
further procedures. If an applicant has failed to meet the procedural 
schedule established by the Department, the DOT decisionmaker may, by 
notice, extend the due date for a final decision for a period equal to 
the period of delay caused by the applicant.

would total more than ten (10) flights; or
    (4) Any other application for which the Department decides the

chapter), or from Department regulations concerning tariffs may be 
submitted by letter. Three copies of such applications shall be sent to 
Department of Transportation Dockets. Upon a showing of good cause, the

electronic mail (when available), or telephone; all such requests must 
be confirmed by written application within three (3) business days of 
the original request.

<R05>
Sec. 302.303  Contents of applications.

    (a) Title. An application filed under Sec. 302.302(a) shall be 
entitled ``Application for . . .'' (followed by the type of authority 
request, e.g., exemption, frequency allocation) and, where applicable, 
shall state if the application involves renewal and/or amendment of 
existing exemption authority.
    (b) Factual statement. Each application shall state:
    (1) The section(s) of the Statute or the rule, regulation, term, 
condition, or limitation from which the exemption is requested;
    (2) The proposed effective date and duration of the exemption;
    (3) A description of how the applicant proposes to exercise the 
authority (for example, applications for exemption from section 41101 or 
41301 of the Statute should include at least: places to be served; 
equipment types, capacity and source; type and frequency or service; and 
other operations that the proposed service will connect with or 
support); and
    (4) Any other facts the applicant relies upon to establish that the 
proposed service will be consistent with the public interest.
    (c) Supporting evidence. (1) Each application shall be accompanied 
by:
    (i) A statement of economic data, or other matters or information 
that the applicant desires the Department to officially notice;
    (ii) Affidavits, or statements under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001, 
establishing any other facts the applicant wants the Department to rely 
upon; and
    (iii) Information showing the applicant is qualified to perform the 
proposed services.
    (2) In addition to the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, an application for exemption from section 41101 or 41301 
of the Statute (except exemptions under section 40109(g)) shall state 
whether the authority sought is governed by a bilateral agreement or by 
principles of comity and reciprocity. Applications by foreign carriers 
shall state whether the applicant's homeland government grants U.S. 
carriers authority similar to that requested. If so, the application 
shall state whether the fact of reciprocity has been established by the 
Department and cite the pertinent finding. If the fact of reciprocity 
has not been established by the Department, the application shall 
include documentation to establish such reciprocity.
    (d) Emergency cabotage. Applications under section 40109(g) of the 
Statute shall, in addition to the information required in paragraphs (b) 
and (c) of this section, contain evidence showing that:
    (1) Because of an emergency created by unusual circumstances not 
arising in the normal course of business, traffic in the markets 
requested cannot be accommodated by air carriers holding certificates 
under section 41102 of the Statute;
    (2) All possible efforts have been made to accommodate the traffic 
by using the resources of such air carriers (including, for example, the 
use of foreign aircraft, or sections of foreign aircraft, under lease or 
charter to such air carriers, and the use of such air carriers' 
reservation systems to the extent practicable);
    (3) The authority requested is necessary to avoid unreasonable 
hardship for the traffic in the market that cannot be accommodated by 
air carriers; and
    (4) In any case where an inability to accommodate traffic in a 
market results from a labor dispute, the grant of the requested 
exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in 
the dispute.
    (e) Renewal applications. An application requesting renewal of an 
exemption or other limited authority under this subpart that is intended 
to invoke the automatic extension provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) shall 
comply with, and contain the statements and information required by part 
377 of this chapter.

Office of International Aviation.


<R05>
Sec. 302.306  Dismissal or rejection of incomplete applications.

    (a) Dismissal or rejection. The Department may dismiss or reject any 
application for exemption that does not comply with the requirements of 
this part.

Sec. 302.307  Answers to applications.

    Within fifteen (15) days after the filing of an application for 
exemption, any person may file an answer in support of or in opposition 
to the grant of a requested exemption. Such answer shall set forth in

[[Page 306]]

to officially notice, and shall be accompanied by affidavits

<R05>
Sec. 302.308  Replies to answers.

    Within seven (7) days after the last day for filing an answer, any 
interested party may file a reply to one or more answers.


<R05>
Sec. 302.309  Requests for hearing.

    The Department will not normally conduct oral evidentiary hearings 
concerning applications for exemption. However, the Department may, in 
its discretion, order such a hearing on an application. Any applicant, 
or any person opposing an application, may request an oral evidentiary 
hearing. Such a request shall set forth in detail the reasons why the 
filing of affidavits or other written evidence will not permit the fair 
and expeditious disposition of the application. A request relying on 
factual assertions shall be accompanied by affidavits establishing such 
facts. If the Department orders an oral evidentiary hearing, the 
procedures in subpart A of this part shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 302.310  Exemptions on the Department's initiative.

    The Department may grant exemptions on its own initiative when it 
finds that such exemptions are required by the circumstances and 
consistent with the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 302.311  Emergency exemptions.

    (a) Shortened procedures. When required by the circumstances and 
consistent with the public interest, the Department may take action, 
without notice, on exemption applications prior to the expiration of the 
normal period for filing answers and replies. When required in a 
particular proceeding, the Department may specify a lesser time for the 
filing of answers and replies, and notify interested persons of this 
time period.
    (b)(1) Applications. Applications for emergency exemption need not 
conform to the requirements of this subpart or of subpart A of this part 
(except as provided in this section and in Sec. 302.303(d) concerning 
emergency cabotage requests). However, an application for emergency 
exemption must normally be in writing and must state in detail the facts 
and evidence that support the application, the grounds for the 
exemption, and the public interest basis for the authority sought. In 
addition, the application shall state specific reasons that justify 
departure from the normal exemption application procedures. The 
application shall also identify those persons notified as required by 
paragraph (c) of this section. The Department may require additional 
information from any applicant before acting on an application.
    (2) Oral requests. The Department will consider oral requests, 
including telephone requests, for emergency exemption authority under 
this section in circumstances that do not permit the immediate filing of 
a written application. All oral requests must, however, provide the 
information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that 
actual evidence in support of the application need not be tendered when 
the request is made. All oral requests must be confirmed by written 
application, together with all supporting evidence, within three (3) 
business days of the original request.
    (c) Notice. Except when the Department decides that no notice need 
be given, applicants for emergency exemption shall notify, as 
appropriate, those persons specified in Sec. 302.304(b) of this 
subpart. Such notification shall be made in the same manner, contain the 
same information, and be dispatched at the same time, as the application 
made to the Department.

    This subpart contains the specific rules that apply to Department 
proceedings to enforce the provisions of Subtitle VII of the Statute, 
and the rules, regulations, orders and other requirements issued by the 
Department, as well as the filing of informal and formal complaints. 
Except as modified by this subpart, the provisions of subpart A of this 
part apply.


<R05>
Sec. 302.402  Definitions.

    Assistant General Counsel, when used in this subpart, refers to the 
Assistant

[[Page 307]]

General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings.
    Complainant refers to the person filing a complaint.
    Parties, when used in this subpart, include the Office of the 
Assistant General Counsel, the respondent, the complainant, and any 
other person permitted to intervene under Sec. 302.20.
    Respondent refers to the person against whom a complaint is filed.


<R05>
Sec. 302.403  Informal complaints.

    Any person may submit in writing to the Assistant General Counsel an 
informal complaint with respect to anything done or omitted to be done 
by any person in contravention of any provision of the Statute or any 
requirement established thereunder. Such informal complaints need not 
otherwise comply with the provisions of this part. Matters so presented 
may, if their nature warrants, be handled by correspondence or 
conference with the appropriate persons. Any matter not disposed of 
informally may be made the subject of an enforcement proceeding pursuant 
to this subpart. The filing of an informal complaint shall not bar the 
subsequent filing of a formal complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 302.404  Formal complaints.

    (a) Filing. Any person may make a formal complaint to the Assistant 
General Counsel about any violation of the economic regulatory 
provisions of the Statute or of the Department's rules, regulations, 
orders, or other requirements. Every formal complaint shall conform to 
the requirements of Sec. 302.3 and Sec. 302.4, concerning the form and 
filing of documents. The filing of a complaint shall result in the 
institution of an enforcement proceeding only if the Assistant General 
Counsel issues a notice instituting such a proceeding as to all or part 
of the complaint under Sec. 302.406(a) or the Deputy General Counsel 
does so under Sec. 302.406(c).
    (b) Amendment. A formal complaint may be amended at any time before 
service of an answer to the complaint. After service of an answer but 
before institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be 
amended with the permission of the Assistant General Counsel. After 
institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be amended 
only on grant of a motion filed under Sec. 302.11.
    (c) Insufficiency of formal complaint. In any case where the 
Assistant General Counsel is of the opinion that a complaint does not 
sufficiently set forth matters required by any applicable rule, 
regulation or order of the Department, or is otherwise insufficient, he 
or she may advise the complainant of the deficiency and require that any 
additional information be supplied by amendment.
    (d) Joinder of complaints or complainants. Two or more grounds of 
complaints involving substantially the same purposes, subject or state 
of facts may be included in one complaint even though they involve more 
than one respondent. Two or more complainants may join in one complaint 
if their respective causes of complaint are against the same party or 
parties and involve substantially the same purposes, subject or state of 
facts. The Assistant General Counsel may separate or split complaints if 
he or she finds that the joinder of complaints, complainants, or 
respondents will not be conducive to the proper dispatch of the 
Department's business or the ends of justice.
    (e) Service. A formal complaint, and any amendments thereto, shall 
be served by the person filing such documents upon each party complained 
of, upon the Deputy General Counsel, and upon the Assistant General 
Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 302.405  Responsive documents.

    (a) Answers. Within fifteen (15) days after the date of service of a 
formal complaint, each respondent shall file an answer in conformance 
with and subject to the requirements of Sec. 302.408(b). Extensions of 
time for filing an answer may be granted by the Assistant General 
Counsel for good cause shown.
    (b) Offers to satisfy. A respondent in a formal complaint may offer 
to satisfy the complaint through submission of facts, offer of 
settlement or proposal of adjustment. Such offer shall be in writing and 
shall be served, within fifteen (15) days after service of the 
complaint, upon the same persons and in the same manner as an answer. 
The submittal of

[[Page 308]]

an offer to satisfy the complaint shall not excuse the filing of an 
answer.
    (c) Motions to dismiss. Motions to dismiss a formal complaint shall 
not be filed prior to the filing of a notice instituting an enforcement 
proceeding with respect to such complaint or a portion thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 302.406  Procedure for responding to formal complaints.

    (a) Within a reasonable time after an answer to a formal complaint 
is filed, the Assistant General Counsel shall either:
    (1) Issue a notice instituting a formal enforcement proceeding in 
accordance with Sec. 302.407 or
    (2) Issue an order dismissing the complaint in whole or in part, 
stating the reasons for such dismissal.
    (b) An order dismissing a complaint issued pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section shall become effective as a final order of the 
Department thirty (30) days after service thereof.
    (c) Whenever the Assistant General Counsel has failed to act on a 
formal complaint within a reasonable time after an answer is due, the 
following motions may be addressed to the Deputy General Counsel:
    (1) By the complainant to institute an enforcement proceeding by 
docketing the complaint upon a showing that it is in the public interest 
to do so; and
    (2) By the respondent to dismiss the complaint upon a showing that 
it is in the public interest to do so.
    (d) The Deputy General Counsel may grant, deny, or defer any of the 
motions, in whole or in part, and take appropriate action to carry out 
his or her decision.


<R05>
Sec. 302.407  Commencement of enforcement proceeding.

    (a) Whenever in the opinion of the Assistant General Counsel there 
are reasonable grounds to believe that any economic regulatory provision 
of the Statute, or any rule, regulation, order, limitation, condition, 
or other requirement established pursuant thereto, has been or is being 
violated, that efforts to satisfy a complaint as provided by Sec. 
302.405 have failed, and that the investigation of any or all of the 
alleged violations is in the public interest, the Assistant General 
Counsel may issue a notice instituting an enforcement proceeding before 
an administrative law judge.
    (b) The notice shall incorporate by reference the formal complaint 
submitted pursuant to Sec. 302.404 or shall be accompanied by a 
complaint by an attorney from the Office of the Assistant General 
Counsel. The notice and accompanying complaint, if any, shall be 
formally served upon each respondent and each complainant.
    (c) The proceedings thus instituted shall be processed in regular 
course in accordance with this part. However, nothing in this part shall 
be construed to limit the authority of the Department to institute or 
conduct any investigation or inquiry within its jurisdiction in any 
other manner or according to any other procedures that it may deem 
necessary or proper.
    (d) Whenever the Assistant General Counsel seeks an assessment of 
civil penalties in an enforcement proceeding, he or she shall serve on 
all parties to the proceeding a notice of the violations alleged and the 
amount of penalties for which the respondent may be liable. The notice 
may be included in the notice instituting a formal enforcement 
proceeding or in a separate document.
    (e) In any proceeding in which civil penalties are sought, any 
decisions issued by the Department shall state the amount of any civil 
penalties assessed upon a finding of violation, and the time and manner 
in which payment shall be made to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 302.408  Answers and replies.

    (a) Within fifteen (15) days after the date of service of a notice 
issued pursuant to Sec. 302.407, the respondent shall file an answer to 
the complaint attached thereto or incorporated therein unless an answer 
has already been filed in accordance with Sec. 302.405. Any requests 
for extension of time for filing of an answer to such complaint shall be 
filed in accordance with Sec. 302.11.
    (b) All answers shall be served in accordance with Sec. 302.7 and 
shall fully and completely advise the parties and the

[[Page 309]]

Department as to the nature of the defense and shall admit or deny 
specifically and in detail each allegation of the complaint unless the 
respondent is without knowledge, in which case, his or her answer shall 
so state and the statement shall operate as a denial. Allegations of 
fact not denied or controverted shall be deemed admitted. Matters 
alleged as affirmative defenses shall be separately stated and numbered 
and shall, in the absence of a reply, be deemed to be controverted. Any 
answer to a complaint, or response to a notice, proposing the assessment 
of civil penalties shall specifically present any matters that the 
respondent intends to rely upon in opposition to, or in mitigation of, 
such civil penalties.
    (c) The DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may, in 
his or her discretion, require or permit the filing of a reply in 
appropriate cases; otherwise, no reply may be filed.


<R05>
Sec. 302.409  Default.

    Failure of a respondent to file and serve an answer within the time 
and in the manner prescribed by Sec. 302.408 shall be deemed to 
authorize the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge, as a matter 
of discretion, to find the facts alleged in the complaint incorporated 
in or accompanying the notice instituting a formal enforcement 
proceeding to be true and to enter such orders as may be appropriate 
without notice or hearing, or, as a matter of discretion, to proceed to 
take proof, without notice, of the allegations or charges set forth in 
the complaint or order; Provided, that the DOT decisionmaker or 
administrative law judge may permit late filing of an answer for good 
cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 302.410  Consolidation of proceedings.

    The DOT decisionmaker or Chief Administrative Law Judge may, upon 
his or her own initiative, or upon motion of any party, consolidate for 
hearing or for other purposes, or may contemporaneously consider, two or 
more enforcement proceedings that involve substantially the same parties 
or issues that are the same or closely related, if he or she finds that 
such consolidation or contemporaneous hearing will be conducive to the 
dispatch of business and to the ends of justice and will not unduly 
delay the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 302.411  Motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.

    (a) At any time after an answer has been filed, any party may file 
with the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge a motion to 
dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, including supporting 
affidavits. The procedure on such motions shall be in accordance with 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.), particularly Rules 
6(d), 7(b), 12, and 56, except that answers and supporting papers to a 
motion to dismiss or for summary judgment shall be filed within seven 
(7) days after service of the motion.
    (b) Parties may petition the DOT decisionmaker to review any action 
by the administrative law judge granting summary judgment or dismissing 
an enforcement proceeding under the procedure established for review of 
an initial decision in Sec. 302.32.


<R05>
Sec. 302.412  Admissions as to facts and documents.

    (a) At any time after an answer has been filed, any party may file 
with the DOT decisionmaker or administrative law judge and serve upon 
the opposing side a written request for the admission of the genuineness 
and authenticity of any relevant documents described in and exhibited 
with the request or for the admission of the truth of any relevant 
matters of fact stated in the request with respect to such documents.
    (b) Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be 
deemed admitted unless within a period designated in the request, not 
less than ten (10) days after service thereof, or within such further 
time as the DOT decisionmaker or the administrative law judge may allow 
upon motion and notice, the party to whom the request is directed serves 
upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically 
the matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in 
detail the reasons why he or she cannot truthfully either admit or deny 
such matters.

[[Page 310]]

    (c) Service of such request and answering statement shall be made as 
provided in Sec. 302.7. Any admission made by a party pursuant to such 
request is only for the purposes of the pending proceeding, or any 
proceeding or action instituted for the enforcement of any order entered 
therein, and shall not constitute an admission by him or her for any 
other purpose or be used against him or her in any other proceeding or 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 302.413  Evidence of previous violations.

    Evidence of previous violations by any person or of any provision of 
the Statute or any requirement thereunder found by the Department or a

relevant and material, be admitted in any enforcement proceeding 
involving such person.


<R05>
Sec. 302.414  Prehearing conference.

302.22.


<R05>
Sec. 302.415  Hearing.

    After the issues have been formulated, whether by the pleadings or 
otherwise, the administrative law judge shall give the parties 
reasonable written notice of the time and place of the hearings. Except

Sec. 302.17 to Sec. 302.38 governing the conduct of oral evidentiary 
hearings will apply.


<R05>
Sec. 302.416  Appearances by persons not parties.

    With consent of the administrative law judge, appearances may be 
entered without request for or grant of permission to intervene by 
interested persons who are not parties to the proceeding. Such persons 
may, with the consent of the administrative law judge, cross-examine a 
particular witness or suggest to any party or counsel therefor questions 
or interrogations to be asked witnesses called by any party, but may not 
otherwise examine witnesses and may not introduce evidence or otherwise 
participate in the proceeding. However, such persons may present to both 
the administrative law judge and the DOT decisionmaker an oral or 
written statement of their position on the issues involved in the 
proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 302.417  Settlement of proceedings.

    (a) The Deputy General Counsel and the respondent may agree to

administrative law judge for approval. The submission of a proposed 
settlement shall not automatically delay the proceeding.
    (b) Any party to the proceeding may submit written comments 
supporting or opposing the proposed settlement within ten (10) days from

otherwise shall disapprove it.
    (d) Information relating to settlement offers and negotiations will

determines that disclosure would interfere with the likelihood of 
settlement of an enforcement proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 302.418  Motions for immediate suspension of operating authority 
pendente lite.

    All motions for the suspension of the economic operating authority 
of an air carrier during the pendency of proceedings to revoke such

for oral argument on such motion.

[[Page 311]]


<R05>
Sec. 302.419  Modification or dissolution of enforcement actions.

    Whenever any party to a proceeding, in which an order of the 
Department has been issued pursuant to section 46101 of the Statute or 
an injunction or other form of enforcement action has been issued by a 
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to section 46106 of the 
Statute, believes that changed conditions of fact or law or the public 
interest require that said order or judicial action be modified or set 
aside, in whole or in part, such party may file with the Department a 
motion requesting that the Department take such administrative action or 
join in applying to the appropriate court for such judicial action, as 
the case may be. The motion shall state the changes desired and the 
changed circumstances warranting such action, and shall include the 
materials and argument in support thereof. The motion shall be served on 
each party to the proceeding in which the enforcement action was taken.

served may file an answer thereto. The Department shall dispose of the 
motion by such procedure as it deems appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 302.420  Saving clause.

    Repeal, revision or amendment of any of the economic regulatory 
provisions of the Statute or of the Department's rules, regulations,

proceeding or any enforcement proceeding initiated thereafter with 
respect to causes arising or acts committed prior to said repeal, 
revision or amendment, unless the act of repeal, revision or amendment 
specifically so provides.

    Subpart F_Rules Applicable to Proceedings Concerning Airport Fees


<R05>
Sec. 302.601  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart contains the specific rules that apply to a 
complaint filed by one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers 
(``carriers''), pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 47129(a), for a determination of 
the reasonableness of a fee increase or a newly established fee for 
aeronautical uses that is imposed upon the carrier by the owner or 
operator of an airport. This subpart also applies to requests by the 
owner or operator of an airport for such a determination. An airport 
owner or operator is considered to have imposed a fee on a carrier when 
it has taken all steps necessary under its procedures to establish the 
fee, whether or not the fee is being collected or carriers are currently 
required to pay it.
    (b) This subpart does not apply to--
    (1) A fee imposed pursuant to a written agreement with a carrier 
using the facilities of an airport;
    (2) A fee imposed pursuant to a financing agreement or covenant 
entered into prior to August 23, 1994, or
    (3) Any other existing fee not in dispute as of August 23, 1994.
    (c) Except as modified by this subpart, the provisions of subpart A 
of this part apply.


<R05>

an airport owner or operator.

    (a) Any carrier may file a complaint with the Secretary for a 
determination as to the reasonableness of any fee imposed on the carrier 
by the owner or operator of an airport. Any airport

[[Page 313]]

owner or operator may also request such a determination with respect to 
a fee it has imposed on one or more carriers. The complaint or request 
for determination shall conform to the requirements of this subpart and 
Sec. Sec. 302.3 and 302.4 concerning the form and filing of documents.
    (b) If a carrier has previously filed a complaint with respect to 
the same airport fee or fees, any complaint by another carrier and any 
airport request for determination shall be filed no later than seven (7) 
calendar days following the initial complaint. In addition, all 
complaints or requests for determination must be filed on or before the 
sixtieth (60th) day after the carrier receives written notice of the 
imposition of the new fee or the imposition of the increase in the fee.
    (c) To ensure an orderly disposition of the matter, all complaints 
and any request for determination filed with respect to the same airport 
fee or fees will be considered in a consolidated proceeding, as provided 
in Sec. 302.606.


<R05>
Sec. 302.603  Contents of complaint or request for determination.

    (a) The complaint or request for determination shall set forth the 
entire grounds for requesting a determination of the reasonableness of 
the airport fee. The complaint or request shall include a copy of the 
airport owner or operator's written notice to the carrier of the 
imposition of the fee, a statement of position with a brief, and all 
supporting testimony and exhibits on which the filing party intends to 
rely. In lieu of submitting duplicative exhibits or testimony, the 
filing party may incorporate by reference testimony and exhibits already 
filed in the same proceeding.
    (b) All exhibits and briefs prepared on electronic spreadsheet or 
word processing programs should be accompanied by standard-format 
computer diskettes containing those submissions. The disk submission 
must be in one of the following formats, in the latest two versions, or 
in such other format as may be specified by notice in the Federal 
Register: Microsoft Word (or RTF), Word Perfect, Ami Pro, Microsoft 
Excel, Lotus 123, Quattro Pro, or ASCII tab-delineated files. Parties 
should submit three copies of each diskette to Department of 
Transportation Dockets: one copy for the docket, one copy for the Office 
of Hearings, and one copy for the Office of Aviation Analysis. Filers 
should ensure that files on the diskettes are unalterably locked.
    (c) When a carrier files a complaint, it must also certify:
    (1) That it has served on the airport owner or operator and all 
other carriers serving the airport the complaint, brief, and all 
supporting testimony and exhibits, and that those parties have received 
or will receive these documents no later than the date the complaint is 
filed. Such service shall be by hand, by electronic transmission, or by 
overnight express delivery. (Unless a carrier has informed the 
complaining carrier that a different person should be served, service 
may be made on the person responsible for communicating with the airport 
on behalf of the carrier about airport fees.);
    (2) That the carrier has previously attempted to resolve the dispute 
directly with the airport owner or operator;
    (3) That when there is information on which the carrier intends to 
rely that is not included with the brief, exhibits, or testimony, the 
information has been omitted because the airport owner or operator has 
not made that information available to the carrier. The certification 
shall specify the date and form of the carrier's request for information 
from the airport owner or operator; and
    (4) That any submission on computer diskette is a true copy of the 
data file used to prepare the printed versions of the exhibits or 
briefs.
    (d) When an airport owner or operator files a request for 
determination, it must also certify:
    (1) That it has served on all carriers serving the airport the 
request, brief, and all supporting testimony and exhibits, and that 
those parties have received or will receive these documents no later 
than the date the request is filed. Such service shall be in the same 
manner as provided in Sec. 302.603(c)(1).

[[Page 314]]

    (2) That the airport owner or operator has previously attempted to 
resolve the dispute directly with the carriers; and
    (3) That any submission on computer diskette is a true copy of the 
data file used to prepare the printed versions of the exhibits or 
briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 302.604  Answers to a complaint or request for determination.

    (a)(1) When a carrier files a complaint under this subpart, the

determination of the reasonableness of a fee it has imposed, any carrier 
serving the airport may file an answer to the request.
    (b) The answer to a complaint or request for determination shall set 
forth the answering party's entire response. When one or more additional 
complaints or a request for determination has been filed pursuant to 
Sec. 302.602(b) with respect to the same airport's fee or fees, the 
answer shall set forth the answering party's entire response to all 
complaints and any such request for determination. The answer shall 
include a statement of position with a brief and any supporting 
testimony and exhibits on which the answering party intends to rely. In 
lieu of submitting duplicative exhibits or testimony, the answering 
party may incorporate by reference testimony and exhibits already filed 
in the same proceeding.
    (c) Answers to a complaint shall be filed no later than fourteen 
(14) calendar days after the filing date of the first complaint with 
respect to the fee or fees in dispute at a particular airport. Answers

    (a) Within thirty (30) days after a complaint or request for 
determination is filed under this subpart, the Secretary will determine 
whether the complaint or request meets the procedural requirements of 
this subpart and whether a significant dispute exists, and take 
appropriate action pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this 
section. When both a complaint and a request for determination have been 
filed with respect to the same airport fee or fees, the Secretary will

meet the procedural requirements of this subpart and whether a 
significant dispute exists within thirty (30) days after the complaint 
is filed.

    (3) Consolidate into a single proceeding all complaints and any 
request for determination with respect to the fee or fees in dispute; 
and
    (4) Include any special provisions for exchange or disclosure of 
information by the parties.
    (c) If the Secretary determines that the complaint or request does 
not meet the procedural requirements of this subpart, the complaint or 
request for determination will be dismissed without prejudice to filing 
a new complaint. The order of the Secretary will set forth the terms and 
conditions under which a revised complaint or request may be filed.
    (d) If the Secretary finds that no significant dispute exists--
    (1) If the proceeding was instituted by a complaint, the Secretary 
will issue an order dismissing the complaint, which will contain a 
concise explanation of the reasons for the determination that the 
dispute is not significant.
    (2) If the proceeding was instituted by a request for determination, 
the Secretary will either issue a final order as provided in Sec. 
302.610 or set forth the schedule for any additional procedures required 
to complete the proceeding.

302.32(b).


<R05>
Sec. 302.609  Completion of proceedings.

the fee is reasonable within 120 days after the complaint or request is 
filed.
    (b) When both a complaint and a request for determination have been 
filed with respect to the same airport fee or fees and have not been 
dismissed, the Secretary will issue a determination as to whether the 
fee is reasonable within 120 days after the complaint is filed.

[[Page 316]]


<R05>
Sec. 302.610  Final order.

    (a) When a complaint or request for determination stands submitted 
to the Secretary for final decision on the merits, he or she may dispose

<R04>
 Subpart G_Rules Applicable to Mail Rate Proceedings and Mail Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 302.701  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the special rules applicable to 
proceedings for the establishment of mail rates by the Department for 
foreign air transportation and air transportation between points in 
Alaska, and certain contractual arrangements between the U.S. Postal 
Service and certificated air carriers for the carriage of mail in 
foreign air transportation entered into pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 5402(a), 
84 Stat. 772.
    (b) Such contracts must be for the transportation of at least 750 
pounds of mail per flight, and no more than five (5) percent, based on 
weight, of the international mail transported under any such contract 
may consist of letter mail.

                       Final Mail Rate Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 302.702  Institution of proceedings.

    (a) Proceedings for the determination of rates of compensation for 
the transportation of mail may be commenced by the filing of a petition 
by an air carrier whose rate is to be fixed, or the U.S. Postal Service, 
or upon the issuance of an order by the DOT decisionmaker.
    (b) The petition shall set forth the rate or rates sought to be 
established, a statement that they are believed to be fair and 
reasonable, the reasons supporting the request for a change in rates, 
and a detailed economic justification sufficient to establish the 
reasonableness of the rate or rates proposed.
    (c) In any case where an air carrier is operating under a final mail 
rate uniformly applicable to an entire rate-making unit as established 
by the DOT decisionmaker, a petition must clearly and unequivocally 
challenge the rate for such entire rate-making unit and not only a part 
of such unit.
    (d) All petitions, amended petitions, and documents relating thereto 
shall be served upon the U.S. Postal Service by sending a copy to the 
Assistant General Counsel, Transportation Division, Washington, DC 
20260-1124, by registered or certified mail, postpaid, prior to the 
filing thereof with the Department. Proof of service on the U.S. Postal 
Service shall consist of a statement in the document that the person 
filing it has served a copy as required by this section.
    (e) Answers to petitions shall be filed within twenty (20) days 
after service of the petition.


<R05>
Sec. 302.703  Order to show cause or instituting a hearing.

    Whether the proceeding is commenced by the filing of a petition or 
upon the Department's own initiative, the DOT decisionmaker may issue an 
order directing the respondent to show cause why it should not adopt 
such findings and conclusions and such final rates as may be specified 
in the order to show cause, or may issue an order setting the matter for 
hearing before an administrative law judge.


<R05>
Sec. 302.704  Objections and answers to order to show cause.

    (a) Where an order to show cause is issued, any person having 
objections to the rates specified in such order shall file with the DOT 
decisionmaker an answer within forty-five (45) days after the date of 
service of such order or

[[Page 317]]

within such other period as the order may specify.
    (b) An answer to an order to show cause shall contain specific 
objections, and shall set forth the findings and conclusions, the rates, 
and the supporting exhibits that would be substituted for the 
corresponding items in the findings and conclusions of the show cause 
order, if such objections were found valid.
    (c) An answer filed by a person who is neither a party nor a person 
ultimately permitted to intervene in an oral evidentiary hearing if such 
proceeding is established shall be treated as a memorandum filed under 
Sec. 302.706.


<R05>
Sec. 302.705  Further procedures.

    (a) If no answer is filed within the designated time, or if a timely 
filed answer raises no material issue of fact, the DOT decisionmaker 
may, upon the basis of the record in the proceeding, enter a final order 
fixing the rate or rates.
    (b) If an answer raising a material issue of fact is filed within 
the time designated in the Department's order, the DOT decisionmaker may 
then issue an order authorizing additional pleadings and/or establishing 
further procedural steps, including setting the matter for oral 
evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.


<R05>
Sec. 302.706  Hearing.

    (a) If a hearing is ordered under Sec. 302.705, the issues at such 
hearing shall be formulated in accordance with the instituting order, 
except that at a prehearing conference, the administrative law judge may 
permit the parties to raise such additional issues as he or she deems 
necessary to make a full determination of a fair and reasonable rate.
    (b)(1) The parties to the proceeding shall be the air carrier or 
carriers for whom rates are to be fixed, the U.S. Postal Service, the 
Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and 
Proceedings and any other person whom the DOT decisionmaker or 
administrative law judge permits to intervene in accordance with Sec. 
302.20.
    (2) In addition to participation in hearings in accordance with 
Sec. 302.19, persons other than parties may, within the time fixed for 
filing an answer to an order to show cause as provided in Sec. 302.704, 
submit a memorandum of opposition to, or in support of, the position 
taken in the petition or order. Such memorandum shall not be received as 
evidence in the proceeding.
    (c) All direct evidence shall be in writing and shall be filed in 
exhibit form within the times specified by the DOT decisionmaker or by 
the administrative law judge.
    (d) Except as modified by this subpart, the provisions of Sec. 
302.17 through Sec. 302.38 of this part shall apply.

                      Provision for Temporary Rate


<R05>
Sec. 302.707  Procedure for fixing temporary mail rates.

    At any time during the pendency of a proceeding for the 
determination of final mail rates, the DOT decisionmaker, upon his or 
her own initiative, or on petition by the air carrier whose rates are in 
issue or by the U.S. Postal Service, may fix temporary rates of 
compensation for the transportation of mail subject to downward or 
upward adjustment upon the determination of final mail rates.

                 Informal Mail Rate Conference Procedure


<R05>
Sec. 302.708  Invocation of procedure.

    (a) Conferences between DOT employees, representatives of air 
carriers, the U.S. Postal Service and other interested persons may be 
called by DOT employees for the purpose of considering and clarifying 
issues and factual material in pending proceedings for the establishment 
of rates for the transportation of mail.
    (b) At the commencement of an informal mail rate conference pursuant 
to this section, the authorized DOT employees conducting such conference 
shall issue to each person present at such conference a written 
statement to the effect that such conference is being conducted pursuant 
to this section and stating the time of commencement of such conference; 
and at the termination of such conference the DOT employees conducting 
such conference shall note in writing on such statement

[[Page 318]]

the time of termination of such conference.


<R05>
Sec. 302.709  Scope of conferences.

    The mail rate conferences shall be limited to the discussion of, and 
possible agreement on, particular issues and related factual material in 
accordance with sound rate-making principles. The duties and powers of 
DOT employees in rate conferences essentially will not be different, 
therefore, from the duties and powers they have in the processing of 
rate cases not involving a rate conference. The employees' function in 
both instances is to present clearly to the DOT decisionmaker the issues 
and the related material facts, together with recommendations. The DOT 
decisionmaker will make an independent determination of the soundness of 
the employees's analyses and recommendations.


<R05>
Sec. 302.710  Participants in conferences.

    The persons entitled to be present in mail rate conferences will be 
the representatives of the carrier whose rates are in issue, the staff 
of the U.S. Postal Service, and the authorized DOT employees. No other 
person will attend unless the DOT employees deem his or her presence 
necessary in the interest of one or more purposes to be accomplished, 
and in such case his or her participation will be limited to such 
specific purposes. No person, however, shall have the duty to attend 
merely by reason of invitation by the authorized DOT employees.


<R05>
Sec. 302.711  Conditions upon participation.

    (a) Nondisclosure of information. As a condition to participation, 
every participant, during the period of the conference and for ninety 
(90) days after its termination, or until the Department takes public 
action with respect to the facts and issues covered in the conference, 
whichever is earlier:
    (1) Shall, except for necessary disclosures in the course of 
employment in connection with conference business, hold the information 
obtained in conference in absolute confidence and trust;
    (2) Shall not deal, directly or indirectly, for the account of 
himself or herself, his or her immediate family, members of his or her 
firm or company, or as a trustee, in securities of the air carrier 
involved in the rate conference except that under exceptional 
circumstances special permission may be obtained in advance from the DOT 
decisionmaker; and
    (3) Shall adopt effective controls for the confidential handling of 
such information and shall instruct personnel under his or her 
supervision, who by reason of their employment come into possession of 
information obtained at the conference, that such information is 
confidential and must not be disclosed to anyone except to the extent 
absolutely necessary in the course of employment, and must not be 
misused. (The term ``information'', as used in this section, shall refer 
only to information obtained at the conference regarding the future 
course of action or position of the Department or its employees with 
respect to the facts or issues discussed at the conference.)
    (b) Signed statement required. Every representative of an air 
carrier actually present at any conference shall sign a statement that 
he or she has read this entire instruction and promises to abide by it 
and advise any other participant to whom he or she discloses any 
confidential information of the restrictions imposed above. Every 
representative of the U.S. Postal Service actually present at any 
conference shall, on his or her own behalf, sign a statement to the same 
effect.
    (c) Presumption of having conference information. A director of any 
air carrier that has had a representative at the conference, who deals 
either directly or indirectly for himself or herself, his or her 
immediate family, members of his or her firm or company, or as a 
trustee, in securities of the air carrier involved in the conference, 
during the restricted period set forth above, shall be presumed to have 
come into possession of information obtained at the conference knowing 
that such information was subject to the restrictions imposed above; but 
such presumption can be rebutted.
    (d) Compliance report required. Within ten (10) days after the 
expiration of the time specified for keeping conference

[[Page 319]]

matters confidential, every participant, as defined in paragraph (e) of 
this section, shall file a verified compliance report with Department of 
Transportation Dockets stating that he or she has complied in every 
respect with the conditions of this section, or if he or she has not so 
complied, stating in detail in what respects he or she has failed to 
comply.
    (e) Persons subject to the provisions of this section. For the 
purposes of this section, participants shall include:
    (1) Any representative of any air carrier and any representative of 
the U.S. Postal Service actually present at the conference;
    (2) The directors and the officers of any air carrier that had a 
representative at the conference;
    (3) The members of any firm of attorneys or consultants that had a 
representative at the conference; and
    (4) The members of the U.S. Postal Service staff who come into 
possession of information obtained at the conference, knowing that such 
information is subject to the restrictions imposed in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 302.712  Information to be requested from an air carrier.

    When an air carrier is requested to submit detailed estimates as to 
traffic, revenues and expenses by appropriate periods and the investment 
that will be required to perform the operations for a future period, 
full and adequate support shall be presented for all estimates, 
particularly where such estimates deviate materially from the air 
carrier's experience. With respect to the rate for a past period, 
essentially the same procedure shall be followed. Other information or 
data likewise may be requested by the DOT employees. All data submitted 
by the air carrier shall be certified by a responsible officer.


<R05>
Sec. 302.713  DOT analysis of data for submission of answers thereto.

    After a careful analysis of these data, the DOT employees will, in 
most cases, send the air carrier a statement of exceptions showing areas 
of differences. Where practicable, the air carrier may submit an answer 
to these exceptions. Conferences will then be scheduled to resolve the 
issues and facts in accordance with sound ratemaking principles.


<R05>
Sec. 302.714  Availability of data to the U.S. Postal Service.

    The representatives of the U.S. Postal Service shall have access to 
all conference data and, insofar as practicable, shall be furnished 
copies of all pertinent data prepared by the DOT employees and the air 
carrier, and a reasonable time shall be allowed to review the facts and 
issues and to make any presentation deemed necessary; Provided, That in 
cases other than those involving an issue as to the service mail rates 
payable by the U.S. Postal Service pursuant to section 41901 of the 
Statute, representatives of the U.S. Postal Service shall be furnished 
with copies of data under this provision only upon their written 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 302.715  Post-conference procedure.

    No briefs, argument, or any formal steps will be entertained by the 
DOT decisionmaker after the rate conferences. The form, content and time 
of the staff's presentation to the DOT decisionmaker are entirely 
matters of internal procedure. Any party to the mail rate proceeding 
may, through an authorized DOT employee, request the opportunity to 
submit a written or oral statement to the DOT decisionmaker on any 
unresolved issue. The DOT decisionmaker will grant such requests 
whenever he or she deems such action desirable in the interest of 
further clarification and understanding of the issues. The granting of 
an opportunity for such further presentation shall not, however, impair 
the rights that any party might otherwise have under the Statute and 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 302.716  Effect of conference agreements.

    No agreements or understandings reached in rate conferences as to 
facts or issues shall in any respect be binding on the Department or any 
participant. Any party to mail rate proceedings will have the same 
rights to file an answer and take other procedural steps as though no 
rate conference had been held. The fact, however, that a rate conference 
was held

[[Page 320]]

and certain agreements or understandings may have been reached on 
certain facts and issues renders it proper to provide that, upon the 
filing of an answer by any party to the rate proceeding, all issues 
going to the establishment of a rate shall be open, except insofar as 
limited in prehearing conference in accordance with Sec. 302.22.


<R05>
Sec. 302.717  Waiver of participant conditions.

    After the termination of a mail rate conference hereunder, the air 
carrier whose rates were in issue may petition the DOT decisionmaker for 
a release from the obligations imposed upon it and all other persons by 
Sec. 302.711. The DOT decisionmaker will grant such petition only after 
a detailed and convincing showing is made in the petition and supporting 
exhibits and documents that there is no reasonable possibility that any 
of the abuses sought to be prevented will occur or that the Department's 
processes will in any way be prejudiced. There will be no hearing or 
oral argument on the petition and the DOT decisionmaker will grant or 
deny the request without being required to assign reasons therefor.

      Processing Contracts for the Carriage of Mail in Foreign Air

    Each contract filed pursuant to this subpart shall be accompanied by 
economic data and such other information in support of the contract upon 
which the filing air carrier intends that the Department rely, 
including, in cases where pertinent, estimates of the annual volume of 
contract mail (weight and ton-miles) under the proposed contract, the 
nature of such mail (letter mail, parcel post, third class, etc.), 
together with a statement as to the extent to which this traffic is new 
or diverted from existing classes of air and surface mail services and 
the priority assigned to this class of mail.


<R05>
Sec. 302.720  Service.

    A copy of each contract filed pursuant to Sec. 302.718, and a copy 
of all material and data filed pursuant to Sec. 302.719, shall be 
served upon each of the following persons:
    (a) Each certificated and commuter (as defined in Sec. 298.2 of 
this chapter) air carrier, other than the contracting carrier, that is 
actually providing scheduled mail services between any pair of points 
between which mail is to be transported pursuant to the contract; and

of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, a complaint with respect to the 
contract setting forth the basis for such complaint and all pertinent 
information in support of same. A copy of the complaint shall be served 
upon the air carrier filing the contract and upon each of the persons 
served with such contract pursuant to Sec. 302.720.


<R05>
Sec. 302.722  Answers to complaints.

    Answers to the complaint may be filed within ten (10) days of the 
filing of the complaint, with service being made as provided in Sec. 
302.720.

[[Page 321]]


<R05>
Sec. 302.723  Further procedures.

    (a) In any case where a complaint is filed, the DOT decisionmaker 
shall issue an order dismissing the complaint, disapproving the 
contract, or taking such other action as may be appropriate. Any such 
order shall be issued not later than ten (10) days prior to the 
effective date of the contract.
    (b) In cases where no complaint is filed, the DOT decisionmaker may 
issue a letter of notification to all persons upon whom the contract was 
served indicating that the Department does not intend to disapprove the 
contract.
    (c) Unless the DOT decisionmaker disapproves the contract not later 
than ten (10) days prior to its effective date, the contract 
automatically becomes effective.


<R05>
Sec. 302.724  Petitions for reconsideration.

    Except in the case of a Department determination to disapprove a 
contract, no petitions for reconsideration of any Department 
determination pursuant to this subpart shall be entertained.

Secretary may terminate or modify such immunity if the Assistant 
Secretary finds after notice and hearing that the previously conferred 
immunity is not consistent with the provisions of section 414. In any 
proceeding to review such immunity, the proponents of the immunity will

[[Page 331]]

have the burden of justifying the continuation of previously conferred 
immunity under the provisions of section 414.

shall include a description of the application, the docket number, date 
of filing, state that it may be reviewed in the Documentary Services 
Division, and indicate that interested parties may comment on the 
application or request a hearing within 21 days of the date of filling 
or other period as specified. The weekly list will normally be prepared 
on the following Monday, or as soon as possible, and will be posted on a 
public bulletin board in the Documentary Services Division. The list 
also shall be submitted for publication in the Federal Register.
    (b) In appropriate case, particularly when an application concerns a 
matter of broad public significance, the Assistant Secretary may cause a 
notice of an application and request for public comment to be published 
separately in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 303.42  Comments on application.

    (a) Unless a different comment period is specified in the weekly 
list, or in a notice of filing published in the Federal Register, any 
person may file comments, responses to the application, and/or a request 
for a hearing within 21 days of the filing of an application.
    (b) Comments supporting or opposing an application or proposing 
conditions and responses thereto shall state with particularity the 
factual basis on which the person commenting relies, and provide 
affidavits or other material in support of the factual basis, if 
appropriate.
    (c) Requests for a formal oral evidentiary hearing must set out with 
specificity the material issues of fact in dispute that cannot be 
resolved without such a hearing. Vague, unsupported allegations will not 
suffice.


<R05>
Sec. 303.43  Action following the comment period.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Section 412 applications. After the period for which comments, 
requests for a hearing or responses to an order

<R05>
Sec. 305.12  Motions to quash or modify an investigation subpena.

    Any person upon whom an investigation subpena is served may, within 
seven (7) days after such service or at any time prior to the return 
date thereof, whichever is earlier, file a motion to quash or modify 
such subpena with the administrative law judge who issued such subpena, 
or in the event the administrative law judge is not available, with the 
chief administrative law judge for action by himself or herself or by 
the DOT decisionmaker. Such motions shall be made in writing in 
conformity with Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Practice (part 302 of this 
subchapter); shall state with particularity the grounds therefor and the 
relief sought; shall be accompanied by the evidence relied upon and all 
such factual matter shall be verified in accordance with the provisions 
of Rule 4(b) of the aforesaid Rules of Practice. Written memoranda or 
briefs may be filed with the motions, stating the points and authorities 
relied upon. No oral argument will be heard on such motions unless the 
chief administrative law judge, the administrative law judge or the DOT 
decisionmaker directs otherwise. A subpena will be quashed or modified 
if the evidence whose production is required is not reasonably relevant 
to the matter under investigation, or the demand made does not describe 
with sufficient particularity the information sought, or the subpena is 
unlawful or unduly burdensome. The filing of a motion to quash or modify 
an investigation subpena shall stay the return date of such subpena 
until such motion is granted or denied. The DOT decisionmaker may at any 
time review, upon his or her own initiative, the ruling of an 
administrative law judge or the chief administrative law

[[Page 336]]

judge denying a motion to quash a subpena. In such cases, the DOT 
decisionmaker may order that the return date of a subpena which he or 
she has elected to review be stayed pending DOT action thereon.

    Source: Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, unless otherwise 
noted.


<R05>
Sec. 313.1  Purpose, scope, and authority.

    (a) Chapter 77 (Energy Conservation) of Title 42 (The Public Health 
and Welfare), authorizes and directs certain actions to conserve energy 
supplies through energy conservation programs and where necessary, the 
regulation of certain energy uses, and to provide for improved energy 
efficiency of motor vehicles, major appliances, and certain other 
consumer products. In furtherance of these purposes, 42 U.S.C. 6362 
requires several transportation regulatory agencies, including DOT, to 
submit a number of reports to the Congress with respect to energy 
conservation and efficiency, and where practicable and consistent with 
the exercise of DOT's authority under other law, to include in any major 
regulatory action a statement of its probable impact on energy 
efficiency and energy conservation. 42 U.S.C. 6362(b) directs DOT to 
define the term ``major regulatory action'' by rule.
    (b) Section 40113 of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States 
Code (Transportation)(``the Statute''), authorizes DOT to establish such 
rules, regulations, and procedures as are necessary to the exercise of 
its functions and are consistent with the purposes of the Statute.
    (c) The purpose of these regulations is to establish procedures and 
guidelines for the implementation of DOT's responsibility under 42 
U.S.C. 6362 to include in any major regulatory action taken by DOT a 
statement of the probable impact on energy efficiency and energy 
conservation.
    (d) These regulations apply to all proceedings before DOT, as 
provided herein.

[Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, 
43529, Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 313.2  Policy.

    (a) General. It is the policy of DOT to view the conservation of 
energy and the energy efficiency improvement goals of Chapter 77 of 
Title 42 as part of DOT's overall mandate, to be considered along with 
the several public interest and public convenience and necessity factors 
enumerated in section 40101 of the Statute. To the extent practicable 
and consistent with DOT's authority under the Statute and other law, 
energy conservation and efficiency are to be weighed in the 
decisionmaking process just as are DOT's traditional policies and 
missions.
    (b) Implementation. Implementation of this policy is through the 
integration of energy findings and conclusions into decisions, opinions, 
or orders in proceedings involving a major regulatory action, as defined 
in this part.
    (c) Proceedings in progress. The provisions of this part are 
intended primarily for prospective application. Proceedings in progress 
on the effective date of this part, in which an application has been 
docketed but no final decision made public, shall adhere to Sec. 
313.6(a) of this part, provided that the fair, efficient, and timely 
administration of DOT's regulatory activities is not compromised 
thereby. Nothing herein shall imply a requirement for new or additional 
hearings, a reopening of the record, or any other procedures which would 
tend to delay a timely decision in proceedings in progress.
    (d) Hearings. Public hearings will not normally be held for the 
purpose of implementing 42 U.S.C. 6362, particularly in connection with 
proposed actions

[[Page 337]]

which do not require notice and hearing as a prerequisite to decision 
under the Statute. Hearings may be ordered in exceptional circumstances 
where the proposed action is of great magnitude or widespread public 
interest and, in addition, presents complex issues peculiarly subject to 
resolution through evidentiary hearings and the process of cross-
examination.

[Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43528, 
43529, Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 313.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Energy efficiency means the ratio of the useful output of 
services in air transportation to the energy consumption of such 
services.
    (b) Energy statement is a statement of the probable impact of a 
major regulatory action on energy efficiency and energy conservation, 
contained in a decision, opinion, order, or rule.
    (c) Major regulatory action is any decision by the DOT decisionmaker 
or administrative law judge requiring an energy statement pursuant to 
Sec. 313.4 of this part.
    (d) NEPA means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
    (e) Statute means Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code 
(Transportation).

[Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43529, 
Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 313.4  Major regulatory actions.

    (a) Any initial, recommended, tentative or final decision, opinion, 
order, or final rule is a major regulatory action requiring an energy 
statement, if it:
    (1) May cause a near-term net annual change in aircraft fuel 
consumption of 10 million (10,000,000) gallons or more, compared to the 
probable consumption of fuel were the action not to be taken; or
    (2) Is specifically so designated by DOT because of its precedential 
value, substantial controversy with respect to energy conservation and 
efficiency, or other unusual circumstances.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the following 
types of actions shall not be deemed as major regulatory actions 
requiring an energy statement:
    (1) Tariff suspension orders under section 41509 of the Statute, 
emergency exemptions or temporary exemptions not exceeding 24 months 
under section 40109 of the Statute and other proceedings in which timely 
action is of the essence;
    (2) Orders instituting or declining to institute investigations or 
rulemaking, setting or declining to set applications for hearing, on 
reconsideration, or on requests for stay;
    (3) Other procedural or interlocutory orders;
    (4) Actions taken under delegated authority; and
    (5) Issuance of a certificate where no determination of public 
convenience and necessity is required.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, DOT may 
provide that an energy statement shall not be prepared in a proceeding 
which may result in a major regulatory action, if it finds that:
    (1) The inclusion of an energy statement is not consistent with the 
exercise of DOT's authority under the Statute or other law;
    (2) The inclusion of an energy statement is not practicable because 
of time constraints, lack of information, or other unusual 
circumstances; or
    (3) The action is taken under laws designed to protect the public 
health or safety.

[Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2425, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 43529, 
Aug. 22, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 313.5  Energy information.

    (a) It shall be the responsibility of applicants and other parties 
or participants to a proceeding which may involve a major regulatory 
action to submit sufficient information about the energy consumption and 
energy efficiency consequences of their proposals or positions in the 
proceeding to enable the administrative law judge or the DOT 
decisionmaker, as the case may be, to determine whether the proceeding 
will in fact involve a major regulatory action for purposes of this 
part, and if so, to consider the relevant energy factors in the decision 
and prepare the energy statement.

[[Page 338]]

    (b) In proceedings involving evidentiary hearings, the energy 
information shall be submitted at such hearings pursuant to DOT's usual 
procedural regulations and practices, under control of the 
administrative law judge or other hearing officer.
    (c) In proceedings not involving evidentiary hearings, the energy 
information shall be submitted at such time as other materials in 
justification of an application are submitted. Where an application 
itself is intended as justification for DOT action, the energy 
information shall be submitted with the application. In rulemakings not 
involving hearings, the energy information shall normally be submitted 
along with comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking, or as directed 
in any such notice or any advance notice.


<R05>
Sec. 313.6  Energy statements.

    (a) Each major regulatory action shall include, to the extent 
practicable, consideration of the probable impact of the action taken or 
to be taken upon energy efficiency and conservation. The administrative 
law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, shall normally 
make findings and conclusions about:
    (1) The net change in energy consumption;
    (2) The net change in energy efficiency; and
    (3) The balance struck between energy factors and other public 
interest and public convenience and necessity factors in the decision.
    (b) Energy findings and conclusions contained in any initial or 
recommended decision are a part of that decision and thus subject to 
discretionary review by DOT.
    (c) In the case of orders to show cause initiated by DOT, energy 
findings and conclusions may be omitted if adequate information is not 
available. In such instances, the energy statement shall be integrated 
into the final decision.


<R05>
Sec. 313.7  Integration with environmental procedures.

    (a) In proceedings in which an environmental impact statement or a 
finding of no significant impact is prepared by a responsible official 
pursuant to DOT's procedures implementing the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the energy information called for by this 
part may be included in that statement or declaration in order to yield 
a single, comprehensive document. In such instances, the DOT's NEPA 
procedures shall govern the submission of the energy information. 
However, it shall remain the responsibility of the administrative law 
judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, to make the findings 
and conclusions required by Sec. 313.6(a) of this part.
    (b) A determination that a major regulatory action within the 
meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6362 and this part may be involved in a proceeding 
is independent from any determination that the proceeding is a ``major 
Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human 
environment'' within the meaning of NEPA, and vice versa.

set forth in Sec. 314.21. The method by which DOT determines whether a 
carrier has undergone a major contraction is set forth in subpart C.


<R05>
Sec. 314.6  Qualifying dislocation.

    A qualifying dislocation is a bankruptcy or major contraction of a 
carrier, the major cause of which is the change in regulatory structure 
provided by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.

            Subpart B_Determination of Qualifying Dislocation


<R05>
Sec. 314.10  Beginning of proceeding.

    A proceeding to determine whether a bankruptcy or major contraction 
is a qualifying dislocation begins either with an application filed with 
the Department or an investigation on DOT's own initiative. Proceedings 
that begin with an application are governed by Sec. Sec. 314.11 through 
314.16. DOT-initiated proceedings are governed by Sec. Sec. 314.14 
through 314.16.


<R05>
Sec. 314.11  Applications.

    (a) Who may file. An application may be filed by an employee who has 
been deprived of employment or adversely affected with respect to 
compensation, or by a representative of one or more such employees.
    (b) Title and contents. Applications shall be titled ``Application 
for Determination of Qualifying Dislocation,'' and shall contain, with 
respect to at least one employee:
    (1) Name and address of the employee;
    (2) Number of years employed by carrier as of October 24, 1978;
    (3) Name and address of the applicant, if different from paragraph 
(b)(1);
    (4) Name of carrier-employer;
    (5) Position held by employee immediately before being deprived of 
employment or adversely affected with respect to compensation;
    (6) Date on which employee was deprived of employment or adversely 
affected with respect to compensation; and
    (7) An explanation of the applicant's basis for claiming that a 
qualifying dislocation has occurred, including all supporting evidence 
available to the applicant.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
3024-0053)


<R05>
Sec. 314.12  Answers.

    Any person may file an answer to an application within 15 days after 
the application is served.


<R05>
Sec. 314.13  Disposition of applications.

    (a) After the due date for answers, the Department will dismiss the 
application or begin an investigation to determine whether a qualifying 
dislocation has occurred.
    (b) The Department will dismiss an application if it does not name 
an employee who, on October 24, 1978, had been employed by a carrier for 
at least 4 years.
    (c) The Department will dismiss an application if the carrier has 
neither become bankrupt nor undergone a major contraction.
    (d) The Department will dismiss an application even though the 
carrier has become bankrupt or undergone a major contraction, if it 
finds that the bankruptcy or major contraction clearly did not have as 
its major cause the change in regulatory structure provided by the 
Airline Deregulation Act.
    (e) A DOT order dismissing an application will announce the reasons 
for the dismissal.


<R05>
Sec. 314.14  Show-cause order.

    When the Department makes a preliminary determination of whether the 
major cause of the bankruptcy or major contraction was the change in 
regulatory structure provided by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, 
it will issue an order announcing a tentative decision that a qualifying 
dislocation has, or has not, occurred. The order will direct all 
interested persons to show cause why the tentative decision should not 
be made final, and will allow 30 days for objections to be filed. The 
Department will publish a summary of the order in the Federal Register 
and serve a copy of the order on each of the following:
    (a) The applicant and the applicant's representative, if any;
    (b) The affected carrier;
    (c) The collective bargaining representatives of the carrier's 
employees; and
    (d) The Secretary of Labor;
    (e) State agencies that are acting as agents of the Secretary of 
Labor to administer the Employee Protection Program.

Sec. 314.15  Oral proceedings.

    The Department will provide for an oral evidentiary hearing, with 
notice published in the Federal Register and served on the persons 
listed in Sec. 314.14, if there are material issues of decisional fact 
that cannot otherwise be adequately resolved. The DOT decisionmaker may 
in his or her discretion hear oral argument before making a final 
determination.


<R05>
Sec. 314.16  Final determination.

    The Department will publish in the Federal Register a summary of an 
order announcing its final determination and, within 3 business days 
after the determination, serve a copy of the order on the persons listed 
in Sec. 314.14.


<R04>
                      Subpart C_Major Contractions


<R05>
Sec. 314.20  Regular monthly computation.

    (a) The Department will monitor the number of full-time employees of 
each carrier, including employees deprived of employment because of a 
strike, as reported monthly by carriers in accordance with part 241 of 
this chapter.
    (b) The DOT does not require monthly reporting of the number of 
positions that are vacant as a result of terminations for cause and, 
except as set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will not 
account for those positions in computing major contractions. In the 
cases set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the DOT 
presumes that the number of employment positions vacant as a result of 
terminations for cause is small enough that accounting for them would 
not change the result.
    (c) Each month, with respect to each carrier:
    (1) If the carrier's current reported full-time employment level is 
92 percent or less of any of the carrier's preceding 12 monthly levels, 
DOT will find

[[Page 341]]

that the carrier has undergone a major contraction.
    (2) If the current reported level is 93 percent or more of each of 
the carrier's preceding 12 monthly levels, the Department will not find 
that the carrier has undergone a major contraction.
    (3) If neither of the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(c)(2) of this section is present, the Department will ascertain by 
special report from the carrier, and add to the reported employment 
levels, the number of positions that were vacant in each of the relevant 
months as a result of terminations for cause. If the resulting figure 
for the current month is 92.5 percent or less of the resulting figure 
for any of the preceding 12 months, the Department will find that the 
carrier has undergone a major contraction. Otherwise, the Department 
will not make such a finding.


<R05>
Sec. 314.21  Advance determinations.

    (a) If circumstances indicate that a major contraction will occur, 
the Department may make an advance determination of a major contraction 
without waiting for the regular monthly computation set forth in Sec. 
314.20. The Department will consider whether to make an advance 
determination either on its own initiative or upon receipt of an 
application from an employee who has been deprived of employment or 
adversely affected with respect to compensation, or a representative of 
one or more such employees.
    (b) An application under this section shall be titled ``Application 
for Advance Determination of Major Contraction.'' It shall contain the 
information set forth in Sec. 314.11 (b)(1) through (b)(6) and an 
explanation of the applicant's basis for claiming that a major 
contraction will occur, including all supporting evidence available to 
the applicant. A person may consolidate an application under this 
section with an application under Sec. 314.11 for determination of a 
qualifying dislocation.
    (c) The Department will terminate an advance determination of major 
contraction whenever it finds that the predicted major contraction has 
not occurred or will not occur.


<R05>
Sec. 314.22  Notice of major contraction.

    Upon finding a major contraction under Sec. 314.20, or making or 
terminating an advance determination under Sec. 314.21, the Department 
will publish the finding in the Federal Register and send written notice 
of it to the persons listed in Sec. 314.14.

Sec. 323.3  Who shall file notices.

    (a) Terminations, suspensions, or reductions by certificated 
carriers. The notice described in Sec. 323.4(a) shall be filed by any 
certificated carrier that intends to:
    (1) Terminate or suspend all passenger air transportation that it is 
providing to any eligible place in the United States when that 
termination or suspension will leave no certificated carriers serving 
that place. Service shall be considered to be terminated or suspended 
whenever it is operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more 
intermediate stops, or in one direction only between the two places;
    (2) Reduce passenger air transportation so that any eligible place 
receives less than the level of essential air service determined by DOT;
    (3) Terminate or suspend all passenger air transportation that it is 
providing to any eligible place in the United States for which DOT has 
not issued an essential air service determination under either Sec. 
325.5 or Sec. 325.7 of this chapter, when that termination or 
suspension will leave only one certificated carrier serving that place. 
Service shall be considered to be terminated or suspended whenever it is 
operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more intermediate 
stops, or in one direction only between the two places;
    (4) Reduce passenger air transportation to any eligible place in 
Alaska for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air 
service so that the service between that place and every other place 
served by a certificated carrier is either:
    (i) Less than two round trip flights per week, or
    (ii) Less than the average weekly number of round trip flights 
actually provided during calendar year 1976, or
    (iii) Less than the number of flights specified under an agreement 
between DOT and the State of Alaska; or
    (5) Terminate, suspend, or reduce passenger air transportation at an 
eligible place for which DOT has issued, or is required to issue, an 
essential air service determination under section 41731 or section 41733 
of the Statute so that the total available seats of all the carriers 
linking that place to FAA-designated hubs will be reduced by 33 percent 
or more during a 90-day period. Service to a hub shall be considered to 
be terminated or suspended whenever it is operated less than 5 days per 
week, with three or more intermediate stops, or in one direction only 
between two places.

[[Page 343]]

    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Uncertificated carriers. The notice described in Sec. 323.4(a)

the level of essential air service determined by the DOT;
    (2) Passenger air transportation to any eligible place for which DOT 
has not determined the level of essential air service, other than a 
place in Alaska, so that there is no FAA-designated hub from which the 
place receives at least two round trip flights per day, 5 days per week; 
or
    (3) Passenger air transportation to any eligible place in Alaska, 
for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air service, so 
that the service between that place and every other place served by a 
certificated carrier is either:
    (i) Less than two round trip flights per week, or
    (ii) Less than the average number of weekly round trip flights 
actually provided during calendar year 1976, or
    (iii) Less than the number of flights specified under an agreement 
between DOT and the State of Alaska.
    (d) For the purpose of this section, in ascertaining the level of 
air transportation being provided to a place or between two places, air 
transportation that has been the subject of a notice filed under this 
section shall be considered not in operation for the duration of the 
notice period.
    (e) If a certificated carrier was, before October 24, 1978, granted 
authority to suspend air transportation, and that authority ends on a 
stated date, the carrier shall comply with the requirements of this part 
before continuing the suspension beyond that date.
    (f) If a certificated carrier was, before October 24, 1978, granted 
authority to terminate or suspend air transportation, but has not 
suspended service, the carrier shall comply with the requirements of 
this part before terminating or suspending service.

with the type of equipment last regularly used to serve the place.
    (b) In the case of an interruption of service caused by a strike, 
the carrier shall give immediate notice of the interruption to DOT. 
Suspension authority under this section due to a strike shall expire 90 
days after employees return to work.
    (c) If service to a place is interrupted for more than 3 consecutive 
days for reasons beyond the carrier's control other than a strike, the 
holder shall give notice to DOT within 3 days following the date of 
first interruption, setting forth the date of first interruption and a 
full statement of the reasons for the interruption.
    (d) The notice required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section

    Each air carrier filing a notice under Sec. 323.3 (a)(2), (a)(4), 
(a)(5), or (c) shall continue to list the affected flights in all 
generally-distributed schedule publications in which the flight was 
listed before the notice. The listings shall continue until DOT permits 
the flights to be discontinued. The listings may include a notice 
stating that the flights are ``to be discontinued as of (date) subject 
to government approval.''


<R05>
Sec. 323.17  Delays in discontinuing service.

    If transportation that is the subject of a notice under this part is

    As a condition on the exemption, an air carrier operating under 
exemption authority in an international market which is the subject of a 
carrier selection proceeding shall file a notice with the Department at 
least ninety days

[[Page 347]]

before it terminates service in that market. Once such a notice has been 
filed, the carrier may not terminate service in that market during the 
notice period unless the air carrier chosen in the selection proceeding 
enters the market and the Department grants the operating carrier 
permission to do so. The Department may allow earlier termination for 
good cause when in the public interest.

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 325.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish procedures to be followed 
in designating eligible points and in determining essential air 
transportation levels for eligible points, and in the appeals and 
periodic reviews of these determinations, under section 419 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 325.2  Applicability.

    This part applies to essential air service determinations for 
communities designated as eligible under section 419(a) of the Act and 
to eligible point designations and essential air service determinations 
for communities that qualify under section 419(b) of the Act. It applies 
to the gathering of data by the Department, and to the participation of 
State, local, and other officials and other interested persons in the 
designation and determination processes.
    Note: Criteria for designating eligible points under section 419(b) 
are contained in part 270 of this chapter. Guidelines for deciding 
essential air service levels are contained in part 398 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 325.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part, eligible point means:
    (a) Any point in the United States, the District of Columbia, and 
the several territories and possessions of the United States to which 
any direct air carrier was authorized, under a certificate issued by CAB 
under section 401 of the Act, to provide air service on October 24, 
1978, whether or not such service was actually provided;
    (b) Any point in the United States and the several territories and 
possessions of the United States that was deleted from a section 401 
certificate between July 1, 1968 and October 24, 1978, inclusive, and 
that has been designated as an eligible point under the Act; or
    (c) Any other point in Alaska or Hawaii that has been designated as 
an eligible point under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 325.4  State and local participation.

    (a) DOT, on a periodic basis, will send a questionnaire to each 
eligible point that is served by not more than one certificated air 
carrier, or is designated as an eligible point under section 419(b) of 
the Act, or for which DOT is reviewing its essential air service needs. 
The questionnaire will be addressed to:
    (1) The chief executive of the principal city, or other unit of 
local government at the affected point, that is named or has been 
previously named in a qualifying section 401 certificate. For points in 
Alaska or Hawaii that are named DOT as eligible points without having 
been listed on a section 401 certificate, the principal city is the most 
populous municipality at the point;
    (2) The individual or entity with direct supervision over and 
responsibility for the airport at the eligible point; and
    (3) The State agency with jurisdiction over air transportation in 
the State containing the eligible point. If there is no such State 
agency, the

[[Page 348]]

questionnaire will be sent to the governor of that State.
    (b) Within 60 days after receipt of the questionnaire, five copies 
of the response shall be filed in the Documentary Services Division, 
unless the Department specifies another date. If no response is received 
within the period, essential air service for that eligible point may 
temporarily be set at the minimum level prescribed in section 419(f) of 
the Act.
    (c) Any other interested person may, during the 60-day response 
period, submit information relevant to the essential air service level 
of that eligible point by filing in the Documentary Services Division, 
five copies of a document titled with the name of the point involved.
    (d) As necessary, the DOT may request additional information to 
supplement the questionnaire.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
3024-0037)


<R05>
Sec. 325.5  Determinations and designations.

    (a) Not later than October 24, 1979, after reviewing all information 
submitted, CAB issued determinations of the essential level of air 
service for eligible points that, on October 24, 1978, were served by 
not more than one direct air carrier holding a certificate under section 
401 of the Act for scheduled service to the point.
    (b) DOT will issue a determination of the essential level of air 
service for a point within 6 months after each of the following events:
    (1) A notice is received that service to an eligible point will be 
reduced to only one carrier that holds a section 401 certificate;
    (2) A point is designated as an eligible point under section 419(b) 
of the Act and either paragraph (c) of this section, paragraph (d) of 
this section, or Sec. 325.7(e); or
    (3) A review was conducted of essential air service of that point 
under Sec. 325.6.
    (c) Not later than January 1, 1982, CAB designated the communities 
described in Sec. 270.2(a) and (b) as eligible points or as ineligible.
    (d) After January 1, 1982, DOT may designate communities in Alaska 
or Hawaii as eligible points if they apply for such designation.


<R05>
Sec. 325.6  Periodic reviews.

    (a) The Department will start a periodic review of essential air 
service within 1 year of the date of the previous determination of 
essential air service for eligible points receiving subsidized service, 
within 2 years of the date of the previous determination for eligible 
points in Alaska, and within 3 years of the date of the previous 
determination for eligible points without subsidized air service.
    (b) The review shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures 
in Sec. Sec. 325.4, 325.5 and 325.7.
    (c) The Department may review the designation under section 419(b) 
of a community as an eligible point to determine whether that point 
continues to meet the criteria in part 270 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 325.7-325.9  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 325.10  Modification of the designated level of essential air 
service.

    (a) Any person may file with DOT a petition titled ``Petition for 
Modification of Essential Air Service Level,'' asking to modify the 
essential air service level at a point.
    (b) The petition shall identify the point affected, and specifically 
state the reasons why the petitioner believes the designated essential 
level is inadequate. It should contain any facts and arguments that 
support its requests, and describe the level of essential air service 
that should be substituted.
    (c) Any person may, within 30 days after the filing of a petition 
for modification, file an answer to that petition titled ``Answer to 
Petition for Modification.''
    (d) After review, the Department may seek more information and the 
procedures of Sec. Sec. 325.5 and 325.7 will be followed.

    (b) If at any time we determine that a carrier has been compensated 
in an amount that exceeds the amount to which it is entitled under 
section 103(b) of the Act or the subpart C set-aside program, the 
Department will notify the carrier of the basis for the determination, 
the amount that must be repaid, and the procedures to follow for making 
a repayment. We will follow collection procedures under the Federal 
Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq,) to the extent 
required by law, in recovering such overpayments. This process will also 
apply to collection of overpayments by the Department as a result of an

be tied only to the airline portion of their businesses and must exclude 
non-air transportation related expenses.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Air carriers that operate both passenger/combination aircraft 
and all-cargo aircraft and routinely report to the Department ASMs and 
RTMs separately for both types of flights must submit two versions of 
Form 330 (Final) in Appendix A to this part to seek compensation on both 
an ASM and RTM basis. Financial and operational data (both actual and 
forecasted) must be disaggregated and correlate exclusively to one or 
the other type of operation.
    (d) You must include the following financial information on Form 330 
(Final) for the period September 11, 2001 through December 31, 2001:
    (1) Your pre-September 11, 2001, profit/loss forecast for the period 
beginning September 11, 2001, and ending December 31, 2001. This 
forecast must reflect seasonal reductions in capacity and the cost 
savings associated with such reductions. Documentation verifying that 
the pre-September 11, 2001, forecast was, in fact, completed before that 
date must also be submitted with your application.
    (2) Your actual results for that same period reflecting any losses 
that were a direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001. These actual results must incorporate all cost reductions 
associated with capacity reductions and furloughs you made due to the 
reduced demand for air service after the September 11th attacks (e.g., 
employee pay adjustments and furloughs, changes in aircraft fleet in 
service, schedule and capacity changes, etc.).
    (3) The difference between your forecast profits/losses and actual 
results for that period (i.e., the difference between the figures in 
paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section).
    (4) The actual losses you report must be net losses, before taxes, 
taking into

[[Page 352]]

account savings from such items as reductions in passenger and cargo 
handling costs, fuel consumption, landing fees, revenue/traffic-related 
expenses (e.g., commissions, food and beverage, booking fees, credit 
card fees), and savings of other costs due to the ground stop and 
subsequent schedule/capacity/staff reductions (including savings from 
layoffs of employees, adjusted for severance payments), as well as 
proceeds from business recovery insurance or other insurance payments. 
You must not report as losses insurance premium increases that have been 
or will be compensated by the Government under the Act, or other losses 
that have been or will be compensated by other subsidies or assistance 
provided by Federal, state, or local governments.

Sec. 330.29  What information must air taxi operators submit on Form 
330 (Final) and Form 330-C?

    As an air taxi operator, you must complete Form 330 (Final) in 
accordance with the requirements in Sec. 330.27. You must also complete 
pages 2, 5, and 6 (certifying pages 2 and 5) of Form 330-C as shown in 
Appendix C to this part. Explanatory notes are included on that Form.


<R05>
Sec. 330.31  What data must air carriers submit concerning ASMs or RTMs?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if you are 
applying for compensation as a passenger or combination passenger/cargo 
carrier, you must have submitted your August 2001 total completed ASM 
report to the Department for your system-wide air service (e.g., 
scheduled, non-scheduled, foreign, and domestic).
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if you are 
applying for compensation as an all-cargo carrier, you must have 
submitted your RTM reports to the Department for the second calendar 
quarter of 2001.
    (c) In calculating and submitting ASMs and RTMs under paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, there are certain things you must not do:
    (1) Except at the direction of the Department, or to correct an 
error that you document to the Department, you must not alter the ASM or 
RTM reports you earlier submitted to the Department. Your ASMs or RTMs 
for purposes of this part are as you have reported them to the 
Department according to existing standards, requirements, and 
methodologies established by the Office of Airline Information (Bureau 
of Transportation Statistics).
    (2) You must not include ASMs or RTMs resulting from operations by 
your code-sharing or alliance partners.
    (d) If you have not previously reported ASMs or RTMs as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for a given operation or 
operations, you may submit your calculation of ASMs or RTMs to the 
Department with your application. You must certify the accuracy of this 
calculation and submit with your application the data and assumptions on 
which the calculation is based. After reviewing your submission, the 
Department may modify or reject your calculation.
    (1) If you are a direct air carrier that has operated your aircraft 
for a lessee (i.e., a wet lease, or aircraft, crew, maintenance, and 
insurance (ACMI) operation), you may submit your calculation of ASMs or 
RTMs for these flights. Your submission must include the following 
elements:
    (i) Documentation that you otherwise qualify as an air carrier;
    (ii) Documentation that you are a wet lessor, and an explanation of

<R05>
Sec. 330.33  Must carriers certify the truth and accuracy of data 
they submit?

    Yes, with respect to all information submitted or retained under 
Sec. Sec. 330.27-330.31 and 330.35, your Chief Executive Officer (CEO), 
Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or Chief Operating Officer (COO) or, if 
those titles are not used, the equivalent officer, must certify that the 
submitted information was prepared under his or her supervision and is 
true and accurate, under penalty of law.


<R05>
Sec. 330.35  What records must carriers retain?

    As an air carrier that applies for compensation under this part, you 
must retain records as follows:
    (a) You must retain all books, records, and other source and summary 
documentation supporting your claims for compensation of direct and 
incremental losses pursuant to Sections 101, 103, and 106 of the Act. 
This requirement includes, but is not limited to, the following:
    (1) You must retain supporting evidence and documentation 
demonstrating the validity of the data you provide under Sec. Sec. 
330.27-330.31.
    (2) You must retain documentation verifying that your pre-September 
11, 2001, forecast was the most recent forecast available to that date.
    (3) You must also retain documentation outlining the assumptions 
made for all forecasts and the source of the data and other inputs used 
in making the forecasts.
    (4) You must agree to have your independent public accountant retain 
all reports, working papers, and supporting documentation pertaining to 
the agreed-upon procedures engagement conducted by your independent 
public accountant under the requirements of this part for a period of 
five years. The accountant must make this information available for 
audit and examination by representatives of the Department of 
Transportation (including the Office of the Inspector General), the 
Comptroller General of the United States, or other Federal agencies.
    (b) You must preserve and maintain this documentation in a manner 
that readily permits its audit and examination by representatives of the

agencies.
    (c) You must retain this documentation for five years.
    (d) You must make all requested data available within one week from 
a request by the Department of Transportation (including the Office of 
the Inspector General), the Comptroller General of the United States, or 
other Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 330.37  Are carriers which participate in this program subject to 
audit?

    (a) All payments you receive from the Department of Transportation 
under this program are subject to audit. All information you submit with 
your applications and all records and documentation that you retain are 
also subject to audit.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, before you 
are eligible to receive payment from the final installment of 
compensation under the Act, there must be an independent public 
accountant's report based on the performance of procedures agreed upon 
by the Department of Transportation with respect to the carrier's 
forecasts and actual results. The independent public accountant's 
engagement must be performed in accordance with generally accepted 
professional standards applicable to agreed-upon procedures engagements. 
You must submit the results of the agreed-upon procedures engagement to 
the Department with your application for payment of the final 
installment.
    (c) The following are the core requirements for the independent 
public accountant's review:
    (1) Determine that the earnings forecast presented to the Department 
was inclusive of the entity's full operations

[[Page 354]]

as an air carrier and was the most current forecast prepared prior to 
September 11, 2001;
    (2) Determine that, if forecasts presented to the Department for 
prior periods had material variances from actual results, the carrier 
provided explanations to account for such variances;
    (3) Determine that the methodology for allocating revenue and 
expenses to the periods September 1-10 and September 11-30, from the 
forecasted and actual September results, was in accordance with air 
carrier records and analyses;
    (4) Determine that the actual expenses and revenues presented to the 
Department are in accordance with the official accounting records of the 
carrier or the financial statements included in the carrier's Securities 
and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q (for availability, see 17 CFR 249.0-
1(b)), and consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(GAAP), except to the extent that GAAP would require or allow treatment 
that would be inconsistent with the Act or this part;
    (5) Verify that the carrier provided explanations supporting the 
allocation methodology used if the forecasted and/or actual results for 
the September 11--30 period was different from allocating 66.7 percent 
of the total amounts for September;
    (6) Determine that the carrier provided full explanations for all 
material differences between forecast and actual results for the 
September 11--30, 2001 period and the October 1--December 31, 2001 
period;
    (7) Determine that the amounts included in management's explanations 
for such material differences were in accordance with the carrier's 
analysis of such fluctuations, and the amounts and explanations were 
traceable to supporting general ledger accounting records or analyses 
prepared by the carrier;
    (8) Determine that the amounts presented to the Department in Form 
330 (Final), pages 2-3, in appendix A to this part that the carrier 
identified as adjustments to the difference between the pre-September 11 
forecast and actual results for the period September 11 through December 
31, 2001, were in accordance with the official accounting records of the 
carrier or the financial statements included in the carrier's Securities 
and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q, and consistent with GAAP, except to 
the extent that GAAP would require or allow treatment that would be 
inconsistent with the Act or this part;
    (9) Determine that the insurance recoveries and government payments 
reported by the air carrier and offsetting income were in accordance 
with the air carrier's general ledger accounting records;
    (10) Determine that the information presented in the air carrier's 
Supplemental Certification were in accordance with the air carrier's 
general ledger accounting records;
    (11) Include in the auditor's report full documentation for each 
exception taken by the auditor; and
    (12) Identify air carrier reports and records utilized in performing 
the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (11) of this section.
    (d) If you are a carrier that reported fewer than 10 million ASMs 
for the month of August 2001 or fewer than two million RTMs for the 
quarter ending June 30, 2001, you are not required to report to the 
Department on the basis of an agreed-upon procedures engagement by an 
independent public accountant. Instead, you may report on the basis of 
simplified procedures approved by the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 330.39  What are examples of types of losses that the Department 
does not allow?

    (a)(1) The Department generally does not allow air carriers to 
include in their calculations aircraft impairment charges, charges or 
expenses attributable to lease buyouts, or other losses that are not 
actually and fully realized in the period between September 11, 2001 and 
December 31, 2001.
    (2) The Department will consider requests to accept adjustments for 
extraordinary or non-recurring expenses or revenues on a case-by-case 
basis. If, as a carrier, you make such a request, you must demonstrate 
the following to the satisfaction of the Department:
    (i) That the expense or revenue was (or was not, as appropriate) the 
direct

[[Page 355]]

result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001;
    (ii) That the revenue or expense was reported in accordance with 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), except to the extent 
that the GAAP would require or allow treatment that would be 
inconsistent with the Act or this part;
    (iii) That an expense was fully borne within the September 11--
December 31, 2001, period and is permanent; and
    (iv) That the resulting additional compensation would not be 
duplicative of other allowances for compensation.
    (b) The Department generally does not accept claims by air carriers 
that cost savings should be excluded from the calculation of incurred 
losses. Consequently, the Department will generally not allow such 
claims to be used in a way that has the effect of increasing the 
compensation for which an air carrier is eligible.


<R04>
                Subpart C_Set-Aside for Certain Carriers


<R05>
Sec. 330.41  What funds is the Department setting aside for eligible 
classes of air carriers?

    The Department is setting aside a sum of up to $35 million to 
compensate eligible classes of air carriers, for which application of a 
distribution formula containing ASMs as a factor, as set forth in 
section 103(b)(2) of the Act, would inadequately reflect their share of 
direct and incremental losses.


<R05>
Sec. 330.43  What classes of air carriers are eligible under the 
set-aside?

    There are two classes of eligible air carriers:
    (a) You are a Class I air carrier if you are an air taxi, regional, 
commuter or indirect air carrier and you reported 75,000 or fewer ASMs 
to the Department for the month of August, 2001.
    (b) You are a Class II air carrier if you are an air taxi, regional, 
commuter or indirect air carrier and you reported between 75,001 and 10 
million ASMs to the Department for the month of August 2001.

[Docket No. OST-2001-10885, 67 FR 54066, Aug. 20, 2002, as amended at 68 
FR 44458, July 29, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 330.45  What is the basis on which air carriers will be compensated 
under the set-aside?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, as an air 
carrier eligible for compensation through the set-aside, you will be 
compensated for an amount calculated as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b)(1) As a Class I carrier, your compensation will be calculated 
using a fixed ASM rate equivalent to the mean losses per ASM for all 
Class I carriers applying for compensation.
    (2) As a Class II carrier, your compensation will be calculated 
using a graduated ASM rate equivalent to--
    (i) The mean loss per ASM for all Class I carriers applying for 
compensation, for each of the first 75,000 ASMs reported; and
    (ii) The mean remaining loss per ASM for all Class II carriers 
applying for compensation for each ASM in excess of 75,000.
    (3) For purposes of this paragraph (b), ASMs are those verified by 
the Department for August 2001.
    (4) Any compensation payments previously made to air carriers 
eligible for the set-aside will be deducted from the amount calculated 
as the carrier's total compensation under the set-aside formula.
    (c) If you are an air carrier whose compensation is calculated using 
an ASM rate as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, your 
compensation will not be less than an amount equivalent to 25 percent of 
the direct and incremental transportation-related losses you have 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department were incurred as a 
direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Your 
compensation will not be more than an amount equivalent to the mean 
percentage of compensation for losses received by passenger and 
combination air carriers that are not eligible for the set-aside funds, 
unless you would have been compensated for more than that percentage of 
losses under the formula set forth in section 103(b)(2) of the Act, in 
which case you will be compensated under that formula.

    (a) Before selling or offering to sell, soliciting or advertising 
any charter flight, a charter operator shall comply with one of the 
three following requirements:
    (1) The charter operator shall furnish a surety bond in an amount 
not less than the maximum fare held out for charter flights proposed to 
be operated during each calendar month multiplied by 90 percent of the 
number of available seats on such flights: Provided, however, That the 
liability of the surety to any charter participant shall not exceed the

bond and amended list of proposed flights shall be filed with the 
Department within 10 days of the date that the charter operator adds 
flights or cancels flights previously proposed, but in no event later 
than 2 days prior to the operation of any such additional charter 
flights; or
    (2) The charter operator shall:
    (i) Furnish and file with the Department a surety bond in the amount 
of $100,000 for the protection of the charter participants: Provided,

shall not exceed the charter operator's applicable tariff fare; and
    (ii) Enter into an agreement with a bank, the terms of which shall 
include the following:
    (a) Each participant shall pay for his deposit and subsequent 
payments comprising the charter participant's tariff fare only by check

makes a cash deposit, the charter operator who receives such cash 
deposit shall forthwith remit to the designated bank a check for the 
full amount of the deposit;
    (b) The bank shall not pay the air carrier or foreign air carrier 
the charter price for the transportation earlier

[[Page 372]]

than 60 days (including day of departure) prior to the scheduled day of

the departure date and price by the charter operator;
    (c) The bank shall reimburse the charter operator for refunds made 
by the latter to the participants upon written notification from the 
charter operator;
    (d) If the charter operator notifies the bank that a flight has been 
canceled, the bank shall make the applicable refunds directly to the 
participants;
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(c) of this section, 
the bank shall not pay any funds from the account to the charter 
operator prior to 2 banking days after completion of each flight when 
the balance in the account shall be paid to the charter operator upon 
certification of the completion date by the charter operator and direct 
air carrier;
    (f) Notwithstanding any provisions above, the amount of total cash 
deposits required to be maintained in the depository account of the bank 
may be reduced by one or both of the following: The amount of surety

made payable to the escrow account: Provided, That such other securities 
shall be substituted in an amount no greater than 80 percent of the 
total market value of the escrow account at the time of such 
substitution: And provided, further, That should the market value of 
such other securities subsequently decrease, from time to time, then 
additional cash or securities qualified for investment hereunder shall 
promptly be added to the escrow account, in an amount equal to the 
amount of such decreased value; or
    (3) The charter operator shall:
    (i) Furnish and file with the Department a surety bond in the amount 
of $100,000 for the protection of the charter participants: Provided, 
however, That the liability of the surety to any charter participant 
shall not exceed the charter operator's applicable tariff fare; and
    (ii) Enter into an agreement with a bank, the terms of which shall 
include the following:
    (a) Whenever the gross amount of customers' deposits exceeds 25 
percent of the charter operator's net worth, as computed under generally 
accepted accounting principles, the charter operator shall, on or before 
the 30th day of the succeeding month, place in escrow or in trust with 
the bank cash in an amount at least equal to the amount by which such 
deposits exceed 25 percent of its net worth: Provided, That negotiable 
securities may be substituted for cash, but the market value thereof 
shall at all times be not less than the amount of cash for which they 
are substituted;
    (b) The escrow agreement or the trust agreement between the bank and 
the operator shall not be effective until approved by the Department. 
Claims against the escrow or trust may be made only with respect to the 
nonperformance of air transportation.
    (b) As used in this section, the term bank means a bank insured by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
    (c) Any bond furnished under this section shall insure the financial 
responsibility of the charter operator and the supplying of the air 
transportation in accordance with the contract between the charter 
operator and the charter participants, and shall be in the form set 
forth as appendix A to this part. Such bond shall be issued by a bonding 
or surety company (1) whose surety bonds are accepted by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission under 49 CFR 1084.6; or (2) which is listed in 
Best's Insurance Reports (fire and casualty) with a general 
policyholders' rating of ``A'' or better. The bonding or surety company 
shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State 
in which the charter originates or in which the charter operator is 
incorporated. For purposes of this

[[Page 373]]

section, the term ``State'' includes any territory or possession of the 
United States, or the District of Columbia. The bond shall be 
specifically identified by the issuing surety with a company bond 
numbering system so that the Department may identify the bond with the 
specific charter or charters to which it relates: Provided, however, 
That these data may be set forth in an addendum attached to the bond 
which addendum must be signed by the charter operator and the surety 
company. It shall be effective on or before the date the operating 
authorization becomes effective. If the bond does not comply with the 
requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to provide 
satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the Department will 
notify the direct air carrier and the charter operator, by registered or 
certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond. Unless such 
deficiencies are corrected within the time set forth in such 
notification, the subject charters shall in no event be operated.
    (d) Any bond furnished under this section shall provide that unless 
the charter participant files a claim with the charter operator, or, if 
he is unavailable, with the surety, within sixty (60) days after 
termination of the charter, the surety shall be released from all 
liability under the bond to such charter participant. The contract 
between the charter operator and the charter participants shall contain 
notice of this provision.

Surety Bond Under Part 372 of the Special Regulations of the Department

    Know all men by these presents, that we ---------------- (name of 
charter operator) of ---------------- (address) as Principal hereinafter 
called ``Principal''), and ---------------- (name of surety) a 
corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of --------
-------- (State) as Surety (hereinafter called ``Surety'') are held and 
firmly bound unto the United States of America in the sum of ----------

and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, 
administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally firmly by 
these presents.
    Whereas Principal is an overseas military personnel charter operator 
pursuant to the provisions of Part 372 of the Department's

[[Page 376]]

Special Regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department 
relating to security for the protection of charter participants, and has 
elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as 
will insure financial responsibility with respect to all monies received 
from charter participants for services in connection with overseas 
military personnel charters to be operated subject to Part 372 of the 
Department's Special Regulations in accordance with contracts, 
agreements, or arrangements therefor, and
    Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by Principal as an 
authorized charter operator with Part 372 of the Department's Special 
Regulations, and other rules and regulations of the Department relating 
to security for the protection of charter participants, and shall inure 
to the benefit of any and all charter participants to whom Principal may 
be held legally liable for any damages herein described.
    Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if 
Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to charter participants any sum 
or sums for which Principal may be held legally liable by reason of 
Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill and carry out all 
contracts, agreements, and arrangements made by Principal while this 
bond is in effect with respect to the receipt of moneys from charter 
participants, and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to and in 
accordance with the provisions of Part 372 of the Department's Special 
Regulations, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in 
full force and effect.
    The liability of Surety with respect to any charter participant 
shall not exceed the charter price paid by or on behalf of such 
participant.
    The liability of Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or 
succession of payments hereunder, unless and until such payment or 
payments shall amount in the aggregate to the penalty (face amount) of 
the bond, but in no event shall Surety's obligation hereunder exceed the 
amount of said penalty.
    Surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Office of Aviation 
Analysis, Department of Transportation, forthwith of all suits or claims 
made and judgments rendered, and payments made by Surety under this 
bond.
    This bond shall cover the following Charters: \1\

liable hereunder for the payment of any damages hereinbefore described 
which arise as a result of any contracts, agreements, undertakings, or 
arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made

such termination shall not affect the liability of the bond hereunder 
for the payment of any damages arising as a result of contracts, 
agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and 
other services made by Principal prior to the date that such termination 
becomes effective. Liability of Surety under this bond shall in all 
events be limited only to a charter participant or charter participants 
who shall within sixty (60) days after the termination of the particular 
charter described herein give written notice of claim to the charter 
operator or, if it is unavailable, to Surety, and all liability on this 
bond shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination

person acting on behalf of a candidate, for transportation in connection 
with the campaign of such candidate, so long as any overdue indebtedness 
of such person to such carrier shall remain unpaid, in whole or in part, 
or so long as such air carrier shall know that any overdue indebtedness 
of such person to any other air carrier remains unpaid, in whole or in 
part.
    (5)(i) With respect to transportation in connection with the 
campaign of any candidate to be performed after June 1, 1972, unsecured 
credit shall not be extended by an air carrier to any person acting on 
behalf of such candidate unless the carrier is authorized in writing by 
such candidate to extend such credit. The foregoing sentence shall not 
be construed as requiring the candidate to assume liability to the 
carrier for credit so extended.
    (ii) Within 7 days after indebtedness becomes overdue for any 
unsecured credit extended by an air carrier to a person acting on behalf 
of a candidate in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, 
the carrier shall notify the candidate in writing of the amount of the 
overdue indebtedness, and, unless paid in full within 25 days after the 
date of such notice, the overdue indebtedness shall be deemed to be the 
overdue indebtedness of the candidate, for the purposes of paragraph 
(b)(4)(i) of this section.
    (b) It shall be presumed that a candidate or person acting on behalf 
of a candidate intends to use transportation in connection with the 
campaign of such candidate for nomination for election, or election, to 
Federal office.

    \1\ Filed as part of the original document.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) A separate report shall be filed for each person acting on 
behalf of any candidate, if the aggregate indebtedness balance of such 
person to the reporting air carrier (including all debts incurred by 
such person, whether or not incurred in connection with the campaign of 
a candidate, as defined in this part) is over $5,000 on the last day of 
the month to which the report pertains. The report shall be filed with

balance, if any, of the amount payable for transportation not paid for 
in advance; (3) any unpaid balance of the charges for such 
transportation as of the last day of the month covered by the report, 
and the length of time that such balance has remained unpaid; and (4) a

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 375.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Act means the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended;
    Air transportation means the carriage by aircraft of persons or 
property as a common carrier for compensation or hire or the carriage of 
mail by aircraft in interstate, overseas, or foreign commerce (see 
section 101 (10) and (23) of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. 1301);
    Category shall indicate a classification of aircraft such as 
airplane, helicopter, glider, etc.;
    Commercial air operations shall mean operations by foreign civil 
aircraft engaged in flights for the purpose of crop dusting, pest 
control, pipeline patrol, mapping, surveying, banner towing, skywriting, 
or similar agricultural and industrial operations performed in the 
United States, and any operations for remuneration or hire to, from or 
within the United States including air carriage involving the 
discharging or taking on of passengers or cargo at one or more points in 
the United States, including carriage of cargo for the operator's own 
account if the cargo is to be resold or otherwise used in the 
furtherance of a business other than the business of providing carriage 
by aircraft, but excluding operations pursuant to foreign air carrier 
permits issued under section 402 of the Act, exemptions, and all other 
operations in air transportation.
    Exemption means an exemption granted, under section 416(b) of the 
Act, authorizing air transportation by a foreign air carrier;

[[Page 382]]

    Foreign air carrier permit means a permit authorizing foreign air 
transportation by a foreign air carrier pursuant to section 402 of the 
Act;
    Foreign aircraft permit means a permit authorizing navigation of 
foreign civil aircraft in the United States pursuant to section 1108(b) 
of the Act and this part;
    Foreign civil aircraft means (a) an aircraft of foreign registry 
that is not part of the armed forces of a foreign nation, or (b) a U.S.-
registered aircraft owned, controlled or operated by persons who are not 
citizens or permanent residents of the United States;
    Stop for non-traffic purposes means a landing for any purpose other 
than taking on or discharging passengers, cargo or mail, and does not 
include landings for embarking or disembarking stopover passengers or 
transshipped cargo or mail, or for other than strictly operational 
purposes.
    Type means all aircraft of the same basic design including all 
modifications thereto except those modifications that result in a change 
in handling or flight characteristics.


<R05>
Sec. 375.2  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part regulate the admission to, and 
navigation in, the United States of foreign civil aircraft other than 
aircraft operated under authority contained in a foreign air carrier 
permit or exemption. This part also contains provisions that specify the 
extent to which certain classes of flight operations by foreign civil 
aircraft may be conducted, and the terms and conditions applicable to 
such operations. Nothing in this part shall authorize any foreign civil 
aircraft to engage in air transportation nor be deemed to provide for 
such authorization by the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 375.3  [Reserved]


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Authorization


<R05>
Sec. 375.10  Certain foreign civil aircraft registered in ICAO member 
states.

    Subject to the observance of the applicable rules, conditions, and 
limitations set forth in this part:
    (a) Foreign civil aircraft manufactured in a State that at the time 
of manufacture was a member of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO), and registered in a State that at the time of 
flight is a member of ICAO, may be navigated in the United States;
    (b) Foreign civil aircraft manufactured in a State that at the time 
of manufacture was not a member of ICAO, and registered in a State that 
at the time of flight is a member of ICAO, may be navigated in the 
United States,
    (1) If the State of registry has notified ICAO that the requirements 
under which it issues or renders valid certificates of airworthiness are 
equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the 
Chicago Convention, or
    (2) If such notification has not been made to ICAO at the time of 
flight, there is on file with the Department a statement by the State of 
registry that, with regard to aircraft of the type that is proposed to 
be operated hereunder, the requirements under which certificates of 
airworthiness are issued or rendered valid are equal to or above the 
minimum standards established pursuant to the Chicago Convention.


<R05>
Sec. 375.11  Other foreign civil aircraft.

    A foreign civil aircraft other than those referred to in Sec. 
375.10 may be navigated in the United States only when (a) the operation 
is authorized by the Department under the provisions of this part, and 
(b) the aircraft complies with any applicable airworthiness standards of 
the Federal Aviation Administration for its operation.


<R04>
                  Subpart C_Rules Generally Applicable


<R05>
Sec. 375.19  Nature of privilege conferred.

    The provisions of this part, and of any permit issued hereunder, 
together with section 1108(b) of the Act, are designed, among other 
purposes, to carry out the international undertakings of the United 
States in the Chicago Convention, in particular Article 5. That article 
gives foreign aircraft the privilege of ``taking on or discharging 
passengers, cargo or mail'' subject to the

[[Page 383]]

right of the State where such embarkation or discharge takes place to 
impose such regulations, conditions or limitations as it may consider 
desirable. The U.S. Congress by the 1953 amendment to section 6 of the 
Air Commerce Act of 1926, now designated as section 1108(b) of the Act, 
authorizes the Department to permit such operations only where 
conditions of reciprocity and the interest of the public in the United 
States are met. Thus, the operator of any foreign registered aircraft is 
not entitled as a matter of right to the issuance, renewal or freedom 
from modification or change in a permit issuable pursuant to this 
authority. Accordingly, any authority conferred by this part may be 
withheld, revoked, amended, modified, restricted, suspended, withdrawn, 
or canceled by the Department in the interest of the public of the 
United States, without notice or hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 375.20  Airworthiness and registration certificates.

    Foreign civil aircraft shall carry currently effective certificates 
of registration and airworthiness issued or rendered valid by the 
country of registry and shall display the nationality and registration 
markings of that country. However, a foreign civil aircraft may carry, 
in lieu of such certificate of airworthiness, an effective special 
flight authorization issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for 
the operations being performed.


<R05>
Sec. 375.21  Airmen.

    Members of the flight crew of a foreign civil aircraft shall have in 
their personal possession valid airman certificates or licenses 
authorizing them to perform their assigned functions in the aircraft and 
for the operation involved issued or rendered valid by the country of 
registry of the aircraft or by the United States. No such flight crew 
members shall perform any flight duty within the United States that they 
are not currently authorized to perform in the country issuing or 
validating the certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 375.22  Flight operations.

    Flights of foreign civil aircraft in the United States shall be 
conducted in accordance with the currently applicable rules of the 
Federal Aviation Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 375.23  Maximum allowable weights.

    Foreign civil aircraft that are permitted to navigate in the United 
States on the basis of foreign airworthiness certificates must conform 
to the limitations on maximum certificated weights prescribed or 
authorized for the particular variation of the aircraft type, and for 
the particular category of use, by the country of manufacture of the 
aircraft type involved.


<R05>
Sec. 375.24  Entry and clearance.

    All U.S. entry and clearance requirements for aircraft, passengers, 
crews, baggage and cargo shall be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 375.25  Unauthorized operations.

    No foreign civil aircraft shall be navigated in the United States 
unless authorized by this part. Commercial air operations (other than 
those authorized by Sec. 375.36) shall not be undertaken without a 
permit issued by the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 375.26  Waiver of sovereign immunity.

    Owners and operators of aircraft operated under this part that are 
engaged in proprietary of commercial activities waive any defense of 
sovereign immunity from suit in any action or proceeding instituted 
against any of them in any court or other tribunal in the United States 
for any claim relating to that operation.


<R04>
                     Subpart D_Authorized Operations


<R05>
Sec. 375.30  Operations other than commercial air operations.

    Foreign civil aircraft that are not engaged in commercial air 
operations into, out of, or within the United States may be operated in 
the United States and may carry non-revenue traffic to, from or between 
points in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 375.31  Demonstration flights of foreign aircraft.

    Flights of foreign civil aircraft within the United States may be 
made for the purpose of demonstration of the

[[Page 384]]

aircraft or any component thereof (including demonstrations at 
airshows), provided no persons, cargo or mail are carried for 
remuneration or hire.


<R05>
Sec. 375.32  Flights incidental to agricultural and industrial 
operations outside the United States.

    Foreign civil aircraft that are engaged in agricultural or 
industrial operations to be performed wholly outside the United States 
may be navigated into, out of, and within the United States in 
connection with those operations provided that the aircraft is not at 
the time engaged in the carriage of passengers, cargo, or mail for 
remuneration or hire.


<R05>
Sec. 375.33  Transit flights, irregular operations.

    Foreign civil aircraft carrying passengers, property or mail for 
remuneration or hire, but not engaged in scheduled international air 
services, are authorized to navigate nonstop across the territory of the 
United States and to make stops for non-traffic purposes. The navigation 
of foreign civil aircraft in the United States is not authorized under 
this section when the elapsed time between landing and takeoff at a stop 
in the United States exceeds 24 hours and passengers are permitted to 
leave the airport or when passengers, property or mail are transferred 
to another aircraft. Flights involving stops under such circumstances 
may, however, be performed in the case of emergency relating to the 
safey of the aircraft, passengers, cargo or crew.


<R05>
Sec. 375.34  Indoctrination training.

    Foreign civil aircraft may be operated in the United States for the 
purpose of giving indoctrination training in the operation of the 
aircraft concerned to a buyer or a buyer's employees or designees. This 
section does not, however, authorize foreign civil aircraft to be used 
within the United States for the purpose of flight instruction for 
remuneration or hire.


<R05>
Sec. 375.35  Free transportation.

    (a) Foreign civil aircraft may be navigated in the United States by 
a foreign air carrier for the transportation of persons and property 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section over the following non-
traffic segments provided such transportation is not for compensation or 
hire:
    (1) Between two or more points in the United States;
    (2) Between a point in the United States named in the carrier's 
section 402 permit or exemption, and a point outside the United States 
not so named, when authorized in accordance with the provisions of part 
216 of this chapter to carry blind sector traffic to or from such 
unnamed foreign point; and
    (3) Between a point in the United States and a point outside thereof 
when the carrier lands at the United States point for non-traffic 
purposes in exercise of the privilege granted under the International 
Air Services Transit Agreement.
    (b) Free transportation may be provided under this section for the 
following categories of persons and property:
    (1) Directors, officers and employees, and their parents and 
immediate families, of the foreign air carrier operating the aircraft;
    (2) Directors, officers and employees, and their parents and 
immediate families, of an air carrier or another foreign air carrier 
traveling pursuant to a pass interchange arrangement;
    (3) Travel agents being transported for the purpose of familiarizing 
themselves with the carrier's services, if the agents are under no 
obligation to sell the transporting carrier's services;
    (4) Witnesses and attorneys attending any legal investigation in 
which any such foreign air carrier is involved;
    (5) Persons injured in aircraft accidents and physicians and nurses 
attending such persons;
    (6) Any persons or property with the object of providing relief in 
cases of general epidemic, natural disaster or other catastrophe;
    (7) Any person who has the duty of guarding foreign government 
officials travelling on official business; and
    (8) Guests of a foreign air carrier (including members of the press) 
on delivery flights of newly-acquired or newly-renovated aircraft.

[[Page 385]]

    (c) A charge reasonably related to the value of meals and beverages 
furnished enroute shall not be deemed to constitute compensation or hire 
for purposes of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 375.36  Lease of foreign civil aircraft without crew.

    Foreign civil aircraft that are leased without crew to an air 
carrier or citizen or permanent resident of the United States, and used 
by the lessee in otherwise authorized air transportation or commercial 
air operations, may be operated into, out of, and within the United 
States in accordance with any applicable regulations prescribed by the 
Federal Aviation Administration.


<R04>
   Subpart E_Operations Requiring Specific Preflight Authorization of 
                                 Filing


<R05>
Sec. 375.40  Permits for commercial air operations.

    (a) Permit required. Except for aircraft being operated under a 
foreign air carrier permit, an exemption, or as otherwise provided in 
Subpart D or H of this part, foreign civil aircraft may engage in 
commercial air operations only if there is carried on board the aircraft 
a permit issued by the Department in accordance with this subpart 
authorizing the operations involved.
    (b) Aircraft are not authorized to engage in air transportation 
under this section. Where an operation involves the carriage of persons, 
property or mail for compensation or hire, the Department will determine 
whether particular flights for which a permit is sought will be in 
common carriage, and therefore in air transportation, based on all the 
facts and circumstances surrounding the applicant's entire operations. 
The burden rests upon the applicant in each instance to demonstrate by 
an appropriate factual showing that the contemplated operation will not 
constitute common carriage from, to or within the United States. In 
general, an applicant that holds itself out to the public, or to a 
particular class or segment, as willing to furnish transportation for 
hire is a common carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 375.41  Agricultural and industrial operations within the United 
States.

    Foreign civil aircraft shall not be used for such commercial air 
operations as crop dusting, pest control, pipeline patrol, mapping, 
surveying, banner towing, skywriting or similar agricultural or 
industrial operations within the United States, including its 
territorial waters and overlying airspace, unless a permit has been 
issued by the Department and the operation is conducted in accordance 
with all applicable State and local laws and regulations as well as the 
applicable provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 375.42  Transport operations--occasional planeload charters.

    Occasional planeload charters may be authorized where, because of 
their limited nature and extent, special equipment or facilities 
utilized, or other circumstances pertaining to them, it appears that 
they are not within the scope of the applicant's normal holding out of 
transportation services to the general public. Such charters are 
normally limited to those in which the entire capacity of the aircraft 
is engaged by a single charterer, and since they are occasional in 
nature, should not exceed for any one applicant more than six flights 
during a calendar year. This part does not authorize operations that 
involve solicitation of the general public such as is usually involved 
in the transportation of individually-ticketed passengers or 
individually-waybilled cargo, or in which the charterer is a travel 
agent, a charter operator, a broker, an air freight forwarder or any 
other organization that holds itself out to the general public to 
provide transportation services. Carriage of cargo for the operator's 
own account is governed by the provisions of this section if the cargo 
is to be resold or otherwise used in the furtherance of a business other 
than the business of providing carriage by aircraft.


<R05>
Sec. 375.43  Application for foreign aircraft permit.

    (a) Applications for foreign aircraft permits shall be submitted on 
OST Form 4509, (Appendix A), in duplicate,

[[Page 386]]

addressed to the Chief, Discrete Operations Branch, Licensing Division, 
P-45, Office of Aviation Operations. Upon a showing of good cause, 
applications may be made by telegram or by telephone.
    (b) Applications shall contain a proper identification (including 
citizenship) of the applicant (the operator of the aircraft concerned) 
and of the owner thereof (if different from the applicant), a 
description of the aircraft by make, model, and registration marks; and 
a full description of the operations for which authority is desired, 
indicating type and dates of operations and number of flights, and 
routing. In the case of cargo flights, the names of all contractors, 
agents, if any, and the beneficial owner of the cargo, and a description 
of the cargo and of the proposed operations shall be provided. In the 
case of passenger flights, a full identification and description of the 
group chartering the aircraft, and identification of the travel agent, 
if any, shall be provided. Applications shall also contain a statement 
as to whether the applicant's homeland allows operators of U.S.-
registered aircraft to conduct similar operations.
    (c) Applications shall be filed at least 15 days in advance of the 
proposed commencement date of the operations. The Department may direct 
the applicant to serve copies of its application on additional persons. 
Late applications may be considered by the Department upon a showing of 
good cause.
    (d)(1) Any party in interest may file a memorandum supporting or 
opposing an application. Two copies of each memorandum shall be filed 
within 7 business days after the application is filed but no later than 
the proposed commencement date of the operations. Memoranda will be 
considered to the extent practicable; the Department may act on an 
application without waiting for supporting or opposing memoranda to be 
filed.
    (2) Each memorandum shall set forth the reasons why the applications 
should be granted or denied, accompanied by whatever data, including 
affidavits, the Department is asked to consider.
    (3) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the applicant.
    (e)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Department, each application 
and memorandum filed in response shall be available for public 
inspection at the Licensing Division of the Office of Aviation 
Operations immediately upon filing. Notice of the filing of all 
applications shall be published in the Department's Weekly List of 
Applications Filed.
    (2) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in 
an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in 
writing. If the Department finds that disclosure of all or part of the 
information should be withheld under applicable provisions of law, and 
the public interest does not require disclosure, it will order that the 
injurious information be withheld.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
2106-0002)


<R05>
Sec. 375.44  Issuance of permit.

    (a) The Department will issue a foreign aircraft permit if it finds 
that the proposed operations meet the requirements of this part and are 
in the public interest. Foreign aircraft permits may be conditioned or 
limited by the Department. Permits must be carried aboard the 
applicant's aircraft during flight over U.S. territory, and are not 
transferable.
    (b) In determining whether to grant a particular application, the 
Department will consider, among other factors, the extent to which the 
country of the applicant's nationality deals with U.S. civil aircraft 
operators on the basis of substantial reciprocity, and whether the 
operation is otherwise in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 375.45  Records and reports of occasional planeload charters.

    (a) Cargo documents. The holder of a permit for cargo operations 
shall issue a manifest or shipping document to its shipper with respect 
to each shipment.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Contents of documents for passenger flights. The holder of a 
permit for passenger charters originating or terminating in the United 
States shall require each charterer to file with it

[[Page 387]]

prior to flight a list of names and addresses of all passengers to be 
transported on each flight.
    (d) Reports of unused authority. All foreign operators of occasional 
planeload charters for which authority is granted must notify the 
Department, in writing, not later than 15 days after the expiration of 
their permits, or their failure to use this authority. The unused 
authority shall otherwise be deemed to have been exercised.


<R04>
                        Subpart F_Transit Flights


<R05>
Sec. 375.50  Transit flights; scheduled international air service 
operations.

    (a) Requirement of notice. Scheduled international air services 
proposed to be operated pursuant to the International Air Services 
Transit Agreement in transit across the United States may not be 
undertaken by foreign civil aircraft unless the operator of such 
aircraft, and (if other than the operator) the carrier offering such 
service to the public, has, not less than 30 days prior to the date of 
commencement of such service, filed a Notice of Proposed Transit Flights 
Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Filing of the notice. An original and two copies of the Notice 
shall be filed with the Chief, Discrete Operations Branch, Licensing 
Division, P-45, Office of Aviation Operations. Copies of the Notice 
shall be served upon the Department of State and the Administrator of 
the Federal Aviation Administration. The filing date shall be the date 
of actual receipt by the Department.
    (c) Content of notice. A ``Notice of Proposed Transit Flights 
Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement'' shall be 
clearly labeled as such, and as a minimum shall set forth, with whatever 
detail may be necessary, the following information:
    (1) The name, country or organization, and citizenship of the 
operator, and, if other than the operator, of the carrier offering the 
services to the public. If any interest (direct or indirect) in the 
operator or offeror of services is held by nationals of a country other 
than the country of organization or citizenship, the nature and extent 
of such interest must be fully disclosed. If any officer or director of 
the operator or carrier offering the services is a national of a country 
other than the country of organization or citizenship, the position of 
duties of such officer or director, and the officer and director's 
relevant position in relation to other officers and directors must 
similarly be fully disclosed. If the information required in this 
subsection has been previously supplied to the Department, the applicant 
may incorporate it by reference.
    (2) The State of registration of the aircraft proposed to be 
operated.
    (3) A full description of the proposed operations including the type 
of operations (passenger, property, mail, or combination), date of 
commencement, duration and frequency of flights, and routing (including 
each terminal and intermediate point to be served).
    (4) A statement as to whether or not any advertisement or 
publication of the proposed operations has been made in the United 
States. If there has been any advertisement or publication of the 
operations in the United States, copies of all such advertisements or 
publications shall be included.
    (5) Any change with respect to these matters (minor changes in 
schedules or routing excepted) shall also be filed with the Department.
    (d) Authorized operations. If the operator and the carrier offering 
services to the public (if different from the operator) have filed a 
``Notice of Proposed Transit Flights Pursuant to the International Air 
Services Transit Agreement,'' at least 30 days before the date of 
commencement of the proposed operations in accordance with paragraphs 
(a), (b), and (c) of this section, the described operations may be 
commenced and performed without further authorization from the 
Department, unless and until the Department issues an order notifying 
the operator and/or the carrier offering the services to the public 
that, considering the matters submitted in the Notice, the Department is 
of the view that a question may exist as to whether:

[[Page 388]]

    (1) The proposed services are authorized pursuant to the terms of 
the International Air Services Transit Agreement;
    (2) Substantial ownership and effective control are vested in 
nationals of a State party to the International Air Services Transit 
Agreement;
    (3) The proposed operations will be in compliance with the laws of 
the United States, the Department's rules, or the provisions of this 
section; or
    (4) The operator or its government have performed their obligations 
under the International Air Services Transit Agreement.
    (e) Prohibited operations. If the Department issues an order of 
notification as described in paragraph (d) of this section, neither the 
operator, nor the carrier offering the services to the public, shall 
commence the proposed operations, or, except as may be otherwise 
specified in the order, operate any flights subsequent to receipt of the 
order, unless and until the Department issues a foreign aircraft permit 
pursuant to the provisions of section 1108(b) of the Act and this part 
specifically authorizing such operations.
    (f) Foreign aircraft permit--application and procedures. If the 
Department issues an Order of Notification as described in paragraph (d) 
of this section, the carrier's Notice of Proposed Transit Flights 
Pursuant to the International Air Services Transit Agreement shall be 
treated as an application for the required foreign aircraft permit, and 
further procedures on such application shall be as directed by the 
Department.
    (g) Short notice filing. Nothing in this section shall be construed 
as precluding the filing of an application for a foreign aircraft permit 
to perform transit operations pursuant to the International Air Services 
Transit Agreement less than 30 days in advance of the proposed 
operation. No such flights shall be operated, however, unless or until a 
specific foreign aircraft permit has been issued by the Department.
    (h) Nature of privilege conferred. Air transportation is not 
authorized under this section, and the burden rests upon each operator 
and carrier to show that the proposed operations will not constitute air 
transportation within the meaning of the Federal Aviation Act. In 
addition, each operator and carrier has the burden of demonstrating that 
the proposed operations are authorized by the International Air Services 
Transit Agreement, and that the appropriate authorization should not be 
withheld pursuant to section 5 of Article I thereof. Stopovers for the 
convenience or pleasure of the passengers are not authorized under this 
section and stops other than for strictly operational reasons shall not 
be made. The consolidation on the same aircraft of an operation under 
this section with a service authorized under section 402 or 416(b) of 
the Act is not authorized by this section. Any authorization or permit 
granted under this section is nontransferable, and may be withheld, 
revoked, suspended, withdrawn, or cancelled by the Department, without 
notice or hearing, if required by the public interest. Operators of 
aircraft registered in countries not parties to the International Air 
Services Transit Agreement shall make special application to the 
Department under Sec. 375.70.


<R04>
                           Subpart G_Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 375.60  Penalties.

    The operation of a foreign aircraft within the United States or over 
adjacent territorial waters in violation of the provisions of this part 
constitutes a violation of the Federal Aviation Act and of this chapter, 
and may, in addition, constitute a violation of the rules of the Federal 
Aviation Administration. Such operation makes the person or persons 
responsible for the violation or violations subject to a civil penalty 
as provided in section 901 of the Act, and to the alteration, amendment, 
modification, suspension or revocation of any permit issued under this 
part and of any U.S. certificate involved as provided in section 609 of 
the Act. Engaging in air transportation as defined in the Act by a 
foreign aircraft without a foreign air carrier permit issued pursuant to 
section 402 of the Act or an exemption, or in violation of the terms of 
such authority constitutes not only a violation of this part but of 
title IV of

[[Page 389]]

the Act as well, which entails a criminal penalty as set forth in 
section 902 of the Act.


<R04>
                     Subpart H_Special Authorization


<R05>
Sec. 375.70  Special authorization.

    Any person desiring to navigate a foreign civil aircraft within the 
United States other than as specifically provided in this part may 
petition the Department for a special authorization to conduct the 
particular flight or series of flights. Such authorization may be issued 
only if the Department finds that the proposed operation is fully 
consistent with the applicable law, that the applicant's homeland grants 
a similar privilege with respect to operators of U.S.-registered 
aircraft, and that the proposed operation is in the interest of the 
public of the United States.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 377.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Authorization means any agency certificate, approval, statutory 
exemption or other form of permission granted pursuant to sections 
101(3), 401, 402, 408, 409, 412 and 416 of the Federal Aviation Act of

the requirements of this part which requests either a renewal or a new 
license and is intended to invoke the provisions of the last sentence of

unlimited regularly scheduled service between a specifically designated 
pair of terminal points and intermediate points, if any.

[SPR-84, 40 FR 24998, June 12, 1975, as amended by SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, 
Feb. 18, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 377.2  Applicability of part.

    (a) This part implements the last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) with 
regard to temporary authorizations granted by the Board.
    Note: The last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) provides: ``When the 
licensee has made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a 
new license in accordance with agency rules, a license with reference to 
an activity of a continuing nature does not expire until the application 
has been finally determined by the agency.''
    (b) Nothing in this part prevents the Board from terminating at any 
time, in accordance with law, any authorization or any extension of an 
authorization.
    (c) Nothing in this part constitutes a determination that any given 
authorization is a ``license with reference to an activity of a 
continuing nature'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c).

[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 377.3  Authorizations not covered by 5 U.S.C. 558(c).

    The Board hereby determines that the following authorizations are 
not licenses ``with reference to an activity of a continuing nature'' 
within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c):
    (a) Authorizations granted for a specified period of 180 days or 
less; and
    (b) Authorizations, other than those granted under section 401 of 
the Act, that by their terms are subject to termination at an uncertain 
date upon the happening of an event, including fulfillment of a 
condition subsequent or occurrence of a contingency.

[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 377.4  Certain authorizations with alternative termination dates.

    Unless granted under section 401 of the Act, an authorization that 
by its terms is subject to termination alternatively, either at an 
uncertain date upon the happening of an event or upon the arrival of a 
specified date:
    (a) Will not be considered a ``license with reference to an activity 
of a continuing nature'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c), if the 
event occurs before the specified date; and
    (b) Ordinarily (subject to Board interpretation under Sec. 377.5) 
will be considered such a license, if the event does not occur before 
the specified date and

[[Page 393]]

that date is more than 180 days after the effective date of the 
authorization.

[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 377.5  Procedure to obtain Board interpretation.

    (a) The Board will determine upon written request by the holder of a 
temporary authorization or by any competitively affected air carrier or 
foreign air carrier, or upon its own initiative, whether the temporary 
authorization is a ``license with reference to an activity of a 
continuing nature'' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c).
    (b) A written request for such a Board determination shall be filed 
at least 60 days before the deadline set forth in Sec. 377.10 for a 
timely renewal application.
    (c) The filing of such a written request shall not affect the 
timeliness requirements for renewal applications that are set forth in 
Sec. 377.10 or any other applicable Board rule or order.

[SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, Feb. 18, 1982]


<R04>
          Subpart B_Renewal Applications and Procedure Thereon


<R05>
Sec. 377.10  Requirements for, and effect of, renewal applications.

    (a) Identification of authorization covered by renewal application. 
Each renewal application shall identify the authorization or 
authorizations to which it is intended to relate. The application shall 
indicate the applicant's intention to rely upon 5 U.S.C. 558(c) as 
implemented by this part. In case of applications for renewal of an 
authorization for route service, the renewal application shall 
specifically identify the separate routes which the applicant proposes 
to continue serving pursuant to the expiring authorization, pending 
final determination of the renewal application.
    (b) Contents of renewal application. The application must contain 
all the information required by law and the Board's regulations, and 
meet the requirements thereof as to form. The new authorization sought 
need not be of the same duration as the expiring authorization. If the 
application relates to renewal of route authority, it must contain, as a 
minimum, a request for renewed authority to render route service between 
the terminals named in each separate route for which renewal is 
requested.
    (c) Timeliness. The application must be filed and served in 
compliance with applicable law and the Board's regulations at least 60 
days before the expiration date of the outstanding temporary 
authorization, except that:
    (1) For certificates issued under section 401 of the Act with a 
specified expiration date, the deadline is 180 days before the 
expiration date;
    (2) For certificates issued under section 401 of the Act that 
terminate by their terms upon the happening of an event that could not 
be foreseen, the deadline is 30 days after the time that the carrier has 
notice that the event will occur or has occurred;
    (3) For foreign air carrier permits issued under section 402 of the 
Act and exemptions issued under section 416 to non-U.S. citizens, the 
deadline is the expiration date itself;
    (4) For renewal by substantially equivalent certificate authority of 
fixed term route authorizations granted by exemption and for interim 
extension of the exemption, pursuant to Sec. 399.18 of this chapter, 
the deadline is 90 days before the expiration date; and
    (5) Nothing in this part supersedes a requirement for earlier filing 
contained in any law, Board rule or order, or temporary authorization.
    (d) Effect. In the case of authorizations which constitute licenses 
with reference to activities of a continuing nature within the meaning 
of 5 U.S.C. 558(c), the filing of an application complying in all 
respects with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section shall extend the authorization to which it relates as then 
outstanding in its entirety, together with all applicable terms, 
conditions and limitations, until the application has been finally 
determined by the Board. In the case of routes granted under section 401 
of the Act, the duty to render adequate service continues to attach to 
every point as provided in the expired authorization which is extended 
pursuant to this provision. The date of final determination of the 
application shall be the date when the final order determining the 
application takes effect, or

[[Page 394]]

when the applicable period for filing of petitions for rehearing, 
reargument or reconsideration expires, or when a timely filed petition 
therefor is denied, whichever occurs latest.

[SPR-84, 40 FR 24998, June 12, 1975, as amended by SPR-184, 47 FR 7212, 
Feb. 18, 1982; 65 FR 6457, Feb. 9, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 377.11  Processing of defective renewal applications.

    When the Board determines that a renewal application does not comply 
with the requirements of this part, or that it does not relate to a 
license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature, it will so 
notify the applicant. The applicant may amend his application to cure 
the deficiency as a matter of right at any time prior to the date when 
the application was due pursuant to Sec. 377.10(c).

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 380.1  Applicability.

    This part applies to Public Charter air transportation of passengers 
in interstate or foreign air transportation, whether furnished by direct 
air carriers or Public Charter operators. This part also relieves such 
charter operators from various provisions of subtitle VII of Title 49 of 
the United States Code (statute), formerly Title IV of the Federal 
Aviation Act of 1958,

[[Page 395]]

as amended, for the purpose of enabling them to provide Public Charters 
utilizing aircraft chartered from such direct air carriers. It also

provided;
    (t) That the participants rights and remedies set forth in the

    (ii) The bank shall pay the direct air carrier the charter price for 
the transportation not earlier than 60 days (including day of departure) 
prior to the scheduled day of departure of the originating or returning 
flight, upon certification of the departure date by the air carrier: 
Provided, That, in the case of a round trip charter contract to be

[[Page 404]]

bank shall pay funds from the account directly to the hotels, 
sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies furnishing ground 
accommodations and services, if any, in connection with the charter or 
series of charters upon presentation to the bank of vendors' bills and 
upon certification by the charter operator or foreign charter operator 
of the amounts payable for such ground accommodations and services and 
the person or companies to whom payment is to be made: Provided, 
however, That the total amounts paid by the bank pursuant to paragraphs 
(b)(2) (ii) and (v) of this section shall not exceed either the total 
cost of the air transportation, or 80 percent of the total deposits 
received by the bank less any refunds made to charter participants 
pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iv) of this section, whichever 
is greater;
    (vi) As used in this section, the term ``bank'' means a bank insured 
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
    (vii) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter 
group;
    (viii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the 
amount of total cash deposits required to be maintained in the 
depository account of the bank may be reduced by one or both of the 
following: The amount of the security agreement in the form prescribed 
in this section in excess of the minimum coverage required by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section; an escrow with the designated bank of Federal, 
State, or municipal bonds or other securities, consisting of 
certificates of deposit issued by banks having a stated policy of 
redeeming such certificates before maturity at the request of the holder 
(subject only to such interest penalties or other conditions as may be 
required by law), or negotiable securities which are publicly traded on 
a securities exchange, all such securities to be made payable to the 
escrow account: Provided, That such other securities shall be 
substituted in an amount no greater than 80 percent of the total market 
value of the escrow account at the time of such substitution: And 
provided, further, That should the market value of such other securities 
subsequently decrease, from time to time, then additional cash or 
securities qualified for investment hereunder shall promptly be added to 
the escrow account, in an amount equal to the amount of such decreased 
value; and
    (ix) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), 
and (viii) of this section, the bank shall not pay out any funds from 
the account prior to 2 banking days after completion of each charter, 
when the balance in the account shall be paid the charter operator or 
foreign charter operator, upon certification of the completion date by 
the direct air carrier: Provided, however, That if the Charter involves 
air transportation only and the bank has paid the direct air carrier(s) 
the charter price for the originating flight, and the returning flight 
if any, and has paid all refunds due to participants, as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and (iii), respectively, of this section, then the 
bank may pay the balance in the account to the charter operator upon 
certification by the direct air carrier performing the originating 
flight that such flight has in fact departed.
    (c)(1) The security agreement required under paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section shall insure the financial responsibility of the charter 
operator or foreign charter operator and the supplying of the 
transportation and all other accommodations, services, and facilities in 
accordance with the contract between the charter operator or foreign 
charter operator and the charter participants.
    (2) The security agreement may be either:
    (i) A surety bond in the form set forth as appendix A to this part;
    (ii) A surety trust agreement in the form set forth as appendix B to 
this part; or
    (iii) An arrangement with a bank (for instance, a standby letter of 
credit) that provides protection of charter participants' funds 
equivalent to or greater than that provided by the Bond in appendix A. 
An arrangement that furnishes a lesser degree of protection than would 
be provided under the bond shall be invalid to that extent, and instead 
the bank, the charter operator or foreign charter operator, and the 
charter participants shall have the same rights and liabilities as 
provided under

[[Page 405]]

a bond in the form of appendix A. If the arrangement does not give as 
much protection as a bond against the risk of the charter operator's 
bankruptcy, the bank shall be liable in the event of bankruptcy to the 
same extent as if it had entered into a bond.
    (3) Any agreement under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall 
include a statement that, in the event that the other provisions of the 
agreement do not provide protection to charter participants comparable 
to that provided under a bond in the form of appendix A, the bank shall 
assume, for the benefit of the charter participants, all the liabilities 
it would have if it entered into the bond.
    (4) The security agreement shall be effective on or before the date 
the charter prospectus is filed with the Department.
    (5) The security agreement shall be specifically identified by the 
issuing securer with a numbering system so that the Department can 
identify the security agreement with the specific charter or charters to 
which it relates. These data may be set forth in an addendum attached to 
the security agreement, which addendum must be signed by the charter 
operator or foreign charter operator and the securer.
    (6) When security is provided by a surety bond, such bond shall be 
issued by a bonding or surety company that is listed in Best's Insurance 
Reports (Fire and Casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of 
``A'' or better. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally 
authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which the charter 
originates. For purposes of this section the term ``State'' includes any 
territory or possession of the United States, or the District of 
Columbia.
    (7) When security is provided by a security agreement other than a 
bond, the agreement shall be issued by a national bank complying with 
the provisions of 12 CFR 7.7010(a), or by a State bank complying with 
applicable State laws that give authority to issue such agreements, and 
all such banks must be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.
    (d) The security agreement required by this section shall provide 
that unless the charter participant files a claim with the charter 
operator or foreign charter operator, or, if it is unavailable, with the 
securer, within 60 days after termination of the charter, the securer 
shall be released from all liability under the security agreement to 
such charter participant. Terminations means the date of arrival (or in 
the case of a canceled charter, the intended date of arrival) of the 
return flight. If there is no return flight in a participant's 
itinerary, termination means the date or intended date of departure of 
the last flight in the participant's itinerary.


<R05>
Sec. 380.34a  Substitution of direct air carrier's security or 
depository agreement.

    (a) A direct air carrier may substitute its own security agreement 
and/or depository arrangements, as specified in this section, for those 
required of the charter operator under Sec. 380.34, but only for 
charter trips in which all the air transportation is provided by one 
direct air carrier. Charter operators are relieved from Sec. 380.34 to 
the extent that the direct carrier substitutes its own arrangements.
    (b) The direct air carrier may substitute its security agreement for 
all of the arrangements required of the charter operator under Sec. 
380.34 (a) or (b). Alternatively, it may substitute its depository 
agreement for the depository agreement required of the charter operator 
under Sec. 380.34(b)(2). If the direct carrier substitutes its 
depository agreement, it may also obtain and substitute a security 
agreement for the one otherwise required of the charter operator under 
Sec. 380.34(b)(1). If the direct carrier substitutes its depository 
agreement only, the charter operator must supply the security agreement 
required under Sec. 380.34(b)(1).
    (c) If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement for all 
the charter operator's requirements under Sec. 380.34, the charter 
operator shall include in the charter prospectus, in place of the 
information in Sec. 380.28(a)(2) regarding the charter operator's 
security agreement:
    (1) A statement by the direct air carrier on OST Form 4535 that it 
will take responsibility for all charter participant payments (including 
those for

[[Page 406]]

ground accommodations and services) and for the fulfillment of all the 
charter operator's contractual and regulatory obligations to the charter 
participants.
    (2) A statement from the direct air carrier and its securer (under 
Sec. 212.12 of this chapter), OST Form 4533, that they have entered 
into a security agreement assuring the direct air carrier's 
responsibilities to charter participants under this section in an 
unlimited amount (except that the liability of the securer with respect 
to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by 
or on behalf of such participant), and that the securer has received a 
copy of the proposed flight schedule identified by the schedule number 
assigned by the charter operator under this part.
    (d) A substitute depository agreement under this section shall be 
signed by the direct air carrier, the charter operator, and the 
depository bank, and shall provide, in addition to existing requirements 
under Sec. 212.8 of this chapter, that:
    (1) Payments by or on behalf of charter participants shall be 
allocated to the flight accounts matching the participant's itinerary in 
the following way: Each account shall have allocated to it the charter 
cost of the participant's air transportation on that flight. The portion 
of each payment not intended for air transportation services shall be 
allocated to the account for the return flight in the participant's 
itinerary. If there is only one flight in the itinerary, the entire 
payment shall be allocated to that account.
    (2) The bank shall pay funds from a flight account directly to the 
hotels, sightseeing enterprises, or other persons or companies 
furnishing ground accommodations and services, if any, in connection 
with the charter flight, upon presentation to the bank of vendor's bills 
and upon certification by the person who contracted for the ground 
accommodations or services of the amounts payable and the persons or 
companies to whom payment is to be made, except that no disbursement 
shall be made that would reduce the balance in the account below the 
charter cost of the flight.
    (3) On sales made to participants by a person other than a retail 
travel agent, the participant shall pay by check, money order, or credit 
card draft payable to the bank. On sales made to participants by a 
retail travel agent, payments shall be made in the same manner unless 
the agent deducts its commission and remits the balance to the bank by 
check, money order, or electronic transfer. The agent may deduct its 
commission only if it agrees in writing with its principal (the charter 
operator or direct air carrier, as applicable) that, if the charter is 
canceled, the agent shall remit to the bank the full amount of the 
commission previously deducted or received within 10 days after receipt 
of notification of the cancellation. The depository bank shall pay 
refunds directly to participants according to the terms of the operator-
participant contract and the terms of this part.
    (e) If the direct carrier substitutes a security agreement in 
addition to substituting a depository agreement, the charter prospectus 
information must include all the information required by paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section, except for the amount of the security 
agreement. That agreement shall be in an amount of at least $10,000 
times the number of flights, except that the amount need not be more 
than $200,000.
    (f) A copy of the depository agreement under paragraph (d) of this 
section shall be filed with the Department, and it shall not be 
effective until approved by the Department.
    (g) A copy of the security agreement under paragraph (c) or 
paragraph (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department. It 
shall insure the financial responsibility of the direct air carrier for 
supplying the transportation and all other accommodations, services, and 
facilities in accordance with the contracts between the charter operator 
and the charter participants. Such security agreement shall meet all the 
other requirements of Sec. 380.34 (c) and (d).

Sec. 380.35  Disbursements from depository account.

    Whereas Principal intends to become a Public Charter operator 
pursuant to the provisions of part 380 of the Department's Special

    This Trust Agreement is entered into between -------------------- 
(charter operator) incorporated under the law of -------------------- 
with the principal place of business being -------------------- 
(hereinafter referred to as the Operator), and -------------------- 
(Bank) with its principal place of business being -------------------- 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Trustee''), for the purpose of 
creating a trust to become effective as of the ------ day of ----------
------, --------, which trust shall continue until terminated as 
hereinafter provided.
    The Operator intends to become a Public Charter operator pursuant to 
the provisions of Part 380 of the Department's Special Regulations and 
other rules and regulations of the Department relating to insurance or 
other security for the protection of charter participants, and has

    This Surety Trust Agreement is written to assure compliance by the 
Operator with the provisions of Part 380 of the Department's Special 
Regulations and other rules and regulations of the Department relating 
to insurance or other security for the protection of charter 
participants.
    It shall inure to the benefit of any and all charter participants to 
whom the Operator may be held legally liable for any of the damages 
herein described.
    It is mutually agreed by and between the operator and Trustee that 
the Trustee shall manage the corpus of the trust and carry out the 
purposes of the trust as hereinafter set forth during the term of the 
trust for the benefit of charter participants (who are hereinafter 
referred to as ``Beneficiaries.'')
    Beneficiaries of the trust created by this Agreement shall be 
limited to those charter participants who meet the following 
requirements:
    1. Those for whom Operator or Operator's agent has received payment 
toward participation in one or more charters operated by or proposed to 
be operated by Operator.
    2. Who have legal claim or claims for money damages against the 
Operator by reason of the Operators' failure faithfully to perform, 
fulfill, and carry out all contracts, agreements, and arrangements made 
by the Operator while this trust is in respect to the receipt of moneys 
and proper disbursement thereof pursuant to Part 380 of the Department's 
Special Regulations; and
    3. Who have given notice of such claim or claims in accordance with 
this Trust Agreement, but who have not been paid by the Operator.
    The Operator shall convey to the Trustee legal title to the trust 
corpus, which has a value of $---------------- by the time of the 
execution of this Agreement.
    Trustee shall assume the responsibilities of the Trustee over the

<R05>
Sec. 381.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is ensure that air travelers who have 
purchased tours to special events will receive the promised admission to 
the event. This part expands the ``Super Bowl rule'' to other events.


<R05>
Sec. 381.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to Special Event Tours that are in interstate air 
transportation, or in foreign air transportation originating at a point 
in the United States. This part applies to U.S. and foreign operators of 
Special Event Tours, whether they be air carriers or ticket agents. This 
part applies to scheduled, charter, and other air transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 381.5  Definition.

    Special Event Tour means a tour that is organized for the purpose of 
attending a sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural, 
political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which 
exists for reasons apart from the tour itself, and which is represented 
by the operator of the tour

[[Page 412]]

as including admission to that event. Examples of such events include, 
but are not limited to, college and professional sporting events, the 
Olympics, concerts, the Passion Play in Oberammergau, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 381.7  Advertising.

    No operator of a Special Event Tour or agent of such an operator 
shall conduct, or cause or allow to be conducted, any advertising, 
solicitation or other promotion for a Special Event Tour unless:
    (a) The operator is in physical possession of enough tickets for 
admission to the event to provide such tickets for a substantial number 
of seats on the tour; or
    (b) The operator has entered into a written contract with an 
organization that is the distributor of such tickets or an organization 
that receives such tickets directly from the distributor (e.g., a bowl 
committee; football conference, league or team; concert promoter or 
arena; etc.), the terms of which provide for that organization to 
furnish the operator enough admission tickets to provide such tickets 
for a substantial number of seats on the tour; or
    (c) The operator has entered into a written contract with another 
person or organization that has a written contract or series of written 
contracts with the distributor of such tickets or with an organization 
that receives such tickets directly from the distributor, the terms of 
which provide for that organization (the organization with which the 
operator has contracted) to furnish the operator enough admission 
tickets to provide such tickets for a substantial number of seats on the 
tour.


<R05>
Sec. 381.9  Sales.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) No operator of a Special Event Tour shall accept money for a 
seat on a Special Event Tour, or authorize an agent to accept such 
money, unless the operator has physical possession of, or written 
contracts (in the manner described in Sec. 381.7) for, a ticket for 
admission to the event for that individual. To the extent that the 
operator receives an unsolicited booking for which the operator does not 
have physical possession of or written contracts for a ticket for 
admission to the event, any payment accompanying that booking must be 
returned within 3 business days.
    (2) Upon acceptance of the money for a sale, the operator must 
reserve one event ticket for that individual. An operator may not sell 
more seats on the tour than it has event tickets in hand or under 
contract. (An operator need not continue to reserve an event ticket for 
an individual who withdraws from the tour by providing notice to the 
operator or by being notified by the operator that the individual's 
participation has been canceled due to failure to remit a required 
installment payment.)
    (b) An operator of a Special Event Tour may accept a booking and 
payment from an individual for whom the operator does not have an event 
ticket in hand or under contract if that individual agrees in writing 
that he or she understands that no event ticket has been reserved for 
him or her. This agreement shall specify whether the person has agreed 
to participate in the tour without an event ticket and/or the operator 
has agreed to attempt to acquire an event ticket for this person. If the 
two parties agree that the operator will attempt to acquire an event 
ticket, the agreement shall specify any penalties that will apply if the 
individual later cancels because an event ticket did not become 
available. If the operator notifies this person that an event ticket has 
become available, that person shall enjoy all the other protections of 
this part from that time.


<R05>
Sec. 381.11  Refunds.

    If promised admission to the primary event for which a Special Event 
Tour was organized is not furnished by the tour operator, at the tour 
price agreed to before departure (including any increases that the 
participant has accepted pursuant to Sec. 381.13(a)), the operator must 
provide each tour participant affected in this way a refund of the total 
tour price. This refund is to be provided within 14 calendar days after 
the scheduled return date of the tour.

[[Page 413]]


<R05>
Sec. 381.13  Price increases.

participation in the tour and receiving a full refund within 14 days 
after the cancellation.
    (b) The tour operator shall not increase the tour price to any 
participant less than ten days before departure.

    (a) Unless specifically permitted by a provision of this part, a 
carrier shall not refuse to provide transportation to a qualified 
individual with a disability on the basis of his or her disability.
    (b) A carrier shall not refuse to provide transportation to a 
qualified individual with a disability solely because the person's 
disability results in appearance or involuntary behavior that may 
offend, annoy, or inconvenience crewmembers or other passengers.
    (c) A carrier shall not refuse to provide transportation to 
qualified individuals with a disability by limiting the number of such 
persons who are permitted to travel on a given flight.
    (d) Carrier personnel, as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 1511, 14 CFR 91.8, 
or 14 CFR 121.533, may refuse to provide transportation to any passenger 
on the basis of safety, and may refuse to provide transportation to any 
passenger whose carriage would violate the Federal Aviation Regulations. 
In exercising this authority, carrier personnel shall not discriminate 
against any qualified individual with a disability on the basis of 
disability and their actions shall not be inconsistent with the 
provisions of this part. In the event that such action is inconsistent 
with the provisions of this part, the carrier shall be subject to 
remedies provided under Sec. 382.65.
    (e) When a carrier refuses to provide transportation to any person 
on a basis relating to the individual's disability, the carrier shall 
specify in writing to the person the basis for the refusal, including, 
where applicable, the reasonable and specific basis for the carrier's 
opinion that transporting the person would or might be inimical to the 
safety of the flight. This written explanation shall be provided within 
10 calendar days of the refusal of transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 382.33  Advance notice requirements.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a carrier 
shall not require a qualified individual with a

[[Page 418]]

disability to provide advance notice of his or her intention to travel 
or of his or her disability as a condition of receiving transportation 
or of receiving services or accommodations required by this part.
    (b) A carrier may require up to 48 hours advance notice and one-hour 
advance check-in concerning a qualified individual with a disability who 
wishes to receive any of the following services, types of equipment, or 
accommodations:
    (1) Medical oxygen for use on board the aircraft, if this service is 
available on the flight;
    (2) Carriage of an incubator, if this service is available on the 
flight;
    (3) Hook-up for a respirator to the aircraft electrical power 
supply, if this service is available on the flight;
    (4) Accommodation for a passenger who must travel in a stretcher, if 
this service is available on the flight;
    (5) Transportation for an electric wheelchair on a flight scheduled 
to be made with an aircraft with fewer than 60 seats;
    (6) Provision by the carrier of hazardous materials packaging for a 
battery for a wheelchair or other assistive device;
    (7) Accommodation for a group of ten or more qualified individuals 
with a disability, who make reservations and travel as a group; and
    (8) Provision of an on-board wheelchair on an aircraft that does not 
have an accessible lavatory.
    (c) If a passenger does not meet advance notice or check-in 
requirements established by a carrier consistent with this section, the 
carrier shall nonetheless provide the service, equipment, or 
accommodation if it can do so by making a reasonable effort, without 
delaying the flight.
    (d) Carriers' reservation and other administrative systems shall 
ensure that when advance notice is provided by qualified individuals 
with a disability as provided by this section, the notice is recorded 
and properly transmitted to operating employees responsible for 
providing the accommodation concerning which notice was provided.
    (e) If the qualified individual with a disability provides the 
notice required by the carrier for a service under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the carrier shall ensure that the requested service is 
provided.
    (f) If a qualified individual with a disability provides advance 
notice to a carrier, and the individual is forced to change to the 
flight of a different carrier because of the cancellation of the 
original flight or the substitution of inaccessible equipment, the first 
carrier shall, to the maximum extent feasible, provide assistance to the 
second carrier in providing the accommodation requested by the 
individual from the first carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 382.35  Attendants.

    (a) Except as provided in this section, a carrier shall not require 
that a qualified individual with a disability travel with an attendant 
as a condition of being provided air transportation. A concern on the 
part of carrier personnel that an individual with a disability may need 
to use inaccessible lavatory facilities or may otherwise need extensive 
special assistance for personal needs which carrier personnel are not 
obligated to provide is not a basis on which the carrier may require an 
attendant.
    (b) A carrier may require that a qualified individual with a 
disability meeting any of the following criteria travel with an 
attendant as a condition of being provided air transportation, if the 
carrier determines that an attendant is essential for safety:
    (1) A person traveling in a stretcher or incubator. The attendant 
for such a person must be capable of attending to the passenger's in-
flight medical needs;
    (2) A person who, because of a mental disability, is unable to 
comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions from carrier 
personnel, including the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 
121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4) or 14 CFR 135.117(b);
    (3) A person with a mobility impairment so severe that the person is 
unable to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft;
    (4) A person who has both severe hearing and severe vision 
impairments, if the person cannot establish some means of communication 
with carrier personnel, adequate to permit transmission of the safety 
briefing required

[[Page 419]]

by 14 CFR 121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4) or 14 CFR 135.117(b).
    (c) If the carrier determines that a person meeting the criteria of 
paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section must travel with an 
attendant, contrary to the individual's self-assessment that he or she 
is capable of traveling independently, the carrier shall not charge for 
the transportation of the attendant.
    (d) If, because there is not a seat available on a flight for an 
attendant whom the carrier has determined to be necessary, an individual 
with a disability with a confirmed reservation is unable to travel on 
the flight, the individual with a disability shall be eligible for 
denied boarding compensation under 14 CFR part 250.
    (e) For purposes of determining whether a seat is available for an 
attendant, the attendant shall be deemed to have checked in at the same 
time as the individual with a disability.


<R05>
Sec. 382.37  Seat assignments.

    (a) Carriers shall not exclude any qualified individual with a 
disability from any seat in an exit row or other location or require 
that a qualified individual with a disability sit in any particular 
seat, on the basis of disability, except in order to comply with the 
requirements of an FAA safety regulation or as provided in this section.
    (b) If a person's disability results in involuntary active behavior 
that would result in the person properly being refused transportation 
under Sec. 382.31, and the safety problem could be mitigated to a 
degree that would permit the person to be transported consistent with 
safety if the person is seated in a particular location, the carrier 
shall offer the person that particular seat location as an alternative 
to being refused transportation.
    (c) If a service animal cannot be accommodated at the seat location 
of the qualified individual with a disability whom the animal is 
accompanying (see Sec. 382.55(a)(2)), the carrier shall offer the 
passenger the opportunity to move with the animal to a seat location, if 
present on the aircraft, where the animal can be accommodated, as an 
alternative to requiring that the animal travel with checked baggage.


<R05>
Sec. 382.38  Seating accommodations.

    (a) On request of an individual who self-identifies to a carrier as 
having a disability specified in this paragraph, the carrier shall 
provide the following seating accommodations, subject to the provisions 
of this section:
    (1) For a passenger who uses an aisle chair to access the aircraft 
and who cannot readily transfer over a fixed aisle armrest, the carrier 
shall provide a seat in a row with a movable aisle armrest.
    (2) The carrier shall provide a seat next to a passenger traveling 
with a disability for a person assisting the individual in the following 
circumstances:
    (i) When an individual with a disability is traveling with a 
personal care attendant who will be performing a function for the 
individual during the flight that airline personnel are not required to 
perform (e.g., assistance with eating);
    (ii) When an individual with a vision impairment is traveling with a 
reader/assistant who will be performing functions for the individual 
during the flight; or
    (iii) When an individual with a hearing impairment is traveling with 
an interpreter who will be performing functions for the individual 
during the flight.
    (3) For an individual traveling with a service animal, the carrier 
shall provide, as the individual requests, either a bulkhead seat or a 
seat other than a bulkhead seat.
    (4) For a person with a fused or immobilized leg, the carrier shall 
provide a bulkhead seat or other seat that provides greater legroom than 
other seats, on the side of an aisle that better accommodates the 
individual's disability.
    (b) A carrier that provides advance seat assignments shall comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by any of the 
following methods:
    (1) The carrier may ``block'' an adequate number of the seats used 
to provide the seating accommodations required by this section.
    (i) The carrier shall not assign these seats to passengers not 
needing seating accommodations provided under this

[[Page 420]]

paragraph until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight.
    (ii) At any time up until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of 
the flight, the carrier shall assign a seat meeting the requirements of 
this section to an individual who requests it.
    (iii) If an individual with a disability does not make a request at 
least 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight, the carrier 
shall meet the individual's request to the extent practicable, but is 
not required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order 
to do so.
    (2) The carrier may designate an adequate number of the seats used 
to provide seating accommodations required by this section as ``priority 
seats'' for individuals with disabilities.
    (i) The carrier shall provide notice that all passengers assigned 
these seats (other than passengers with disabilities listed in paragraph 
(a) of this section) are subject to being reassigned to another seat if 
necessary to provide a seating accommodation required by this section. 
The carrier may provide this notice through its computer reservation 
system, verbal information provided by reservation personnel, ticket 
notices, gate announcements, counter signs, seat cards or notices, 
frequent-flier literature, or other appropriate means.
    (ii) The carrier shall assign a seat meeting the requirements of 
this section to an individual who requests the accommodation and checks 
in at least one hour before the scheduled departure of the flight. If 
all designated priority seats that would accommodate the individual have 
been assigned to other passengers, the carrier shall reassign the seats 
of the other passengers as needed to provide the requested 
accommodation.
    (iii) If the individual with a disability does not check in at least 
an hour before the scheduled departure of the flight, the carrier shall 
meet the individual's request to the extent practicable, but is not 
required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order to do 
so.
    (c) On request of an individual who self-identifies to a carrier as 
having a disability other than one in the four categories listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section and as needing a seat assignment 
accommodation in order to readily access and use the carrier's air 
transportation services, a carrier that assigns seats in advance shall 
provide such an accommodation, as described in this paragraph.
    (1) A carrier that complies with paragraph (a) this section through 
the ``seat-blocking'' mechanism of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
shall implement the requirements of this paragraph as follows:
    (i) When the passenger with a disability not described in paragraph 
(a) of this section makes a reservation more than 24 hours before the 
scheduled departure time of the flight, the carrier is not required to 
offer the passenger one of the seats blocked for the use of passengers 
with disabilities listed under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) However, the carrier shall assign to the passenger any seat, 
not already assigned to another passenger, that accommodates the 
passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available for assignment to 
the general passenger population at the time of the request.
    (2) A carrier that complies with this section through the 
``designated priority seats'' mechanism of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section shall implement the requirements of this paragraph as follows:
    (i) When a passenger with a disability not described in paragraph 
(a) of this section makes a reservation, the carrier shall assign to the 
passenger any seat, not already assigned to another passenger, that 
accommodates the passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available 
for assignment to the general passenger population at the time of the 
request.
    (ii) If such a passenger is assigned to a designated priority seat, 
he or she is subject to being reassigned to another seat as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) A carrier that does not provide advance seat assignments shall 
provide seating accommodations for persons described in paragraphs (a) 
and (c) of this section by allowing them to board the aircraft before 
other passengers, including other ``pre-boarded'' passengers, so that 
the individuals needing seating accommodations can select

[[Page 421]]

seats that best meet their needs if they have taken advantage of the 
opportunity to pre-board.
    (e) A carrier may comply with the requirements of this section 
through an alternative method not specified in paragraphs (b) through 
(d) of this section. A carrier wishing to do so shall obtain the written 
concurrence of the Department of Transportation (Office of the 
Secretary) before implementing the alternative method.
    (f) The carrier shall assign a seat providing an accommodation 
requested by an individual with a disability, as specified in this 
section, even if the seat is not otherwise available for assignment to 
the general passenger population at the time of the individual's 
request.
    (g) If the carrier has already provided a seat to an individual with 
a disability to furnish an accommodation required by paragraph (a) or 
(c) of this section, the carrier shall not reassign that individual to 
another seat in response to a subsequent request from another individual 
with a disability, without the first individual's consent.
    (h) In no case shall any individual be denied transportation on a 
flight in order to provide accommodations required by this section.
    (i) Carriers are not required to furnish more than one seat per 
ticket or to provide a seat in a class of service other than the one the 
passenger has purchased.
    (j) In responding to requests from individuals for accommodations 
required by this section, carriers shall comply with FAA safety rules, 
including those pertaining to exit seating (see 14 CFR 121.585 and 
135.129).
    (k) Carriers are required to comply with this section beginning 
September 30, 1998.

Sec. 382.39  Provision of services and equipment.

    Carriers shall ensure that qualified individuals with a disability 
are provided the following services and equipment:
    (a) Carriers shall provide assistance requested by or on behalf of 
qualified individuals with a disability, or offered by air carrier 
personnel and accepted by qualified individuals with a disability, in 
enplaning and deplaning. The delivering carrier shall be responsible for 
assistance in making flight connections and transportation between 
gates.
    (1) This assistance shall include, as needed, the services personnel 
and the use of ground wheelchairs, boarding wheelchairs, on-board 
wheelchairs where provided in accordance with this part, and ramps or 
mechanical lifts.
    (2) Boarding shall be by level-entry loading bridges or accessible 
passenger lounges, where these means are available. Where these means 
are unavailable, assistance in boarding aircraft with 30 or fewer 
passenger seats shall be provided as set forth in Sec. 382.40, and 
assistance in boarding aircraft with 31 or more seats shall be provided 
as set forth in Sec. 382.40a. In no case shall carrier personnel hand-
carry a passenger in order to provide boarding or deplaning assistance 
(i.e., directly pick up the passenger's body in the arms of one or more 
carrier personnel to effect a change of level that the passenger needs 
to enter or leave the aircraft). Hand-carrying of passengers is 
permitted only for emergency evacuations.
    (3) Carriers shall not leave an individual with a disability 
unattended in a ground wheelchair, boarding wheelchair, or other device, 
in which the passenger is not independently mobile, for more than 30 
minutes.
    (b) Carriers shall provide services within the aircraft cabin as 
requested by or on behalf of individuals with a disability, or when 
offered by air carrier personnel and accepted by individuals with a 
disability as follows:
    (1) Assistance in moving to and from seats, as part of the enplaning 
and deplaning processes;
    (2) Assistance in preparation for eating, such as opening packages 
and identifying food;
    (3) If there is an on-board wheelchair on the aircraft, assistance 
with the use of the on-board wheelchair to enable the person to move to 
and from a lavatory;
    (4) Assistance to a semiambulatory person in moving to and from the 
lavatory, not involving lifting or carrying the person; or

[[Page 422]]

    (5) Assistance in loading and retrieving carry-on items, including 
mobility aids and other assistive devices stowed on board in accordance 
with Sec. 382.41.
    (c) Carriers are not required to provide extensive special 
assistance to qualified individuals with a disability. For purposes of 
this section, extensive special assistance includes the following 
activities:
    (1) Assistance in actual eating;
    (2) Assistance within the restroom or assistance at the passenger's 
seat with elimination functions;
    (3) Provision of medical services.

Sec. 382.40  Boarding assistance for small aircraft.

    (a) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to air carriers 
conducting passenger operations with aircraft having 19-30 seat capacity 
at airports with 10,000 or more annual enplanements.
    (b) Carriers shall, in cooperation with the airports they serve, 
provide boarding assistance to individuals with disabilities using 
mechanical lifts, ramps, or other suitable devices that do not require 
employees to lift or carry passengers up stairs.
    (c)(1) Each carrier shall negotiate in good faith with the airport 
operator at each airport concerning the acquisition and use of boarding 
assistance devices. The carrier(s) and the airport operator shall, by no 
later than September 2, 1997, sign a written agreement allocating 
responsibility for meeting the boarding assistance requirements of this 
section between or among the parties. The agreement shall be made 
available, on request, to representatives of the Department of 
Transportation.
    (2) The agreement shall provide that all actions necessary to ensure 
accessible boarding for passengers with disabilities are completed as 
soon as practicable, but no later than December 2, 1998 at large and 
medium commercial service hub airports (those with 1,200,000 or more 
annual enplanements); December 2, 1999 for small commercial service hub 
airports (those with between 250,000 and 1,199,999 annual enplanements); 
or December 4, 2000 for non-hub commercial service primary airports 
(those with between 10,000 and 249,999 annual enplanements) . All air 
carriers and airport operators involved are jointly responsible for the 
timely and complete implementation of the agreement.
    (3) Under the agreement, carriers may require that passengers 
wishing to receive boarding assistance requiring the use of a lift for a 
flight using a 19-30 seat aircraft check in for the flight one hour 
before the scheduled departure time for the flight. If the passenger 
checks in after this time, the carrier shall nonetheless provide the 
boarding assistance by lift if it can do so by making a reasonable 
effort, without delaying the flight.
    (4) Boarding assistance under the agreement is not required in the 
following situations:
    (i) Access to aircraft with a capacity of fewer than 19 or more than 
30 seats;
    (ii) Access to float planes;
    (iii) Access to the following 19-seat capacity aircraft models: the 
Fairchild Metro, the Jetstream 31, and the Beech 1900 (C and D models);
    (iv) Access to any other 19-seat aircraft model determined by the 
Department of Transportation to be unsuitable for boarding assistance by 
lift on the basis of a significant risk of serious damage to the 
aircraft or the presence of internal barriers that preclude passengers 
who use a boarding or aisle chair to reach a non-exit row seat.
    (5) When boarding assistance is not required to be provided under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section, or cannot be provided as required by 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for reasons beyond the control of 
the parties to the agreement (e.g., because of mechanical problems with 
a lift), boarding assistance shall be provided by any available means to 
which the passenger consents, except hand-carrying as defined in Sec. 
382.39(a)(2) of this part.
    (6) The agreement shall ensure that all lifts and other 
accessibility equipment are maintained in proper working condition.
    (d)(1) The training of carrier personnel required by Sec. 382.61 
shall include, for those personnel involved in providing boarding 
assistance, training to proficiency in the use of the boarding

[[Page 423]]

assistance equipment used by the carrier and appropriate boarding 
assistance procedures that safeguard the safety and dignity of 
passengers.
    (2) Carriers who do not operate aircraft with more than a 19-seat 
capacity shall ensure that those personnel involved in providing 
boarding assistance are trained to proficiency in the use of the 
boarding assistance equipment used by the carrier and appropriate 
boarding assistance procedures that safeguard the safety and dignity of 
passengers.

<R05>
Sec. 382.40a  Boarding assistance for large aircraft.

    (a) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to air carriers 
conducting passenger operations with aircraft having a seating capacity 
of 31 or more passengers at airports with 10,000 or more annual 
enplanements, in any situation where passengers are not boarded by 
level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges.
    (b) Carriers shall, in cooperation with the airports they serve, 
provide boarding assistance to individuals with disabilities using 
mechanical lifts, ramps, or other suitable devices that do not require 
employees to lift or carry passengers up stairs.
    (c)(1) Each carrier that does not provide passenger boarding by 
level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges shall 
negotiate in good faith with the airport operator at each airport 
concerning the acquisition and use of boarding assistance devices. The 
carrier(s) and the airport operator shall, by no later than March 4, 
2002, sign a written agreement allocating responsibility for meeting the 
boarding assistance requirements of this section between or among the 
parties. The agreement shall be made available, on request, to 
representatives of the Department of Transportation.
    (2) The agreement shall provide that all actions necessary to ensure 
accessible boarding for passengers with disabilities are completed as 
soon as practicable, but no later than December 4, 2002. All air 
carriers and airport operators involved are jointly responsible for the 
timely and complete implementation of the agreement.
    (3) Under the agreement, carriers may require that passengers 
wishing to receive boarding assistance requiring the use of a lift for a 
flight check in for the flight one hour before the scheduled departure 
time for the flight. If the passenger checks in after this time, the 
carrier shall nonetheless provide the boarding assistance by lift if it 
can do so by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.
    (4) Level-entry boarding assistance under the agreement is not 
required with respect to float planes or with respect to any widebody 
aircraft determined by the Department of Transportation to be unsuitable 
for boarding assistance by lift, ramp, or other device on the basis that 
no existing boarding assistance device on the market will accommodate 
the aircraft without a significant risk of serious damage to the 
aircraft or injury to passengers or employees.
    (5) When level-entry boarding assistance is not required to be 
provided under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, or cannot be provided 
as required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section (e.g., because of 
mechanical problems with a lift), boarding assistance shall be provided 
by any available means to which the passenger consents, except hand-
carrying as defined in Sec. 382.39 (a)(2).
    (6) The agreement shall ensure that all lifts and other 
accessibility equipment are maintained in proper working condition.
    (d) The training of carrier personnel required by Sec. 382.61 shall 
include, for those personnel involved in providing boarding assistance, 
training to proficiency in the use of the boarding assistance equipment 
used by the carrier and appropriate boarding assistance procedures that 
safeguard the safety and dignity of passengers.

Sec. 382.41  Stowage of personal equipment.

    (a) All stowage of qualified individuals with a disability's 
wheelchairs and other equipment covered by this part in aircraft cabins 
shall be in accordance with 14 CFR 121.589 and 14 CFR 121.285(c) or 14 
CFR 135.87, as applicable.

[[Page 424]]

    (b) Carriers shall permit qualified individuals with a disability 
using personal ventilators/respirators to bring their equipment, 
including non-spillable batteries that meet the requirements of 49 CFR 
173.159(d) and any applicable FAA safety regulations, on board the 
aircraft and use it.
    (c) Carriers shall permit qualified individuals with a disability to 
stow canes and other assistive devices on board the aircraft in close 
proximity to their seats, consistent with the requirements of FAA safety 
regulations for carry-on items.
    (d) Carriers shall not, in implementing their carry-on baggage 
policies, count toward a limit on carry-on items any assistive device 
brought into the cabin by a qualified individual with a disability.
    (e) Carriers shall provide for on-board stowage of passengers' 
wheelchairs (including collapsible or break-down battery-powered 
wheelchairs, subject to the provisions of paragraph (g)(5) of this 
section) as carry-on baggage as follows:
    (1) Carriers shall permit the stowage of wheelchairs or components 
of wheelchairs in overhead compartments and under seats, consistent with 
the requirements of FAA safety regulations for carry-on items.
    (2) In an aircraft in which a closet or other approved stowage area 
is provided in the cabin for passengers' carry-on items, of a size that 
will accommodate a folding, collapsible, or break-down wheelchair, the 
carrier shall designate priority stowage space, as described below, for 
at least one folding, collapsible, or break-down wheelchair in that 
area. A individual with a disability who takes advantage of a carrier 
offer of the opportunity to pre-board the aircraft may stow his or her 
wheelchair in this area, with priority over the carry-on items brought 
onto the aircraft by other passengers enplaning at the same airport. A 
individual with a disability who does not take advantage of a carrier 
offer of the opportunity to preboard may use the area to stow his or her 
wheelchair on a first-come, first-served basis along with all other 
passengers seeking to stow carry-on items in the area.
    (3) If an approved stowage area in the cabin is not available for a 
folding, collapsible, or break-down wheelchair, the wheelchair shall be 
stowed in the cargo compartment.
    (f) When a folding, collapsible, or break-down wheelchair cannot be 
stowed in the passenger cabin as carry-on baggage, carriers shall 
provide for the checking and timely return of passengers' wheelchairs 
and other assistive devices as close as possible to the door of the 
aircraft, so that passengers may use their own equipment to the extent 
possible, except where this practice would be inconsistent with DOT 
regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials.
    (1) At the request of the passenger, the carrier may return 
wheelchairs or other assistive devices to the passenger at the baggage 
claim area instead of at the door of the aircraft.
    (2) In order to achieve the timely return of wheelchairs, 
passengers' wheelchairs and other assistive devices shall be among the 
first items retrieved from the baggage compartment.
    (3) Wheelchairs and other assistive devices shall be stowed in the 
baggage compartment with priority over other cargo and baggage. Where 
this priority results in passengers' baggage being unable to be carried 
on the flight, the carrier shall make its best efforts to ensure that 
the other baggage reaches the passengers' destination within four hours 
of the scheduled arrival time of the flight.
    (g) Whenever baggage compartment size and aircraft airworthiness 
considerations do not prohibit doing so, carriers shall accept a 
passenger's battery-powered wheelchair, including the battery, as 
checked baggage, consistent with the requirements of 49 CFR 
175.10(a)(19) and (20) and the provisions of paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (1) Carriers may require that qualified individuals with a 
disability wishing to have battery-powered wheelchairs transported on a 
flight (including in the cabin) check in one hour before the scheduled 
departure time of the flight. If such an individual checks in after this 
time, the carrier shall nonetheless carry the wheelchair if it can do so 
by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.

[[Page 425]]

    (2) If the battery on the individual's wheelchair has been labeled 
by the manufacturer as non-spillable as provided in 49 CFR 
173.159(d)(2), or if a battery-powered wheelchair with a spillable 
battery is loaded, stored, secured and unloaded in an upright position, 
the carrier shall not require the battery to be removed and separately 
packaged. Notwithstanding this requirement, carriers may remove and 
package separately any battery that appears to be damaged or leaking.
    (3) When it is necessary to detach the battery from the wheelchair, 
carriers shall, upon request, provide packaging for the battery meeting 
the requirements of 49 CFR 175.10(a)(19) and (20) and package the 
battery. Carriers may refuse to use packaging materials or devices other 
than those they normally use for this purpose.
    (4) Carriers shall not drain batteries.
    (5) At the request of a passenger, a carrier shall stow a folding, 
break-down or collapsible battery-powered wheelchair in the passenger 
cabin stowage area as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. If the 
wheelchair can be stowed in the cabin without removing the battery, the 
carrier shall not remove the battery. If the wheelchair cannot be stowed 
in the cabin without removing the battery, the carrier shall remove the 
battery and stow it in the baggage compartment as provided in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section. In this case, the carrier shall permit the 
wheelchair, with battery removed, to be stowed in the cabin.
    (h) Individuals with disabilities shall be permitted to provide 
written directions concerning the disassembly and reassembly of their 
wheelchairs.

Sec. 382.43  Treatment of mobility aids and assistive devices.

    (a) When wheelchairs or other assistive devices are disassembled by 
the carrier for stowage, the carrier shall reassemble them and ensure 
their prompt return to the individual with a disability. Wheelchairs and 
other assistive devices shall be returned to the passenger in the 
condition received by the carrier.
    (b) With respect to domestic transportation, the baggage liability 
limits of 14 CFR part 254 do not apply to liability for loss, damage, or 
delay concerning wheelchairs or other assistive devices. The criterion 
for calculating the compensation for a lost, damaged, or destroyed 
wheelchair or other assistive device shall be the original purchase 
price of the device.
    (c) Carriers shall not require qualified individuals with a 
disability to sign waivers of liability for damage to or loss of 
wheelchairs or other assistive devices.

<R05>
Sec. 382.45  Passenger information.

    (a) A carrier shall make available, on request, the following 
information concerning facilities and services related to the provision 
of air transportation to qualified individuals with a disability. This 
information shall pertain to the type of aircraft and, where feasible, 
the specific aircraft scheduled for a specific flight:
    (1) The location of seats, if any, with movable armrests and any 
seats which the carrier, consistent with this part, does not make 
available to qualified individuals with a disability;
    (2) Any limitations on the ability of the aircraft to accommodate 
qualified individuals with disabilities, including limitations on the 
availability of boarding assistance to the aircraft, with respect to the 
departure and destination points and any intermediate stops. The carrier 
shall provide this information to any passenger who states that he or 
she uses a wheelchair for boarding, even if the passenger does not 
explicitly request the information.
    (3) Any limitations on the availability of storage facilities, in 
the cabin or in the cargo bay, for mobility aids or other equipment 
commonly used by individuals with a disability;
    (4) Whether the aircraft has an accessible lavatory.
    (b) The following provisions govern the provision of individual 
safety briefings to qualified individuals with a disability:
    (1) Individual safety briefings shall be conducted for any passenger 
where

[[Page 426]]

required by 14 CFR 121.571 (a)(3) and (a)(4) or 14 CFR 135.117(b);
    (2) Carrier personnel may offer an individual briefing to any other 
passenger;
    (3) Individual safety briefings for qualified individuals with a 
disability shall be conducted as inconspicuously and discreetly as 
possible;
    (4) Carrier personnel shall not require any qualified individual 
with a disability to demonstrate that he or she has listened to, read, 
or understood the information presented, except to the extent that 
carrier personnel impose such a requirement on all passengers with 
respect to the general safety briefing, and shall not take any action 
adverse to a qualified individual with a disability on the basis that 
the person has not ``accepted'' the briefing.
    (c) Each carrier shall ensure that qualified individuals with a 
disability, including those with vision or hearing impairments, have 
timely access to information the carrier provides to other passengers in 
the terminal or on the aircraft (to the extent that it does not 
interfere with crewmembers' safety duties as set forth in FAA 
regulations) including, but not limited to, information concerning 
ticketing, flight delays, schedule changes, connections, flight check-
in, gate assignments, and the checking and claiming of luggage; 
Provided, That persons who are unable to obtain such information from 
the audio or visual systems used by carriers in airports or on aircraft 
shall request the information from carrier personnel. Carriers shall 
also provide information on aircraft changes that will affect the travel 
of individuals with a disability.
    (d) Carriers shall have, at each airport they use, a copy of this 
part and shall make it available for review by individuals with a 
disability on request.

<R05>
Sec. 382.47  Accommodations for persons with hearing impairments.

    (a) Each carrier providing scheduled air service, or charter service 
under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act, and which makes available 
telephone reservation and information service available to the public 
shall make available a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) 
service to enable persons with hearing impairments to make reservations 
and obtain information. The TDD service shall be available during the 
same hours as the telephone service for the general public and the 
response time for answering calls shall be equivalent. Users of the TDD 
service shall not be subject to charges for a call that exceed those 
applicable to other users of the telephone information and reservation 
service.
    (b) In aircraft in which safety briefings are presented to 
passengers on video screens, the carrier shall ensure that the video 
presentation is accessible to persons with hearing impairments.
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
carrier shall implement this requirement by using open captioning or an 
inset for a sign language interpreter as part of the video presentation.
    (2) A carrier may use an equivalent non-video alternative to this 
requirement only if neither open captioning nor a sign language 
interpreter inset could be placed in the video presentation without so 
interfering with it as to render it ineffective or would be large enough 
to be readable.
    (3) Carriers shall implement the requirements of this section by 
substituting captioned video materials for uncaptioned video materials 
as the uncaptioned materials are replaced in the normal course of the 
carrier's operations.


<R05>
Sec. 382.49  Security screening of passengers.

    (a) Qualified individuals with a disability shall undergo security 
screening in the same manner, and be subject to the same security 
requirements, as other passengers. Possession by a qualified individual 
with a disability of an aid used for independent travel shall not 
subject the person or the aid to special screening procedures if the 
person using the aid clears the security system without activating it. 
Provided, That this paragraph shall not prohibit security personnel from 
examining a mobility aid or assistive device which,

[[Page 427]]

in their judgment, may conceal a weapon or other prohibited item. 
Security searches of qualified individuals with a disability whose aids 
activate the security system shall be conducted in the same manner as 
for other passengers. Private security screenings shall not be required 
for qualified individuals with a disability to a greater extent, or for 
any different reason, than for other passengers.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a 
qualified individual with a disability requests a private screening in a 
timely manner, the carrier shall provide it in time for the passenger to 
enplane.
    (c) If a carrier employs technology that can conduct an appropriate 
screening of an individual with a disability without necessitating a 
physical search of the person, the carrier is not required to provide a 
private screening.


<R05>
Sec. 382.51  Communicable diseases.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a carrier 
shall not take any of the following actions, with respect to a person 
who is otherwise a qualified individual with a disability, on the basis 
that the individual has a communicable disease or infection:
    (1) Refuse to provide transportation to the person;
    (2) Require the person to provide a medical certificate; or
    (3) Impose on the person any condition, restriction, or requirement 
not imposed on other passengers.
    (b)(1) The carrier may take the actions listed in paragraph (a) of 
this section with respect to an individual who has a communicable 
disease or infection only if the individual's condition poses a direct 
threat to the health or safety of others.
    (2) For purposes of this section, a direct threat means a 
significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be 
eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or 
by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.
    (3) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to 
the health or safety of others, a carrier must make an individualized 
assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical 
knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: the 
nature, duration, and severity of the risk; that the potential harm to 
the health and safety of others will actually occur; and whether 
reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will 
mitigate the risk.
    (4) In taking actions authorized under this paragraph, carriers 
shall select the alternative, consistent with the safety and health of 
other persons, that is least restrictive from the point of view of the 
passenger with the communicable disease. For example, the carrier shall 
not refuse to provide transportation to an individual if provision of a 
medical certificate or reasonable modifications to practices, policies, 
or procedures will mitigate the risk of communication of the disease to 
others to an extent that would permit the individual to travel.
    (5) If an action authorized under this paragraph results in the 
postponement of a passenger's travel, the carrier shall permit the 
passenger to travel at a later time (up to 90 days from the date of the 
postponed travel) at the fare that would have applied to the passenger's 
originally scheduled trip without penalty or, at the passenger's 
discretion, provide a refund for any unused flights, including return 
flights.
    (6) Upon the passenger's request, the carrier shall provide to the 
passenger a written explanation of any action taken under this paragraph 
within 10 days of the request.
    (c) If a qualified individual with a disability with a communicable 
disease or infection of the kind described in paragraph (b) of this 
section presents a medical certificate to the carrier, as provided in 
Sec. 382.53(c)(2), the carrier shall provide transportation to the 
individual, unless it is not feasible for the carrier to implement the 
conditions set forth in the medical certificate as necessary to prevent 
the transmission of the disease or infection to other persons in the 
normal course of a flight.

individual with a disability--
    (i) Who is traveling in a stretcher or incubator;
    (ii) Who needs medical oxygen during a flight, as provided in 14 CFR 
121.574; or
    (iii) Whose medical condition is such that there is reasonable doubt 
that the individual can complete the flight safely, without requiring 
extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a 
written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the 
passenger is capable of completing a flight safely, without requiring 
extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.
    (c)(1) If a qualified individual with a disability has a 
communicable disease or infection of the kind described in Sec. 
382.51(b), a carrier may require a medical certificate.
    (2) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a 
written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the disease 
or infection would not, under the present conditions in the particular 
passenger's case, be communicable to other persons during the normal 
course of a flight. The medical certificate shall state any conditions 
or precautions that would have to be observed to prevent the 
transmission of the disease or infection to other persons in the normal 
course of a flight. It shall be dated within ten days of the date of the 
flight for which it is presented.


<R05>
Sec. 382.55  Miscellaneous provisions.

    (a) Carriers shall permit dogs and other service animals used by 
individuals with a disability to accompany the persons on a flight.

animal identification cards, other written documentation, presence of 
harnesses or markings on harnesses, tags, or the credible verbal 
assurances of the qualified individual with a disability using the 
animal.
    (2) Carriers shall permit a service animal to accompany a qualified 
individual with a disability in any seat in which the person sits, 
unless the animal obstructs an aisle or other area that must remain 
unobstructed in order to facilitate an emergency evacuation.
    (3) In the event that special information concerning the 
transportation of animals outside the continental United States is 
either required to be or is provided by the carrier, the information 
shall be provided to all passengers traveling with animals outside the 
continental United States with the carrier, including those traveling 
with service animals.
    (b) Carriers shall not require qualified individuals with a 
disability to sit on blankets.
    (c) Carriers shall not restrict the movements of individuals with a 
disability in terminals or require them to remain in a holding area or

    (a) For the purposes of this section, a disability-related complaint 
means a specific written expression of dissatisfaction received from, or 
submitted on behalf, of an individual with a disability concerning a 
difficulty associated with the person's disability, which the person 
experienced when using or attempting to use an air carrier's or foreign 
air carrier's services.
    (b) This section applies to certificated U.S. carriers and foreign 
air carriers operating to, from, and in the United States, conducting 
passenger operations with at least one aircraft having a designed 
seating capacity of more than 60 passengers. Foreign air carriers are 
covered by this section only with respect to disability-related 
complaints associated with any flight segment originating or terminating 
in the United States.
    (c) Carriers shall categorize disability-related complaints that 
they receive according to the type of disability and nature of 
complaint. Data concerning a passenger's disability must be recorded 
separately in the following areas: vision impaired, hearing impaired, 
vision and hearing impaired, mentally impaired, communicable disease, 
allergies (e.g., food allergies, chemical sensitivity), paraplegic, 
quadriplegic, other wheelchair, oxygen, stretcher, other assistive 
device (cane, respirator, etc.), and other disability. Data concerning 
the alleged discrimination or service problem related to the disability 
must be separately recorded in the following areas: refusal to board, 
refusal to board without an attendant, security issues concerning 
disability, aircraft not accessible, airport not accessible, advance 
notice dispute, seating accommodation, failure to provide adequate or 
timely assistance, damage to assistive device, storage and delay of 
assistive device, service animal problem, unsatisfactory information, 
and other.
    (d) Carriers shall submit an annual report summarizing the 
disability-related complaints that they received during the prior 
calendar year using the form specified in Appendix A to this Part. The 
first report shall cover complaints received during calendar year 2004 
and shall be submitted to the Department of Transportation by January 
25, 2005. Carriers shall submit all subsequent reports on the last 
Monday in January of that year for the prior calendar year. All 
submissions must be made through the World Wide Web except for 
situations where the carrier can demonstrate that it would suffer undue 
hardship if it were not permitted to submit the data via paper copies, 
disks, or email, and DOT has approved an exception. All fields in the 
form must be completed; carriers are to enter ``0'' where there were no 
complaints in a given category. Each annual report must contain the 
following certification signed by an authorized representative of the 
carrier: ``I, the undersigned, do certify that this report has been 
prepared under my direction in accordance with the regulations in

[[Page 432]]

14 CFR Part 382. I affirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, 
this is a true, correct, and complete report.'' Electronic signatures 
will be accepted.
    (e) Carriers shall retain correspondence and record of action taken 
on all disability-related complaints for three years after receipt of 
the complaint or creation of the record of action taken. Carriers must 
make these records available to Department of Transportation officials 
at their request.
    (f)(1) In a code-share situation, each carrier shall comply with 
paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section for--
    (i) Disability-related complaints it receives from or on behalf of 
passengers with respect to difficulties encountered in connection with 
service it provides;
    (ii) Disability-related complaints it receives from or on behalf of 
passengers when it is unable to reach agreement with its code-share 
partner as to whether the complaint involves service it provides or 
service its code-share partner provides; and
    (iii) Disability-related complaints forwarded by another carrier or 
governmental agency with respect to difficulties encountered in 
connection with service it provides.
    (2) Each carrier shall also forward to its code-share partner 
disability-related complaints the carrier receives from or on behalf of 
passengers with respect to difficulties encountered in connection with 
service provided by its code-sharing partner.
    (g) Each carrier, except for carriers in code-share situations,

PART 383_CIVIL PENALTIES--Table of Contents




Sec.
383.1 Basis and purpose.
383.2 Amount of penalty.

    Authority: Sec. 503, Pub. L. 108-176, 117 Stat. 2490.

    Source: 69 FR 41423, July 9, 2004, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 383.1  Basis and purpose.

    (a) Basis. This part implements the civil penalty provisions of 
Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Pub. L. 108-176; 
117 Stat. 2490, December 12, 2003, section 503) (Vision 100). Because 
this statute revises or reaffirms all civil penalty provisions under 49 
U.S.C. 46301, no further adjustments to account for inflation are 
required under the terms of Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment 
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-410, 104 Stat. 890) and the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, section 31001). The latter 
requires that federal agencies adjust civil penalties at least every 
four years to reflect any inflation which may have occurred.
    (b) Purpose. This part incorporates the civil penalty liability 
amounts prescribed in 49 U.S.C. 46301(a), as modified by Vision 100.


<R05>
Sec. 383.2  Amount of penalty.

    Civil penalties payable to the U.S. Government for violations of 
Title 49, Chapters 401 through 421, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 46301(a) as 
revised by Vision 100, are as follows:
    (a) A general civil penalty of not more than $25,000 (or $1,100 for 
individuals or small businesses) applies to violations of statutory 
provisions and rules or orders issued under those provisions, other than 
those listed in paragraph (b) of this section, (see 49 U.S.C. 
46301(a)(1));
    (b) With respect to small businesses and individuals, 
notwithstanding the general $1,100 civil penalty, the following civil 
penalty limits apply:
    (1) A maximum civil penalty of $10,000 applies for violations of 
most provisions of Chapter 401, including the anti-discrimination 
provisions of sections 40127 (general provision), and 41705 
(discrimination against the disabled) and rules and orders issued 
thereunder (see 49 U.S.C. 46301 (a)(5) (A));
    (2) A maximum civil penalty of $5,000 applies for violations of 
section 41719 and rules and orders issued thereunder (see 49 U.S.C. 
46301 (a)(5)(C)); and
    (3) A maximum civil penalty of $2,500 applies for violations of 
section 41712 or consumer protection rules or orders (see 49 U.S.C. 
46301 (a)(5)(D)).

Sec. 385.2  Applicability.

    This part describes the organization of the Department insofar as, 
pursuant to authority conferred on it by section 40113 of the Statute, 
the Department has adopted rules herein or elsewhere which make 
continuing assignments of authority with respect to any of its functions 
of making orders or other determinations, many of which are not required 
to be made on an evidentiary record upon notice and hearing or which are 
not the subject of contest, and Department personnel have been assigned 
to perform such functions.

[[Page 437]]

Delegations by the Secretary of Transportation to Secretarial Officers 
and the Director, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) of functions 
under Subparts I, II, and IV of the Statute appear in 49 CFR part 1. 
This part also sets forth the procedures governing discretionary review 
by the appropriate Reviewing Official of action taken under such 
assignments. Nothing in this part shall be construed as precluding the 
Department from issuing, by appropriate order, temporary delegations of

filing of otherwise unauthorized documents; waivers of procedural 
requirements; requests for hearing; requests for additional information; 
dismissal of applications upon the applicant's request, moot 
applications, or incomplete or otherwise defective applications; and

review of the staff member's decision on the merits. The dismissal of 
incomplete or otherwise defective applications under authority set forth 
in this part shall be without prejudice except where under otherwise 
applicable law the time for making application has run out or where the 
defect is not corrected within a reasonable time fixed by the staff 
member. Under the authority assigned to the staff as set forth in this 
part to approve, disapprove, grant, or deny, relief may be granted or 
denied in part and grants may be made subject to lawful and reasonable 
conditions. Moreover, where applicable, the authority to grant relief 
also includes authority to renew or extend an existing authorization.

    Unless otherwise specified, staff action shall be by order or 
informal writing (letters, telegrams, decision marked on copy of 
application form, etc.). Such orders or informal writings shall contain 
a recital that action is taken pursuant to authority assigned herein, 
shall, in cases where there are ``parties or interveners,'' or where 
there may be an adverse effect upon a person with a substantial 
interest, contain a brief reference to the right of aggrieved parties to 
petition the Reviewing Official for review pursuant to applicable 
procedural rules, including a statement of the time within which 
petitions must be filed (Sec. 385.51); shall state whether the filing 
of a petition shall preclude the action from becoming effective; and 
shall be in the name of the person exercising the assigned function. 
They shall contain all findings, determinations and conclusions which

Sec. 385.6  Referral to the Reviewing Official.

    When the staff member finds that the public interest so requires, or 
that, with respect to other than matters requiring immediate action as 
hereafter specified, there will be insufficient time for discretionary 
review of his or her decision upon petition, the staff member shall, in 
lieu of exercising the authority, submit the matter to the Reviewing 
Official for decision. In any case in which the staff member finds that 
immediate action is required with respect to any matter assigned herein, 
the disposition of which is governed by prior precedent and policy, the

a petition for review shall not preclude such action from becoming 
effective.

    Any assignment of authority to a staff member other than the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge, the Administrative Law Judge, and the Deputy

such staff member's respective superiors. In accordance with the

Sec. 385.31  Petitions for review.

    (a) Time for filing. Petitions for review shall be filed and served 
within seven (7) days after the date of the staff action to which they 
relate, but a different period may be fixed in such staff action 
consistent with effective preservation of the right to petition for 
discretionary review and the exigencies of the situation.
    (b) Contents. Petitions for review shall demonstrate that (1) a 
finding of material fact is clearly erroneous; (2) a legal conclusion is 
contrary to law, Department rules, or precedent; (3) a substantial and 
important question of policy is involved; (4) a prejudicial procedural 
error has occurred; or (5) the staff action is substantially deficient 
on its face. The petition shall briefly and specifically state the 
alleged grounds for review and the relief sought. If persons who 
participated at the staff action level set forth any new facts, 
arguments, or other new matter, an explanation must be furnished as to 
why said matter was not previously adduced at the staff action level. In 
the absence of a valid explanation, the Department may disregard such 
new matter.

requirements of Sec. Sec. 302.3 and 302.4 of this chapter. (Rules of 
practice in Economic Proceedings). Petitions shall not exceed 10 pages

who have served documents on the petitioner at the staff action level; 
and on such other persons as may be directed by the Department or the 
staff member who took the action to be reviewed.
    (e) Answers. The applicant and such other persons as disclose a 
substantial interest which would be adversely affected by the relief 
sought in the petition may, within seven (7) days after filing the 
petition, file an answer thereto. A different period for the filing of 
answers may be fixed in the staff action. Such answers shall comply with 
the form and filing requirements applicable to petitions and shall be 
served on the applicant and any other person who has theretofore served 
a document in the matter on such respondent.

pending disposition by the Department, unless the Department determines 
otherwise or unless the staff action provides otherwise in accordance 
with subpart A of this part. However, in cases where the Department's 
regulations provide that permissions or approvals are granted, or that 
other legal effects result, within a stated period from the filing with 
the Department of a prescribed document, unless the Department gives 
notice to the contrary or takes other action within said period, such 
notice given or action taken by a staff member under delegated authority 
shall toll the running of such period. A timely petition for review of 
staff action which is not stayed by its filing which is received after 
or not acted upon before the effective date of the action shall be 
entertained and disposed of on its merits as a petition for 
reconsideration.

practicable following receipt of payment.
    (e) Applications for waivers or modifications of any fees required 
to be paid to the Board under this section may be filed in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) Each applicant shall set forth briefly and succinctly the relief 
that it seeks and the reasons why such relief should be granted. Waivers 
or modifications of stated fees shall be granted only where it is 
demonstrated that such action is in the public interest because 
furnishing of the information requested can be considered as primarily 
benefiting the general public.
    (2) Applications requesting waivers or modifications of fees under 
this section shall be addressed to the Managing Director, who has been 
delegated authority by the Board to decide such applications in Sec. 
385.12 of this chapter, and shall accompany the request for service 
under this section.
    (3) The Managing Director shall either rule on the application or, 
at his discretion, pass the matter on to the Board for its 
determination. In acting upon such applications the Managing Director 
and the Board, where applicable, shall be guided by the procedures and

been granted a waiver, or
    (ii) Changes in matters pertaining to foreign air carriers that have 
been granted a waiver and that are included

Sec. 398.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish general guidelines for the 
determination of basic essential air service for each eligible place 
under 49 U.S.C. 41731 and 41732. Procedures for the determination of the 
essential air service level for a place are contained in part 325 of 
this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 398.2  Number and designation of hubs.

    (a) What is a hub? The Department considers hubs as belonging to any 
one of three classifications:
    (1) A large hub is a place accounting for at least 1.00 percent of 
the total enplanements in the United States;
    (2) A medium hub is a place accounting for at least 0.25 percent but 
less than 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States; 
and
    (3) A small hub is a place accounting for at least 0.05 percent but 
less than 0.25 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
    (b) How many hubs? (1) As a general matter, the Department will 
require service to one large or medium hub.
    (2) In Alaska or when the nearest large or medium hub is more than 
400 miles from the eligible place, the Department may instead require 
service to a small hub or nonhub.
    (3) In some cases, the Department may require service to two hubs, 
of which at least one will be a large or medium hub. The Department will 
require service to two hubs if an eligible place has close commercial, 
geographic, and political ties to both hubs and if there is sufficient 
traffic from the eligible place to support two round trips a day to both 
hubs. If traffic is not sufficient, the Department may require one round 
trip a day to both hubs if the community requests such service.
    (4) In no event will essential air service consist of service to 
more than two hubs.
    (c) Which hub? (1) In designating hubs, the Department will weigh 
all of the following factors:
    (i) The extent to which candidate hubs provide access to the 
national air transportation system;
    (ii) The commercial, geographic, and political ties of candidate 
hubs to the eligible place;
    (iii) The traffic levels to candidate hubs, as shown by traffic 
studies and origin and designation data;
    (iv) The distance of candidate hubs from the eligible place; and
    (v) The size of candidate hubs. Large size will be a positive 
factor, but principally as substantiating the access and community-ties 
factors.
    (2) For Alaska, rather than requiring service to a hub, the 
Department may instead require that service from an eligible place be 
provided to a nearby focal point for traffic which, in turn, has service 
to a hub.


<R05>
Sec. 398.3  Specific airports.

    (a) At an eligible place, essential air service may be specified as 
service to a particular airport. In the case of hyphenated places, 
essential air service will be specified as service to more than one 
airport only if clearly necessary and if the multi-airport service is 
economically feasible and justified on the basis of traffic levels at 
those airports.

[[Page 456]]

    (b) At a hub, essential air service is not usually specified as 
service to a particular airport.


<R05>
Sec. 398.4  Equipment.

    (a) Except in Alaska, service will be provided by aircraft offering 
at least 15 passenger seats, unless:
    (1) Average daily enplanements at the place did not exceed 11 
passengers for any fiscal year from 1976 through 1986;
    (2) The requirement would necessitate the payment of compensation in 
a fiscal year for service at the place when compensation would otherwise 
not be necessary; or
    (3) The affected community agrees in writing to the use of smaller 
aircraft to provide service at the place.
    (b) The aircraft must have at least two engines and use two pilots, 
unless scheduled air transportation has not been provided to the place 
in aircraft with at least two engines and using two pilots for at least 
60 consecutive operating days at any time since October 31, 1978.
    (c) The aircraft must be pressurized when the service regularly 
involves flights above 8,000 feet in altitude.
    (d) All aircraft must meet the applicable safety standards of the 
Federal Aviation Administration.
    (e) The aircraft must be conveniently accessible to passengers by 
stairs rather than over the wing.


<R05>
Sec. 398.5  Frequency of flights.

    (a) Except in Alaska, at least two round trips each weekday and two 
round trips each weekend.
    (b) In Alaska, a level of service at least equal to that provided in 
1976, or two round trips each week, whichever is greater, except that 
the Department and the appropriate State authority of Alaska may agree 
to a different level of service after consulting with the affected 
community.
    (c) An essential air service level may be set at more than that 
stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if:
    (1) Historical traffic data and studies of traffic-generating 
potential for the place indicate that more frequent service is needed to 
accommodate passengers and accompanying baggage with the aircraft used 
at that place;
    (2) More flights are needed because the capacity available to the 
eligible place is being shared with traffic destined for an intermediate 
stop or for a place beyond the eligible place;
    (3) More flights are needed to accommodate passengers because 
smaller aircraft are being used at the place;
    (4) More flights are needed in order to ensure adequate connecting 
opportunities as provided for by Sec. 398.7; or
    (5) For Alaska, the appropriate state agency agrees that more 
frequent service is needed to accommodate cargo traffic with the 
aircraft used at the eligible place.
    (d) For eligible places where traffic levels vary substantially with 
the season, a two-tier level of essential air service may be established 
with required flight frequencies changing accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 398.6  Seat guarantees.

    (a) The number of seats guaranteed at the eligible place will be 
sufficient to accommodate the estimated passenger traffic at an average 
load factor of 60 percent, except that an average load factor of 50 
percent will be used when service is provided with aircraft having fewer 
than 15 passenger seats.
    (b) Only under unusual circumstances will an eligible place's 
essential air service level be set at a number of flights that will 
accommodate more than 40 passengers a day in each direction (a total of 
80 inbound and outbound passengers). Generally, 40 passengers can be 
accommodated by guaranteeing 67 seats a day in each direction (a total 
of 134 inbound and outbound seats).
    (c) The Department may guarantee an eligible place more than 67 
seats a day if:
    (1) The number of stops between or beyond the eligible place and the 
hub results in available aircraft capacity being shared with passengers 
at those other places;
    (2) The distance between the eligible place and the designated hub 
requires the use of large aircraft;
    (3) The eligible place has suffered an abrupt and significant 
reduction in its service that warrants a temporary increase in the 
maximum guaranteed capacity; or

[[Page 457]]

    (4) Other unusual circumstances warrant guaranteeing the eligible 
place more than 67 seats a day.


<R05>
Sec. 398.7  Timing of flights.

    To qualify as essential air service, flights must depart at 
reasonable times, considering the needs of passengers with connecting 
flights at the hub. It is the policy of the Department to consider the 
reasonableness of the time in view of the purpose for which the local 
passengers are traveling. If travel is primarily to connect with other 
flights at the hub, local flight times should be designed to link with 
those flights. If travel is primarily local (i.e., to and from the hub), 
there should be at least one morning flight in each direction and one 
late-afternoon or evening flight in each direction.


<R05>
Sec. 398.8  Number of intermediate stops.

    (a) Except in Alaska, no more than one intermediate stop is 
permitted in providing essential air service between the eligible place 
and its hub, unless otherwise agreed to with the community. In cases 
where an eligible place receives service to two hubs, however, more than 
one intermediate stop is permitted between that place and its secondary 
hub.
    (b) In Alaska, more than one intermediate stop is permitted if 
required by low traffic levels at the eligible place or by the long 
distance between the eligible place and its hub.
    (c) The Department may specify nonstop service when necessary to 
make the service viable.
    (d) Where an eligible place normally is an intermediate stop that 
shares available capacity with another place, it is the policy of the 
Department either to require additional capacity (more flights or larger 
aircraft) between the eligible place and its hub or to specify some 
turnaround operations on that route segment.


<R05>
Sec. 398.9  Load factor standards.

    The load factor standards used in this part may be raised for 
individual eligible places under either of the following circumstances:
    (a) The place is served by the carrier as part of a linear route; or
    (b) It would be in the interest of the community, the carrier, or 
the general public to raise the load factor standard for that place.


<R05>
Sec. 398.10  Overflights.

    The Department considers it a violation of 49 U.S.C. 41732 and the 
air service guarantees provided under this part for an air carrier 
providing essential air service to an eligible place to overfly that 
place, except under one or more of the following circumstances:
    (a) The carrier is not compensated for serving that place and 
another carrier is providing by its flights the service required by the 
Department's essential air service determination for that place;
    (b) Circumstances beyond the carrier's control prevent it from 
landing at the eligible place;
    (c) The flight involved is not in a market where the Department has 
determined air service to be essential; or
    (d) The eligible place is a place in Alaska for which the 
Department's essential air service determination permits the overflight.


<R05>
Sec. 398.11  Funding reductions.

    (a) If, in any fiscal year, appropriations for payments to air 
carriers remain at or below the amounts estimated as necessary to 
maintain subsidy-supported essential air service at the places receiving 
such service, and Congress provides no statutory direction to the 
contrary, appropriations shall not be available for essential air 
service to otherwise eligible places within the 48 contiguous States and 
Puerto Rico that have a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of 
$200.00, or are located:
    (1) Less than 70 highway miles from the nearest large or medium hub 
airport;
    (2) Less than 55 miles from the nearest small hub airport; or
    (3) Less than 45 highway miles from the nearest nonhub airport that 
has enplaned, on certificated or commuter carriers, 100 or more 
passengers per day in the most recent year for which the Department has 
obtained complete data.

[[Page 458]]

    (b) The rate of subsidy per passenger shall be calculated by 
dividing the annual subsidy in effect as of July 1 of the prior fiscal 
year by the total origin-and-destination traffic during the most recent 
year for which the Department has obtained complete data.

        Subpart A_Applicability and Effects of Policy Statements


<R05>
Sec. 399.1  Applicability.

    All statements of general policy adopted by the Board for the 
guidance of the public will be published in this part, except as 
provided in Sec. 399.2.


<R05>
Sec. 399.2  Exclusions.

    The following types of policies are generally not included in this 
part:
    (a) Policies relating solely to the internal management of the 
Board;
    (b) Policies requiring secrecy in the public interest or in the 
interest of national defense;
    (c) Policies that are repetitive of section 102 of the Act;
    (d) Policies that are fully expressed in a procedural or substantive 
rule of the Board, or in any opinion, decision, order, certificate, 
permit, exemption, or waiver of the Board;
    (e) Expressions of encouragement or admonition to industry to follow 
a certain course of action;
    (f) Positions on legislative items and on other matters that are 
outside the scope of the Board's current statutory powers and duties.

[PS-21, 29 FR 1446, Jan. 29, 1964, as amended by PS-63, 40 FR 6643, Feb. 
13, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 399.3  Statements in other Board documents.

    No statement contained in any Board opinion, decision, order, 
certificate, permit, exemption, or waiver shall be considered a 
statement of policy within the meaning of this part, even though such 
statements may constitute a precedent in future cases or declare future 
policy to be followed in like cases. Similarly, a denial by the Board or 
relief sought, or statements of the Board's reasons for failure to issue 
a rule upon which rulemaking proceedings have been commenced shall not 
be considered statements of policy, except to the extent that it is 
specifically stated that such denial or failure is based upon a policy 
thereafter to be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 399.4  Nature and effect of policy statements.

    Policy statements published in this part will be observed by the 
Board until rescinded, but any policy may be amended from time to time 
as experience or changing conditions may require. Changes in policy may 
be made with or without advance notice to the public and will become 
effective upon publication in the Federal Register unless otherwise 
provided. If it appears to the Board, in its consideration of any matter 
before it, that the application of a policy published in this part would 
run counter to an express provision of law or policy enunciated by 
Congress in the Act, the published policy shall not be applicable to 
such matter.


<R05>
Sec. 399.5  Arrangement of policy statements.

    The statements of general policy relating to the various duties and 
functions of the Board are grouped according to subject matter in the 
following subparts; the titles of the subparts indicate the general 
subject matter included therein.

           Subpart B_Policies Relating to Operating Authority


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 399.10-399.11  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 399.12  Negotiation by air carriers for landing rights in foreign 
countries.

    (a) It is the policy of the Board (jointly with the Department of 
State) that, as a general rule, landing rights abroad for United States 
flag air carriers will be acquired through negotiation by the U.S. 
Government with foreign governments rather than by direct negotiation 
between an air carrier and a foreign government.
    (b) It is corollary to the foregoing policy that no United States 
air carrier may avail itself of representations by one foreign 
government to further its interest with another foreign government, 
especially with respect to landing rights, except insofar as such 
representations have been specifically authorized by the U.S. 
Government.

[[Page 460]]


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 399.13-399.17  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 399.18  Maximum duration of fixed-term route authorization 
granted by exemption; renewal of such authority.

    It is the policy of the Board to limit the duration of exemptions 
which authorize fixed-term route service to a maximum period of two 
years, and to entertain requests for renewal of such authority only when 
incorporated in a duly filed application for substantially equivalent 
certificate authority under section 401 of the Act. (See Sec. 377.10(c) 
of this chapter (Special Regulations).)

<R05>
Sec. 399.19  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 399.21  Charter exemptions (except military).

    In deciding applications for exemptions from section 41102 of Title 
49 of the United States Code by air carriers seeking to perform charter 
service in air transportation, we will give primary weight to the 
chartering public's own assessment of the air carrier services that best 
meet its transportation needs. Therefore, we will not, as a general 
rule, consider as relevant to our decision on such applications, 
objections based upon (1) offers by the objectors to perform the charter 
service, and/or (2) estimates of revenue or traffic diversion, unless in 
the latter case the objectors demonstrate that the diversion resulting 
from grant of the exemption would threaten their ability to fulfill 
their certificate obligations.

[PS-78, 43 FR 31886, July 24, 1978, as amended at 60 FR 43531, Aug. 22, 
1995]


<R04>
            Subpart C_Policies Relating to Rates and Tariffs


<R05>
Sec. 399.30  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    DPFI formula fare means the trunk coach formula fare on July 1, 
1977, as established by the Board in Phase 9 of the Domestic Passenger 
Fares Investigation (Docket 21866-9).
    SIFL means the standard industry fare level, as set forth in Sec. 
399.31.

[PS-92, 45 FR 24118, Apr. 9, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 399.31  Standard industry fare level.

    (a) Generally. Except as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, 
the standard industry fare level (``SIFL'') for coach/standard service 
in a market is equal to the predominant fare in effect in that market on 
July 1, 1977, as adjusted by the Board for cost increases.
    (b) Predominant fare. For each market, the predominant fare in 
effect on July 1, 1977, is presumed to be as set forth below. The 
presumption may be rebutted, however, by showing that more passengers 
used a higher fare.
    (1) For U.S. Mainland-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands markets where the 
Board has specified day-of-week fare differentials: the peak-season 
midweek fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.
    (2) For U.S. Mainland-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands markets where the 
Board has specified only seasonal fare differentials: the off-peak-
season fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.
    (3) For U.S. Mainland-Hawaii markets: the peak-season second class 
fare appearing in tariffs in effect on July 1, 1977.
    (4) For all other interstate and overseas markets: the lowest 
unrestricted fare in effect on July 1, 1977.
    (c) Adjustments for cost increases. The Board adjusts the SIFL at 
least once every 6 months by the percentage change, since the previous 
adjustment, in the actual operating cost per available seat-mile for 
interstate and overseas transportation combined. The method of 
adjustment is illustrated in the example set out at the end of this 
subpart.
    (d) Intrastate markets in California, Florida, and Texas. For each 
of these markets, the SIFL is equal to the level that it would be if the 
market were an interstate one whose predominant fare on July 1, 1977, 
was the DPFI formula fare.
    (e) Intra-Hawaii markets. For intra-Hawaii markets, the Board's 
flexibility zones are based not on the SIFL, but on the standard 
Hawaiian fare level (``SHFL''), which is equal to 110 percent of the 
first class fare in effect on

[[Page 461]]

July 1, 1977, as adjusted by the Board for cost increases.

[PS-92, 45 FR 24118, Apr. 9, 1980, as amended by PS-95, 45 FR 42255, 
June 24, 1980; PS-96, 45 FR 48604, July 21, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 399.32  Zone of limited suspension for domestic passenger fares.

    (a) Applicability. This section sets forth the Board's policy on 
passenger fares for scheduled service by certificated air carriers in 
the following areas, except to the extent that greater flexibility is 
set forth in Sec. 399.33:
    (1) Within the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia 
(``the Mainland''); and
    (2) Between the Mainland and Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, 
Hawaii, or Alaska.
    (b) Downward flexibility. Each carrier may set fares in each market 
at any amount below the SIFL. The Board will not suspend such a fare on 
the ground that its level is unreasonable, except in the following 
extraordinary circumstances:
    (1) There is a high probability that the fare would be found to be 
unlawful after investigation;
    (2) There is a substantial likelihood that the fare is predatory so 
that there would be an immediate and irreparable harm to competition if 
the fare were allowed to go into effect;
    (3) The harm to competition is greater than the injury to the 
traveling public if the proposed fare were unavailable; and
    (4) The suspension is in the public interest.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Upward flexibility. Each carrier may set fares above the SIFL as 
follows, and where they are so set, the Board will not suspend them on 
the grounds that their level is unreasonable except upon a clear showing 
of abuse of market power that the Board does not expect to be corrected 
through marketplace forces:
    (1) For service on the Mainland: Up to 30 percent above the sum of 
the SIFL plus $14. Each time after January 13, 1981, that the Board 
adjusts the SIFL for cost increases in accordance with Sec. 399.31(c), 
it will adjust the $14 figure by the same percentage rounded to the 
nearest whole dollar. The Board order announcing the adjustment will be 
published in the Federal Register and served on all certificated 
carriers, and copies will be available through the Domestic Fares and 
Rates Division, Bureau of Domestic Aviation, Civil Aeronautics Board, 
Washington, D.C. 20428.
    (2) For service between the Mainland and Puerto Rico, the Virgin 
Islands, Hawaii, or Alaska: Up to 30 percent above the SIFL.
    (e) Fares above the zone. Tariff filings that state fares above the 
applicable zone must include the data and information set forth in Sec. 
221.165 of this chapter. For peak fares, this must include a description 
of the carrier's off-peak fares that are available in the market. The 
Board will suspend a fare above the zone that it finds not to be 
justified by cost or competitive factors.

[PS-94, 45 FR 40973, June 17, 1980, as amended by PS-96, 45 FR 48604, 
July 21, 1980; PS-101, 46 FR 11809, Feb. 11, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 399.33  Additional fare flexibility.

    For scheduled service in the areas set forth in Sec. 399.32(a), 
certificated air carriers have the following fare flexibility in 
addition to that set forth in Sec. 399.32:
    (a) First class. Carriers may without restriction set the level of 
first class fares.
    (b) Small aircraft. Carriers may without restriction set the level 
of fares for service with aircraft designed to have a maximum passenger 
capacity of 60 or fewer seats.
    (c) Through service and on-line connecting service. For through 
service and on-line connecting service, carriers may set their fares up 
to the sum of the local fares minus one tax-rounded coach ceiling 
terminal charge for each local fare after the first, if that level is 
higher than the ceiling set forth in Sec. 399.32(d). The Board will not 
suspend such a fare on the ground that its level is unreasonable except 
upon a clear showing of abuse of market power that the Board does not

Sec. 399.34  Intra-Hawaii and Intra-Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands fare 
flexibility.

    For scheduled service within Hawaii, and within and between Puerto 
Rico and the Virgin Islands, certificated air carriers have the fare 
flexibility set forth in Sec. Sec. 399.32 and 399.33, except that:
    (a) Instead of the limits set forth in Sec. 399.32(d), the upper 
limit of the zone for Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands is 30 percent above the 
SIFL, and for Hawaii is 30 percent above the SHFL; and
    (b) The fare flexibility set forth in Sec. 399.33(a) (first class) 
does not apply to service within Hawaii.

Sec. 399.35  Special tariff permission.

    (a) Definition. As used in this section, to grant STP means to 
approve a carrier's application for Special Tariff Permission to file a 
tariff on less than the statutory notice set forth in Sec. 221.160(a) 
of this chapter.
    (b) Lower fares, rates, and charges. It is the policy of the Board 
to grant STP for tariffs that state lower fares, rates, or charges and 
any rules affecting only those lower fares, rates, or charges, except 
that:
    (1) The Board will not grant STP to match a tariff filed on 
statutory notice; and
    (2) The Board will not grant STP if the proposed fares, rates, 
charges, or rules raise significant questions of lawfulness, that is, 
could reasonably be expected to be found unjust or unreasonable, 
unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential, unduly prejudicial, or 
predatory, under current statutory or Board guidelines. In these 
situations, if the carrier files the tariff on statutory notice and at 
the same time applies for STP to advance the tariff's effective date, 
the Board will use its best efforts to act within 15 days to grant or 
deny STP.
    (c) Higher fares or rates. For tariffs that state higher fares or 
rates, and any rules affecting only those fares or rates, the Board's 
policy on STP is, except in unusual or emergency circumstances:
    (1) To grant STP if the resulting fares or rates are within a 
statutory or Board-established zone of fare or rate flexibility; and
    (2) Otherwise, to deny STP.

Sec. 399.36  Unreasonable discrimination.

    (a) As used in this section:
    (1) Unreasonable discrimination means unjust discrimination or 
unreasonable preference or prejudice; and
    (2) Rate means rate, fare, or charge.

[[Page 464]]

    (b) Except in unusual circumstances or as provided in paragraph (c) 
of this section, the Board will find a rate for domestic air 
transportation to constitute unreasonable discrimination only if:
    (1) There is a reasonable probability that the rate will result in 
significant long-run economic injury to passengers or shippers;
    (2) The rate is in fact discriminatory according to a reasonable 
cost allocation or other rational basis;
    (3) The rate does not provide transportation or other statutorily 
recognized benefits that justify the discrimination; and
    (4) Actual and potential competitive forces cannot reliably be 
expected to eliminate the undesirable effects of the discrimination 
within a reasonable period.
    (c) A rate that discriminates on the basis of the status of the 
traffic carried will not be presumed to be unreasonably discriminatory, 
unless the use of the status categories in question is contrary to 
established national anti-discrimination policy.

Sec. 399.37  Joint fares.

    There should be joint fares in all markets over all routings within 
the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia as follows:
    (a) Level. The level shall not exceed the sum of the maximum local 
fares permitted by this subpart minus one tax-rounded coach ceiling 
terminal charge for each interline connection, and in any event shall 
not exceed the sum of the actual local fares.
    (b) Division. Joint fares shall be divided according to the relative 
costs of the mileage flown by each carrier participating in the 
interline movement. However, where a joint fare is equal to the sum of 
the actual local fares, each carrier shall get the local fare as its 
share.

Sec. 399.39  Equipment purchase deposits.

    Equipment purchase deposits are advance payments made by air 
carriers to manufacturers for the purchase of equipment to be delivered 
in the future, or funds segregated by air carriers for this purpose. It 
is the policy of the Board not to recognize equipment purchase deposits 
in an air carrier's investment base for ratemaking purposes. When 
equipment is acquired by an air carrier and placed in air-transport 
service, the Board will recognize in the air carrier's investment base 
interest on purchase deposits on such equipment capitalized and 
amortized in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and Reports 
for Certificated Air Carriers (part 241 of this chapter).

    The Board will not approve or accept any tariff filings for

January 1, 1983. Any tariffs for such transportation that do not specify 
an earlier expiration date shall expire at midnight on December 31,

    (a) Applicability. This section states the Board's policy for 
suspending rate changes for the transportation of property in foreign 
air transportation. It does not affect the Board's authority to suspend 
any rate as unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential, or unduly 
prejudicial. This section applies to rate changes by all direct air 
carriers and direct foreign air carriers.
    (b) Standard foreign rate levels. For each market in foreign air 
transportation, the standard foreign rate level for the carriage of 
property shall be the bulk general commodity rates in effect in that 
market on April 1, 1982, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
this section. However, the general commodity rate for shipments larger 
than 500 kg. shall be deemed to be the same as the 500 kg. rate for the 
purposes of this paragraph, regardless of any different rate in effect 
in the market.

[[Page 465]]

    (c) Ceilings of limited rate suspension. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will not suspend as 
unreasonable any proposed rate for foreign air transportation of 
property equal to or less than the following levels:
    (1) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in the Atlantic region, 20 
percent above the standard foreign rate level.
    (2) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in the Pacific region, 15 
percent above the standard foreign rate level.
    (3) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in the Western Hemisphere 
region (except Mexico and Canada), 5 percent above the standard foreign 
rate level.
    (4) For all bulk rates (GCR's and SCR's) in Canada/Mexico 
transborder markets, 10 percent above the standard foreign rate level 
for the Western Hemisphere.
    (5) For all container rates, no maximum level.
    (d) Extraordinary circumstances. The Board may suspend any tariff if 
it finds that:
    (1) The suspension is in the public interest because of unreasonable 
regulatory action by a foreign government with respect to rate proposals 
of an air carrier, or
    (2) All of the following extraordinary circumstances are present:
    (i) It is highly probable that the fare would be found unreasonable 
after investigation;
    (ii) There is a substantial likelihood of immediate and irreparable 
harm to the public if the rate is allowed to go into effect; and
    (iii) The suspension is required by the public interest.
    (e) Burden of proof. Persons requesting tariff suspension under 
paragraph (d) of this section shall have the burden of producing 
convincing evidence that the conditions of that paragraph are present.
    (f) Standard foreign rate level adjustments. (1) The Board will 
periodically adjust the standard foreign rate levels to reflect the 
percentage change in average operating costs per available ton-mile 
since the previous adjustment.
    (2) Costs will be averaged for three regions--the Atlantic, the 
Pacific, and Western Hemisphere--and applied equally among all markets 
in each region.
    (3) Cost computations will be based on scheduled freighter and 
combination service by U.S. air carriers.
    (4) Adjustments will be made on April 1 and October 1 of each year, 
or more frequently as the Board finds appropriate.
    (5) In computing costs under this section, the Board will make no 
adjustments for load factors, aircraft utilization, or other matters due 
to operational decisions made solely by carrier management. However, the 
Board retains the discretion to normalize costs for strikes, mandatory 
aircraft groundings, and other occurrences not solely due to management 
decisions.
    (g) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
    (1) GCR means general commodity rate.
    (2) SCR means specific commodity rate.
    (3) Container rate means any rate specifically applicable to 
property tendered to the carrier in a unit load devise.

Sec. 399.42  Flight equipment depreciation and residual values.

    For rate-making purposes, for air carriers receiving subsidy under 
section 406 of the Act, it is the policy of the Board that flight 
equipment depreciation will be based on the conventional straight-line 
method of accrual, employing the service lives and residual values set 
forth below:

<R05>
Sec. 399.43  Treatment of leased aircraft.

    In determining the appropriate treatment of leased aircraft for 
ratemaking purposes, it is the Board's policy to recognize actual rental 
expenses. In unusual circumstances where the leased aircraft value 
(determined on a constructive depreciated basis) in relation to net book 
value of owned aircraft operated by the same air carrier is 
significantly in excess of the ratio for the aggregate of the domestic 
trunklines and local service carriers (computed on the same basis), a 
reasonable profit element may be added which shall reflect the 
additional risks of operations with the leased aircraft, to the extent 
that such risks are not compensated by the return on investment. Such 
profit element would be determined by applying the standard rate of 
return, less 6 percentage points, to the value of the leased aircraft, 
on a constructive depreciated basis, to the extent the ratio of such 
value to depreciated cost of owned aircraft plus the value of leased 
aircraft exceeds the average for the domestic air carriers. Rental cost 
plus allowable profit, if any, will not be recognized in amounts 
exceeding depreciation plus return on investment computed as if the 
aircraft had been purchased by the carrier.

[PS-44, 36 FR 7229, Apr. 16, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 399.44  Treatment of deferred Federal income taxes for rate purposes.

    For rate-making purposes other than the determination of subsidy 
under section 406(b), it is the policy of the Board that Federal income 
tax expense should be based on the normal taxes that would be paid under 
the depreciation standards used for rate making, and that accumulated 
reserves for deferred taxes should be excluded from the recognized 
capitalization for rate-base purposes.

Subpart D [Reserved]


<R04>
             Subpart E_Policies Relating to Hearing Matters


<R05>
Sec. 399.60  Standards for determining priorities of hearing.

    (a) General. This policy statement describes the general standards 
which will be used by the Board in determining the order in which it 
will designate for hearing those matters on its docket which are to be 
decided after notice and hearing. Among such matters are applications 
for certificates of public convenience and necessity or for foreign air 
carrier permits; applications under section 408 of the Act for approval 
of consolidations or acquisitions of control; complaint cases; and 
various rate-making proceedings.
    (b) Standards. Matters will be assigned for hearing in accordance 
with the degree of relative priority which each matter is entitled to on 
the basis of the comparative public interest involved therein. Among 
other things, the Board will take into account:
    (1) Statutory requirements for preference or statutory limitations 
on the time within which the Board shall act;
    (2) The impact of delay on the public or particular persons;
    (3) The need for promptly securing compliance with the provisions of 
the Act;
    (4) The time for which the matter has already been pending and which 
would be required to dispose of it;
    (5) Whether the application requests renewal of an existing 
temporary authorization; and
    (6) In matters relating to operating authority:
    (i) Whether a proposal might reduce subsidy or increase economy of 
operations;
    (ii) Whether an application proposes new service;
    (iii) The volume of traffic that might be affected by the grant or 
denial of the proposal;
    (iv) The period that has elapsed since the Board considered the 
service needs of the places or areas involved; and
    (v) The relative availability of necessary staff members of the 
carriers, communities and the Board, in the light of other proceedings 
already in progress, to handle the processing of the case.

Interested persons may urge upon the Board such considerations as they 
believe should lead it to accord a particular application a priority 
different from that which the Board has given it.


<R05>
Sec. 399.61  Presentations of public and civic bodies in route 
proceedings.

    For the purpose of implementing the Board's policy to provide for 
the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence 
and otherwise to expedite route proceedings, and in light of experience, 
the following guidelines are hereby established:
    (a) Public and civic bodies which represent the same geographic area 
or community should consolidate their presentation of evidence, briefs 
or oral argument to the examiner and the Board;
    (b) A public body or a civic organization, or several such bodies or 
organizations whose presentation of evidence is consolidated, should 
keep to a minimum the number of witnesses used to present the factual 
evidence in support of the community's position;
    (c) Exhibits offered in evidence by a public body or civic 
organization should be limited to evidence of the economic 
characteristics of the community and area involved, data as to community 
of interest and traffic, evidence with respect to the sufficiency of 
existing service, and airport data, and should not include data relating 
to number of electricity, water and gas meters, telephones, schools, 
freight car loadings, building permits, sewer connections, or volume of 
bank deposits in the community.


<R05>
Sec. 399.62  Target dates in hearing cases.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to initial and recommended 
decisions of administrative law judges, final decisions, and decisions 
on petitions for review or reconsideration in cases in which the Board 
has ordered a trial-type hearing before an administrative law judge.
    (b) Issuance of target dates. In cases to which this section 
applies, the Board or the administrative law judge, as the situation 
calls for, shall issue a notice of the target date for the completion of

[[Page 469]]

the initial or recommended decision, final decision, or decision on a 
petition for review or reconsideration. The Board or the administrative 
law judge shall endeavor to render the pending decision not later than 
the target date.
    (c) Time for promulgating target dates. (1) In the case of initial, 
recommended, or final decisions, notice of target dates shall be issued, 
served, and filed within 20 days of the submission of closing briefs, or 
the conclusion of oral argument to the administrative law judge or the 
Board, as may be appropriate.
    (2) In the case of petitions for review or for reconsideration, 
notices of target dates shall be issued, served, and filed within 20 
days of the date for the filing of answers: Provided, That, in the case 
of petitions for reconsideration of Board decisions awarding new route 
authority, the Board shall, in lieu of issuing individual target dates, 
endeavor to render its decision no later than the day preceding the 
effective date of the new authority awarded.

Apr. 28, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 399.63  Role of staff in route proceedings.

    (a) General. This policy statement establishes the standards 
applicable to staff participation in oral hearing cases involving award 
of route authority.
    (b) Standards. The staff's role during such hearings, primarily 
because it acts in the broad public interest, and not for a particular 
private or local interest, is to assure that essential evidence is 
introduced to resolve the public interest issues; that the evidence 
submitted by the parties is subject to adversary testing, and that 
decisional options are developed with the public interest in mind. In 
route cases designated by the Board that offer the opportunity for 
developing new policies to adapt to the administration of the Federal 
Aviation Act or that raise unusual evidentiary issues, a prehearing 
presentation by staff of decisional options will contribute to a better 
trial record, be consistent with traditional notions of fundamental 
fairness, better serve the Board's decisionmaking needs and ultimately 
serve the public interest. In any route case where the Board has not 
required the staff to participate by making a prehearing presentation, 
the staff shall present a prehearing presentation of decisional options 
if the administrative law judge finds that there exists unusual policy 
or evidentiary issues which clearly require such a presentation. We 
believe it is not desirable for the staff to advocate the adoption of a 
single decisional option at the outset of a case. Accordingly,
    (1) In route cases designated by the Board that offer the 
opportunity for developing new policies, the staff shall make a 
prehearing presentation of the decisional options available, and 
describe the kinds of evidence needed or available to develop each 
option. The staff need not and should not be required to develop 
evidence on each option. In every case, after the close of the hearing, 
however, the staff shall advocate a position based upon one or more of 
the decisional options identified in its prehearing presentation or 
developed at trial.
    (2) In any route case in which the administrative law judge finds 
that there exists unusual policy or evidentiary issues clearly requiring 
a prehearing presentation, the staff shall submit a prehearing statement 
of the decisional options available.
    (3) To the extent possible, the Board, in its instituting orders, 
will identify or designate the cases which involve the development of 
new policies or unusual evidentiary issues that will require the type of 
staff participation described in Sec. 399.63(b)(1).

               Subpart G_Policies Relating to Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 399.80  Unfair and deceptive practices of ticket agents.

    It is the policy of the Board to regard any of the following 
enumerated practices (among others) by a ticket agent as an unfair or 
deceptive practice or unfair method of competition:
    (a) Misrepresentations \1\ which may induce members of the public to 
believe that the ticket agent is an air carrier.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The word ``misrepresentation'' used in this list includes any 
statement or representation made in advertising or made orally to 
members of the public which is false, fraudulent, deceptive or 
misleading, or which has the tendency or capacity to deceive or mislead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Using or displaying or permitting or suffering to be used or 
displayed the name, trade name, slogan or any abbreviation thereof, of 
the ticket agent, in advertisements, on or in places of business, or on 
aircraft in connection with the name of an air carrier with whom it does 
business, in such manner that it may mislead or confuse the traveling 
public with respect to the agency status of the ticket agent.
    (c) Misrepresentations as to the quality or kind of service, type or 
size of aircraft, time of departure or arrival, points served, route to 
be flown, stops to be made, or total trip-time from point of departure 
to destination.
    (d) Misrepresentation as to qualifications of pilots or safety 
record or certification of pilots, aircraft or air carriers.
    (e) Misrepresentations that passengers are directly insured when 
they are not so insured; for example, where the only insurance in force 
is that protecting the air carrier in event of liability.
    (f) Misrepresentations as to fares and charges for air 
transportation or services in connection therewith.
    (g) Misrepresentation that special discounts or reductions are 
available, when such discounts or reductions are not specific in the 
lawful tariffs of the air carrier which is to perform the 
transportation.
    (h) Advertising or otherwise offering for sale or selling air 
transportation or services in connection therewith at less than the 
rates, fares and charges specified in the currently effective tariffs of 
the air carrier or air carriers who are engaged to perform such air 
transportation or services, or offering or giving rebates or other 
concessions thereon, or assisting, suffering or permitting persons to 
obtain such air transportation or services at less than such lawful 
rates, fares and charges.
    (i) Misrepresentations that special priorities for reservations are 
available when such special considerations are not in fact granted to 
members of the public generally.
    (j) Selling air transportation to persons on a reservation or 
charter basis for specified space, flight, or time, or representing that 
such definite reservation or charter is or will be available or has been 
arranged, without a binding commitment with an air carrier for the 
furnishing of such definite reservation or charter as represented or 
sold.
    (k) Selling or issuing tickets or other documents to passengers to 
be exchanged or used for air transportation knowing or having reason to 
know or believe that such tickets or other documents will not be or 
cannot be legally honored by air carriers for air transportation.
    (l) Failing or refusing to make proper refunds promptly when service 
cannot

[[Page 471]]

be performed as contracted or representing that such refunds are 
obtainable only at some other point, thus depriving persons of the 
immediate use of the money to arrange other transportation, or forcing 
them to suffer unnecessary inconveniences and delays or requiring them 
to accept transportation at higher cost, or under less desirable 
circumstances, or on less desirable aircraft than that represented at 
the time of sale.
    (m) Misrepresentations regarding the handling, forwarding or routing 
of baggage or other property, or the loss or tracing thereof, or failing 
or refusing to honor proper claims for loss of or damage to baggage or 
other property.
    (n) Misrepresentation as to the requirements that must be met by 
persons or organizations in order to qualify for charter or group fare 
flights.


<R05>
Sec. 399.81  Unrealistic or deceptive scheduling.

    (a) It is the policy of the Board to consider unrealistic scheduling 
of flights by any air carrier providing scheduled passenger air 
transportation to be an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair 
method of competition within the meaning of section 411 of the Act.
    (b) With respect to the advertising of scheduled performance, it is 
the policy of the Board to regard as an unfair or deceptive practice or 
an unfair method of competition the use of any figures purporting to 
reflect schedule or on-time performance without indicating the basis of 
the calculation, the time period involved, and the pairs of points or 
the percentage of systemwide operations, thereby represented and whether 
the figures include all scheduled flights or only scheduled flights 
actually performed.

<R05>
Sec. 399.82  Passing off of carrier identity by affiliation between 
carriers.

    (a) Applicability. This policy shall apply to proceedings in which 
the Board, in exercising its regulatory powers with respect to air 
carriers and foreign air carriers, is required to determine whether 
carriers have engaged in unfair or deceptive practices, or unfair 
methods of competition. The standards herein shall not be construed to 
supersede any action previously taken by the Board in a particular 
proceeding dealing with the subject matter of this statement, but to the 
extent not inconsistent therewith shall provide standards which 
supplement, or implement such specific Board action. The limitation of 
this policy statement to certain affiliated carriers should not be 
construed as an indication that the Board will permit other carriers to 
pass off by means of activities which are inconsistent with the minimum 
safeguards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. In such cases the 
Board may determine in an adjudicatory proceeding that the activities 
engaged in have a tendency to pass off and constitute an unfair or 
deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition.
    (b) Definition. For the purpose of this statement, the term 
affiliation, as between an air carrier and a foreign air carrier, shall 
mean that one of the carriers directly or indirectly has one of the 
following relationships to the other:
    (1) Owns or controls 10 percent or more of the securities of the 
other, with or without an accompanying power to vote;
    (2) Is in control of the other within the meaning of section 408 of 
the Act;
    (3) Has any of the interlocking relationships described in section 
409 of the Act;
    (4) Is jointly controlled with the other carrier, directly or 
indirectly by a third person;
    (5) Provides general agency services for the other carrier.

For the purpose of this statement, general agency services shall mean 
services performed under an agreement between an air carrier and a 
foreign air carrier which provides for the general representation of one 
by the other in a specified area or point, in relation to services such 
as the following: Solicitation and sale of passenger, express, and cargo 
transportation; airport transportation and hotel accommodations; local 
advertising and publicity, local sales offices; passenger services; 
local government representation; purchase,

[[Page 472]]

lease or other acquisition of equipment; or aircraft and transit 
services, aircraft inspection, aircraft dispatch.
    (c) Minimum safeguards. The minimum safeguards which the Board will 
consider as adequate to foreclose passing off by affiliated carriers are 
as follows:
    (1) An air carrier and any affiliated foreign air carrier shall not 
engage in joint public relations activities at points served by both 
carriers which tend to pass off the services of one carrier as the 
services of the other carrier or as part of a unified system of which 
each is a part;
    (2) Where one affiliated carrier provides general agency services 
for the other carrier, at points served by both carriers, it shall 
specifically identify all flights of the other carrier as flights of 
that carrier without reference to any relationship to the carrier 
performing the agency services;
    (3) All forms of display (including aircraft insignia), scheduled 
publications, advertising, or printed matter employed by affiliated 
carriers shall not state or imply that the services of either carrier 
are performed in common with the other carrier or as part of a single 
system. In cases where it is necessary to indicate that any agency 
service is performed by one affiliated carrier for the other, the 
references to the carrier performing the agency should be sufficiently 
subordinated to the name of the other carrier as to emphasize the 
limited role of the agent;
    (4) Telephone facilities at points served by both carriers should 
preserve the identity of the individual carriers;
    (5) Where joint traffic or sales facilities are maintained by 
affiliated carriers, the separate identity of each carrier should be 
maintained by reasonably comparable use of display advertising, desk-
space, personnel uniforms, and other facilities and activities;
    (6) Where one carrier sells time payment tickets for travel over the 
other carrier (except interline travel), the application form should 
identify the carrier performing the transportation;
    (7) The respective personnel of the affiliated carriers shall 
preserve the individual identity of the respective carriers in all 
public dealings.
    (d) Unfair and deceptive practice. It is the policy of the Board to 
regard any joint activity of an affiliated air carrier and a foreign air 
carrier as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of 
competition where such joint activity does not satisfy the minimum 
safeguards enumerated in the preceding subsection.
    (e) Exceptions. Exceptions to a safeguard set forth in paragraph (c) 
of this section may be recognized for activities in a foreign country if 
the Board finds that special circumstances pertaining to the country 
render the safeguard inappropriate. Exceptions on other grounds may be 
recognized pursuant to Sec. 399.4.

[PS-29, 30 FR 13781, Oct. 29, 1965]


<R05>
Sec. 399.83  Unfair or deceptive practice of air carrier, foreign air 
carrier, or ticket agent in orally confirming to prospective passenger 
reserved space on scheduled flights.

    It is the policy of the Board to consider the practice of an air 
carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, of stating to a 
prospective passenger by telephone or other means of communication that 
a reservation of space on a scheduled flight in air transportation is 
confirmed before a passenger has received a ticket specifying thereon 
his confirmed reserved space, to be an unfair or deceptive practice and 
an unfair method of competition in air transportation or the sale 
thereof within the meaning of section 411 of the Act, unless the tariff 
of the particular air carrier or foreign air carrier provides for 
confirmation of reserved space by the means so used.

[PS-58, 39 FR 38096, Oct. 29, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 399.84  Price advertising.

    The Board considers any advertising or solicitation by a direct air 
carrier, indirect air carrier, or an agent of either, for passenger air 
transportation, a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and 
ground accommodations), or a tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that 
states a price for such air transportation, tour, or tour component to 
be an unfair or deceptive practice, unless the price stated is the 
entire price to be paid by the customer to the air carrier, or agent, 
for such air

transportation, tour, or tour component.

Sec. 399.86  Payments for non-air transportation services for air cargo.

    The Board considers that payments by air carriers and foreign air 
carriers to shippers, indirect air carriers, or foreign indirect air 
carriers for non-air transportation preparation of air cargo shipments 
are for services ancillary to the air transportation, and are not 
prohibited under section 403 of the Act.

                      Relationships of Air Carriers


<R05>
Sec. 399.91  Air carrier participation in programs of technical 
assistance to airlines of less developed countries.

    (a) Applicability. This policy shall apply to proceedings under 
sections 408, 409, and 412 of the Act in which the Board is required to 
make any determination as to the public interest or consistency with the 
Act of any agreement or relationship sought to be entered into by an air 
carrier, or officer or director thereof, with a foreign airline in 
connection with the performance of some activity pursuant to a technical 
assistance contract financed by an agency of the U.S. Government.
    (b) Policy. It is the policy of the Board that all U.S. air carriers 
interested in performing contracts for aviation technical assistance to 
foreign airlines should have equal access to information necessary to 
bid on such contracts, and should be given equal consideration 
thereafter in the award of such contracts based upon customary 
contracting criteria and subject to the considerations set forth below:
    (1) The air carrier selected should possess the necessary technical 
and managerial skills and economic strength to perform the assigned task 
in the recipient country to the credit of the United States. Where 
familiarity with the particular language and culture of the recipient 
country are important to the success of the proj ect, weight should be 
given to the capabilities of all interested carriers in this regard, 
including particularly those which a route carrier may have acquired 
through service to the country or area.
    (2) Where a single U.S. route carrier is serving or is certificated 
to serve the recipient country or the region in which it is located, and 
where initiation or continued operation of the route by such carrier is 
an important national interest objective of the United States, weight 
should be given to any evidence that an award of the contract to the 
route carrier as opposed to any other U.S. carrier would be held to 
achieve this objective.
    (3) An air carrier performing a technical assistance contract will 
necessarily occupy a close special relationship with the airline and 
government of the recipient country. Over and above the terms of any 
specific contract, there is latent in such relationship the possibility 
of a relative preference for such carrier over a competing U.S. air 
carrier in matters of interline traffic, governmental restrictions, etc. 
Accordingly, where more than one U.S. route carrier is certificated to 
serve the recipient country and more than one such carrier wishes to 
perform the technical assistance, none of such carriers should be 
awarded the contract over the objection of any other except under very 
unusual circumstances.
    (4) Technical assistance contracts should contain realistic 
objectives and require competent performance at reasonable cost and 
within a reasonable period of time consistent with the ability of the 
foreign airline to become self-sufficient.
    (5) Technical assistance contracts should not be awarded to a U.S. 
route carrier with major economic interests hostile to those of the U.S. 
route carrier serving the country.
    (6) Technical assistance contracts should not be awarded to 
subsidized carriers except under special circumstances. Such 
circumstances should include at least a showing (i) that the subsidized 
carrier has special qualifications, the utilization of which

[[Page 474]]

is required in the national interest by the circumstances of a 
particular program, and (ii) that performance of the contract will not 
interfere with the primary business of the subsidized carrier which is 
to provide air transportation in the United States. In the latter 
connection, it is to be recognized that participation with maximum 
effectiveness in a technical assistance program would not only divert 
the attention of top management from certificated services but might 
also involve the assignment of the most competent senior operational and 
technical personnel, the diversion of funds at least on a short-term 
basis, and the possible transfer from certificated services of aircraft 
and related equipment. Normally, therefore, unless substantial evidence 
and arguments are produced to the contrary, participation by subsidized 
carriers in technical assistance programs will be considered 
inconsistent with the public interest.

<R05>
Sec. 399.101  Public release of Board decisions in cases where the 
action of the Board is subject to the review or approval of the President.

    (a) By Executive Order 11920, 41 FR 23665 (June 11, 1976), effective 
July 11, 1976, the President has authorized the issuance for public 
inspection of decisions by the Board in cases where the action of the 
Board is subject to the review or approval of the President in 
accordance with section 801 of the Federal Aviation Act. In the interest 
of national security, and in order to allow for consideration of 
appropriate action under Executive Order 11652, Executive Order 11920 
provides that decisions shall be withheld from public disclosure for 
five days after submission to the President but may be released on or 
after the sixth day following receipt by the President as to all 
unclassified portions of the text if the Board is not notified by the 
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or his designee 
that all or part of the decision shall be withheld from public 
disclosure.
    (b) It is the policy of the Board to release to the public all 
decisions by the Board in section 801 cases as promptly as possible 
following submission of such decision to the President. Upon receipt of 
notice by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs 
as required by the Executive Order, the Board shall promptly provide one 
copy for public inspection in the Docket Section and one copy for public 
inspection and copying in the Public Reference Room, and shall promptly 
thereafter print and process the decision for more general distribution 
in accordance with Board procedures. Where the Board is required to 
withhold portions of the text of its decision it shall make public those 
portions of its decision which may be publicly released. Where the Board 
is required to withhold public release of its decision in its entirety 
it shall nonetheless publicly indicate that its decision has been 
transmitted to the President. The Board shall not publicly indicate that 
its decision has been transmitted to the President in those cases in 
which the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or 
his designee determines that classification of the existence of the 
decision is appropriate and so informs the Board. The provisions are 
also applicable to decisions submitted to the President for review 
pursuant to section 801(b) of the Act.

private sites involving rockets powered by a motor or motors having a 
total impulse of 200,000 pound-seconds or less and a total burning or 
operating time of less than 15 seconds, and a rocket having a ballistic 
coefficient-i.e., gross weight in pounds divided by frontal area of 
rocket vehicle-less than 12 pounds per square inch.
    Associate Administrator means the Associate Administrator for 
Commercial Space Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, or any 
person designated by the Associate Administrator to exercise the 
authority or discharge the responsibilities of the Associate 
Administrator.
    Contingency abort means cessation of vehicle flight during ascent or 
descent in a manner that does not jeopardize public health and safety 
and the safety of property, in accordance with mission rules and 
procedures. Contingency abort includes landing at an alternative 
location that has been designated as a contingency abort location in 
advance of vehicle flight.

[[Page 480]]

    Emergency abort means cessation of vehicle flight during ascent or 
descent in a manner that minimizes risk to public health and safety and 
the safety of property. Emergency abort involves failure of a vehicle, 
safety-critical system, or flight safety system such that contingency 
abort is not possible.
    Federal launch range means a launch site, from which launches 
routinely take place, that is owned and operated by the government of 
the United States.
    Flight safety system means a system designed to limit or restrict 
the hazards to public health and safety and the safety of property 
presented by a launch vehicle or reentry vehicle while in flight by 
initiating and accomplishing a controlled ending to vehicle flight. A 
flight safety system may be destructive resulting in intentional break 
up of a vehicle or nondestructive, such as engine thrust termination 
enabling vehicle landing or safe abort capability.
    Hazardous materials means hazardous materials as defined in 49 CFR 
172.101.
    Launch means to place or try to place a launch vehicle or reentry 
vehicle and any payload from Earth in a suborbital trajectory, in Earth 
orbit in outer space, or otherwise in outer space, and includes 
activities involved in the preparation of a launch vehicle for flight, 
when those activities take place at a launch site in the United States. 
The term launch includes the flight of a launch vehicle and pre-flight 
ground operations beginning with the arrival of a launch vehicle or 
payload at a U.S. launch site. For purposes of an ELV launch, flight 
ends after the licensee's last exercise of control over its launch 
vehicle. For purposes of an orbital RLV launch, flight ends after 
deployment of a payload for an RLV having payload deployment as a 
mission objective. For other orbital RLVs, flight ends upon completion 
of the first sustained, steady-state orbit of an RLV at its intended 
location.
    Launch accident means
    (1) A fatality or serious injury (as defined in 49 CFR 830.2) to any 
person who is not associated with the flight;
    (2) Any damage estimated to exceed $25,000 to property not 
associated with the flight that is not located at the launch site or 
designated recovery area.
    (3) An unplanned event occurring during the flight of a launch 
vehicle resulting in the known impact of a launch vehicle, its payload 
or any component thereof:
    (i) For an expendable launch vehicle (ELV), outside designated 
impact limit lines; and
    (ii) For an RLV, outside a designated landing site.
    Launch incident means an unplanned event occurring during the flight 
of a launch vehicle, other than a launch accident, involving a 
malfunction of a flight safety system or safety-critical system or 
failure of the licensee's safety organization, design or operations.
    Launch operator means a person who conducts or who will conduct the 
launch of a launch vehicle and any payload.
    Launch site means the location on Earth from which a launch takes 
place (as defined in a license the Secretary issues or transfers under 
this chapter) and necessary facilities at that location.
    Launch vehicle means a vehicle built to operate in, or place a 
payload in, outer space or a suborbital rocket.
    Mishap means a launch or reentry accident, launch or reentry 
incident, launch site accident, failure to complete a launch or reentry 
as planned, or an unplanned event or series of events resulting in a 
fatality or serious injury (as defined in 49 CFR 830.2), or resulting in 
greater than $25,000 worth of damage to a payload, a launch or reentry 
vehicle, a launch or reentry support facility or government property 
located on the launch or reentry site.
    Operation of a launch site means the conduct of approved safety 
operations at a permanent site to support the launching of vehicles and 
payloads.
    Operation of a reentry site means the conduct of safety operations 
at a permanent site on Earth at which a reentry vehicle and its payload, 
if any, is intended to land.
    Payload means an object that a person undertakes to place in outer 
space by means of a launch vehicle, including components of the vehicle 
specifically designed or adapted for that object.

[[Page 481]]

    Person means an individual or an entity organized or existing under 
the laws of a state or country.
    Reenter; reentry means to return or attempt to return, purposefully, 
a reentry vehicle and its payload, if any, from Earth orbit or from 
outer space to Earth. The term ``reenter; reentry'' includes activities 
conducted in Earth orbit or outer space to determine reentry readiness 
and that are critical to ensuring public health and safety and the 
safety of property during reentry flight. The term ``reenter; reentry'' 
also includes activities conducted on the ground after vehicle landing 
on Earth to ensure the reentry vehicle does not pose a threat to public 
health and safety or the safety of property.
    Reentry accident means any unplanned event occurring during the 
reentry of a reentry vehicle resulting in the known impact of the 
reentry vehicle, its payload, or any component thereof outside a 
designated reentry site; a fatality or serious injury (as defined in 49 
CFR 830.2) to any person who is not associated with the reentry; or any 
damage estimated to exceed $25,000 to property not associated with the 
reentry and not located within a designated reentry site.
    Reentry incident means any unplanned event occurring during the 
reentry of a reentry vehicle, other than a reentry accident, involving a 
malfunction of a reentry safety-critical system or failure of the 
licensee's safety organization, procedures, or operations.
    Reentry operator means a person responsible for conducting the 
reentry of a reentry vehicle as specified in a license issued by the 
FAA.
    Reentry site means the location on Earth where a reentry vehicle is 
intended to return. It includes the area within three standard 
deviations of the intended landing point (the predicted three-sigma 
footprint).
    Reentry vehicle means a vehicle designed to return from Earth orbit 
or outer space to Earth substantially intact. A reusable launch vehicle 
that is designed to return from Earth orbit or outer space to Earth 
substantially intact is a reentry vehicle.
    Reusable launch vehicle (RLV) means a launch vehicle that is 
designed to return to Earth substantially intact and therefore may be 
launched more than one time or that contains vehicle stages that may be 
recovered by a launch operator for future use in the operation of a 
substantially similar launch vehicle.
    Safety-critical means essential to safe performance or operation. A 
safety-critical system, subsystem, condition, event, operation, process 
or item is one whose proper recognition, control, performance or 
tolerance is essential to system operation such that it does not 
jeopardize public safety.
    Vehicle safety operations personnel means those persons whose job 
performance is critical to public health and safety or the safety of 
property during RLV or reentry operations.
    State and United States means, when used in a geographical sense, 
the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and any 
other commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States; and
    United States citizen means:
    (1) Any individual who is a citizen of the United States;
    (2) Any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, or 
other entity organized or existing under the laws of the United States 
or any State; and
    (3) Any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association, or 
other entity which is organized or exists under the laws of a foreign 
nation, if the controlling interest in such entity is held by an 
individual or entity described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this 
definition. Controlling interest means ownership of an amount of equity 
in such entity sufficient to direct management of the entity or to void 
transactions entered into by management. Ownership of at least fifty-one 
percent of the equity in an entity by persons described in paragraph (1) 
or (2) of this definition creates a rebuttable presumption that such 
interest is controlling.

notice is impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, 
a notice of proposed rulemaking is issued and interested persons are 
invited to participate in proceedings related to each substantive rule 
proposed.
    (b) Unless the Associate Administrator determines that notice and 
comment is necessary or desirable, interpretive rules, general 
statements of policy, and rules relating to organization, procedure, or

    (a) Any person may petition the Associate Administrator for an 
extension of time to submit comments in response to a notice of proposed 
rulemaking. The petition shall be submitted in duplicate not less than 
three days before expiration of the time stated in the notice. The 
filing of the petition does not automatically extend the time for 
petitioner's comments.
    (b) The Associate Administrator grants the petition only if the 
petitioner shows a substantive interest in the proposed rule and good 
cause for the extension, and if the extension is in the public interest. 
If an extension is granted, it is granted as to all persons and is 
published in the Federal Register.

[53 FR 11013, Apr. 4, 1988, as amended by Amdt. 404-2, 68 FR 35289, June

<R05>
Sec. 406.7  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 406.9  Civil penalties.

    (a) Civil penalty liability. Under 49 U.S.C. 70115(c), a person 
found by the FAA to have violated a requirement of the Act, a regulation 
issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license issued or 
transferred under the Act, is liable to the United States for a civil 
penalty of not more than $100,000 for each violation, as adjusted for 
inflation. A separate violation occurs for each day the violation 
continues.
    (b) Delegations. The authority to impose civil penalties is 
exercised by an agency attorney as described in Sec. 406.105.
    (c) Notice of proposed civil penalty. A civil penalty action is 
initiated when the agency attorney advises a person, referred to as the 
respondent, of the

[[Page 486]]

charges or other reasons upon which the FAA bases the proposed action 
and allows the respondent to answer the charges and to be heard as to 
why the civil penalty should not be imposed. A notice of proposed civil 
penalty states the facts alleged; any requirement of the Act, a 
regulation issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license 
issued or transferred under the Act allegedly violated by the 
respondent; and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than 
30 days after receipt of the notice of proposed civil penalty the 
respondent may elect to proceed by one or more of the following:
    (1) Pay the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed upon 
amount, in which case the agency attorney will issue either an order 
imposing civil penalty or a compromise order in that amount.
    (2) Submit to the agency attorney one of the following:
    (i) Written information, including documents and witnesses 
statements, demonstrating that a violation did not occur or that a 
penalty, or the amount of the proposed penalty, is not warranted by the 
circumstances.
    (ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the 
amount of reduction, and the reasons and any document supporting a 
reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a 
financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the 
proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in 
business.
    (iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the 
matter with the agency attorney and to submit relevant information.
    (3) Request that a final notice of proposed civil penalty be issued 
so that the respondent may request a hearing in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (d) Final notice of proposed civil penalty. A final notice of 
proposed civil penalty (final notice) provides the last opportunity for 
the respondent to request a hearing.
    (1) The agency attorney issues a final notice if one of the 
following occurs:
    (i) The respondent fails to respond to the notice of proposed civil 
penalty not later than 30 days after the date the respondent received 
the notice of proposed civil penalty.
    (ii) The parties have not agreed to a resolution of the action after 
participating in informal procedures under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (iii) The respondent requests the issuance of a final notice in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Not later than 15 days after the date the respondent received 
the final notice of proposed civil penalty, the respondent shall do one

upon amount, in which case the agency attorney issues either an order 
imposing civil penalty or a compromise order in that amount.
    (ii) Request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (e) Order imposing civil penalty. An order imposing civil penalty is 
the final order of the Secretary imposing a civil penalty. An order 
imposing civil penalty is issued for a violation described in paragraph 
(a) of this section after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    (1) The agency attorney either issues an order imposing civil 
penalty, or another document becomes an order imposing civil penalty, as 
described below.
    (i) The agency attorney issues an order imposing civil penalty if, 
in response to a notice of proposed civil penalty or a final notice of 
proposed civil penalty, the respondent pays or agrees to pay a civil 
penalty in the amount proposed or an agreed upon amount (other than an 
agreement for a compromise order under paragraph (f) of this section).
    (ii) Unless the respondent requests a hearing not later than 15 days 
after the date the respondent received a final notice of proposed civil 
penalty, the final notice of proposed civil penalty becomes an order 
imposing civil penalty.
    (iii) Unless an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker in 
accordance with Sec. 406.175, if the administrative law judge finds 
that a violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an 
amount found appropriate by the administrative law judge, is warranted, 
an initial decision of an administrative

[[Page 487]]

law judge under subpart B of this part becomes an order imposing civil 
penalty.
    (iv) Unless a complaint is filed with a United States district court 
in accordance with Sec. 406.176, if the FAA decisionmaker finds that a 
violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an amount 
found appropriate by the FAA decisionmaker, is warranted, a final 
decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker under subpart B of this part 
becomes an order imposing civil penalty. If a person seeks judicial 
review not later than 60 days after the final decision and order has 
been served on the respondent, the final decision and order is stayed.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) Compromise order. The agency attorney at any time may agree to 
compromise any civil penalty with no finding of violation. Under such 
agreement, the agency attorney issues a compromise order stating:
    (1) The respondent agrees to pay a civil penalty.
    (2) The FAA makes no finding of a violation.
    (3) The compromise order may not be used as evidence of a prior 
violation in any subsequent civil penalty action or license action.
    (g) Request for hearing. Any respondent who has been issued a final 
notice of proposed civil penalty may, not later than 15 days after the 
date the respondent received the final notice, request a hearing under 
subpart B of this part.
    (1) The respondent must file a written request for hearing with the 
Docket Management System (Docket Management System, U.S. Department of 
Transportation, Room PL 401, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20590-0001) and must serve a copy of the request on the agency attorney. 
Sections 406.113 and 406.115 state how filing and service must be done.
    (2) The request for hearing must be dated and signed.
    (h) Method of payment. A respondent must pay a civil penalty by 
check or money order, payable to the Federal Aviation Administration.
    (i) Collection of civil penalties. If a respondent does not pay a 
civil penalty imposed by an order imposing civil penalty or a compromise 
order within 60 days after service of the final order, the FAA may refer 
the order to the United States Department of Treasury or Department of 
Justice to collect the civil penalty.
    (j) Exhaustion of administrative remedies. A respondent may seek 
judicial review of a final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker 
as provided in Sec. 406.179. A respondent has not exhausted 
administrative remedies for purposes of judicial review if the final 
order is one of the following:
    (1) An order imposing civil penalty issued by an agency attorney 
under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) A final notice of proposed civil penalty that becomes an order 
imposing civil penalty under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) An initial decision of an administrative law judge that was not 
appealed to the FAA decisionmaker.
    (4) A compromise order under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (k) Compromise. The FAA may compromise or remit a civil penalty that 
has been proposed or imposed under this section.

Chief Counsel for Litigation.

    (a) The Docket Management System (DMS). (1) Documents filed in a 
civil penalty adjudication are kept in the Docket Management System 
(DMS), except for documents that contain confidential information in 
accordance with Sec. 406.117. The DMS is an electronic docket. 
Documents that are filed are scanned into the electronic docket and an 
index is made of all documents that have been filed so that any person 
may view the index and documents as provided in paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (2) A party is not required to file written interrogatories and 
responses, requests for production of documents or tangible items and 
responses, and requests for admission and responses with the Docket 
Management System or submit them to administrative law judge, except as 
provided in Sec. 406.143.
    (b) Method of filing. A person filing a document must mail or 
personally deliver the signed original and one copy of each document to 
the DMS at Docket Management System, U.S. Department of Transportation, 
Plaza Level 401, 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590-0001. A 
person must serve a copy of each document on each party in accordance 
with Sec. 406.115.
    (c) Date of filing. The date of filing is the date of personal 
delivery; or if mailed, the mailing date shown on any certificate of 
service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of 
service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no 
certificate of service or postmark. The date shown in the DMS index is 
not necessarily the date of service. It is the date the DMS received the 
document.
    (d) Form. DMS scans the documents into its electronic docket. To 
ensure that DMS can scan the document and correctly identify it in the 
index, each person filing a document must comply with the following:
    (1) Each document must be legible. It may be handwritten, 
typewritten, or printed from a computer.
    (2) Each document must have a caption on its first page, clearly 
visible, with the following information:
    (i) ``FAA Space Adjudication.''
    (ii) Case name, such as ``In the matter of X Corporation.''
    (iii) FAA Case Number and DMS docket number, if assigned.
    (iv) Name of the document being filed, including the party filing 
the document, such as ``Respondent's Motion to Dismiss.''
    (v) ``Confidential information filed with administrative law judge'' 
or ``Confidential information filed with Assistant Chief Counsel for 
Litigation'' if the party is filing confidential information under Sec. 
406.117.
    (3) The document must be capable of being scanned and be easy to 
read both in paper form and as scanned into the electronic docket. A 
document that meets the following specifications is capable of being 
scanned using automatic feeders and is easy to read both in paper form 
and as scanned into the electronic docket. Documents that do not meet 
these specifications may not be legible.
    (i) On white paper.
    (ii) On paper not larger than 8\1/2\ by 11 inches.
    (iii) In black ink.

    (vi) Margins at least 1 inch on each side.
    (vii) The original not bound or hole-punched, only held together 
with removable metal clips or the like. The copy that is filed or sent 
to the administrative law judge or Assistant Chief Counsel for 
Litigation, and the copy served on another party, need not meet this 
specification.
    (viii) The original has no tabs. The copy that is filed or sent to 
the administrative law judge or Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation, 
and the copy served on another party, need not meet this specification.
    (e) Sending documents to the administrative law judge or Assistant 
Chief Counsel for Litigation. Sending the document directly to the

under Sec. 406.117.
    (f) Viewing and copying the record. Any person may view and copy the 
record, except for confidential information, as follows:

Sec. 406.115  Serving documents on other parties.

    (a) Service required. A person must serve on each other party at the 
time of filing a copy of any document filed with the Docket Management 
System. Service on a party's attorney or representative of record is 
adequate service on the party.
    (b) Method of service. A person must serve documents by personal 
delivery or by mail.
    (c) Certificate of service. A person may attach a certificate of 
service to a document filed with the DMS. Any certificate of service

document, that the document was served on each party, the method of 
service, and the date of service.
    (d) Date of service. The date of service is the date of personal 
delivery; or if mailed, the mailing date shown on the certificate of 
service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of 
service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no 
certificate of service or postmark. The date shown in the DMS index is 
not necessarily the date of service. It is the date the DMS received the 
document.
    (e) Additional time after service by mail. Whenever a party has a 
right or a duty to act or to make any response within a prescribed 
period after service by mail, or on a specified date after service by

judge must serve a copy of each document including, but not limited to, 
notices of pre-hearing conferences and hearings, rulings on motions, 
decisions, and orders, upon each party to the proceedings by personal 
delivery or by mail.
    (g) Service made. A document is deemed served in accordance with 
this subpart if it was properly addressed; was sent in accordance with 
this subpart; and was returned, not claimed, or refused. Service is 
considered valid as of the date and the time that the document was 
mailed, or personal delivery of the document was refused.
    (h) Presumption of service. There is a presumption of service where 
a party or a person, who customarily receives mail, or receives it in 
the ordinary course of business, at either the person's residence or the 
person's principal place of business, acknowledges receipt of the 
document.


<R05>
Sec. 406.117  Confidential information.

    (a) Filing confidential information. If a party wants certain 
information that the party is filing not made available to the public, 
the party must do the following:
    (1) Place the information in a separate sealed envelope and clearly 
mark the envelope ``CONFIDENTIAL.'' At least the first page of the 
document in the envelope also must be marked ``CONFIDENTIAL.''
    (2) Attach to this envelope a cover document marked ``Confidential 
information filed with administrative law judge'' or ``Confidential 
information filed with Assistant Chief Counsel for Litigation.'' The 
cover document must include, at the least, a short statement of what is 
being filed, such as ``Respondent's motion for confidentiality order.''
    (3) Unless such a motion has already been granted, enclose a motion 
for confidentiality order in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section. The motion must be in the sealed envelope if it contains 
confidential information; otherwise the motion must be outside of the 
sealed envelope.
    (b) Marked information not made public. If a party files a document 
in a sealed envelope clearly marked ``CONFIDENTIAL'' the document may 
not

[[Page 492]]

be made available to the public unless and until the administrative law 
judge or the FAA decisionmaker decides it may be made available to the 
public in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 70114.
    (c) Motion for confidentiality order. If a party is filing, is 
requested to provide in discovery, or intends to offer at the hearing, 
information that the party does not wish to be available to the public, 
the party must file a motion for a confidentiality order.
    (1) The party must state the specific grounds for withholding the 
information from the public.
    (2) If the party claims that the information is protected under 49 
U.S.C. 70114, and if both the complainant and the respondent agree that 
the information is protected under that section, the administrative law 
judge must grant the motion. If one party does not agree that the 
information is protected under 49 U.S.C. 70114 the administrative law 
judge must decide. Either party may file an interlocutory appeal of 
right under Sec. 406.173(c).
    (3) If the party claims that the information should be protected on 
grounds other than those provided by 49 U.S.C. 70114 the administrative 
law judge must grant the motion if, based on the motion and any response 
to the motion, the administrative law judge determines that disclosure 
would be detrimental to safety, disclosure would not be in the public 
interest, or that the information is not otherwise required to be made 
available to the public.
    (4) If the administrative law judge determines that the information 
is not necessary to decide the case or would not otherwise lead to the 
discovery of relevant material, the administrative law judge must 
preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.
    (5) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material may be disclosed during discovery, the administrative law judge 
may order that the material may be discovered and disclosed under 
limited conditions or may be used only under certain terms and 
conditions.
    (6) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material is necessary to decide the case, or would otherwise lead to the 
discovery of relevant material, and that a confidentiality order is 
warranted, the administrative law judge must--
    (i) Provide an opportunity for review of the document by the 
attorneys of record off the record.
    (ii) Provide procedures for excluding the information from the 
record, or order that portion of the record that includes confidential 
information be closed.
    (iii) Order that the parties must not disclose the information in 
any manner and the parties must not use the information in any other 
proceeding.
    (7) If an administrative law judge orders a record closed, in whole 
or in part:
    (i) The closed record is not available to the public.
    (ii) The closed record is available to the parties' attorneys of 
record.
    (iii) The administrative law judge may determine whether the closed 
record is available to the parties, the parties' representatives, or 
other persons such as witnesses for a party.
    (iv) No party, attorney of record, representative of record, or 
person who receives information from such persons, may disclose 
information that has been protected under this section except to a 
person authorized by this section or the administrative law judge to 
receive it.

a request for hearing. The complainant should suggest a location for the 
hearing when filing the complaint.
    (2) Service. The complainant must personally deliver or mail a copy

representative who has filed a notice of appearance in accordance with 
Sec. 406.107.
    (3) Contents of complaint. The final notice of proposed civil 
penalty issued under Sec. 406.9(d) may be filed as the complaint. A 
complaint must set forth the following in sufficient detail to provide 
notice:
    (i) The facts alleged.
    (ii) Any requirement of the Act, a regulation issued under the Act, 
or any term or condition of a license issued or transferred under the 
Act allegedly violated by the respondent.
    (iii) The proposed civil penalty.
    (b) Answer--(1) Time for filing. The respondent must file an answer 
to the complaint, or may file a written motion pursuant to Sec. 
406.141(f)(2) instead of filing an answer, not later than 30 days after

shall treat a general denial of the complaint as a failure to file an 
answer.

dismiss a request for a hearing as prematurely filed instead of filing a 
complaint. If the motion is not granted, the complainant must file the 
complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later 
than 10 days after service of the administrative law judge's ruling or 
order on the motion to dismiss. If the motion to dismiss is granted and 
the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, the respondent may

decision on appeal, the complainant must file a complaint and must serve 
a copy of the complaint on each party not later than 10 days after

    (2) Respondent's motions instead of an answer. A respondent may file 
one or more of the following motions instead of filing an answer. If the

answer not later than 10 days after service of the denial of the motion.
    (i) Respondent's motion to dismiss complaint for failure to state a 
claim for

[[Page 496]]

which a civil penalty may be imposed. A respondent may file a motion to 
dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for which a civil 
penalty may be imposed instead of filing an answer. The motion must show 
that the complaint fails to state a violation of the Act, a regulation 
issued under the Act, or any term or condition of a license issued or 
transferred under the Act.
    (ii) Respondent's motion to dismiss allegations or complaint for 
staleness. Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, a respondent 
may move to dismiss the complaint, or that part of the complaint that 
alleges a violation that occurred more than 5 years before an agency 
attorney issued a notice of proposed civil penalty to the respondent, as 
provided by 28 U.S.C. 2462.
    (iii) Respondent's motion for more definite statement. A respondent 
may file a motion requesting a more definite statement of the 
allegations contained in the complaint instead of filing an answer. The 
respondent must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain 
allegations contained in a complaint or response to any pleading and 
must submit the details that the party believes would make the 
allegation or response definite and certain. If the administrative law 
judge grants the motion, the complainant must supply a more definite 
statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling granting 
the motion. If the complainant fails to supply a more definite 
statement, the administrative law judge must strike the allegations in 
the complaint to which the motion is directed. If the administrative law 
judge denies the motion, the respondent must file an answer and must 
serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 10 days after 
service of the order of denial.
    (3) Other motions to dismiss. A party may file a motion to dismiss, 
specifying the grounds for dismissal.
    (4) Complainant's motion for more definite statement. The 
complainant may file a motion requesting a more definite statement if an 
answer fails to respond clearly to the allegations in the complaint. The 
complainant must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or uncertain 
allegations contained in the answer and must submit the details that the 
complainant believes would make the allegation or response definite and 
certain. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, the 
respondent must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days 
after service of the ruling on the motion. If the respondent fails to 
supply a more definite statement, the administrative law judge must 
strike those statements in the answer to which the motion is directed. 
An administrative law judge shall treat a respondent's failure to supply 
a more definite statement as an admission of unanswered allegations in 
the complaint.
    (5) Other motions for more definite statement. A party may file a 
motion for more definite statement of any pleading that requires or 
permits a response under this subpart. A party must set forth, in 
detail, each indefinite or uncertain allegation contained in a pleading 
or response and must submit the details that would make each allegation 
definite and certain.
    (6) Motion to strike. Any party may make a motion to strike any 
insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or 
irrelevant matter in a pleading. A party must file a motion to strike 
and must serve a copy on each party before a response to that pleading 
is required under this subpart or, if a response is not required, not 
later than 10 days after service of the pleading.
    (7) Motion for decision. A party may make a motion for decision, 
regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the 
administrative law judge has issued an initial decision in the 
proceedings. The administrative law judge must grant a party's motion 
for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, 
admissions, matters that the administrative law judge has officially 
noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no 
genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is 
entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party making the motion 
for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of 
material fact disputed by the parties.
    (8) Motion for disqualification. A party may file a motion for 
disqualification. A party may file the motion at any

[[Page 497]]

time after the administrative law judge has been assigned to the 
proceedings but must make the motion before the administrative law judge 
files an initial decision in the proceedings.
    (i) Motion and supporting affidavit. A party must state the grounds 
for disqualification, including, but not limited to, personal bias, 
pecuniary interest, or other factors showing reason for 
disqualification, in the motion for disqualification. A party must 
submit an affidavit with the motion for disqualification that sets 
forth, in detail, the matters alleged to constitute grounds for 
disqualification.
    (ii) Answer. A party may respond to the motion for disqualification 
not later than 5 days after service of the motion for disqualification.
    (iii) Decision on motion for disqualification. The administrative 
law judge must issue a decision on the motion for disqualification not 
later than 15 days after the motion has been filed. If the 
administrative law judge finds that the motion for disqualification and 
supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the 
administrative law judge must withdraw from the proceedings immediately. 
If the administrative law judge finds that disqualification is not 
warranted, the administrative law judge must deny the motion and state 
the grounds for the denial on the record. If the administrative law 
judge fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 15 
days after the motion has been filed, the motion is granted.


<R05>
Sec. 406.143  Discovery.

    (a) Initiation of discovery. Any party may initiate discovery 
described in this section, without the consent or approval of the 
administrative law judge, at any time after a complaint has been filed.
    (b) Methods of discovery. The following methods of discovery are 
permitted under this section: depositions on oral examination or written 
questions of any person; written interrogatories directed to a party; 
requests for production of documents or tangible items to any person; 
and requests for admission by a party. A party is not required to file 
written interrogatories and responses, requests for production of 
documents or tangible items and responses, and requests for admission 
and responses with the Docket Management System or submit any of them to 
the administrative law judge. In the event of a discovery dispute, a 
party must attach a copy of these documents in support of a motion filed 
under this section.
    (c) Service on the agency. A party must serve each discovery request 
directed to the agency or any agency employee with the agency attorney.
    (d) Time for response to discovery request. Unless otherwise 
directed by this subpart or agreed by the parties, a party must respond 
to a request for discovery, including filing objections to a request for 
discovery, not later than 30 days after service of the request.
    (e) Scope of discovery. Subject to the limits on discovery set forth 
in paragraph (f) of this section, a party may discover any matter that 
is not privileged and that is relevant to the subject matter of the 
proceeding. A party may discover information that relates to the claim 
or defense of any party including the existence, description, nature, 
custody, condition, and location of any document or other tangible item 
and the identity and location of any person having knowledge of 
discoverable matter. A party may discover facts known, or opinions held, 
by an expert who any other party expects to call to testify at the 
hearing. A party has no ground to object to a discovery request on the 
basis that the information sought would not be admissible at the hearing 
if the information sought during discovery is reasonably calculated to 
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (f) Limiting discovery. The administrative law judge must limit the 
frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party 
shows that--
    (1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
    (2) The information requested can be obtained from another less 
burdensome and more convenient source;

[[Page 498]]

    (3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity 
to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted 
under this section; or
    (4) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is 
unduly burdensome or expensive.
    (g) Confidentiality order. A party or person who has received a 
discovery request for information that is related to a trade secret, 
confidential or sensitive material, competitive or commercial 
information, proprietary data, or information on research and 
development, may file and serve a motion for a confidentiality order in 
accordance with Sec. 406.117.
    (h) Protective order. A party or a person who has received a request 
for discovery may file a motion for protective order and must serve a 
copy of the motion for protective order on each party. The party or 
person making the motion must show that the protective order is 
necessary to protect the party or the person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. As part of the 
protective order, the administrative law judge may:
    (1) Deny the discovery request;
    (2) Order that discovery be conducted only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time or place for discovery 
or a determination of the method of discovery; or
    (3) Limit the scope of discovery or preclude any inquiry into 
certain matters during discovery.
    (i) Duty to supplement or amend response. A party who has responded 
to a discovery request has a duty to supplement or amend the response, 
as soon as the information is known, as follows:
    (1) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question 
requesting the identity and location of any person having knowledge of 
discoverable matters.
    (2) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question 
requesting the identity of each person who will be called to testify at 
the hearing as an expert witness and the subject matter and substance of 
that witness' testimony.
    (3) A party must supplement or amend any response that was incorrect 
when made or any response that was correct when made but is no longer 
correct, accurate, or complete.
    (j) Depositions. The following rules apply to all depositions taken 
pursuant to this section:
    (1) Form. A deposition must be taken on the record and reduced to 
writing. The person being deposed must sign the deposition unless the 
parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.
    (2) Administration of oaths. Within the United States, or a 
territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, a party must take a deposition before a person authorized to 
administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the 
law of the place where the examination is held. In a foreign country, a 
party must take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure.
    (3) Notice of deposition. A party must serve a notice of deposition, 
stating the time and place of the deposition and the name and address of 
each person to be examined,on the person to be deposed, must submit the 
notice to the administrative law judge, and must file the notice with 
the Docket Management System, and must serve the notice on each party, 
not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may serve a notice 
of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only with consent 
of the administrative law judge. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be 
served on the person to be examined, the party must attach to the notice 
of deposition a copy of the subpoena duces tecum that describes the 
materials to be produced at the deposition.
    (4) Use of depositions. A party may use any part or all of a 
deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a 
showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who 
was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable 
notice of the deposition.
    (k) Interrogatories. (1) A party may not serve more than 30 
interrogatories to each other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory 
must be counted as a separate interrogatory.

[[Page 499]]

    (2) A party must file a motion for leave to serve more than 30 
interrogatories on a party before serving additional interrogatories on 
a party. The administrative law judge must grant the motion only if the 
party shows good cause for the party's failure to inquire about the 
information previously and that the information cannot reasonably be 
obtained using less burdensome discovery methods or be obtained from 
other sources.
    (3) A party must answer each interrogatory separately and completely 
in writing.
    (4) A party, or the party's attorney or representative of record, 
must sign the party's responses to interrogatories.
    (5) If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party must state the 
objection and the reasons for the objection.
    (6) An opposing party may offer into evidence any part or all of a 
party's responses to interrogatories at a hearing under this subpart to 
the extent that the response is relevant, material, and not repetitious.
    (l) Requests for admission. A party may serve a written request for 
admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under 
this section or the authenticity of any document described in the 
request. A party must set forth each request for admission separately. A 
party must serve a copy of each document referenced in the request for 
admission unless the document has been provided or is reasonably 
available for inspection and copying.
    (1) Time. A party's failure to respond to a request for admission is 
not later than 30 days after service of the request constitutes an 
admission of the truth of the statement or statements contained in the 
request for admission. The administrative law judge may determine that a 
failure to respond to a request for admission does not constitute an 
admission of the truth if a party shows that the failure was due to 
circumstances beyond the control of the party or the party's attorney or 
representative.
    (2) Response. A party may object to a request for admission. The 
objection must be in writing and signed by the party or the party's 
attorney or representative of record, and must state the reasons for 
objection. A party may specifically deny the truth of the matter or 
describe the reasons why the party is unable to truthfully deny or admit 
the matter. If a party is unable to deny or admit the truth of the 
matter, the party must show that the party has made reasonable inquiry 
into the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable 
by, the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the 
matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. 
If an administrative law judge determines that a response does not 
comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is 
insufficient, the matter is admitted.
    (3) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted or treated as admitted 
under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the 
hearing and appeal.
    (m) Motion to compel discovery. A party may make a motion to compel 
discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, 
a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, a person gives an 
evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding to 
an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or 
tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may 
complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before making a 
motion to compel if a person refuses to answer.
    (n) Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel. If 
a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, 
the administrative law judge, limited to the extent of the party's 
failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may:
    (1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings;
    (2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party;
    (3) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the 
hearing; or
    (4) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses 
at the hearing.

least 60 days notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing.
    (b) Date, time, and location of the hearing. The administrative law 
judge must set a reasonable date, time, and location for the hearing 
within the United States. The administrative law judge must consider the 
need for discovery and any joint procedural or discovery schedule 
submitted by the parties when determining the hearing date. The 
administrative law judge must give due regard to the convenience of the 
parties, the location where the majority of the witnesses reside or 
work, and whether a scheduled air carrier serves the location.
    (c) Earlier hearing. With the consent of the administrative law 
judge, the parties may agree to hold the hearing on an earlier date than 
the date specified in the notice of hearing.
    (d) Space hearing consolidated with aviation hearing under 14 CFR 
part 13 subpart G. With the consent of the administrative law judge, the 
parties may agree to hold the hearing, or parts of the hearing, together 
with a hearing under 14 CFR part 13 subpart G if the cases involve some 
common issues of fact. If the hearings are consolidated, the 
administrative law judge may issue a consolidated initial decision 
covering both cases. The Administrator will serve as the FAA 
decisionmaker on appeal for both cases and will issue a consolidated 
decision, with the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space 
Transportation serving as an advisor to the FAA decisionmaker.


<R05>
Sec. 406.149  Evidence.

    (a) General. A party is entitled to present the party's case or 
defense by oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence, to submit 
rebuttal evidence, and to conduct any cross-examination that may be 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (b) Admissibility. A party may introduce any oral, documentary, or 
demonstrative evidence in support of the party's case or defense. The 
administrative law judge must admit any oral, documentary, or 
demonstrative evidence introduced by a party but must exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
    (c) Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings 
governed by this subpart. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is 
hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its 
admissibility.


<R05>
Sec. 406.151  Standard of proof.

    The administrative law judge must issue an initial decision or must 
rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is supported by, 
and in accordance with, the reliable, probative, and substantial 
evidence contained in the record. In order to prevail, the party with 
the burden of proof must prove the party's case or defense by a 
preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 406.153  Burden of proof.

    (a) Except in the case of an affirmative defense, in a civil penalty

Sec. 406.159  Subpoenas.

    (a) Request for subpoena. A party may obtain from the administrative 
law judge a subpoena to compel the attendance of a witness at a 
deposition or hearing or to require the production of

[[Page 501]]

documents or tangible items. The administrative law judge must deliver 
the subpoena, signed by the administrative law judge but otherwise in 
blank, to the party. The party must complete the subpoena, stating the 
title of the action and the date and time for the witness' attendance or 
production of documents or items. The party who obtained the subpoena 
must serve the subpoena on the witness.
    (b) Motion to quash or modify the subpoena. A party, or any person 
upon whom a subpoena has been served, may file a motion to quash or 
modify the subpoena at or before the time specified in the subpoena for 
compliance. The applicant must describe, in detail, the basis for the 
motion to quash or modify the subpoena including, but not limited to, a 
statement that the testimony, document, or tangible evidence is not 
relevant to the proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably tailored 
to the scope of the proceeding, or that the subpoena is unreasonable and 
oppressive. A motion to quash or modify the subpoena will stay the 
effect of the subpoena pending a decision by the administrative law 
judge on the motion.
    (c) Enforcement of subpoena. Upon a showing that a person has failed 
or refused to comply with a subpoena, the Secretary may apply to the 
appropriate district court of the United States to seek enforcement of 
the subpoena in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 70115(c). A party may request 
the Secretary to seek such enforcement.


<R05>
Sec. 406.161  Witness fees.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise authorized by the administrative law 
judge, the party who applies for a subpoena to compel the attendance of 
a witness at a deposition or hearing, or the party at whose request a 
witness appears at a deposition or hearing, must pay the witness fees 
described in this section.
    (b) Amount. Except for an employee of the agency who appears at the 
direction of the agency, a witness who appears at a deposition or 
hearing is entitled to the same fees and mileage expenses as are paid to 
a witness in a court of the United States in comparable circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 406.163  Record.

    (a) Exclusive record. The transcript of all testimony in the 
hearing; all exhibits received into evidence; the complaint, answer, and 
amendments thereto; all motions, applications, and requests, and 
responses thereto; and all rulings constitute the exclusive record for 
decision of the proceedings and the basis for the issuance of any orders 
in the proceeding.
    (b) A person may keep the original document, data, or other 
evidence, with the consent of the administrative law judge, by 
substituting a legible copy for the record.

Sec. 406.165  Argument before the administrative law judge.

    (a) Argument during the hearing. During the hearing, the 
administrative law judge must give the parties a reasonable opportunity 
to present arguments on the record supporting or opposing motions, 
objections, and rulings if the parties request an opportunity for 
argument. The administrative law judge may request written arguments 
during the hearing if the administrative law judge finds that submission 
of written arguments would be reasonable.
    (b) Final oral argument. At the conclusion of the hearing and before 
the administrative law judge issues an initial decision in the 
proceedings, the parties are entitled to submit oral proposed findings 
of fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the 
administrative law judge, and supporting arguments for the findings, 
conclusions, or exceptions. At the conclusion of the hearing, a party 
may waive final oral argument.
    (c) Post-hearing briefs. The administrative law judge may request 
written post-hearing briefs before the administrative law judge issues 
an initial decision if the administrative law judge finds that 
submission of written briefs would be reasonable. If a party files a 
written post-hearing brief, the party must include proposed findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the administrative 
law judge, and supporting arguments for the findings, conclusions, or 
exceptions. The administrative law judge must give the parties a 
reasonable opportunity, not more than 30 days after

[[Page 502]]

receipt of the transcript, to prepare and submit the briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 406.167  Initial decision.

    (a) Contents. The administrative law judge must issue an initial 
decision at the conclusion of the hearing. In each oral or written 
decision, the administrative law judge must include findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, and the grounds supporting those findings and 
conclusions, upon all material issues of fact, the credibility of 
witnesses, the applicable law, any exercise of the administrative law 
judge's discretion, the amount of any civil penalty found appropriate by 
the administrative law judge, and a discussion of the basis for any 
order issued in the proceedings. The administrative law judge is not 
required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, 
procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the 
substance of the initial decision. If the administrative law judge 
refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the 
administrative law judge must make copies of that initial decision 
available to all parties and the FAA decisionmaker.
    (b) Oral decision. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, at the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge 
must issue the initial decision and order orally on the record.
    (c) Written decision. The administrative law judge may issue a 
written initial decision not later than 30 days after the conclusion of 
the hearing or submission of the last posthearing brief if the 
administrative law judge finds that issuing a written initial decision 
is reasonable. The administrative law judge must serve a copy of any 
written initial decision on each party.


<R05>
Sec. 406.173  Interlocutory appeals.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may 
not appeal a ruling or decision of the administrative law judge to the 
FAA decisionmaker until the initial decision has been entered on the 
record. A decision or order of the FAA decisionmaker on an interlocutory 
appeal does not constitute a final order of the Secretary for the 
purposes of judicial review under 5 U.S.C. chapter 7.
    (b) Interlocutory appeal for cause. If a party files a written 
request for an interlocutory appeal for cause, or orally requests an 
interlocutory appeal for cause, the proceedings are stayed until the 
administrative law judge issues a decision on the request. If the 
administrative law judge grants the request, the proceedings are stayed 
until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on the interlocutory 
appeal. The administrative law judge must grant an interlocutory appeal 
for cause if a party shows that delay of the interlocutory appeal would 
be detrimental to the public interest or would result in undue prejudice 
to any party.
    (c) Interlocutory appeals of right. If a party notifies the 
administrative law judge of an interlocutory appeal of right, the 
proceedings are stayed until the FAA decisionmaker issues a decision on 
the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal, 
without the consent of the administrative law judge, before an initial 
decision has been entered in the case of:
    (1) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge barring a 
party, or a party's attorney or representative, from the proceedings.
    (2) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge allegedly in 
violation of the limitations on the administrative law judge under Sec. 
406.109(c).
    (3) Failure of the administrative law judge to grant a motion for a 
confidentiality order based on 49 U.S.C. 70114, under Sec. 
406.117(c)(2).
    (4) Failure of the administrative law judge to dismiss the 
proceedings in accordance with Sec. 406.135.
    (d) Procedure. A party must file with the Docket Management System 
and serve each other party a notice of interlocutory appeal, with 
supporting documents, not later than 10 days after the administrative 
law judge's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of 
right or not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's 
decision granting an interlocutory appeal for cause. A party must file 
with the Docket Management System a reply brief, if any, and serve a 
copy of the reply brief on each party, not later than 10 days after 
service of the appeal brief. The FAA decisionmaker must render a 
decision on the interlocutory

[[Page 503]]

appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in the proceedings, 
within a reasonable time after receipt of the interlocutory appeal.
    (e) Rejection of interlocutory appeal. The FAA decisionmaker may 
reject frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an 
order precluding one or more parties from making further interlocutory 
appeals in a proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, 
or dilatory interlocutory appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 406.175  Appeal from initial decision.

    (a) Notice of appeal. A party may appeal the initial decision, and 
any decision not previously appealed pursuant to Sec. 406.173, by 
filing with the Docket Management System and serving on each party a 
notice of appeal. A party must file the notice of appeal not later than 
10 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or 
service of the written initial decision on the parties.
    (b) Issues on appeal. A party may appeal only the following issues:
    (1) Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of 
reliable, probative, and substantial evidence;
    (2) Whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with 
applicable law, precedent, and public policy; and
    (3) Whether the administrative law judge committed any prejudicial 
errors during the hearing that support the appeal.
    (c) Perfecting an appeal. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a 
party must perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the 
oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial 
decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief.
    (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may 
agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of 
the FAA decisionmaker, who serves a letter confirming the extension of 
time on each party.
    (2) Motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an 
extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an 
extension of time may file a motion for an extension and must serve a 
copy of the motion on each party. The FAA decisionmaker may grant an 
extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the motion.
    (d) Appeal briefs. A party must file the appeal brief with the 
Docket Management System and serve each party.
    (1) A party must set forth, in detail, the party's specific 
objections to the initial decision or rulings in the appeal brief. A 
party also must set forth, in detail, the basis for the appeal, the 
reasons supporting the appeal, and the relief requested in the appeal. 
If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the appeal, 
the party must specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in 
the record in the appeal brief.
    (2) The FAA decisionmaker may dismiss an appeal, on the FAA 
decisionmaker's own initiative or upon motion of any other party, where 
a party has filed a notice of appeal but fails to perfect the appeal by 
timely filing an appeal brief.
    (e) Reply brief. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party 
may file a reply brief with the Docket Management System and serve on 
each other party not later than 35 days after the appeal brief has been 
served on that party. If the party relies on evidence contained in the 
record for the reply, the party must specifically refer to the pertinent 
evidence contained in the record in the reply brief.
    (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may 
agree to extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of 
the FAA decisionmaker, who will serve a letter confirming the extension 
of time on each party.
    (2) Motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an 
extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an 
extension of time may file and serve a motion for an extension and must 
serve a copy of the motion on each party. The FAA decisionmaker may 
grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the 
motion.
    (f) Other briefs. The FAA decisionmaker may allow any person to 
submit an amicus curiae brief in an appeal of an initial decision. A 
party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief without 
permission of the FAA decisionmaker. A party may file with

[[Page 504]]

the Docket Management System a motion for permission to file an 
additional brief and must serve a copy of the motion on each other 
party. The party may not file the additional brief with the motion. The 
FAA decisionmaker may grant permission to file an additional brief if 
the party demonstrates good cause for allowing additional argument on 
the appeal. The FAA decisionmaker will allow a reasonable time for the 
party to file the additional brief.
    (g) Number of copies. A party must file the original brief and two 
copies of the brief with the Docket Management System and serve one copy 
on each other party.
    (h) Oral argument. The FAA decisionmaker has sole discretion to 
permit oral argument on the appeal. On the FAA decisionmaker's own 
initiative or upon written motion by any party, the FAA decisionmaker 
may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the 
development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an 
opportunity for oral argument.
    (i) Waiver of objections on appeal. If a party fails to object to 
any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply 
brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The FAA 
decisionmaker is not required to consider any objection or argument in a 
brief if the party does not specifically refer in the brief to the 
pertinent evidence from the record.
    (j) FAA decisionmaker's decision on appeal. The FAA decisionmaker 
will review the record, the briefs on appeal, and the oral argument, if 
any, to determine if the administrative law judge committed prejudicial 
error in the proceedings or that the initial decision should be 
affirmed, modified, or reversed. The FAA decisionmaker may affirm, 
modify, or reverse the initial decision, make any necessary findings, or 
may remand the case for any proceedings that the FAA decisionmaker 
determines may be necessary.
    (1) The FAA decisionmaker may raise any issue, on the FAA 
decisionmaker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition 
of the proceedings. The FAA decisionmaker will give the parties a 
reasonable opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues before 
making a decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker 
requires the consideration of additional testimony or evidence, the FAA 
decisionmaker will remand the case to the administrative law judge for 
further proceedings and an initial decision related to that issue. If an 
issue raised by the FAA decisionmaker is solely an issue of law or the 
issue was addressed at the hearing but was not raised by a party in the 
briefs on appeal, a remand of the case to the administrative law judge 
for further proceedings is not required but may be provided in the 
discretion of the FAA decisionmaker.
    (2) The FAA decisionmaker will issue the final decision and order of 
the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the 
decision and order on each party.
    (3) A final decision and order of the FAA decisionmaker is precedent 
in any other civil penalty action under this part. Any issue, finding or 
conclusion, order, ruling, or initial decision of an administrative law 
judge that has not been appealed to the FAA decisionmaker is not 
precedent in any other civil penalty action.


<R05>
Sec. 406.177  Petition to reconsider or modify a final decision and 
order of the FAA decisionmaker on appeal.

    (a) General. Any party may petition the FAA decisionmaker to 
reconsider or modify a final decision and order issued by the FAA 
decisionmaker on appeal from an initial decision. A party must file a 
petition to reconsider or modify with the Docket Management System not 
later than 30 days after service of the FAA decisionmaker's final 
decision and order on appeal and must serve a copy of the petition on 
each party. The FAA decisionmaker will not reconsider or modify an 
initial decision and order issued by an administrative law judge that 
has not been appealed by any party to the FAA decisionmaker.
    (b) Contents. A party must state briefly and specifically the 
alleged errors in the final decision and order on appeal, the relief 
sought by the party, and the grounds that support, the petition to 
reconsider or modify.

[[Page 505]]

    (1) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on allegations 
regarding the consequences of the FAA decisionmaker's decision, the 
party must describe these allegations and must describe, and support, 
the basis for the allegations.
    (2) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new material 
not previously raised in the proceedings, the party must set forth the 
new material and include affidavits of prospective witnesses and 
authenticated documents that would be introduced in support of the new 
material. The party must explain, in detail, why the new material was 
not discovered through due diligence prior to the hearing.
    (c) Repetitious and frivolous petition. The FAA decisionmaker will 
not consider a repetitious or frivolous petition. The FAA decisionmaker 
may summarily dismiss any repetitious or frivolous petition to 
reconsider or modify.
    (d) Reply to petition. Any other party may reply to a petition to 
reconsider or modify, not later than 10 days after service of the 
petition on that party, by filing a reply. A party must serve a copy of 
the reply on each party.
    (e) Effect of filing petition. Unless otherwise ordered by the FAA 
decisionmaker, filing a petition under this section stays the effective 
date of the FAA decisionmaker's final decision and order on appeal, and 
tolls the time allowed for judicial review.
    (f) FAA decisionmaker's decision on petition. The FAA decisionmaker 
may affirm, modify, or reverse the final decision and order on appeal, 
or may remand the case for any proceedings that the FAA decisionmaker 
determines may be necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 406.179  Judicial review of a final decision and order.

    (a) A person may seek judicial review of a final decision and order 
of the FAA decisionmaker as provided in 5 U.S.C. chapter 7 and 28 U.S.C. 
1331. A party seeking judicial review must file with a United States 
district court.
    (b) In accordance with Sec. 406.9(e)(iv), if a person seeks 
judicial review not later than 60 days after the final decision and 
order has been served on the respondent, the final decision and order is 
stayed.
    (c) In accordance with Sec. 406.9(i), if a respondent does not pay 
a civil penalty and does not file an appeal with the United States 
district court within 60 days after service of the final decision and 
order, the FAA may refer the order to the United States Department of 
Treasury or Department of Justice to collect the civil penalty.

<R05>
Sec. 413.5  Pre-application consultation.

    A prospective applicant shall consult with the FAA before submitting 
an application to discuss the application process and potential issues 
relevant to the FAA's licensing decision. Early consultation enables an 
applicant to identify potential licensing issues at the planning stage 
when changes to a license application or to proposed licensed activities 
are less likely to result in significant delay or costs to the 
applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 413.7  Application.

    (a) Form. An application must be in writing, in English and filed in 
duplicate with the Federal Aviation Administration, Associate 
Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation, AST-200, Room 331, 
800 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20591. Attention: 
Licensing and Safety Division, Application Review.
    (b) Administrative information. An application must identify the 
following:
    (1) The name and address of the applicant;
    (2) The name, address, and telephone number of any person to whom 
inquiries and correspondence should be directed; and
    (3) The type of license for which the applicant is applying.
    (c) Signature and certification of accuracy. An application must be 
legibly signed, dated, and certified as true, complete, and accurate by 
one of the following:
    (1) For a corporation: An officer authorized to act for the 
corporation in licensing matters.
    (2) For a partnership or a sole proprietorship: A general partner or 
proprietor, respectively.
    (3) For a joint venture, association, or other entity: An officer or 
other individual duly authorized to act for the joint venture, 
association, or other entity in licensing matters.


<R05>
Sec. 413.9  Confidentiality.

    (a) Any person furnishing information or data to the FAA may request 
in writing that trade secrets or proprietary commercial or financial 
data be treated as confidential. The request must be made at the time 
the information or data is submitted, and state the period of time for 
which confidential treatment is desired.
    (b) Information or data for which any person or agency requests 
confidentiality must be clearly marked with an identifying legend, such 
as ``Proprietary Information,'' ``Proprietary Commercial Information,'' 
``Trade Secret,'' or ``Confidential Treatment Requested.'' Where this 
marking proves impracticable, a cover sheet containing the identifying 
legend must be securely attached to the compilation of information or 
data for which confidential treatment is requested.
    (c) If a person requests that previously submitted information or 
data be treated confidentially, the FAA will do so to the extent 
practicable in light of any prior distribution of the information or 
data.
    (d) Information or data for which confidential treatment has been 
requested or information or data that qualifies for exemption under 
section 552(b)(4) of Title 5, United States Code, will not be disclosed 
to the public unless the Associate Administrator determines that the 
withholding of the information or data is contrary to the public or 
national interest.


<R05>
Sec. 413.11  Acceptance of an application.

    The FAA will initially screen an application to determine whether 
the application is sufficiently complete to enable the FAA to initiate 
the reviews or evaluations required under any applicable part of this 
chapter. After completion of the initial screening, the FAA notifies the 
applicant, in writing, of one of the following:
    (a) The application is accepted and the FAA will initiate the 
reviews or evaluations required for a licensing determination under this 
chapter; or
    (b) The application is so incomplete or indefinite as to make 
initiation of the reviews or evaluations required for a licensing 
determination under this chapter inappropriate, and the application is 
rejected. The notice will state the reason(s) for rejection and 
corrective actions necessary for the application to be accepted. The FAA 
may return a rejected application to the applicant or may hold it 
pending additional submissions by the applicant.

[[Page 508]]


<R05>
Sec. 413.13  Complete application.

    Acceptance by the FAA of an application does not constitute a 
determination that the application is complete. If, in addition to the 
information required by the applicable parts of this chapter, the FAA 
requires other information necessary for a determination that public 
health and safety, safety of property and national security and foreign 
policy interests of the United States are protected during the conduct 
of a licensed activity, an applicant shall submit the additional 
information required to show compliance with this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 413.15  Review period.

    (a) 180-day review. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, the 
FAA reviews and makes a determination on a license application within 
180 days of receipt of an accepted application.
    (b) Review period tolled. If an accepted application does not 
provide sufficient information to continue or complete the reviews or 
evaluations required by this chapter for a licensing determination, or 
an issue exists that would affect a licensing determination, the FAA 
notifies the applicant, in writing, and informs the applicant of any 
information required to complete the application. If further review is 
impracticable, the 180-day review period shall be tolled pending receipt 
by the FAA of the requested information.
    (c) 120-day notice. If the FAA has not made a licensing 
determination within 120 days of receipt of an accepted application, the 
FAA informs the applicant, in writing, of any outstanding information 
needed to complete the reviews or evaluations required by this chapter 
for a licensing determination, or of any pending issues that would 
affect the licensing determination.


<R05>
Sec. 413.17  Continuing accuracy of application; supplemental 
information; amendment.

    (a) An applicant is responsible for the continuing accuracy and 
completeness of information furnished to the FAA as part of a pending 
license application. If at any time information provided by an applicant 
as part of a license application is no longer accurate and complete in 
all material respects, the applicant shall submit a statement furnishing 
the new or corrected information. As part of its submission, the 
applicant shall recertify the accuracy and completeness of the 
application in accordance with section 413.7. An applicant's failure to 
comply with any of the requirements set forth in this paragraph is a 
sufficient basis for denial of a license application.
    (b) An applicant may amend or supplement a license application at 
any time prior to issuance or transfer of a license.
    (c) Willful false statements made in any application or document 
relating to an application or license are punishable by fine and 
imprisonment under section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code, and by 
administrative sanctions in accordance with part 405 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 413.19  Issuance of a license.

    After the FAA completes its reviews and makes the approvals and 
determinations required by this chapter for a license, the FAA issues a 
license to an applicant in accordance with this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 413.21  Denial of a license application.

    (a) The FAA informs a license applicant, in writing, if its 
application has been denied and states the reasons for denial.
    (b) An applicant whose license application is denied may either:
    (1) Attempt to correct any deficiencies identified by the FAA and 
request reconsideration of the revised application. The FAA has 60 days 
or the number of days remaining in the 180-day review period, whichever 
is greater, within which to reconsider its licensing determination; or
    (2) Request a hearing in accordance with part 406 of this chapter, 
for the purpose of showing why the application should not be denied.
    (c) An applicant whose license application is denied after 
reconsideration under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may request a 
hearing in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 413.23  License renewal.

    (a) Eligibility. A licensee may apply to renew its license by 
submitting to the

[[Page 509]]

FAA a written application for renewal of the license at least 90 days 
before the expiration date of the license.
    (b) Application.(1) A license renewal application shall satisfy the 
requirements set forth in this part and any other applicable part of 
this chapter.
    (2) The application may incorporate by reference information 
provided as part of the application for the expiring license or any 
modification to that license.
    (3) The applicant must describe any proposed changes in its conduct 
of licensed activities and provide any additional clarifying information 
required by the FAA.
    (c) Review of application. The FAA conducts the reviews required 
under this chapter for a license to determine whether the applicant's 
license may be renewed for an additional term. The FAA may incorporate 
by reference any findings that are part of the record for the expiring 
license.
    (d) Grant of license renewal. After completion by the FAA of the 
reviews required by this chapter for a license and issuance of the 
requisite approvals and determinations, the FAA issues an order amending 
the expiration date of the license. The FAA may impose additional or 
revised terms and conditions necessary to protect public health and 
safety and the safety of property and to protect U.S. national security 
and foreign policy interests.
    (e) Denial of license renewal. The FAA informs a licensee, in

this subchapter.

[Doc. No. FAA-1999-5535, 65 FR 56658, Sept. 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 415.3  Types of launch licenses.

    (a) Launch-specific license. A launch-specific license authorizes a 
licensee to conduct one or more launches, having the same launch 
parameters, of one type of launch vehicle from one launch site. The 
license identifies, by name or mission, each launch authorized under the 
license. A licensee's authorization to launch terminates upon completion 
of all launches authorized by the license or the expiration date stated 
in the license, whichever occurs first.
    (b) Launch operator license. A launch operator license authorizes a 
licensee to conduct launches from one launch site, within a range of 
launch parameters, of launch vehicles from the same family of vehicles 
transporting specified classes of payloads. A launch operator license 
remains in effect for five years from the date of issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 415.5  Policy and safety approvals.

    To obtain a launch license, an applicant must obtain policy and 
safety approvals from the FAA. Requirements for obtaining these 
approvals are contained in subparts B, C and F of this part. Only a 
launch license applicant may apply for the approvals, and may apply for 
either approval separately and in advance of submitting a complete 
license application, using the application procedures contained in part 
413 of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 415.7  Payload determination.

    A payload determination is required for a launch license unless the 
proposed payload is exempt from payload review under Sec. 415.53 of 
this part. The FAA conducts a payload review, as described in subpart D 
of this part, to make the determination. Either a launch license 
applicant or a payload owner or operator may request a review of its 
proposed payload using the application procedures contained in part 413 
of this subchapter. Upon receipt of an application, the FAA may conduct 
a payload review independently of a launch license application.


<R05>
Sec. 415.9  Issuance of a launch license.

    (a) The FAA issues a launch license to an applicant who has obtained 
all approvals and determinations required under this chapter for a 
license.
    (b) A launch license authorizes a licensee to conduct a launch or 
launches in accordance with the representations contained in the 
licensee's application, subject to the licensee's compliance with terms 
and conditions contained in license orders accompanying the license, 
including financial responsibility requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 415.11  Additional license terms and conditions.

    The FAA may modify a launch license at any time by modifying or 
adding license terms and conditions to ensure compliance with the Act 
and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 415.13  Transfer of a launch license.

    (a) Only the FAA may transfer a launch license.
    (b) An applicant for transfer of a launch license shall submit a 
license application in accordance with part 413 of this subchapter and 
shall meet the requirements of part 415 of this subchapter. The FAA will 
transfer a license to an applicant who has obtained all of the approvals 
and determinations required under this chapter for a license. In 
conducting its reviews and issuing approvals and determinations, the FAA 
may incorporate by reference

[[Page 511]]

any findings made part of the record to support the initial licensing 
determination. The FAA may modify a license to reflect any changes 
necessary as a result of a license transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 415.15  Rights not conferred by launch license.

    Issuance of a launch license does not relieve a licensee of its 
obligation to comply with all applicable requirements of law or 
regulation that may apply to its activities, nor does issuance confer 
any proprietary, property or exclusive right in the use of any federal 
launch range or related facilities, airspace, or outer space.

which 100 percent of the population are assumed not to be a casualty. An 
effective casualty area accounts for the characteristics of the debris 
piece, including its size, the path angle of its trajectory, impact 
explosions, and debris skip, splatter, and bounce. An effective casualty 
area also accounts for the size of a person.
    Explosive means any chemical compound or mechanical mixture that,

United Nations Organization classification system for transport of 
dangerous goods, and as determined in accordance with 49 CFR part 173, 
subpart C.
    Impact dispersion area means an area representing an estimated three 
standard deviation dispersion about a nominal impact point of an 
intermediate or final stage of a suborbital launch vehicle.
    Impact dispersion factor means a constant used to estimate, using a 
stage apogee, a three standard deviation dispersion about a nominal 
impact point of an intermediate or final stage of a suborbital launch 
vehicle.
    Impact dispersion radius (R<INF>i</INF>) means a radius that defines 
an impact dispersion area.
    Impact range means the distance between a launch point and the 
impact point of a suborbital launch vehicle stage.

appendix A of this part, the portion of a flight corridor from the 
launch point to a point 100 nautical miles in the direction of the 
flight azimuth. For a flight corridor defined in accordance with 
appendix B of this part, a launch area is the portion of a flight 
corridor from the launch point to the enveloping line enclosing the 
outer boundary of the last debris dispersion circle.
    Launch point means a point on the Earth from which the flight of a 
launch vehicle begins, and is defined by its geodetic latitude, 
longitude and height on an ellipsoidal Earth model.

ground activity at a launch site resulting in a fatality or serious 
injury (as defined in 49 CFR 830.2) to any person who is not associated 
with the activity, or any damage estimated to exceed $25,000 to property 
not associated with the activity.
    Net explosive weight (NEW) means the total weight, expressed in 
pounds, of explosive material or explosive equivalency contained in an 
item.
    Nominal means, in reference to launch vehicle performance, 
trajectory, or stage impact point, a launch vehicle flight where all

vehicle's IIP to move past a populated area. For a given populated area, 
the overflight dwell time is the time period measured along the nominal 
trajectory IIP ground trace from the time point whose normal with the 
trajectory intersects the most uprange part of the populated area to the 
time point whose normal with the trajectory intersects the most 
downrange part of the populated area.

<R05>
Sec. 420.67  Storage or handling of liquid propellants.

    (a) For an explosive hazard facility where liquid propellants are 
handled or stored, a launch site operator shall determine the total 
quantity of liquid propellant and, if applicable pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, the explosive equivalent of liquid propellant in 
each explosive hazard facility in accordance with the following:
    (1) The quantity of liquid propellant in a tank, drum, cylinder, or 
other container is the net weight in pounds of the propellant in the 
container. The determination of quantity shall include any liquid 
propellant in associated piping to any point where positive means are 
provided for interrupting the flow through the pipe, or interrupting a 
reaction in the pipe in the event of a mishap.
    (2) Where two or more containers of compatible liquid propellants 
are handled or stored together in an explosive hazard facility, the 
total quantity of propellant to determine the minimum separation 
distance between the explosive hazard facility and all other explosive 
hazard facilities and each public area shall be the total quantity of 
liquid propellant in all containers, unless:
    (i) The containers are separated one from the other by the 
appropriate distance as provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
    (ii) The containers are subdivided by intervening barriers, such as 
diking, that prevent mixing.
    (iii) If paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section apply, a launch 
site operator shall use the quantity of propellant requiring the 
greatest separation distance pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
to determine the minimum separation distance between the explosive 
hazard facility and all other explosive hazard facilities and each 
public area.
    (3) Where two or more containers of incompatible liquid propellants 
will be handled or stored together in an explosive hazard facility, a 
launch site operator shall determine the explosive equivalent in pounds 
of the combined liquids, using the formulas provided in appendix E, 
table E-2, to determine the minimum separation distance between the 
explosive hazard facility and other explosive hazard facilities and 
public areas unless the containers are separated one from the other by 
the appropriate distance as determined in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section. A launch site operator shall then use the quantity of liquid 
propellant requiring the greatest separation distance to determine the 
minimum separation distance between the explosive hazard facility and 
all other explosive hazard facilities and each public area.
    (4) A launch site operator shall convert quantities of liquid 
propellants

[[Page 532]]

from gallons to pounds using the conversion factors provided in appendix 
E, table E-3 and the following equation:

Pounds of propellant = gallons x density of propellant (pounds per 
    gallon).

    (b) A launch site operator shall use appendix E, table E-3 to 
determine hazard and compatibility groups and shall separate liquid 
propellants from each other and from each public area using distances no 
less than those provided in appendix E, tables E-4 through E-7 in 
accordance with the following:
    (1) A launch site operator shall measure minimum separation 
distances from the hazard source in an explosive hazard facility, such 
as a container, building, segment, or positive cutoff point in piping, 
closest to each explosive hazard facility.
    (2) A launch site operator shall measure the minimum separation 
distance between compatible liquid propellants using the ``intragroup 
and compatible'' distance for the propellant quantity and hazard group 
that requires the greater distance prescribed by appendix E, tables E-4, 
E-5, and E-6.
    (3) A launch site operator shall measure the minimum separation 
distance between liquid propellants of different compatibility groups 
using the ``public area and incompatible'' distance for the propellant 
quantity and hazard group that requires the greater distance provided in 
appendix E, tables E-4, E-5, and E-6, unless the propellants of 
different compatibility groups are subdivided by intervening barriers 
that prevent mixing. If such barriers are present, the minimum 
separation distance shall be the ``intragroup and compatible'' distance 
for the propellant quantity and group that requires the greater distance 
provided in appendix E, tables E-4, E-5, and E-6.
    (4) A launch site operator shall separate liquid propellants from 
each public area using a distance no less than the ``public area and 
incompatible'' distance provided in appendix E, tables E-4, E-5, and E-
6.
    (5) A launch site operator shall separate each explosive hazard 
facility that contains liquid propellants where explosive equivalents 
apply pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section from all other 
explosive hazard facilities of a single customer using the intraline 
distance provided in appendix E, table E-7, and from each public area 
using the public area distance provided in appendix E, table E-7.

credible event (MCE), or the worst case explosion that is expected to 
occur. If the MCE shows that there will be no simultaneous explosion 
reaction of the liquid propellant tanks and the solid propellant motors, 
then the minimum distance between the explosive hazard facility and all 
other explosive hazard facilities and public areas must be based on the 
MCE.

Sec. 420.71  Lightning protection.

    (a) Lightning protection. A licensee shall ensure that the public is 
not exposed to hazards due to the initiation of explosives by lightning.
    (1) Elements of a lighting protection system. Unless an explosive 
hazard facility meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, all explosive hazard facilities shall have a lightning 
protection system to ensure explosives are not initiated by lightning. A 
lightning protection system shall meet the requirements of this 
paragraph and include the following:
    (i) Air terminal. An air terminal to intentionally attract a 
lightning strike.
    (ii) Down conductor. A low impedance path connecting an air terminal 
to an earth electrode system.
    (iii) Earth electrode system. An earth electrode system to dissipate 
the current from a lightning strike to ground.
    (2) Bonding and surge protection. A lightning protection system must 
meet the requirements of this paragraph and include the following:
    (i) Bonding. All metallic bodies shall be bonded to ensure that 
voltage potentials due to lightning are equal everywhere in the 
explosive hazard facility. Any fence within six feet of a lightning 
protection system shall have a bond across each gate and other 
discontinuations and shall be bonded to the lightning protection system. 
Railroad tracks that run within six feet of the lightning protection 
system shall be bonded to the lightning protection system.
    (ii) Surge protection. A lightning protection system shall include 
surge protection to reduce transient voltages due to lightning to a 
harmless level for all metallic power, communication, and 
instrumentation lines entering an explosive hazard facility.
    (3) Circumstances where no lightening protection system is required. 
No lightning protection system is required for an explosive hazard 
facility when a lightning warning system is available to permit 
termination of operations and withdrawal of the public to public area 
distance prior to an electrical storm, or for an explosive hazard 
facility containing explosives that cannot be initiated by lightning. If 
no lightning protection system is required, a licensee must ensure the 
withdrawal of the public to a public area distance prior to an 
electrical storm.
    (4) Testing and inspection. Lightning protection systems shall be 
visually inspected semiannually and shall be tested once each year for 
electrical continuity and adequacy of grounding. A licensee shall 
maintain at the explosive hazard facility a record of results obtained 
from the tests, including any action taken to correct deficiencies 
noted.
    (b) Electrical power lines. A licensee shall ensure that electric 
power lines at its launch site meet the following requirements:
    (1) Electric power lines shall be no closer to an explosive hazard 
facility than the length of the lines between the poles or towers that 
support the lines unless an effective means is provided to ensure that 
energized lines cannot, on breaking, come in contact with the explosive 
hazard facility.
    (2) Towers or poles supporting electrical distribution lines that 
carry between 15 and 69 KV, and unmanned electrical substations shall be 
no closer to an explosive hazard facility than the public area distance 
for that explosive hazard facility.
    (3) Towers or poles supporting electrical transmission lines that 
carry 69 KV or more, shall be no closer to an explosive hazard facility 
than the public area distance for that explosive hazard facility.

      Appendix A to Part 420--Method for Defining a Flight Corridor

                            (a) Introduction

    (1) This appendix provides a method for constructing a flight 
corridor from a launch point for a guided suborbital launch vehicle or 
any one of the four classes of guided orbital launch vehicles from table 
1, Sec. 420.19, without the use of local meteorological data or a 
launch vehicle trajectory.
    (2) A flight corridor includes an overflight exclusion zone in a 
launch area and, for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an impact 
dispersion area in a downrange area. A flight corridor for a guided 
suborbital launch vehicle ends with the impact dispersion area, and, for 
the four classes of guided orbital launch vehicles, 5000 nautical miles 
(nm) from the launch point.

                    (c) Creation of a Flight Corridor

    (1) To define a flight corridor, an applicant shall:
    (i) Select a guided suborbital or orbital launch vehicle, and, for 
an orbital launch vehicle, select from table 1 of Sec. 420.19 a launch 
vehicle weight class that best represents the launch vehicle the 
applicant plans to support at its launch point;
    (ii) Select a debris dispersion radius (D<INF>max</INF>) from table 
A-1 corresponding to the guided suborbital launch vehicle or orbital 
launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i);
    (iii) Select a launch point geodetic latitude and longitude; and
    (iv) Select a flight azimuth.
    (2) An applicant shall define and map an overflight exclusion zone 
using the following method:
    (i) Select a debris dispersion radius (D<INF>max</INF>) from table 
A-1 and a downrange distance (D<INF>OEZ</INF>) from table A-2 to define 
an overflight exclusion zone for the guided suborbital launch vehicle or 
orbital launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
    (ii) An overflight exclusion zone is described by the intersection 
of the following boundaries, which are depicted in figure A-1:
    (A) An applicant shall define an uprange boundary with a half-circle 
arc of radius D<INF>max</INF> and a chord of length twice 
D<INF>max</INF> connecting the half-circle arc endpoints. The uprange 
boundary placement on a map has the chord midpoint positioned on the 
launch point with the chord oriented along an azimuth <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>90[deg]from the launch azimuth and the half-circle arc 
located uprange from the launch point.
    (B) An applicant shall define the downrange boundary with a half-
circle arc of radius D<INF>max</INF> and a chord of length twice 
D<INF>max</INF> connecting the half-circle arc endpoints. The downrange 
boundary placement on a map has the chord midpoint intersecting the 
nominal flight azimuth line at a distance D<INF>OEZ</INF> inches 
downrange with the chord oriented along an azimuth <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>90[deg]from the launch azimuth and the half-circle arc 
located downrange from the intersection of the chord and the flight 
azimuth line.
    (C) Crossrange boundaries of an overflight exclusion zone are 
defined by two lines segments. Each is parallel to the flight azimuth 
with one to the left side and one to the right side of the flight 
azimuth line. Each line connects an uprange half-circle arc endpoint to 
a downrange half-circle arc endpoint as shown in figure A-1.
    (iii) An applicant shall identify the overflight exclusion zone on a 
map that meets the requirements of paragraph (b).
    (3) An applicant shall define and map a flight corridor using the 
following method:
    (i) In accordance with paragraph (b), an applicant shall draw a 
flight corridor on one or more maps with the D<INF>max</INF> origin 
centered on the intended launch point and the flight corridor centerline 
(in the downrange direction) aligned with the initial flight azimuth. 
The flight corridor is depicted in figure A-2 and its line segment 
lengths are tabulated in table A-3.

[[Page 539]]

    (ii) An applicant shall define the flight corridor using the 
following boundary definitions:
    (A) An applicant shall draw an uprange boundary, which is defined by 
an arc-line GB (figure A-2), directly uprange from and centered on the 
intended launch point with radius D<INF>max</INF>.
    (B) An applicant shall draw line CF perpendicular to and centered on 
the flight azimuth line, and positioned 10 nm downrange from the launch 
point. The applicant shall use the length of line CF provided in table 
A-3 corresponding to the guided suborbital launch vehicle or orbital 
launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
    (C) An applicant shall draw line DE perpendicular to and centered on 
the flight azimuth line, and positioned 100 nm downrange from the launch 
point. The applicant shall use the length of line DE provided in table 
A-3 corresponding to the guided suborbital launch vehicle or orbital 
launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
    (D) Except for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an applicant 
shall draw a downrange boundary, which is defined by line HI and is 
drawn perpendicular to and centered on the flight azimuth line, and 
positioned 5,000 nm downrange from the launch point. The applicant shall 
use the length of line HI provided in table A-3 corresponding to the 
orbital launch vehicle class selected in paragraph (c)(1)(i).
    (E) An applicant shall draw crossrange boundaries, which are defined 
by three lines on the left side and three lines on the right side of the 
flight azimuth. An applicant shall construct the left flight corridor 
boundary according to the following, and as depicted in figure A-3 :
    (1) The first line (line BC in figure A-3) is tangent to the uprange 
boundary arc, and ends at endpoint C of line CF, as depicted in figure 
A-3;
    (2) The second line (line CD in figure A-3) begins at endpoint C of 
line BC and ends at endpoint D of line DH, as depicted in figure A-3;
    (3) For all orbital launch vehicles, the third line (line DH in 
figure A-3) begins at endpoint D of line CD and ends at endpoint H of 
line HI, as depicted in figure A-3; and
    (4) For a guided suborbital launch vehicle, the line DH begins at 
endpoint D of line CD and ends at a point tangent to the impact 
dispersion area drawn in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) and as 
depicted in figure A-4.
    (F) An applicant shall repeat the procedure in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii)(E) for the right side boundary.
    (iii) An applicant shall identify the flight corridor on a map that 
meets the requirements of paragraph (b).
    (4) For a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an applicant shall 
define a final stage impact dispersion area as part of the flight 
corridor and show the impact dispersion area on a map, as depicted in 
figure A-4, in accordance with the following:
    (i) An applicant shall select an apogee altitude (H<INF>ap</INF>) 
for the launch vehicle final stage. The apogee altitude should equal the 
highest altitude intended to be reached by a guided suborbital launch 
vehicle launched from the launch point.
    (ii) An applicant shall define the impact dispersion area by using 
an impact range factor [IP(H<INF>ap</INF>)] and a dispersion factor 
[DISP(H<INF>ap</INF>)] as shown below:
    (A) An applicant shall calculate the impact range (D) for the final 
launch vehicle stage. An applicant shall set D equal to the maximum 
apogee altitude (H<INF>ap</INF>) multiplied by the impact range factor 
as shown below:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.048

where: IP(H<INF>ap</INF>) = 0.4 for an apogee less than 100 km; and 
IP(H<INF>ap</INF>) = 0.7 for an apogee 100 km or greater.

    (B) An applicant shall calculate the impact dispersion radius (R) 
for the final launch vehicle stage. An applicant shall set R equal to 
the maximum apogee altitude (H<INF>ap</INF>) multiplied by the 
dispersion factor as shown below:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.049

where: DISP(H<INF>ap</INF>) = 0.05

    (iii) An applicant shall draw the impact dispersion area on a map 
with its center on the predicted impact point. An applicant shall then 
draw line DH in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(4).

                    (d) Evaluate the Flight Corridor

    (1) An applicant shall evaluate the flight corridor for the presence 
of any populated areas. If an applicant determines that no populated 
area is located within the flight corridor, then no additional steps are 
necessary.
    (2) If a populated area is located in an overflight exclusion zone, 
an applicant may modify its proposal or demonstrate that there are times 
when no people are present or that the applicant has an agreement in 
place to evacuate the public from the overflight exclusion zone during a 
launch.
    (3) If a populated area is located within the flight corridor, an 
applicant may modify its proposal and create another flight corridor 
pursuant to appendix A, use appendix B to narrow the flight corridor, or 
complete a risk analysis in accordance with appendix C.

      Appendix B to Part 420--Method for Defining a Flight Corridor

                            (a) Introduction

    (1) This appendix provides a method to construct a flight corridor 
from a launch point for a guided suborbital launch vehicle or any one of 
the four weight classes of guided orbital launch vehicles from table 1, 
Sec. 420.19, using local meteorological data and a launch vehicle 
trajectory.
    (2) A flight corridor is constructed in two sections--one section 
comprising a launch area and one section comprising a downrange area. 
The launch area of a flight corridor reflects the extent of launch 
vehicle debris impacts in the event of a launch vehicle failure and 
applying local meteorological conditions. The downrange area reflects 
the extent of launch vehicle debris impacts in the event of a launch 
vehicle failure and applying vehicle imparted velocity, malfunctions 
turns, and vehicle guidance and performance dispersions.
    (3) A flight corridor includes an overflight exclusion zone in the 
launch area and, for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an impact 
dispersion area in the downrange area. A flight corridor for a guided 
suborbital launch vehicle ends with an impact dispersion area and, for 
the four classes of guided orbital launch vehicles, 5,000 nautical miles 
(nm) from the launch point, or where the IIP leaves the surface of the 
Earth, whichever is shorter.

                          (b) Data Requirements

    (1) Launch area data requirements. An applicant shall satisfy the 
following data requirements to perform the launch area analysis of this 
appendix. The data requirements are identified in table B-1 along with 
sources where data acceptable to the FAA may be obtained.
    (i) An applicant must select meteorological data that meet the 
specifications in table B-1 for the proposed launch site.

the launch vehicle trajectory for time intervals of no greater than one 
second. When choosing wind data, an applicant shall use a time period of 
between one and 12 months.
    (2) A launch area analysis must include all trajectory positions 
whose Z-values are less than or equal to 50,000 ft.
    (3) Each trajectory time is denoted by the subscript ``i''. Height 
intervals for a given atmospheric pressure level are denoted by the 
subscript ``j'.
    (4) Using data from the GGUAS CD-ROM, an applicant shall estimate 
the mean atmospheric density, maximum wind speed, height interval fall 
times and height interval debris dispersions for 15 mean geometric 
height intervals.
    (i) The height intervals in the GGUAS source data vary as a function

surface, 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 
10. The actual geometric height associated with each pressure level 
varies depending on the time of year. An applicant shall estimate the 
mean geometric height over the period of months selected in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph for each of the 15 pressure levels as shown in 
equation B1.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.055

where:

H<INF>j</INF> = mean geometric height h<INF>m</INF> = geometric height 
for a given month n<INF>m</INF> = number of observations for a given 
month
k = number of wind months of interest

    (ii) The atmospheric densities in the source data also vary as a 
function of the 15 atmospheric pressure levels. The actual atmospheric 
density associated with each pressure level varies depending on the time 
of year. An applicant shall estimate the mean atmospheric density over 
the period of months selected in accordance with subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph for each of the 15 pressure levels as shown in equation 
B2.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.056

where:

[rho]<INF>j</INF> = mean atmospheric density
--
[rho]<INF>m</INF> = atmospheric density for a given month
n<INF>m</INF> = number of observations for a given month
k = number of wind months of interest

    (iii) An applicant shall estimate the algebraic maximum wind speed 
at a given pressure level as follows and shall repeat the process for 
each pressure level.

[[Page 547]]

    (A) For each month, an applicant shall calculate the monthly mean 
wind speed (W<INF>az</INF>) for 360 azimuths using equation B3;
    (B) An applicant shall select the maximum monthly mean wind speed 
from the 360 azimuths;
    (C) An applicant shall repeat subparagraphs (c)(4)(iii)(A) and (B) 
for each month of interest; and
    (D) An applicant shall select the maximum mean wind speed from the 
range of months. The absolute value of this wind is designated 
W<INF>max</INF> for the current pressure level.
    (iv) An applicant shall calculate wind speed using the means for 
winds from the West (u) and winds from the North (v). An applicant shall 
use equation B3 to resolve the winds to a specific azimuth bearing.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.057

where:

az = wind azimuth
u = West zonal wind component
v = North zonal wind component
W<INF>az</INF> = mean wind speed at azimuth for each month

    (v) An applicant shall estimate the interval fall time over a height 
interval assuming the initial descent velocity is equal to the terminal 
velocity (V<INF>T</INF>). An applicant shall use equations B4 through B6 
to estimate the fall time over a given height interval.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.058

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.059

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.060

where:

[Delta]H<INF>Tj</INF>= height difference between two mean geometric 
heights
[beta]= ballistic coefficient
--
[rho]x= mean atmospheric density for the corresponding mean geometric 
heights
 V<INF>Tj</INF> = terminal velocity

    (vi) An applicant shall estimate the interval debris dispersion 
(D<INF>j</INF>) by multiplying the interval fall time by the algebraic 
maximum mean wind speed (W<INF>max</INF>) as shown in equation B7.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.061

    (5) Once the Dj are estimated for each height interval, an applicant 
shall determine the total debris dispersion (D<INF>i</INF>) for each 
Z<INF>i</INF> using a linear interpolation and summation exercise, as 
shown below in equation B8. An applicant shall use a launch point height 
of zero equal to the surface level of the nearest GGUAS grid location.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.124

where:

n = number of height intervals below jth height interval

    (6) Once all the D<INF>i</INF> radii have been calculated, an 
applicant shall produce a launch area flight corridor in accordance with 
the requirements of subparagraphs (c)(6)(i)-(iv).
    (i) On a map meeting the requirements of appendix A, paragraph (b),

flight azimuth for the corresponding Z<INF>i</INF> position;
    (ii) An applicant shall draw a circle of radius D<INF>i</INF> 
centered on the corresponding X<INF>i</INF> position; and
    (iii) An applicant shall repeat the instructions in subparagraphs 
(c)(6)(i)-(ii) for each D<INF>i</INF> radius.
    (iv) The launch area of a flight corridor is the enveloping line 
that encloses the outer boundary of the D<INF>i</INF> circles as shown 
in Fig. B-1. The uprange portion of a flight corridor is described by a 
semi-circle arc that is a

[[Page 548]]

portion of either the most uprange D<INF>i</INF> dispersion circle, or 
the overflight exclusion zone (defined by subparagraph (c)(7)), 
whichever is further uprange.
    (7) An applicant shall define an overflight exclusion zone in the 
launch area in accordance with the requirements of appendix A, 
subparagraph (c)(2).
    (8) An applicant shall draw the launch area flight corridor and 
overflight exclusion zone on a map or maps that meet the requirements of 
table B-1.

    (d) Construction of a Downrange Area of a Flight Corridor
    (1) The downrange area analysis estimates the debris dispersion for 
the downrange time points on a launch vehicle trajectory. An applicant 
shall perform the downrange area analysis using the processes and 
equations of this paragraph.
    (2) The downrange area analysis shall include trajectory positions 
at a height (the Z<INF>i</INF>-values) greater than 50,000 feet and 
nominal trajectory IIP values less than or equal to 5,000 nm. For a 
guided suborbital launch vehicle, the final IIP value for which an 
applicant must account is the launch vehicle final stage impact point. 
Each trajectory time shall be one second or less and is denoted by the 
subscript ``i'.
    (3) An applicant shall compute the downrange area of a flight 
corridor boundary in four steps, from each trajectory time increment: 
determine a reduction ratio factor; calculate the launch vehicle 
position after simulating a malfunction turn; rotate the state vector 
after the malfunction turn in the range of three degrees to one degree 
as a function of X<INF>i</INF> distance downrange; and compute the IIP 
of the resulting trajectory. The locus of IIPs describes the boundary of 
the downrange area of a flight corridor. An applicant shall use the 
following subparagraphs, (d)(3)(i)-(v), to compute the downrange area of 
the flight corridor boundary:
    (i) Compute the downrange Distance to the final IIP position for a 
nominal trajectory as follows:
    (A) Using equations B30 through B69, determine the IIP coordinates 
([phis]<INF>max</INF>, [lambda]<INF>max</INF>) for the nominal state 
vector before the launch vehicle enters orbit where [alpha] in equation 
B30 is the nominal flight azimuth angle measured from True North.
    (B) Using the range and bearing equations of appendix A, paragraph 
(b)(3), determine

[[Page 549]]

the distance (S<INF>max</INF>) from the launch point coordinates 
([phis]<INF>lp</INF>, [lambda]<INF>lp</INF>) to the IIP coordinates 
([phis]<INF>max</INF>, [lambda]<INF>max</INF>) computed in accordance 
with (3)(i)(A) of this paragraph.
    (C) The distance for S<INF>max</INF> may not exceed 5000 nm. In 
cases when the actual value exceeds 5000 nm the applicant shall use 5000 
nm for S<INF>max</INF>.
    (ii) Compute the reduction ratio factor (F<INF>n</INF>) for each 
trajectory time increment as follows:
    (A) Using equations B30 through B69, determine the IIP coordinates 
([phis]<INF>i</INF>, [lambda]<INF>i</INF>) for the nominal state vector 
where [alpha] in equation B30 is the nominal flight azimuth angle 
measured from True North.
    (B) Using the range and bearing equations of appendix A, paragraph 
(b)(3), determine the distance (S<INF>i</INF>) from the launch point 
coordinates ([phis]<INF>lp</INF>, [lambda]<INF>lp</INF>) to the IIP 
coordinates ([phis]<INF>i</INF>, [lambda]<INF>i</INF>) computed in 
(3)(ii)(A) of this paragraph.
    (C) The reduction ratio factor is:

velocity components after a simulated malfunction turn for each 
X<INF>i</INF> using the following method.
    (A) Turn duration ([Delta]t) = 4 sec.

boundary, respectively. An applicant shall perform the trajectory 
rotation in conjunction with a trajectory transformation from the 
X<INF>90</INF>, Y<INF>90</INF>, Z<INF>90</INF>, X<INF>90</INF>, 
Y<INF>90</INF>, Z<INF>90</INF>, components to E, N, U, E, N, U. The 
trajectory subscripts ``R'' and ``L'' from equations B15 through B26 
have been discarded to reduce the number of equations. An applicant 
shall transform from to E,N,U,E,N,U to E,F,G,E,F,G. An applicant shall 
use the equations of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A)-(F) to produce the EFG

    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.071
    
    (v) The IIP computation implements an iterative solution to the 
impact point problem. An applicant shall solve equations B46 through 
B69, with the appropriate substitutions, up to a maximum of five times. 
Each repetition of the equations provides a

[[Page 553]]

more accurate prediction of the IIP. An applicant shall use the required 
IIP computations of paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A)-(W) below. An applicant 
shall use this IIP computation for both the left-and right-lateral 
offsets. The IIP computations will result in latitude and longitude 
pairs for the left-lateral flight corridor boundary and the right-
lateral flight corridor boundary. An applicant shall use the lines 
connecting the latitude and longitude pairs to describe the entire 
downrange area boundary of the flight corridor up to 5000 nm or a final 
stage impact dispersion area.
    (A) An applicant shall approximate the radial distance 
(r<INF>k,l</INF>) from the geocenter to the IIP. The distance from the 
center of the Earth ellipsoid to the launch point shall be used for the 
initial approximation of r<INF>k,l</INF> as shown in equation B46.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.072

    (B) An applicant shall compute the radial distance (r) from the 
geocenter to the launch vehicle position.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.073

    If r < r<INF>k,l</INF> then the launch vehicle position is below the 
Earth's surface and an impact point cannot be computed. An applicant 
must restart the calculations with the next trajectory state vector.
    (C) An applicant shall compute the inertial velocity components.

    (F) An applicant shall compute the semi-major axis of the trajectory 
ellipse (a<SUP>t</SUP>).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.077

    If at 0 or at then the trajectory orbit is not elliptical, but is 
hyperbolic or parabolic, and an impact point cannot be computed. The 
launch vehicle has achieved escape velocity and the applicant may 
terminate computations.
    (G) An applicant shall compute the eccentricity of the trajectory 
ellipse multiplied by the sine of the eccentric anomaly at epoch 
[egr]<INF>s</INF>).

    (H) An applicant shall compute the eccentricity of the trajectory 
ellipse squared [egr]\2\).

    If a<INF>t</INF>(1-[egr])-a<INF>E</INF>] <ls-thn-eq> 0 and [egr] 
<ls-thn-eq>= 0 then the trajectory perigee height is positive and an 
impact point cannot be computed. The launch vehicle has achieved Earth 
orbit and the applicant may terminate computations.
    (I) An applicant shall compute the eccentricity of the trajectory 
ellipse multiplied by the cosine of the eccentric anomaly at impact 
([egr]<INF>c</INF>k).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.080

    (J) An applicant shall compute the eccentricity of the trajectory 
ellipse multiplied by the sine of the eccentric anomaly at impact 
([egr]<INF>s</INF>k).
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.081

    If [egr]<INF>s</INF>k < 0 then the trajectory orbit does not 
intersect the Earth's surface and an impact point cannot be computed. 
The launch vehicle has achieved Earth orbit and the applicant may 
terminate computations.
    (K) An applicant shall compute the cosine of the difference between 
the eccentric anomaly at impact and the eccentric anomaly at epoch 
([Delta][egr]<INF>c</INF>k).

corridor and show the area on a map using the following procedure:

ending with the first IIP calculated on the left side. An applicant 
shall repeat this procedure for the right side.
    (iii) An applicant shall connect the left sides of the launch area 
and downrange portions of the flight corridor. An applicant shall repeat 
this procedure for the right side.
    (iv) An applicant shall plot the overflight exclusion zone defined 
in subparagraph (c)(7).
    (v) An applicant shall draw any impact dispersion area on the 
downrange map with the center of the impact dispersion area on the 
launch vehicle final stage impact point obtained from the applicant's 
launch vehicle trajectory analysis done in accordance with subparagraph 
(b)(1)(ii).

                      (e) Evaluate the Launch Site

    (1) An applicant shall evaluate the flight corridor for the presence 
of populated areas. If no populated area is located within the flight 
corridor, then no additional steps are necessary.
    (2) If a populated area is located in an overflight exclusion zone, 
an applicant may modify its proposal or demonstrate that there are times 
when no people are present or that the applicant has an agreement in 
place to evacuate the public from the overflight exclusion zone during a 
launch.
    (3) If a populated area is located within the flight corridor, an 
applicant may modify its proposal or complete an overflight risk 
analysis in accordance with appendix C.

                  Appendix C to Part 420--Risk Analysis

                            (a) Introduction

    (1) This appendix provides a method for an applicant to estimate the 
expected casualty (E<INF>c</INF>) for a launch of a guided expendable 
launch vehicle using a flight corridor generated either by appendix A or 
appendix B. This appendix also provides an applicant options to simplify 
the method where population at risk is minimal.
    (2) An applicant shall perform a risk analysis when a populated area 
is located within a flight corridor defined by either appendix A or 
appendix B. If the estimated expected casualty exceeds 30x10 
<SUP>-6</SUP>, an applicant may either modify its proposal, or if the 
flight corridor used was generated by the appendix A method, use the 
appendix B method to narrow the flight corridor and then redo the 
overflight risk analysis pursuant to this appendix. If the estimated 
expected casualty still exceeds 30x10 <SUP>-6</SUP> the FAA will not 
approve the location of the proposed launch point.

                          (b) Data Requirements

    (1) An applicant shall obtain the data specified by subparagraphs 
(b)(2) and (3) and summarized in table C-1. Table C-1 provides sources 
where an applicant may obtain data acceptable to the FAA. An applicant 
must also employ the flight corridor information from appendix A or B, 
including flight azimuth and, for an appendix B flight corridor, 
trajectory information.
    (2) Population data. Total population (N) and the total landmass 
area within a populated area (A) are required. Population data up to and 
including 100 nm from the launch point are required at the U.S. census 
block group level. Population data downrange from 100 nm are required at 
no greater than 1[deg] x 1[deg] latitude/longitude grid coordinates.
    (3) Launch vehicle data. Launch vehicle data consist of the launch 
vehicle failure probability (P<INF>f</INF>), the launch vehicle 
effective casualty area (A<INF>c</INF>), trajectory position data, and 
the overflight dwell time (t<INF>d</INF>). The failure probability is a 
constant (P<INF>f</INF> = 0.10) for a guided orbital or suborbital 
expendable launch vehicle. Table C-3 provides effective casualty area 
data based on IIP range. Trajectory position information is provided 
from distance computations provided by this appendix for an appendix A 
flight corridor, or trajectory data used in appendix B for an appendix B 
flight corridor. The dwell time (t<INF>d</INF>) may be determined from 
trajectory data produced when creating an appendix B flight corridor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

              (c) Estimating Corridor Casualty Expectation

    (1) A corridor casualty expectation [E<INF>C</INF>(Corridor)] 
estimate is the sum of the expected casualty measurement of each 
populated area inside a flight corridor.
    (2) An applicant shall identify and locate each populated area in 
the proposed flight corridor.
    (3) An applicant shall determine the probability of impact in each 
populated area using the procedures in subparagraphs (5) or (6) of this 
paragraph. Figures C-1 and C-2 illustrate an area considered for 
probability of impact (P<INF>i</INF> ) computations by the dashed-lined 
box around the populated area within a flight corridor, and figure C-3 
illustrates a populated area in a final stage impact dispersion area. An 
applicant shall then estimate the E<INF>C</INF> for each populated area 
in accordance with subparagraphs (7) and (8) of this paragraph.
    (4) The P<INF>i</INF> computations do not directly account for 
populated areas whose areas are bisected by an appendix A flight 
corridor centerline or an appendix B nominal trajectory ground trace. 
Accordingly, an applicant must evaluate P<INF>i</INF> for each of the 
bi-sections as two separate populated areas, as shown in figure C-4, 
which shows one bi-section to the left of an appendix A flight 
corridor's centerline and one to its right.
    (5) Probability of impact (P<INF>i</INF>) computations for a 
populated area in an appendix A flight corridor. An applicant shall 
compute P<INF>i</INF> for each populated area using the following 
method:
    (i) For the launch and downrange areas, but not for a final stage 
impact dispersion area for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an 
applicant shall compute P<INF>i</INF> for each populated area using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.094

where:

x<INF>1</INF>, x<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest downrange distance 
(nm) along the flight corridor centerline to the populated area (see 
figure C-1)
y<INF>1</INF>, y<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest cross range distance 
(nm) to the populated area measured from the flight corridor centerline 
(see figure C-1)
[sigma]<INF>y</INF> = one-third of the cross range distance from the 
centerline to the flight corridor boundary (see figure C-1)
exp = exponential function (e \x\)
P<INF>f</INF> = probability of failure = 0.10
R = IIP range rate (nm/sec) (see table C-2)
C = 643 seconds (constant)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) For each populated area within a final stage impact dispersion 
area, an applicant shall compute P<INF>i</INF> using the following 
method:
    (A) An applicant shall estimate the probability of final stage 
impact in the x and y sectors of each populated area within the final 
stage impact dispersion area using equations C2 and C3:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.095

where:

X<INF>1</INF>, X<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest downrange distance, 
measured along the flight corridor centerline, measured from the nominal 
impact point to the populated area (see figure C-3)
[sigma]<INF>x</INF> = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see 
figure C-3)
exp = exponential function (e \x\)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.096

where:

y<INF>1</INF>, y<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest cross range distance 
to the populated area measured from the flight corridor centerline (see 
figure C-3)
[sigma]<INF>y</INF> = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see 
figure C-3)
exp = exponential function (e \x\)

    (B) If a populated area intersects the impact dispersion area 
boundary so that the x<INF>2</INF> or y<INF>2</INF> distance would 
otherwise extend outside the impact dispersion area, the x<INF>2</INF> 
or y<INF>2</INF> distance should be set equal to the impact dispersion 
area radius. The x<INF>2</INF> distance for populated area A in figure 
C-3 is an example. If a populated area intersects the flight azimuth, an 
applicant shall solve equation C3 by obtaining the solution in two 
parts. An applicant shall determine, first, the probability between 
y<INF>1</INF> = 0 and y<INF>2</INF> = a and, second, the probability 
between y<INF>1</INF> = 0 and y<INF>2</INF> = b, as depicted in figure 
C-4. The probability P<INF>y</INF> is then equal to the sum of the 
probabilities of the two parts. If a populated area intersects the line 
that is normal to the flight azimuth on the impact point, an applicant 
shall solve equation C2 by obtaining the solution in two parts in the 
same manner as with the values of x.
    (C) An applicant shall calculate the probability of impact for each 
populated area using equation C4 below:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.097

where: P<INF>s</INF> = 1-P<INF>f</INF> = 0.90

[[Page 559]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.098

    (6) Probability of impact computations for a populated area in an 
appendix B flight corridor. An applicant shall compute P<INF>i</INF> 
using the following method:
    (i) For the launch and downrange areas, but not for a final stage 
impact dispersion area for a guided suborbital launch vehicle, an 
applicant shall compute P<INF>i</INF> for each populated area using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.099

where:

y<INF>1</INF>,y<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest cross range distance 
(nm) to a populated area measured from the nominal trajectory IIP ground 
trace (see figure C-2)
[sigma]<INF>y</INF> = one-third of the cross range distance (nm) from 
nominal trajectory to the flight corridor boundary (see figure C-2)
exp = exponential function (e\x\)
P<INF>f</INF> = probability of failure = 0.10
t = flight time from lift-off to orbital insertion (seconds)
t<INF>d</INF> = overflight dwell time (seconds)

    (ii) For each populated area within a final stage impact dispersion 
area, an applicant shall compute P<INF>i</INF> using the following 
method:
    (A) An applicant shall estimate the probability of final stage 
impact in the x and y sectors of each populated area within the final 
stage impact dispersion area using equations C6 and C7:

[[Page 560]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.100

where:

x<INF>1</INF>, x<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest downrange distance, 
measured along nominal trajectory IIP ground trace, measured from the 
nominal impact point to the populated area (see figure C-3)
[sigma]<INF>x</INF> = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see 
figure C-3)
exp = exponential function (e\x\)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.105

where:

y<INF>1</INF>, y<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest cross range distance 
to the populated area measured from the nominal trajectory IIP ground 
trace (see figure C-3)
[sigma]<INF>y</INF> = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see 
figure C-3)
exp = exponential function (e\x\)

    (B) If a populated area intersects the impact dispersion area 
boundary so that the x<INF>2</INF> or y<INF>2</INF> distance would 
otherwise extend outside the impact dispersion area, the x<INF>2</INF> 
or y<INF>2</INF> distance should be set equal to the impact dispersion 
area radius. The x<INF>2</INF> distance for populated area A in figure 
C-3 is an example. If a populated area intersects the flight azimuth, an 
applicant shall solve equation C7 by obtaining the solution in two 
parts. An applicant shall determine, first, the probability between 
y<INF>1</INF> = 0 and y<INF>2</INF> = a and, second, the probability 
between y<INF>1</INF> = 0 and y<INF>2</INF> = b, as depicted in figure 
C-4. The probability P<INF>y</INF> is then equal to the sum of the 
probabilities of the two parts. If a populated area intersects the line 
that is normal to the flight azimuth on the impact point, an applicant 
shall solve equation C6 by obtaining the solution in two parts in a 
similar manner with the values of x.
    (C) An applicant shall calculate the probability of impact for each 
populated area using equation C8 below:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.106

where: P<INF>s</INF> = 1-P<INF>f</INF> = 0.90

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.108

    (7) Using the P<INF>i</INF> calculated in either subparagraph (c)(5) 
or (6) of this paragraph, an applicant shall calculate the casualty 
expectancy for each populated area within the flight corridor in 
accordance with equation C9. E<INF>ck</INF> is the casualty expectancy 
for a given populated area as shown in equation C9, where individual 
populated areas are designated with the subscript ``k''.

subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8). Those variations are identified in 
subparagraphs (9)(i) through (vi) of this paragraph. Subparagraphs (i) 
through (iv) permit an applicant to make conservative assumptions that 
would lead to an overestimation of the corridor E<INF>C</INF> compared 
with the analysis defined by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8). In subparagraphs 
(v) and (vi), an applicant that would otherwise fail the analysis 
prescribed by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8) may avoid (c)(1)-(8)'s 
overestimation of the probability of impact in each populated area. An 
applicant employing a variation shall identify the variation used, show 
and discuss the specific assumptions made to modify the analysis defined 
by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(8), and demonstrate how each assumption leads 
to overestimation of the corridor E<INF>C</INF> compared with the 
analysis defined by subparagraphs (c)(1)-(c)(8).
    (i) Assume that P<INF>x</INF> and P<INF>y</INF> have a value of 1.0 
for all populated areas.
    (ii) Combine populated areas into one or more larger populated 
areas, and use a population density for the combined area or areas equal 
to the most densely populated area.
    (iii) For any given populated area, assume P<INF>y</INF> has a value 
of one.
    (iv) For any given P<INF>x</INF> sector (an area spanning the width 
of a flight corridor and bounded by two time points on the trajectory 
IIP ground trace) assume P<INF>y</INF> has a value of one and use a 
population density for the sector equal to the most densely populated 
area.
    (v) For a given populated area, divide the populated area into 
smaller rectangles, determine P<INF>i</INF> for each individual 
rectangle, and sum the individual impact probabilities to determine 
P<INF>i</INF> for the entire populated area.
    (vi) For a given populated area, use the ratio of the populated area 
to the area of the P<INF>i</INF> rectangle from the subparagraph (c)(1)-
(8) analysis.

                        (d) Evaluation of Results

    (1) If the estimated expected casualty does not exceed 
30x10<SUP>-6</SUP>, the FAA will approve the launch site location.
    (2) If the estimated expected casualty exceeds 30x10<SUP>-6</SUP>, 
then an applicant may either modify its proposal, or, if the flight 
corridor used was generated by the appendix A method, use the appendix B 
method to narrow the flight corridor and then perform another appendix C 
risk analysis.

Appendix D to Part 420--Impact Dispersion Areas and Casualty Expectancy 
           Estimate for an Unguided Suborbital Launch Vehicle

                            (a) Introduction

    (1) This appendix provides a method for determining the 
acceptability of the location of a launch point from which an unguided 
suborbital launch vehicle would be launched. The appendix describes how 
to define an overflight exclusion zone and impact dispersion areas, and 
how to evaluate whether the public risk presented by the launch of an 
unguided suborbital launch vehicle remains at acceptable levels.
    (2) An applicant shall base its analysis on an unguided suborbital 
launch vehicle whose

[[Page 564]]

final launch vehicle stage apogee represents the intended use of the 
launch point.
    (3) An applicant shall use the apogee of each stage of an existing 
unguided suborbital launch vehicle with a final launch vehicle stage 
apogee equal to the one proposed, and calculate each impact range and 
dispersion area using the equations provided.
    (4) This appendix also provides a method for performing an impact 
risk analysis that estimates the expected casualty (E<INF>c</INF>) 
within each impact dispersion area. This appendix provides an applicant 
options to simplify the method where population at risk is minimal.
    (5) If the estimated E<INF>c</INF> is less than or equal to 
30x10<SUP>-6,</SUP> the FAA will approve the launch point for unguided 
suborbital launch vehicles. If the estimated E<INF>c</INF> exceeds 
30x10<SUP>-6,</SUP> the proposed launch point will fail the launch site 
location review.

                          (b) Data Requirements

    (1) An applicant shall employ the apogee of each stage of an 
existing unguided suborbital launch vehicle whose final stage apogee 
represents the maximum altitude to be reached by unguided suborbital 
launch vehicles launched from the launch point. The apogee shall be 
obtained from one or more actual flights of an unguided suborbital 
launch vehicle launched at an 84 degree elevation.
    (2) An applicant shall satisfy the map and plotting data 
requirements of appendix A, paragraph (b).
    (3) Population data. An applicant shall use total population (N) and 
the total landmass area within a populated area (A) for all populated 
areas within an impact dispersion area. Population data up to and 
including 100 nm from the launch point are required at the U.S. census 
block group level. Population data downrange from 100 nm are required at 
no greater than 1[deg] x 1[deg] latitude/longitude grid coordinates.

        (c) Overflight Exclusion Zone and Impact Dispersion Areas

    (1) An applicant shall choose a flight azimuth from a launch point.
    (2) An applicant shall define an overflight exclusion zone as a 
circle with a radius of 1600 feet centered on the launch point.
    (3) An applicant shall define an impact dispersion area for each 
stage of the suborbital launch vehicle chosen in accordance with 
subparagraph (b)(1) in accordance with the following:
    (i) An applicant shall calculate the impact range for the final 
launch vehicle stage (D<INF>n</INF>). An applicant shall set 
D<INF>n</INF> equal to the last stage apogee altitude (H<INF>n</INF>) 
multiplied by an impact range factor [IP(H<INF>n</INF>)] in accordance 
with the following:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.111

where:

IP(H<INF>n</INF>) = 0.4 for an apogee less than 100 km, and
IP(H<INF>n</INF>) = 0.7 for an apogee of 100 km or greater.

    (ii) An applicant shall calculate the impact range for each 
intermediate stage (D<INF>i</INF>), where i [egr] {1, 2, 3, . . . (n- 
1){time} , and where n is the total number of launch vehicle stages. 
Using the apogee altitude (H<INF>i</INF>) of each intermediate stage, an 
applicant shall use equation D1 to compute the impact range of each 
stage by substituting H<INF>i</INF> for H<INF>n</INF>. An applicant 
shall use the impact range factors provided by equation D1.
    (iii) An applicant shall calculate the impact dispersion radius for 
the final launch vehicle stage (R<INF>n</INF>). An applicant shall set 
R<INF>n</INF> equal to the last stage apogee altitude (H<INF>n</INF>) 
multiplied by an impact dispersion factor [DISP(H<INF>n</INF>)] in 
accordance with the following:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.112

where:

DISP(H<INF>n</INF>) = 0.4 for an apogee less than 100 km, and
DISP(Hn) = 0.7 for an apogee of 100 km or greater.

    (iv) An applicant shall calculate the impact dispersion radius for 
each intermediate stage (R<INF>i</INF>), where i [egr] {1, 2, 3, . . . 
(n- 1){time}  and where n is the total number of launch vehicle stages. 
Using the apogee altitude (H<INF>i</INF>) of each intermediate stage, an 
applicant shall use equation D2 to compute an impact dispersion radius 
of each stage by substituting H<INF>i</INF> for H<INF>n</INF>. An 
applicant shall use the dispersion factors provided by equation D2.
    (4) An applicant shall display an overflight exclusion zone, each 
intermediate and final stage impact point (D<INF>i</INF> through 
D<INF>n</INF>), and each impact dispersion area for the intermediate and 
final launch vehicle stages on maps in accordance with paragraph (b)(2).

 (d) Evaluate the Overflight Exclusion Zone and Impact Dispersion Areas

    (1) An applicant shall evaluate the overflight exclusion zone and 
each impact dispersion area for the presence of any populated areas. If 
an applicant determines that no populated area is located within the 
overflight exclusion zone or any impact dispersion area, then no 
additional steps are necessary.
    (2) If a populated area is located in an overflight exclusion zone, 
an applicant may modify its proposal or demonstrate that there are times 
when no people are present or that the applicant has an agreement in 
place to evacuate the public from the overflight exclusion zone during a 
launch.
    (3) If a populated area is located within any impact dispersion 
area, an applicant may modify its proposal and define a new overflight 
exclusion zone and new impact dispersion areas, or perform an impact 
risk analysis in accordance with paragraph (e).

                        (e) Impact Risk Analysis

    (1) An applicant shall estimate the expected average number of 
casualties, E<INF>C</INF>, within the impact dispersion areas according 
to the following method:
    (i) An applicant shall calculate the E<INF>c</INF> by summing the 
impact risk for the impact dispersion areas of the final launch vehicle 
stage and all intermediate stages. An applicant shall estimate 
E<INF>c</INF> for the impact dispersion area of each stage by using 
equations D3 through D7 for each of the populated areas located within 
the impact dispersion areas.
    (ii) An applicant shall estimate the probability of impacting inside 
the X and Y sectors of each populated area within each impact dispersion 
area using equations D3 and D4:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.114

where:

x<INF>1</INF>, x<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest downrange distance 
to populated area (see figure D-2)

[[Page 566]]

[sigma]<INF>x</INF> = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see 
figure D-2)
exp = exponential function (e\x\)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.115

where:

y<INF>1</INF>, y<INF>2</INF> = closest and farthest cross range distance 
to the populated area (see figure D-2)
[sigma]<INF>y</INF> = one-third of the impact dispersion radius (see 
figure D-2)
exp = exponential function (e\x\)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.116

    (iii) If a populated area intersects the impact dispersion area 
boundary so that the x<INF>2</INF> or y<INF>2</INF> distance would 
otherwise extend outside the impact dispersion area, the x<INF>2</INF> 
or y<INF>2</INF> distance should be set equal to the impact dispersion 
area radius. The x<INF>2</INF> distance for populated area A in figure 
D-2 is an example.
    (iv) If a populated area intersects the flight azimuth, an applicant 
shall solve equation D4 by obtaining the solution in two parts. An 
applicant shall determine, first, the probability between y<INF>1</INF> 
= 0 and y<INF>2</INF> = a and, second, the probability between 
y<INF>1</INF> = 0 and y<INF>2</INF> = b, as depicted in figure D-3. The 
probability P<INF>y</INF> is then equal to the sum of the probabilities 
of the two parts. If a populated area intersects the line that is normal 
to the flight azimuth on the impact point, an applicant shall solve 
equation D3 by obtaining the solution in two parts in the same manner as 
with the values of x.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.117

    (v) An applicant shall calculate the probability of impact 
(P<INF>i</INF>) for each populated area using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.118

where:

P<INF>s</INF> = probability of success = 0.98

    (vi) An applicant shall calculate the casualty expectancy for each 
populated area. E<INF>c</INF><INF>k</INF> is the casualty expectancy for 
a given populated area as shown in equation D6, where individual 
populated areas are designated with the subscript ``k''.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19OC00.119

where:

k { {1, 2, 3, . . . , n{time} 
A<INF>c</INF> = casualty area (from table D-1)
A<INF>k</INF> = populated area
N<INF>k</INF> = population in A<INF>k</INF>

    (viii) Alternative casualty expectancy (E<INF>c</INF>) analysis. An 
applicant may employ specified variations to the analysis defined by 
subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii). Those variations are identified in 
subparagraphs (viii)(A) through (F) of this paragraph. Subparagraphs (A) 
through (D) permit an applicant to make conservative assumptions that 
would lead to an overestimation of E<INF>c</INF> compared with the 
analysis defined by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii). In subparagraphs (E) 
and (F), an applicant that would otherwise fail the analysis prescribed 
by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii) may avoid (d)(1)(i)-(vii)'s 
overestimation of the probability of impact in each populated area. An 
applicant employing a variation shall identify the variation used, show 
and discuss the specific assumptions made to modify the analysis defined 
by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii), and demonstrate how each assumption 
leads to overestimation of the corridor E<INF>c</INF> compared with the 
analysis defined by subparagraphs (d)(1)(i)-(vii).
    (A) Assume that P<INF>x</INF> and P<INF>y</INF> have a value of 1.0 
for all populated areas.
    (B) Combine populated areas into one or more larger populated areas, 
and use a population density for the combined area or areas equal to the 
most densely populated area.
    (C) For any given populated area, assume P<INF>x</INF> has a value 
of one.
    (D) For any given populated area, assume P<INF>y</INF> has a value 
of one.
    (E) For a given populated area, divide the populated area into 
smaller rectangles, determine P<INF>i</INF> for each individual 
rectangle, and sum the individual impact probabilities to determine 
P<INF>i</INF> for the entire populated area.
    (F) For a given populated area, use the ratio of the populated area 
to the area of the P<INF>i</INF> rectangle used in the subparagraph 
(d)(1)(i)-(vii) analysis.
    (2) If the estimated expected casualty does not exceed 30 x 
10<SUP>-6</SUP>, the FAA will approve the launch point.
    (3) If the estimated expected casualty exceeds 30 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP>, 
then an applicant may modify its proposal and then repeat the impact 
risk analysis in accordance with this appendix D. If no set of impact 
dispersion areas exist which satisfy the FAA's risk threshold, the 
applicant's proposed launch site will fail the launch site location 
review.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 431.1  Scope.

    This part prescribes requirements for obtaining a reusable launch 
vehicle (RLV) mission license and post-licensing requirements with which 
a licensee must comply to remain licensed. Requirements for preparing a 
license application are contained in part 413 of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 431.3  Types of reusable launch vehicle mission licenses.

    (a) Mission-specific license. A mission-specific license authorizing 
an RLV mission authorizes a licensee to launch and reenter, or otherwise 
land, one model or type of RLV from a launch site approved for the 
mission to a reentry site or other location approved for the mission. A 
mission-specific license authorizing an RLV mission may authorize more 
than one RLV mission and identifies each flight of an RLV authorized 
under the license. A licensee's authorization to conduct RLV missions 
terminates upon completion of all activities authorized by the license 
or the expiration date stated in the reentry license, whichever occurs 
first.
    (b) Operator license. An operator license for RLV missions 
authorizes a licensee to launch and reenter, or otherwise land, any of a 
designated family of RLVs within authorized parameters, including launch 
sites and trajectories, transporting specified classes of payloads to 
any reentry site or other location designated in the license. An 
operator license for RLV missions is valid for a two-year renewable 
term.


<R05>
Sec. 431.5  Policy and safety approvals.

    To obtain either type of RLV mission license, an applicant must 
obtain policy and safety approvals from the FAA. Requirements for 
obtaining these approvals are contained in subparts B and C of this 
part. Only the license applicant may apply for the approvals, and may 
apply for either approval separately and in advance of submitting a 
complete license application, using the application procedures contained 
in part 413 of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 431.7  Payload and payload reentry determinations.

    (a) A payload determination is required to launch a payload unless 
the proposed payload is exempt from payload review under Sec. 415.53 of 
this chapter. Requirements for obtaining a payload determination are set 
forth in part 415, subpart D of this chapter.
    (b) A payload reentry determination is required to reenter a payload 
to Earth on an RLV unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload 
reentry review.
    (c) A payload reentry determination made under a previous license 
application under this subchapter may satisfy the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The FAA conducts a review, as described in subpart D of this 
part, to make a payload reentry determination. Either an RLV mission 
license applicant or a payload owner or operator may request a review of 
the proposed payload using the application procedures contained in part 
413 of this subchapter. Upon receipt of an application, the FAA may 
conduct a payload reentry review independently of an RLV mission license 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 431.9  Issuance of a reusable launch vehicle mission license.

    (a) The FAA issues either a mission-specific or operator license 
authorizing RLV missions to an applicant who has obtained all approvals 
and determinations required under this chapter for the license.
    (b) An RLV mission license authorizes a licensee to launch and 
reenter, or otherwise land, an RLV and payload, if any, in accordance 
with the representations contained in the licensee's application, 
subject to the licensee's compliance with terms and conditions contained 
in license orders accompanying the license, including financial 
responsibility requirements.

[[Page 573]]


<R05>
Sec. 431.11  Additional license terms and conditions.

    The FAA may amend an RLV mission license at any time by modifying or 
adding license terms and conditions to ensure compliance with 49 U.S.C. 
Subtitle IX, chapter 701, and applicable regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 431.13  Transfer of a reusable launch vehicle mission license.

    (a) Only the FAA may transfer an RLV mission license.
    (b) An applicant for transfer of an RLV mission license shall submit 
a license application in accordance with part 413 of this subchapter and 
satisfy the applicable requirements of this part. The FAA will transfer 
an RLV mission license to an applicant who has obtained all of the 
approvals and determinations required under this chapter for an RLV 
mission license. In conducting its reviews and issuing approvals and 
determinations, the FAA may incorporate any findings made part of the 
record to support the initial licensing determination. The FAA may 
modify an RLV mission license to reflect any changes necessary as a 
result of a license transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 431.15  Rights not conferred by a reusable launch vehicle mission 
license.

    Issuance of an RLV mission license does not relieve a licensee of 
its obligation to comply with requirements of law that may apply to its 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 431.16-431.20  [Reserved]


<R04>
    Subpart B_Policy Review and Approval for Launch and Reentry of a 
                         Reusable Launch Vehicle


<R05>
Sec. 431.21  General.

    The FAA issues a policy approval to an RLV mission license applicant 
upon completion of a favorable policy review. A policy approval is part 
of the licensing record on which the licensing determination is based.


<R05>
Sec. 431.23  Policy review.

    (a) The FAA reviews an RLV mission license application to determine 
whether the proposed mission presents any issues, other than those 
issues addressed in the safety review, that would adversely affect U.S. 
national security or foreign policy interests, would jeopardize public 
health and safety or the safety of property, or would not be consistent 
with international obligations of the United States.
    (b) Interagency consultation is conducted as follows:
    (1) The FAA consults with the Department of Defense to determine 
whether an RLV mission license application presents any issues adversely 
affecting U.S. national security.
    (2) The FAA consults with the Department of State to determine 
whether an RLV mission license application presents any issues adversely 
affecting U.S. foreign policy interests or international obligations.
    (3) The FAA consults with other Federal agencies, including the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, authorized to address 
issues identified under paragraph (a) of this section, associated with 
an applicant's RLV mission proposal.
    (c) The FAA advises an applicant, in writing, of any issue raised 
during a policy review that would impede issuance of a policy approval. 
The applicant may respond, in writing, or revise its license 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 431.25  Application requirements for policy review.

    In its RLV mission license application, an applicant must--
    (a) Identify the model, type, and configuration of any RLV proposed 
for launch and reentry, or otherwise landing on Earth, by the applicant.
    (b) Identify all vehicle systems, including structural, thermal, 
pneumatic, propulsion, electrical, and avionics and guidance systems 
used in the vehicle(s), and all propellants.
    (c) Identify foreign ownership of the applicant as follows:
    (1) For a sole proprietorship or partnership, identify all foreign 
ownership;
    (2) For a corporation, identify any foreign ownership interests of 
10% or more; and

[[Page 574]]

    (3) For a joint venture, association, or other entity, identify any 
participating foreign entities.
    (d) Identify proposed launch and reentry flight profile(s), 
including--
    (1) Launch and reentry site(s), including planned contingency abort 
locations, if any;
    (2) Flight trajectories, reentry trajectories, associated ground 
tracks, and instantaneous impact points for nominal operations, and 
contingency abort profiles, if any;

Sec. 435.3  Types of reentry licenses.

    (a) Reentry-specific license. A reentry-specific license authorizes 
a licensee to reenter one model or type of reentry vehicle, other than 
an RLV, to a reentry site or other location approved for the reentry. A 
reentry-specific license may authorize more than one reentry and 
identifies each reentry authorized under the license. A licensee's 
authorization to reenter terminates upon completion of all activities 
authorized by the license or the expiration date stated in the reentry 
license, whichever occurs first.
    (b) Reentry-operator license. A reentry operator license authorizes 
a licensee to reenter any of a designated family of reentry vehicles, 
other than an RLV, within authorized parameters, including trajectories, 
transporting specified classes of payloads to any reentry site 
designated in the license. A reentry operator license is valid for a 2-
year renewable term.

vehicle and payload, if any, in accordance with the representations 
contained in the reentry licensee's application, subject to the 
licensee's compliance with terms and conditions contained in license 
orders accompanying the reentry license, including financial 
responsibility requirements.


<R05>

    (b) An applicant for transfer of a reentry license shall submit a 
reentry license application in accordance with part 413 of this 
subchapter and satisfy the applicable requirements of this part. The FAA 
will transfer a reentry license to an applicant who has obtained all of 
the approvals and determinations required under this chapter for a 
reentry license. In conducting its reviews and issuing approvals and 
determinations, the FAA may incorporate any findings made part of the 
record to support the initial licensing determination. The FAA may 
modify a reentry license to reflect any changes necessary as a result of 
a reentry license transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 435.15  Rights not conferred by reentry license.

    Issuance of a reentry license does not relieve a licensee of its 
obligation to comply with requirements of law that may apply to its 
activities.

activities as warranted by supplementary information provided to or 
obtained by the Office after the MPL determination is issued. Any change 
in financial responsibility requirements as a result of an amended MPL 
determination shall be set forth in a license order.
    (e) The Office may make a determination of maximum probable loss at 
any time other than as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section upon 
request by any person.

    (a) As a condition of each launch license, the licensee must comply 
with insurance requirements set forth in this section and in a license 
order issued by the Office, or otherwise demonstrate the required amount 
of financial responsibility.
    (b) The licensee must obtain and maintain in effect a policy or 
policies of liability insurance, in an amount determined by the Office 
under paragraph (c) of this section, that protects the following persons 
as additional insureds to the extent of their respective potential 
liabilities against covered claims by a third party for bodily injury or 
property damage resulting from licensed launch activities:
    (1) The licensee, its customer, and their respective contractors and 
subcontractors, and the employees of each, involved in licensed launch 
activities;
    (2) The United States, its agencies, and its contractors and 
subcontractors involved in licensed launch activities; and
    (3) Government personnel.
    (c) The Office shall prescribe for each licensee the amount of 
insurance required to compensate the total of covered third-party claims 
for bodily injury or property damage resulting from licensed launch 
activities in connection with any particular launch. Covered third-party 
claims include claims by the United States, its agencies, and its 
contractors and subcontractors for damage or loss to property other than 
property for which insurance is required under paragraph (d) of this 
section. The amount of insurance required is based upon the Office's 
determination of maximum probable loss; however, it will not exceed the 
lesser of:
    (1) $500 million; or
    (2) The maximum liability insurance available on the world market at 
a reasonable cost, as determined by the Office.
    (d) The licensee must obtain and maintain in effect a policy or 
policies of insurance, in an amount determined by the Office under 
paragraph (e) of this section, that covers claims by the United States, 
its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors involved in 
licensed launch activities for property damage or loss resulting from 
licensed launch activities. Property covered by this insurance must 
include all property owned, leased, or occupied by, or within the care, 
custody, or control of, the United States and its agencies, and its 
contractors and subcontractors involved in licensed launch activities, 
at a Federal range facility. Insurance must protect the United States 
and its agencies, and its contractors and subcontractors involved in 
licensed launch activities.
    (e) The Office shall prescribe for each licensee the amount of 
insurance required to compensate claims for property damage under 
paragraph (d) of this section resulting from licensed launch activities 
in connection with any particular launch. The amount of insurance is 
based upon a determination of maximum probable loss; however, it will 
not exceed the lesser of:
    (1) $100 million; or
    (2) The maximum available on the world market at a reasonable cost, 
as determined by the Office.
    (f) In lieu of a policy of insurance, a licensee may demonstrate 
financial responsibility in another manner meeting the terms and 
conditions applicable to insurance as set forth in this part. The 
licensee must describe in detail the method proposed for demonstrating 
financial responsibility and how it assures that the licensee is able to 
cover claims as required under this part.

Sec. 440.11  Duration of coverage; modifications.

    (a) Insurance coverage required under Sec. 440.9, or other form of 
financial responsibility, shall attach upon commencement of licensed 
launch activities, and remain in full force and effect as follows:
    (1) Until completion of licensed launch activities at the launch 
site; and
    (2) For orbital launches, until the later of--
    (i) Thirty days following payload separation, or attempted payload 
separation in the event of a payload separation anomaly; or
    (ii) Thirty days from ignition of the launch vehicle.
    (3) For suborbital launches, until the later of--
    (i) Motor impact and payload recovery; or
    (ii) The Office's determination that risk to third parties and 
Government property as a result of licensed launch activities is 
sufficiently small that financial responsibility is no longer necessary, 
as determined by the Office through the risk analysis conducted before 
the launch to determine MPL and specified in a license order.
    (b) Financial responsibility required under this part may not be 
replaced, canceled, changed, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce 
the limits of liability or the extent of coverage, nor expire by its own 
terms, prior to the time specified in a license order, unless the Office 
is notified at least 30 days in advance and expressly approves the 
modification.


<R05>
Sec. 440.13  Standard conditions of insurance coverage.

    (a) Insurance obtained under Sec. 440.9 shall comply with the 
following terms and conditions of coverage:
    (1) Bankruptcy or insolvency of an insured, including any additional 
insured, shall not relieve the insurer of any of its obligations under 
any policy.
    (2) Policy limits shall apply separately to each occurrence and, for 
each occurrence to the total of claims arising out of licensed launch 
activities in connection with any particular launch.
    (3) Except as provided herein, each policy must pay claims from the 
first dollar of loss, without regard to any deductible, to the limits of 
the policy. A licensee may obtain a policy containing a deductible 
amount if the amount of the deductible is placed in an escrow account or 
otherwise demonstrated to be unobligated, unencumbered funds of the 
licensee, available to compensate claims at any time claims may arise.
    (4) Each policy shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction 
of the licensee or any additional insured, including nonpayment by the 
licensee of the policy premium, and must insure the licensee and each 
additional insured regardless of any breach or violation of any 
warranties, declarations, or conditions contained in the policies by the 
licensee or any additional insured (other than a breach or violation by 
the licensee or an additional insured, and then only as against that 
licensee or additional insured).
    (5) Exclusions from coverage must be specified.
    (6) Insurance shall be primary without right of contribution from 
any other insurance that is carried by the licensee or any additional 
insured.
    (7) Each policy must expressly provide that all of its provisions, 
except the policy limits, operate in the same manner as if there were a 
separate policy with and covering the licensee and each additional 
insured.
    (8) Each policy must be placed with an insurer of recognized 
reputation and responsibility that is licensed to do business in any 
State, territory, possession of the United States, or the District of 
Columbia.
    (9) Except as to claims resulting from the willful misconduct of the 
United States or its agents, the insurer shall waive any and all rights 
of subrogation against each of the parties protected by required 
insurance.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 440.15  Demonstration of compliance.

with reciprocal waiver of claims requirements as set forth in this 
section.
    (b) The licensee shall implement reciprocal waivers of claims with 
its contractors and subcontractors, its customer(s) and the customer's 
contractors and subcontractors, under which each party waives and 
releases claims against the other parties to the waivers and agrees to 
assume financial responsibility for property damage it sustains and for 
bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, and to 
hold harmless and indemnify each other from bodily injury or property 
damage sustained by its employees, resulting from licensed launch 
activities, regardless of fault.

[[Page 592]]

    (c) For each licensed launch in which the U.S. Government, its 
agencies, or its contractors and subcontractors is involved in licensed 
launch activities or where property insurance is required under Sec. 
440.9(d) of this part, the Federal Aviation Administration of the 
Department of Transportation, the licensee, and its customer shall enter 
into a three-party reciprocal waiver of claims agreement in the form set 
forth in Appendix II to this part or that satisfies its requirements.

legislation, must agree in any waiver of claims agreement required under 
this part to indemnify another party to the agreement from claims by the 
indemnifying party's contractors and subcontractors arising out of the 
indemnifying party's failure to implement properly the waiver 
requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 440.19  United States payment of excess third-party liability claims.

    (a) The United States pays successful covered claims (including 
reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) of a third party 
against the licensee, the customer, and the contractors and 
subcontractors of the licensee and the customer, and the employees of 
each involved in licensed launch activities, and the contractors and 
subcontractors of the United States and its agencies, and their 
employees, involved in licensed launch activities to the extent provided 
in an appropriation law or other legislative authority providing for 
payment of claims in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 70113, and to the extent 
the total amount of such covered claims arising out of any particular 
launch:
    (1) Exceeds the amount of insurance required under Sec. 440.9(b); 
and
    (2) Is not more than $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation 
occurring after January 1, 1989) above that amount.
    (b) Payment by the United States under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not be made for any part of such claims for which bodily injury or 
property damage results from willful misconduct by the party seeking 
payment.
    (c) The United States shall provide for payment of claims by third 
parties for bodily injury or property damage that are payable under 49 
U.S.C. 70113 and not covered by required insurance under Sec. 440.9(b), 
without regard to the limitation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
because of an insurance policy exclusion that is usual. A policy 
exclusion is considered usual only if insurance covering the excluded 
risk is not commercially available at reasonable rates. The licensee 
must submit a certification in accordance with Sec. 440.15(c)(1)(iii) 
of this part for the United States to cover the claims.
    (d) Upon the expiration of the policy period prescribed in 
accordance with Sec. 440.11(a), the United States shall provide for 
payment of claims that are payable under 49 U.S.C. 70113 from the first 
dollar of loss up to $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation occurring 
after January 1, 1989).
    (e) Payment by the United States of excess third-party claims under 
49 U.S.C. 70113 shall be subject to:
    (1) Prompt notice by the licensee to the Office that the total 
amount of claims arising out of licensed launch activities exceeds, or 
is likely to exceed, the required amount of financial responsibility. 
For each claim, the notice must specify the nature, cause, and amount of 
the claim or lawsuit associated with the claim, and the party or parties 
who may otherwise be liable for payment of the claim;
    (2) Participation or assistance in the defense of the claim or 
lawsuit by the United States, at its election;
    (3) Approval by the Office of any settlement, or part of a 
settlement, to be paid by the United States; and
    (4) Approval by Congress of a compensation plan prepared by the 
Office and submitted by the President.
    (f) The Office will:
    (1) Prepare a compensation plan outlining the total amount of claims 
and meeting the requirements set forth in 49 U.S.C. 70113;
    (2) Recommend sources of funds to pay the claims; and
    (3) Propose legislation as required to implement the plan.
    (g) The Office may withhold payment of a claim if it finds that the 
amount is unreasonable, unless it is the final

[[Page 599]]

than ninety days after a licensee or transferee has requested a 
determination and submitted all information required by the Office to

that are involved in, or whose personnel or property are exposed to risk 
of damage or loss as a result of, licensed reentry activities before

of financial responsibility.
    (b) The licensee must obtain and maintain in effect a policy or 
policies of liability insurance, in an amount determined by the Office 
under paragraph (c) of this section, that protects the following persons 
as additional insureds to the extent of their respective potential 
liabilities against covered claims by a third party for bodily injury or

    (e) The Office shall prescribe for each licensee the amount of 
insurance required to compensate claims for property damage under 
paragraph (d) of this section resulting from licensed reentry activities 
in connection with any particular reentry. The amount of insurance is 
based upon a determination of maximum probable loss; however, it will 
not exceed the lesser of:
    (1) $100 million; or
    (2) The maximum available on the world market at a reasonable cost, 
as determined by the Office.
    (f) In lieu of a policy of insurance, a licensee may demonstrate

conditions applicable to insurance as set forth in this part. The 
licensee must describe in detail the method proposed for demonstrating 
financial responsibility and how it assures that the licensee is able to 
cover claims as required under this part.

<R05>
Sec. 450.11  Duration of coverage; modifications.

    (a) Insurance coverage required under Sec. 450.9, or other form of 
financial responsibility, shall attach upon commencement of licensed 
reentry activities, and remain in full force and effect as follows:
    (1) For ground operations, until completion of licensed reentry 
activities at the reentry site; and
    (2) For other licensed reentry activities, thirty days from 
initiation of reentry flight; however, in the event of an abort that 
results in the reentry vehicle remaining on orbit, insurance shall 
remain in place until the Office's determination that risk to third 
parties and Government property as a result of licensed reentry 
activities is sufficiently small that financial responsibility is no 
longer necessary, as determined by the Office through the risk analysis 
conducted to determine MPL and specified in a license order.
    (b) Financial responsibility required under this part may not be 
replaced, canceled, changed, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce 
the limits of liability or the extent of coverage, nor expire by its own 
terms, prior to the time specified in a license order, unless the Office 
is notified at least 30 days in advance and expressly approves the 
modification.


<R05>
Sec. 450.13  Standard conditions of insurance coverage.

    (a) Insurance obtained under Sec. 450.9 shall comply with the 
following terms and conditions of coverage:

insured, shall not relieve the insurer of any of its obligations under 
any policy.
    (2) Policy limits shall apply separately to each occurrence and, for 
each occurrence to the total of claims arising out of licensed reentry 
activities in connection with any particular reentry.
    (3) Except as provided in this paragraph herein, each policy must

deductible, to the limits of the policy. A licensee may obtain a policy 
containing a deductible amount if the amount of the deductible is placed 
in an escrow account or otherwise demonstrated to be unobligated, 
unencumbered funds of the licensee, available to compensate claims at 
any time claims may arise.
    (4) Each policy shall not be invalidated by any action or inaction 
of the licensee or any additional insured, including nonpayment by the 
licensee of the policy premium, and must insure the licensee and each 
additional insured regardless of any breach or violation of any 
warranties, declarations, or conditions contained in the policies by the 
licensee or any additional insured (other than a breach or violation by 
the licensee or an additional insured, and then only as against that 
licensee or additional insured).
    (5) Exclusions from coverage must be specified.
    (6) Insurance shall be primary without right of contribution from 
any

[[Page 601]]

other insurance that is carried by the licensee or any additional 
insured.
    (7) Each policy must expressly provide that all of its provisions, 
except the policy limits, operate in the same manner as if there were a 
separate policy with and covering the licensee and each additional 
insured.
    (8) Each policy must be placed with an insurer of recognized 
reputation and responsibility that either:
    (i) Is licensed to do business in any State, territory, possession 
of the United States, or the District of Columbia; or
    (ii) Includes in each of its policies of insurance obtained under 
this part a contract clause in which the insurer agrees to submit to the 
jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction within the United 
States and designates an authorized agent within the United States for 
service of legal process on the insurer.
    (9) Except as to claims resulting from the willful misconduct of the 
United States or its agents, the insurer shall waive any and all rights 
of subrogation against each of the parties protected by required 
insurance.
    (b) [Reserved]

contractors and subcontractors and customers, under which each party 
waives and releases claims against the other parties to the waivers and 
agrees to assume financial responsibility for property damage it 
sustains and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own 
employees, and to hold harmless and indemnify each other from bodily 
injury or property damage sustained by its employees, resulting from 
reentry activities, including licensed launch activities associated with 
a particular reentry, regardless of fault.
    (c) For each licensed reentry in which the U.S. Government, its

<R05>
Sec. 450.19  United States payment of excess third-party liability claims.

    (a) The United States pays successful covered claims (including 
reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) of a third party 
against the licensee, the customer, and the contractors and 
subcontractors of the licensee and the customer, and the employees of 
each involved in licensed reentry activities, the licensee, customer and 
the contractors and subcontractors of each involved in licensed launch 
activities associated with a particular reentry, and the contractors and 
subcontractors of the United States and its agencies, and their 
employees, involved in licensed reentry activities and licensed launch 
activities associated with a particular reentry, to the extent provided 
in an appropriation law or other legislative authority providing for 
payment of claims in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 70113, and to the extent 
the total amount of such covered claims arising out of any particular 
reentry:
    (1) Exceeds the amount of insurance required under Sec. 450.9(b); 
and
    (2) Is not more than $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation 
occurring after January 1, 1989) above that amount.
    (b) Payment by the United States under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall not be made for any part of such

[[Page 603]]

claims for which bodily injury or property damage results from willful 
misconduct by the party seeking payment.
    (c) The United States shall provide for payment of claims by third 
parties for bodily injury or property damage that are payable under 49 
U.S.C. 70113 and not covered by required insurance under Sec. 450.9(b), 
without regard to the limitation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
because of an insurance policy exclusion that is usual. A policy 
exclusion is considered usual only if insurance covering the excluded 
risk is not commercially available at reasonable rates. The licensee 
must submit a certification in accordance with Sec. 450.15(c)(1)(iii) 
of this part for the United States to cover the claims.
    (d) Upon the expiration of the policy period prescribed in 
accordance with Sec. 450.11(a), the United States shall provide for 
payment of claims that are payable under 49 U.S.C. 70113 from the first 
dollar of loss up to $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation occurring 
after January 1, 1989).
    (e) Payment by the United States of excess third-party claims under 
49 U.S.C. 70113 shall be subject to:
    (1) Prompt notice by the licensee to the Office that the total 
amount of claims arising out of licensed reentry activities exceeds, or 
is likely to exceed, the required amount of financial responsibility. 
For each claim, the notice must specify the nature, cause, and amount of 
the claim or lawsuit associated with the claim, and the party or parties 
who may otherwise be liable for payment of the claim;
    (2) Participation or assistance in the defense of the claim or 
lawsuit by the United States, at its election;
    (3) Approval by the Office of any settlement, or part of a 
settlement, to be paid by the United States; and
    (4) Approval by Congress of a compensation plan prepared by the 
Office and submitted by the President.
    (f) The Office will:
    (1) Prepare a compensation plan outlining the total amount of claims 
and meeting the requirements set forth in 49 U.S.C. 70113;
    (2) Recommend sources of funds to pay the claims; and
    (3) Propose legislation as required to implement the plan.
    (g) The Office may withhold payment of a claim if it finds that the 
amount is unreasonable, unless it is the final order of a court that has 
jurisdiction over the matter.

Appendix A to Part 450--Information Requirements for Obtaining a Maximum 
       Probable Loss Determination for Licensed Reentry Activities
