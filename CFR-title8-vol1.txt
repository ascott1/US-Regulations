                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1999), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Members, retired Immigration Judges, and Administrative Law Judges 
employed within EOIR to act as temporary, additional Board Members for 
terms not to exceed six months. The Chairman may divide the Board into 
three-member panels and designate a Presiding Member of each panel. The 
Chairman may

[[Page 12]]

from time to time make changes in the composition of such panels and of 
Presiding Members. Each panel shall be empowered to decide cases by 
majority vote. A majority of the number of Board Members authorized to 
constitute a panel shall constitute a quorum for such panel. Each three-
member panel may exercise the appropriate authority of the Board as set 
out in part 3 that is necessary for the adjudication of cases before it. 
In the case of an unopposed motion or a motion to withdraw an appeal 
pending before the Board, a single Board Member or the Chief Attorney 
Examiner may exercise the appropriate authority of the Board as set out 
in part 3 that is necessary for the adjudication of such motions before 
it.
    (2) Chairman. The Chairman shall direct, supervise, and establish 
internal operating procedures and policies of the Board. He shall 
designate a member of the Board to act as Chairman in his absence or 
unavailability. The Chairman shall be assisted in the performance of his 
duties by a Chief Attorney Examiner, who shall be directly responsible 
to the Chairman. The Chief Attorney Examiner shall serve as an Alternate 
Board Member when, in the absence or unavailability of a Board Member or 
Members or for other good cause, his participation is deemed necessary 
by the Chairman. Once designated, his participation in a case shall 
continue to its normal conclusion.
    (3) Board Members. Board Members shall perform the quasi-judicial 
function of adjudicating cases coming before the Board.
    (4) En banc process--(i) Full Board en banc. A majority of the 
permanent Board Members shall constitute a quorum of the Board for 
purposes of convening the full Board en banc. The Board may on its own 
motion, by a majority vote of the permanent Board Members, or by 
direction of the Chairman, consider any case as the full Board en banc, 
or reconsider as the full Board en banc any case that has been 
considered or decided by a three-member panel or by a limited en banc 
panel.
    (ii) Limited en banc panels. The Board may on its own motion, by a 
majority vote of the permanent Board Members, or by direction of the 
Chairman, assign a case or group of cases for consideration by a limited 
en banc panel, or assign a case that has been considered or decided by a 
three-member panel for reconsideration by a limited en banc panel. Each 
limited en banc panel shall consist of nine members. Each limited en 
banc panel shall contain the Chairman or Vice Chairman (as decided by 
the Chairman). If the Chairman and Vice Chairman are both disqualified 
in a particular case, then the most senior permanent Board Member who is 
not disqualified shall sit on the limited en banc panel as the Presiding 
Board Member. If the Chairman and Vice Chairman are both unavailable to 
hear a case that has been assigned to a limited en banc panel, but the 
Chairman is not disqualified, then the Chairman shall designate a 
Presiding Board Member to sit on the limited en banc panel. If the 
Chairman is unavailable and disqualified, then the Vice Chairman, if 
unavailable and not disqualified, shall designate a presiding Board 
Member to sit on the limited en banc panel. Where a case that has been 
considered or decided by a three-member panel is assigned for review by 
a limited en banc panel, the en banc panel shall contain all available 
permanent Board Members who considered or decided that case as part of a 
three-member panel. The remaining members of each limited en banc panel 
will be randomly selected from among the permanent Board Members. The 
decision reached by a limited en banc panel shall be considered as the 
final decision of the Board in the case, unless the Chairman or a 
majority of the permanent Board Members vote to decide to assign the 
case to a full en banc panel for reconsideration in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
    (5) Precedents. By majority vote of the permanent Board Members, a 
decision of the Board, whether rendered by a three-member panel, a 
limited en banc panel, or by the entire Board sitting en banc, may be 
designated to serve as a Board precedent pursuant to paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (6) Board staff. There shall also be attached to the Board such 
number of attorneys and other employees as the

[[Page 13]]

Deputy Attorney General, upon recommendation of the Director, shall from 
time to time direct.
    (b) Appellate jurisdiction. Appeals shall lie to the Board of 
Immigration Appeals from the following:

in 8 CFR part 240, subpart D.
    (2) Decisions of Immigration Judges in deportation cases, as 
provided in 8 CFR part 240, subpart E, except that no appeal shall lie

to April 1, 1997.
    (3) Decisions of Immigration Judges in removal proceedings, as 
provided in 8 CFR part 240, except that no appeal shall lie seeking

chapter.
    (4) Decisions involving administrative fines and penalties, 
including mitigation thereof, as provided in part 280 of this chapter.

behalf of a child described in section 101(b)(1)(F) of the act), and 
decisions on requests for revalidation and decisions revoking the 
approval of such petitions, in accordance with section 205 of the act, 
as provided in parts 204 and 205, respectively, of this chapter.
    (6) Decisions on applications for the exercise of the discretionary 
authority contained in section 212(d)(3) of the act as provided in part 
212 of this chapter.
    (7) Determinations relating to bond, parole, or detention of an 
alien as provided in 8 CFR part 236, subpart A.

of status referred on a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) to the 
Immigration Judge in accordance with Sec. 245.13(n)(2) of this chapter 
or remanded to the Immigration Court in accordance with 
Sec. 245.13(d)(2) of this chapter.
    (c) Jurisdiction by certification. The Commissioner, or any other 
duly authorized officer of the Service, any Immigration Judge, or the 
Board may in any case arising under paragraph (b) of this section 
certify such case to the Board. The Board in its discretion may review 
any such case by certification without regard to the provisions of 
Sec. 3.7 if it determines that the parties have already been given a 
fair opportunity to make representations before the Board regarding the 
case, including the opportunity request oral argument and to submit a 
brief.
    (d) Powers of the Board--(1) Generally. Subject to any specific 
limitation prescribed by this chapter, in considering and determining 
cases before it as provided in this part the Board shall exercise such 
discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney General by law as 
is appropriate and necessary for the disposition of the case.
    (1-a) Summary dismissal of appeals. (i) Standards. The Board may 
summarily dismiss any appeal or portion of any appeal in any case in 
which:
    (A) The party concerned fails to specify the reasons for the appeal 
on Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29 (Notices of Appeal) or other document 
filed therewith;
    (B) The only reason for the appeal specified by the party concerned 
involves a finding of fact or a conclusion of law that was conceded by 
that party at a prior proceeding;
    (C) The appeal is from an order that granted the party concerned the 
relief that had been requested;
    (D) The Board is satisfied, from a review of the record, that the 
appeal is filed for an improper purpose, such as to cause unnecessary 
delay, or that the

[[Page 14]]

appeal lacks an arguable basis in law or fact unless the Board 
determines that it is supported by a good faith argument for extension, 
modification or reversal of existing law.
    (E) The party concerned indicates on Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29 
that he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal 
and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably 
explain his or her failure to do so, within the time set for filing; or
    (F) The appeal fails to meet essential statutory or regulatory 
requirements or is expressly excluded by statute or regulation.
    (ii) Disciplinary consequences. The filing by an attorney or 
representative accredited under Sec. 292.2(d) of this chapter of an 
appeal which is summarily dismissed under paragraph (d)(1-a)(i) of this 
section may constitute frivolous behavior under Sec. 292.3(a)(15) of 
this chapter. Summary dismissal of an appeal under paragraph (d)(1-a)(i) 
of this section does not limit the other grounds and procedures for 
disciplinary action against attorneys or representatives.
    (2) Finality of decision. The decision of the Board shall be final 
except in those cases reviewed by the Attorney General in accordance 
with paragraph (h) of this section. The Board may return a case to the 
Service or Immigration Judge for such further action as may be 
appropriate, without entering a final decision on the merits of the 
case.
    (3) Rules of practices: Discipline of attorneys and representatives. 
The Board shall have authority, with the approval of the Director, EOIR, 
to prescribe rules governing proceedings before it. It shall also 
determine whether any organization desiring representation is of a kind 
described in Sec. 1.1(j) of this chapter, and shall regulate the conduct 
of attorneys, representatives of organizations, and others who appear in 
a representative capacity before the Board or the Service or any special 
Inquiry Officer.
    (e) Oral argument. When an appeal has been taken, request for oral 
argument if desired shall be included in the Notice of Appeal. Oral 
argument shall be heard at the discretion of the Board at such date and 
time as the Board shall fix. The Service may be represented before the 
Board by an officer of the Service designated by the Service.
    (f) Service of Board decisions. The decision of the Board shall be 
in writing and copies thereof shall be transmitted by the Board to the 
Service and a copy shall be served upon the alien or party affected as 
provided in part 292 of this chapter.
    (g) Decisions of the Board as precedents. Except as they may be 
modified or overruled by the Board or the Attorney General, decisions of 
the Board shall be binding on all officers and employees of the Service 
or Immigration Judges in the administration of the Act, and selected 
decisions designated by the Board shall serve as precedents in all 
proceedings involving the same issue or issues.
    (h) Referral of cases to the Attorney General. (1) The Board shall 
refer to the Attorney General for review of its decision all cases 
which:
    (i) The Attorney General directs the Board to refer to him.
    (ii) The Chairman or a majority of the Board believes should be 
referred to the Attorney General for review.
    (iii) The Commissioner requests be referred to the Attorney General 
for review.
    (2) In any case in which the Attorney General reviews the decision 
of the Board, the decision of the Attorney General shall be stated in 
writing and shall be transmitted to the Board for transmittal and 
service as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

Sec. 3.2  Reopening or reconsideration before the Board of Immigration Appeals.

    (a) General. The Board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its 
own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision. A request to 
reopen or reconsider any case in which a decision has been made by the 
Board, which request is made by the Service, or by the party affected by 
the decision, must be in the form of a written motion to the Board. The 
decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the 
discretion of the Board, subject to the restrictions of this section. 
The Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party 
moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.
    (b) Motion to reconsider. (1) A motion to reconsider shall state the 
reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the 
prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority. A 
motion to reconsider a decision rendered by an Immigration Judge or 
Service officer that is pending when an appeal is filed with the Board, 
or that is filed subsequent to the filing with the Board of an appeal 
from the decision sought to be reconsidered, may be deemed a motion to 
remand the decision for further proceedings before the Immigration Judge 
or the Service officer from whose decision the appeal was taken. Such 
motion may be consolidated with, and considered by the Board in 
connection with the appeal to the Board.
    (2) A motion to reconsider a decision must be filed with the Board 
within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision or on or before 
July 31, 1996, whichever is later. A party may file only one motion to 
reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a 
decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. In removal proceedings 
pursuant to section 240 of the Act, an alien may file only one motion to 
reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the United 
States.
    (c) Motion to reopen. (1) A motion to reopen proceedings shall state 
the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion 
is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary 
material. A motion to reopen proceedings for the purpose of submitting 
an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate 
application for relief and all supporting documentation. A motion to 
reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board 
that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and 
could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing; nor 
shall any motion to reopen for the purpose of affording the alien an 
opportunity to apply for any form of discretionary relief be granted if 
it appears that the alien's right to apply for such relief was fully 
explained to him or her and an opportunity to apply therefore was 
afforded at the former hearing, unless the relief is sought on the basis 
of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing. Subject to 
the other requirements and restrictions of this section, and 
notwithstanding the provisions in Sec. 1.1(p) of this chapter, a motion 
to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an 
application for relief under section 212(c) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 
1182(c)) may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was 
statutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the 
administratively final order of deportation.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a party 
may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings 
(whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must 
be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final 
administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be 
reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an alien may file only 
one motion to reopen removal proceedings (whether before the Board or 
the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 
days after the date on which the final administrative decision was 
rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.
    (3) In removal proceedings pursuant to section 240 of the Act, the 
time limitation set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not 
apply to a motion

[[Page 16]]

to reopen filed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 3.23(b)(4)(ii). The 
time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section shall not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings:
    (i) Filed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(1) 
or Sec. 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A)(2);
    (ii) To apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation 
based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or 
in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence 
is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or 
presented at the previous hearing;
    (iii) Agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed. Notwithstanding 
such agreement, the parties may contest the issues in a reopened 
proceeding; or
    (iv) Filed by the Service in exclusion or deportation proceedings 
when the basis of the motion is fraud in the original proceeding or a 
crime that would support termination of asylum in accordance with 
Sec. 208.22(f) of this chapter.
    (4) A motion to reopen a decision rendered by an Immigration Judge 
or Service officer that is pending when an appeal is filed, or that is 
filed while an appeal is pending before the Board, may be deemed a 
motion to remand for further proceedings before the Immigration Judge or 
the Service officer from whose decision the appeal was taken. Such 
motion may be consolidated with, and considered by the Board in 
connection with, the appeal to the Board.
    (d) Departure, deportation, or removal. A motion to reopen or a 
motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who 
is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings 
subsequent to his or her departure from the United States. Any departure 
from the United States, including the deportation or removal of a person 
who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, 
occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to 
reconsider, shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
    (e) Judicial proceedings. Motions to reopen or reconsider shall 
state whether the validity of the exclusion, deportation, or removal 
order has been or is the subject of any judicial proceeding and, if so, 
the nature and date thereof, the court in which such proceeding took 
place or is pending, and its result or status. In any case in which an 
exclusion, deportation, or removal order is in effect, any motion to 
reopen or reconsider such order shall include a statement by or on 
behalf of the moving party declaring whether the subject of the order is 
also the subject of any pending criminal proceeding under the Act, and, 
if so, the current status of that proceeding. If a motion to reopen or 
reconsider seeks discretionary relief, the motion shall include a 
statement by or on behalf of the moving party declaring whether the 
alien for whose relief the motion is being filed is subject to any 
pending criminal prosecution and, if so, the nature and current status 
of that prosecution.
    (f) Stay of deportation. Except where a motion is filed pursuant to 
the provisions of Secs. 3.23(b)(4)(ii) and 3.23(b)(4)(iii)(A), the 
filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay 
the execution of any decision made in the case. Execution of such 
decision shall proceed unless a stay of execution is specifically 
granted by the Board, the Immigration Judge, or an authorized officer of 
the Service.
    (g) Filing procedures--(1) English language, entry of appearance, 
and proof of service requirements. A motion and any submission made in 
conjunction with a motion must be in English or accompanied by a 
certified English translation. If the moving party, other than the 
Service, is represented, Form EOIR-27, Notice of Entry of Appearance as 
Attorney or Representative Before the Board, must be filed with the 
motion. In all cases, the motion shall include proof of service on the 
opposing party of the motion and all attachments. If the moving party is 
not the Service, service of the motion shall be made upon the Office of 
the District Counsel for the district in which the case was completed 
before the Immigration Judge.
    (2) Distribution of motion papers. (i) A motion to reopen or motion 
to reconsider a decision of the Board pertaining

[[Page 17]]

to proceedings before an Immigration Judge shall be filed directly with 
the Board. Such motion must be accompanied by a check, money order, or 
fee waiver request in satisfaction of the fee requirements of Sec. 3.8. 
The record of proceeding pertaining to such a motion shall be forwarded 
to the Board upon the request or order of the Board.
    (ii) A motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider a decision of the 
Board pertaining to a matter initially adjudicated by an officer of the 
Service shall be filed with the officer of the Service having 
administrative control over the record of proceeding.
    (iii) If the motion is made by the Service in proceedings in which 
the Service has administrative control over the record of proceedings, 
the record of proceedings in the case and the motion shall be filed 
directly with the Board. If such motion is filed directly with an office 
of the Service, the entire record of proceeding shall be forwarded to 
the Board by the Service officer promptly upon receipt of the briefs of 
the parties, or upon expiration of the time allowed for the submission 
of such briefs.
    (3) Briefs and response. The moving party may file a brief if it is 
included with the motion. If the motion is filed directly with the Board 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the opposing party 
shall have 13 days from the date of service of the motion to file a 
brief in opposition to the motion directly with the Board. If the motion 
is filed with an office of the Service pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(ii) 
of this section, the opposing party shall have 13 days from the date of 
filing of the motion to file a brief in opposition to the motion 
directly with the office of the Service. In all cases, briefs and any 
other filings made in conjunction with a motion shall include proof of 
service on the opposing party. The Board, in its discretion, may extend 
the time within which such brief is to be submitted and may authorize 
the filing of a brief directly with the Board. A motion shall be deemed 
unopposed unless a timely response is made. The Board may, in its 
discretion, consider a brief filed out of time.
    (h) Oral argument. A request for oral argument, if desired, shall be 
incorporated in the motion to reopen or reconsider. The Board, in its 
discretion, may grant or deny requests for oral argument.
    (i) Ruling on motion. Rulings upon motions to reopen or motions to 
reconsider shall be by written order. If the order directs a reopening 
and further proceedings are necessary, the record shall be returned to 
the Immigration Court or the officer of the Service having 
administrative control over the place where the reopened proceedings are 
to be conducted. If the motion to reconsider is granted, the decision 
upon such reconsideration shall affirm, modify, or reverse the original 
decision made in the case.

Sec. 3.3  Notice of appeal.

    (a) Filing--(1) Appeal from decision of an Immigration Judge. A 
party affected by a decision who is entitled under this chapter to 
appeal to the Board from a decision of an Immigration Judge shall be 
given notice of his or her right to appeal. An appeal from a decision of 
an Immigration Judge shall be taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the 
Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form 
EOIR-26) directly with the Board, within the time specified in the 
governing sections of this chapter. The appealing parties are only those 
parties who are covered by the decision of an Immigration Judge and who 
are specifically named on the Notice of Appeal. The appeal must be 
accompanied by a check, money order, or fee waiver request in 
satisfaction of the fee requirements of Sec. 3.8. If the respondent/
applicant is represented, a Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or 
Representative Before the Board (Form EOIR-27) must be filed with the 
Notice of Appeal. The appeal must reflect proof of service of a copy of 
the appeal and all attachments on the opposing party. The appeal and all 
attachments must be in English or accompanied by a certified English 
translation. An appeal is not properly filed unless it is received at 
the Board, along with all required documents, fees or fee waiver 
requests, and proof of service,

[[Page 18]]

within the time specified in the governing sections of this chapter. A 
notice of appeal may not be filed by any party who has waived appeal 
pursuant to Sec. 3.39.
    (2) Appeal from decision of a Service officer. A party affected by a 
decision who is entitled under this chapter to appeal to the Board from 
a decision of a Service officer shall be given notice of his or her 
right to appeal. An appeal from a decision of a Service officer shall be 
taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals 
of Decision of District Director (Form EOIR-29) directly with the office 
of the Service having administrative control over the record of 
proceeding within the time specified in the governing sections of this 
chapter. The appeal must be accompanied by a check, money order, or fee 
waiver request in satisfaction of the fee requirements of Sec. 3.8 and, 
if the appellant is represented, a Notice of Entry of Appearance as 
Attorney or Representative Before the Board (Form EOIR-27). The appeal 
and all attachments must be in English or accompanied by a certified 
English translation. An appeal is not properly filed until its receipt 
at the appropriate office of the Service, together with all required 
documents and fees, and the fee provisions of Sec. 3.8 are satisfied.
    (b) Statement of the basis of appeal. The party taking the appeal 
must identify the reasons for the appeal in the Notice of Appeal (Form 
EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29) or in any attachments thereto, in order to 
avoid summary dismissal pursuant to Sec. 3.1(d)(1-a)(i). The statement 
must specifically identify the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, 
or both, that are being challenged. If a question of law is presented, 
supporting authority must be cited. If the dispute is over the findings 
of fact, the specific facts contested must be identified. Where the 
appeal concerns discretionary relief, the appellant must state whether 
the alleged error relates to statutory grounds of eligibility or to the 
exercise of discretion and must identify the specific factual and legal 
finding or findings that are being challenged. The appellant must also 
indicate in the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29) whether 
he or she desires oral argument before the Board and whether he or she 
will be filing a separate written brief or statement in support of the 
appeal.
    (c) Briefs--(1) Appeal from decision of an Immigration Judge. Briefs 
in support of or in opposition to an appeal from a decision of an 
Immigration Judge shall be filed directly with the Board. In those cases 
that are transcribed, the briefing schedule shall be set by the Board 
after the transcript is available. An appellant shall be provided 30 
days in which to file a brief, unless a shorter period is specified by 
the Board. The appellee shall have the same period of time in which to 
file a reply brief that was initially granted to the appellant to file 
his or her brief. The time to file a reply brief commences from the date 
upon which the appellant's brief was due, as originally set or extended 
by the Board. The Board, upon written motion, may extend the period for 
filing a brief or a reply brief for up to 90 days for good cause shown. 
In its discretion, the Board may consider a brief that has been filed 
out of time. All briefs, filings, and motions filed in conjunction with 
an appeal shall include proof of service on the opposing party.
    (2) Appeal from decision of a Service officer. Briefs in support of 
or in opposition to an appeal from a decision of a Service officer shall 
be filed directly with the office of the Service having administrative 
control over the file in accordance with a briefing schedule set by that 
office. The alien shall be provided 30 days in which to file a brief, 
unless a shorter period is specified by the Service officer from whose 
decision the appeal is taken. The Service shall have the same period of 
time in which to file a reply brief that was initially granted to the 
alien to file his or her brief. The time to file a reply brief commences 
from the date upon which the alien's brief was due, as originally set or 
extended. Upon written request of the alien, the Service officer from 
whose decision the appeal is taken or the Board may extend the period 
for filing a brief for good cause shown. The Board may authorize the 
filing of briefs directly with the Board. In its discretion, the Board 
may consider a brief that has been filed out of time. All briefs and 
other documents filed in

[[Page 19]]

conjunction with an appeal, unless filed by an alien directly with a 
Service office, shall include proof of service on the opposing party.
    (d) Effect of certification. The certification of a case, as 
provided in this part, shall not relieve the party affected from 
compliance with the provisions of this section in the event that he or 
she is entitled and desires to appeal from an initial decision, nor 
shall it serve to extend the time specified in the applicable parts of 
this chapter for the taking of an appeal.
    (e) Effect of departure from the United States. Departure from the 
United States of a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings, 
prior to the taking of an appeal from a decision in his or her case, 
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to appeal.

Sec. 3.4  Withdrawal of appeal.

    In any case in which an appeal has been taken, the party taking the 
appeal may file a written withdrawal thereof with the office at which 
the notice of appeal was filed. If the record in the case has not been 
forwarded to the Board on appeal in accordance with Sec. 3.5, the 
decision made in the case shall be final to the same extent as if no 
appeal had been taken. If the record has been forwarded on appeal, the 
withdrawal of the appeal shall be forwarded to the Board and, if no 
decision in the case has been made on the appeal, the record shall be 
returned and the initial decision shall be final to the same extent as 
if no appeal had been taken. If a decision on the appeal has been made 
by the Board in the case, further action shall be taken in accordance 
therewith. Departure from the United States of a person who is the 
subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to the taking of an 
appeal, but prior to a decision thereon, shall constitute a withdrawal 
of the appeal, and the initial decision in the case shall be final to 
the same extent as though no appeal had been taken. Departure from the 
United States of a person who is the subject of deportation or removal 
proceedings, except for arriving aliens as defined in Sec. 1.1(q) of 
this chapter, subsequent to the taking of an appeal, but prior to a 
decision thereon, shall constitute a withdrawal of the appeal, and the 
initial decision in the case shall be final to the same extent as though 
no appeal had been taken.

Sec. 3.5  Forwarding of record on appeal.

    (a) Appeal from decision of an Immigration Judge. If an appeal is 
taken from a decision of an Immigration Judge, the record of proceeding 
shall be forwarded to the Board upon the request or the order of the 
Board.
    (b) Appeal from decision of a Service officer. If an appeal is taken 
from a decision of a Service officer, the record of proceeding shall be 
forwarded to the Board by the Service officer promptly upon receipt of 
the briefs of the parties, or upon expiration of the time allowed for 
the submission of such briefs. A Service officer need not forward such 
an appeal to the Board, but may reopen and reconsider any decision made 
by the officer if the new decision will grant the benefit that has been 
requested in the appeal. The new decision must be served on the 
appealing party within 45 days of receipt of any briefs or upon 
expiration of the time allowed for the submission of any briefs. If the 
new decision is not served within these time limits or the appealing 
party does not agree that the new decision disposes of the matter, the 
record of proceeding shall be immediately forwarded to the Board.

Sec. 3.6  Stay of execution of decision.

    (a) Except as provided under Sec. 236.1 of this chapter, 
Sec. 3.19(i), and paragraph (b) of this section, the decision in any 
proceeding under this chapter from which an appeal to the Board may be 
taken shall not be executed during the time allowed for the filing of an 
appeal unless a waiver of the right to appeal is filed, nor shall such 
decision be executed while an appeal is pending or while a case is 
before the Board by way of certification.
    (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply 
to an order of an Immigration Judge under Sec. 3.23 or Sec. 242.22 of 
this chapter denying a motion to reopen or reconsider or to stay

[[Page 20]]

deportation, except where such order expressly grants a stay or where 
the motion was filed pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 3.23(b)(4)(iii). 
The Board may, in its discretion, stay deportation while an appeal is 
pending from any such order if no stay has been granted by the 
Immigration Judge or a Service officer.

Sec. 3.7  Notice of certification.

    Whenever, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3.1(c), a case 
is certified to the Board, the alien or other party affected shall be 
given notice of certification. An Immigration Judge or Service officer 
may certify a case only after an initial decision has been made and 
before an appeal has been taken. If it is known at the time the initial 
decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the notice of 
certification shall be included in such decision and no further notice 
of certification shall be required. If it is not known until after the 
initial decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the office 
of the Service or the Immigration Court having administrative control 
over the record of proceeding shall cause a Notice of Certification to 
be served upon the parties. In either case, the notice shall inform the 
parties that the case is required to be certified to the Board and that 
they have the right to make representations before the Board, including 
the making of a request for oral argument and the submission of a brief. 
If either party desires to submit a brief, it shall be submitted to the 
office of the Service or the Immigration Court having administrative 
control over the record of proceeding for transmittal to the Board 
within the time prescribed in Sec. 3.3(c). The case shall be certified 
and forwarded to the Board by the office of the Service or Immigration 
Court having administrative jurisdiction over the case upon receipt of 
the brief, or upon the expiration of the time within which the brief may 
be submitted, or upon receipt of a written waiver of the right to submit 
a brief. The Board in its discretion may elect to accept for review or 
not accept for review any such certified case. If the Board declines to 
accept a certified case for review, the underlying decision shall become 
final on the date the Board declined to accept the case.

such a case filed under this part by any person other than an officer of 
the Service, filed directly with the Service shall be accompanied by the 
appropriate fee specified, and remitted in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 103.7 of this chapter.
    (c) Waiver of fees. The Board may, in its discretion, authorize the 
prosecution of any appeal or any motion over which the Board has 
jurisdiction without payment of the required fee. In any case in which 
an alien or other party affected is unable to pay the fee fixed for an 
appeal or motion, he or she shall file with the Notice of Appeal (Form 
EOIR-26 or Form EOIR-29) or motion, an Appeal Fee Waiver Request, (Form

[[Page 21]]

the Service.
    (e) After an initial bond redetermination, a request for a

    (D) Aliens subject to section 303(b)(3)(A) of Pub. L. 104-208 who 
are not ``lawfully admitted'' (as defined in Sec. 236.1(c)(2) of this 
chapter); or
    (E) Aliens designated in Sec. 236.1(c) of this chapter as ineligible 
to be considered for release.
    (ii) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting an 
alien from seeking a redetermination of custody conditions by the 
Service in accordance with part 235 or 236 of this chapter. In addition, 
with respect to paragraphs (h)(1)(i)(C), (D), and (E) of this section, 
nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting an alien 
from seeking a determination by an immigration judge that the alien is 
not properly included within any of those paragraphs.
    (2)(i) Upon expiration of the Transition Period Custody Rules set 
forth in section 303(b)(3) of Div. C. of Pub. L. 104-208, an immigration 
judge may not redetermine conditions of custody imposed by the Service 
with respect to the following classes of aliens:
    (A) Aliens in exclusion proceedings;
    (B) Arriving aliens in removal proceedings, including aliens paroled 
after arrival pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act;
    (C) Aliens described in section 237(a)(4) of the Act;
    (D) Aliens in removal proceedings subject to section 236(c)(1) of 
the Act (as in effect after expiration of the Transition Period Custody

of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, and as amended by 
section 440(c) of Pub. L. 104-132).
    (ii) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting an 
alien from seeking a redetermination of custody conditions by the 
Service in accordance with part 235 or 236 of this chapter. In addition, 
with respect to paragraphs (h)(2)(i)(C), (D), and (E) of this section, 
nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting an alien 
from seeking a determination by an immigration judge that the alien is 
not properly included within any of those paragraphs.
    (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section, an alien subject to section 303(b)(3)(A) of Div. C of Pub. L. 
104-208 may apply to the Immigration Court, in a manner consistent with 
paragraphs (c)(1)

[[Page 25]]

through (c)(3) of this section, for a redetermination of custody 
conditions set by the Service. Such an alien must first demonstrate, by 
clear and convincing evidence, that release would not pose a danger to 
other persons or to property. If an alien meets this burden, the alien 
must further demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the 
alien is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding or interview.
    (4) Unremovable aliens. A determination of a district director (or 
other official designated by the Commissioner) regarding the exercise of 
authority under section 303(b)(3)(B)(ii) of Div. C. of Pub. L. 104-208 
(concerning release of aliens who cannot be removed because the 
designated country of removal will not accept their return) is final, 
and shall not be subject to redetermination by an immigration judge.
    (i) Stay of custody order pending Service appeal--(1) General 
emergency stay authority. The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) has 
the authority to stay the order of an immigration judge redetermining 
the conditions of custody of an alien when the Service appeals the 
custody decision. The Service is entitled to seek an emergency stay for 
the Board in connection with such an appeal at any time.
    (2) Automatic stay in certain cases. If an alien is subject to 
section 242(a)(2) of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, and 
as amended by section 440(c) of Pub. L. 104-132), section 303(b)(3)(A) 
of Div. C of Pub. L. 104-208, or section 236(c)(1) of the Act (as 
designated on April 1, 1997), and the district director has denied the 
alien's request for release or has set a bond of $10,000 or more, any 
order of the immigration judge authorizing release (on bond or 
otherwise) shall be stayed upon the Service's filing of a Notice of 
Service Intent to Appeal Custody Redetermination (Form EOIR-43) with the 
Immigration Court on the day the order is issued, and shall remain in 
abeyance pending decision of the appeal by the Board of Immigration 
Appeals. The stay shall lapse upon failure of the Service to file a 
timely notice of appeal in accordance with Sec. 3.38.

upon motion by one of the parties, after the charging document has been 
filed with the Immigration Court. The Immigration Judge may grant a 
change of venue only after the other party has been given notice and an 
opportunity to respond to the motion to change venue.
    (c) No change of venue shall be granted without identification of a 
fixed street address, including city, state and ZIP code, where the 
respondent/applicant may be reached for further hearing notification.

Sec. 3.21  Pre-hearing conferences and statement.

    (a) Pre-hearing conferences may be scheduled at the discretion of 
the Immigration Judge. The conference may be held to narrow issues, to 
obtain stipulations between the parties, to exchange information 
voluntarily, and otherwise to simplify and organize the proceeding.
    (b) The Immigration Judge may order any party to file a pre-hearing 
statement of position that may include, but is not limited to: A 
statement of facts to which both parties have stipulated, together with 
a statement that the parties have communicated in good faith to 
stipulate to the fullest extent possible; a list of proposed witnesses 
and what they will establish; a list of exhibits, copies of exhibits to 
be introduced, and a statement of the reason for their introduction; the 
estimated time required to present the case; and, a statement of 
unresolved issues involved in the proceedings.

    (c) If submission of a pre-hearing statement is ordered under 
paragraph (b) of this section, an Immigration Judge also may require 
both parties, in writing prior to the hearing, to make any evidentiary 
objections regarding matters contained in the pre-hearing statement. If 
objections in writing are required but not received by the date for 
receipt set by the Immigration Judge, admission of all evidence 
described in the pre-hearing statement shall be deemed unopposed.

<R05>
Sec. 3.23  Reopening or reconsideration before the Immigration Court.

    (a) Pre-decision motions. Unless otherwise permitted by the 
Immigration Judge, motions submitted prior to the final order of an 
Immigration Judge shall be in writing and shall state, with 
particularity the grounds therefore, the relief sought, and the 
jurisdiction. The Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for 
the making of motions and replies thereto. A motion shall be deemed 
unopposed unless timely response is made.
    (b) Before the Immigration Court--(1) In general. An Immigration 
Judge may upon his or her own motion at any time, or upon motion of the 
Service or the alien, reopen or reconsider any case in which he or she 
has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is vested with the Board of 
Immigration Appeals. Subject to the exceptions in this paragraph and 
paragraph (b)(4), a party may file only one motion to reconsider and one 
motion to reopen proceedings. A motion to reconsider must be filed 
within 30 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of 
removal, deportation, or exclusion, or on or before July 31, 1996, 
whichever is later. A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of 
the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal, 
deportation, or exclusion, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever 
is later. A motion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on 
behalf of a person who is the subject of removal, deportation, or 
exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United 
States. Any departure from the United States, including the deportation 
or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or 
removal proceedings, occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or 
a motion to reconsider shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion. The 
time and numerical limitations set forth in this paragraph do not apply 
to motions by the Service in removal proceedings pursuant to section 240 
of the Act. Nor shall such limitations apply to motions by the Service 
in exclusion or deportation proceedings, when the basis of the motion is 
fraud in the original proceeding or a crime that would support 
termination of asylum in accordance with Sec. 208.22(e) of this chapter.
    (i) Form and contents of the motion. The motion shall be in writing 
and signed by the affected party or the attorney or representative of 
record, if any. The motion and any submission made in conjunction with 
it must be in English or accompanied by a certified English translation. 
Motions to reopen or reconsider shall state whether the validity of the 
exclusion, deportation, or removal order has been or is the subject of 
any judicial proceeding and, if so, the nature and date thereof, the 
court in which such proceeding took place or is pending, and its result 
or status. In any case in which an exclusion, deportation, or removal 
order is in effect, any motion to reopen or reconsider such order shall 
include a statement by or on behalf of the moving party declaring 
whether the subject of the order is also the subject of any pending 
criminal proceeding under the Act, and, if so, the current status of 
that proceeding.
    (ii) Filing. Motions to reopen or reconsider a decision of an 
Immigration Judge must be filed with the Immigration Court having 
administrative control over the Record of Proceeding. A

[[Page 27]]

motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall include a certificate 
showing service on the opposing party of the motion and all attachments. 
If the moving party is not the Service, service of the motion shall be 
made upon the Office of the District Counsel for the district in which 
the case was completed. If the moving party, other than the Service, is 
represented, a Form EOIR-28, Notice of Appearance as Attorney or 
Representative Before an Immigration Judge must be filed with the 
motion. The motion must be filed in duplicate with the Immigration 
Court, accompanied by a fee receipt.
    (iii) Assignment to an Immigration Judge. If the Immigration Judge 
is unavailable or unable to adjudicate the motion to reopen or 
reconsider, the Chief Immigration Judge or his or her delegate shall 
reassign such motion to another Immigration Judge.
    (iv) Replies to motions; decision. The Immigration Judge may set and 
extend time limits for replies to motions to reopen or reconsider. A 
motion shall be deemed unopposed unless timely response is made. The 
decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider 
is within the discretion of the Immigration Judge.
    (v) Stays. Except in cases involving in absentia orders, the filing 
of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay the 
execution of any decision made in the case. Execution of such decision 
shall proceed unless a stay of execution is specifically granted by the 
Immigration Judge, the Board, or an authorized officer of the Service.
    (2) Motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider shall state the 
reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the 
Immigration Judge's prior decision and shall be supported by pertinent 
authority. Such motion may not seek reconsideration of a decision 
denying previous motion to reconsider.
    (3) Motion to reopen. A motion to reopen proceedings shall state the 
new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is 
granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary 
material. Any motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an 
application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate 
application for relief and all supporting documents. A motion to reopen 
will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that 
evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and 
could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing. A 
motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity 
to apply for any form of discretionary relief will not be granted if it 
appears that the alien's right to apply for such relief was fully 
explained to him or her by the Immigration Judge and an opportunity to 
apply therefore was afforded at the hearing, unless the relief is sought 
on the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the 
hearing. Pursuant to section 240A(d)(1) of the Act, a motion to reopen 
proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application 
for relief under section 240A(a) (cancellation of removal for certain 
permanent residents) or 240A(b) (cancellation of removal and adjustment 
of status for certain nonpermanent residents) may be granted only if the 
alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such 
relief prior to the service of a notice to appear, or prior to the 
commission of an offense referred to in section 212(a)(2) of the Act 
that renders the alien inadmissible or removable under sections 
237(a)(2) of the Act or (a)(4), whichever is earliest. The Immigration 
Judge has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party 
has established a prima facie case for relief.
    (4) Exceptions to filing deadlines--(i) Asylum. The time and 
numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
shall not apply if the basis of the motion is to apply for relief under 
section 208 or 241(b)(3) of the Act and is based on changed country 
conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which 
removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not 
available and could not have been discovered or presented at the 
previous proceeding. The filing of a motion to reopen under this section 
shall not automatically stay the removal of the alien. However, the 
alien may request a stay and, if granted by the Immigration Judge, the 
alien

[[Page 28]]

shall not be removed pending disposition of the motion by the 
Immigration Judge. If the original asylum application was denied based 
upon a finding that it was frivolous, then the alien is ineligible to 
file either a motion to reopen or reconsider, or for a stay of removal.
    (ii) Order entered in absentia or removal proceedings. An order of 
removal entered in absentia or in removal proceedings pursuant to 
section 240(b)(5) of the Act may be rescinded only upon a motion to 
reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal, if 
the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of 
exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the Act. An 
order entered in absentia pursuant to section 240(b)(5) may be rescinded 
upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that 
he or she did not receive notice in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) 
or (2) of the Act, or the alien demonstrates that he or she was in 
Federal or state custody and the failure to appear was through no fault 
of the alien. However, in accordance with section 240(b)(5)(B) of the 
Act, no written notice of a change in time or place of proceeding shall 
be required if the alien has failed to provide the address required 
under section 239(a)(1)(F) of the Act. The filing of a motion under this 
paragraph shall stay the removal of the alien pending disposition of the 
motion by the Immigration Judge. An alien may file only one motion 
pursuant to this paragraph.
    (iii) Order entered in absentia in deportation or exclusion 
proceedings. (A) An order entered in absentia in deportation proceedings 
may be rescinded only upon a motion to reopen filed:
    (1) Within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if 
the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of 
exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien (e.g., serious 
illness of the alien or serious illness or death of an immediate 
relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances); 
or
    (2) At any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not 
receive notice or if the alien demonstrates that he or she was in 
federal or state custody and the failure to appear was through no fault 
of the alien.
    (B) A motion to reopen exclusion hearings on the basis that the 
Immigration Judge improperly entered an order of exclusion in absentia 
must be supported by evidence that the alien had reasonable cause for 
his failure to appear.
    (C) The filing of a motion to reopen under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) 
of this section shall stay the deportation of the alien pending decision 
on the motion and the adjudication of any properly filed administrative 
appeal.
    (D) The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section shall not apply to a motion to reopen filed pursuant to 
the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section.
    (iv) Jointly filed motions. The time and numerical limitations set 
forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to a motion to 
reopen agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed.

Sec. 3.24  Fees pertaining to matters within the jurisdiction of the Immigration Judge.

    Unless waived by the Immigration Judge, any fee pertaining to a 
matter within the jurisdiction of the Immigration Judge shall be 
remitted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.7 of this 
chapter. Any such fee may be waived by the Immigration Judge upon a 
showing that the respondent/applicant is incapable of paying the fees 
because of indigency. A properly executed affidavit or unsworn 
declaration made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 by the respondent/applicant 
must accompany the request for waiver of fees and shall substantiate the 
indigency of the respondent/application.

[61 FR 18908, Apr. 29, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 3.25  Form of the proceeding.

    (a) Waiver of presence of the parties. The Immigration Judge may, 
for good cause, and consistent with section

[[Page 29]]

240(b) of the Act, waive the presence of the alien at a hearing when the 
alien is represented or when the alien is a minor child at least one of 
whose parents or whose legal guardian is present. When it is 
impracticable by reason of an alien's mental incompetency for the alien 
to be present, the presence of the alien may be waived provided that the 
alien is represented at the hearing by an attorney or legal 
representative, a near relative, legal guardian, or friend.
    (b) Stipulated request for order; waiver of hearing. An Immigration 
Judge may enter an order of deportation, exclusion or removal stipulated 
to by the alien (or the alien's representative) and the Service. The 
Immigration Judge may enter such an order without a hearing and in the 
absence of the parties based on a review of the charging document, the 
written stipulation, and supporting documents, if any. If the alien is 
unrepresented, the Immigration Judge must determine that the alien's 
waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The stipulated request 
and required waivers shall be signed on behalf of the government and by 
the alien and his or her attorney or representative, if any. The 
attorney or representative shall file a Notice of Appearance in 
accordance with Sec. 3.16(b). A stipulated order shall constitute a 
conclusive determination of the alien's deportability or removability 
from the United States. The stipulation shall include:
    (1) An admission that all factual allegations contained in the 
charging document are true and correct as written;
    (2) A concession of deportability or inadmissibility as charged;
    (3) A statement that the alien makes no application for relief under 
the Act;
    (4) A designation of a country for deportation or removal under 
section 241(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act;
    (5) A concession to the introduction of the written stipulation of 
the alien as an exhibit to the Record of Proceeding;
    (6) A statement that the alien understands the consequences of the 
stipulated request and that the alien enters the request voluntarily, 
knowingly, and intelligently;
    (7) A statement that the alien will accept a written order for his 
or her deportation, exclusion or removal as a final disposition of the 
proceedings; and
    (8) A waiver of appeal of the written order of deportation or 
removal.
    (c) Telephonic or video hearings. An Immigration Judge may conduct 
hearings through video conference to the same extent as he or she may 
conduct hearings in person. An Immigration Judge may also conduct a 
hearing through a telephone conference, but an evidentiary hearing on 
the merits may only be conducted through a telephone conference with the 
consent of the alien involved after the alien has been advised of the 
right to proceed in person or, where available, through a video 
conference, except that credible fear determinations may be reviewed by 
the Immigration Judge through a telephone conference without the consent 
of the alien.

Sec. 3.26  In absentia hearings.

    (a) In any exclusion proceeding before an Immigration Judge in which 
the applicant fails to appear, the Immigration Judge shall conduct an in 
absentia hearing if the Immigration Judge is satisfied that notice of 
the time and place of the proceeding was provided to the applicant on 
the record at a prior hearing or by written notice to the applicant or 
to the applicant's counsel of record on the charging document or at the 
most recent address in the Record of Proceeding.
    (b) In any deportation proceeding before an Immigration Judge in 
which the respondent fails to appear, the Immigration Judge shall order 
the respondent deported in absentia if: (1) The Service establishes by 
clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence that the respondent is 
deportable; and (2) the Immigration Judge is satisfied that written 
notice of the time and place of the proceedings and written notice of 
the consequences of failure to appear, as set forth in section 242B(c) 
of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1252b(c)), were provided to the respondent in 
person or were provided to the respondent or the respondent's counsel of 
record, if any, by certified mail.
    (c) In any removal proceeding before an Immigration Judge in which 
the

[[Page 30]]

alien fails to appear, the Immigration Judge shall order the alien 
removed in absentia if:
    (1) The Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing 
evidence that the alien is removable; and
    (2) The Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing 
evidence that written notice of the time and place of proceedings and 
written notice of the consequences of failure to appear were provided to 
the alien or the alien's counsel of record.
    (d) Written notice to the alien shall be considered sufficient for 
purposes of this section if it was provided at the most recent address 
provided by the alien. If the respondent fails to provide his or her 
address as required under Sec. 3.15(d), no written notice shall be 
required for an Immigration Judge to proceed with an in absentia 
hearing. This paragraph shall not apply in the event that the 
Immigration Judge waives the appearance of an alien under Sec. 3.25.

place reasonable limitations upon the number in attendance at any one 
time with priority being given to the press over the general public;
    (b) For the purpose of protecting witnesses, parties, or the public 
interest, the Immigration Judge may limit attendance or hold a closed 
hearing.
    (c) In any proceeding before an Immigration Judge concerning an 
abused alien spouse, the hearing and the Record of Proceeding shall be 
closed to the public unless the abused spouse agrees that the hearing 
and the Record of Proceeding shall be open to the public. In any 
proceeding before an Immigration Judge concerning an abused alien child, 
the hearing and the Record of Proceeding shall be closed to the public.

substituted charges of deportability and/or factual allegations may be 
lodged by the Service in writing. The alien shall be served with a copy 
of these additional charges and/or allegations and the Immigration Judge 
shall read them to the alien. The Immigration Judge shall advise the 
alien, if he or she is not represented by counsel, that the alien may be 
so represented. The alien may be given a reasonable continuance to 
respond to the additional factual allegations and charges. Thereafter, 
the provision of Sec. 240.10(b) of this chapter relating to pleading

Sec. 3.35  Depositions and subpoenas.

    (a) Depositions. If an Immigration Judge is satisfied that a witness 
is not reasonably available at the place of hearing and that said 
witness' testimony or other evidence is essential, the Immigration Judge 
may order the taking of deposition either at his or her own instance or 
upon application of a party. Such order shall designate the official by 
whom the deposition shall be taken, may prescribe and limit the content, 
scope, or manner of taking the deposition, and may direct the production 
of documentary evidence.
    (b) Subpoenas issued subsequent to commencement of proceedings--(1) 
General. In any proceeding before an Immigration Judge, other than under 
8 CFR part 335, the Immigration Judge shall have exclusive jurisdiction 
to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses or for the 
production of books, papers and other documentary evidence, or both. An 
Immigration Judge may issue a subpoena upon his or her own volition or 
upon application of the Service or the alien.
    (2) Application for subpoena. A party applying for a subpoena shall 
be required, as a condition precedent to its issuance, to state in 
writing or at the proceeding, what he or she expects to prove by such 
witnesses or documentary evidence, and to show affirmatively that he or 
she has made diligent effort, without success, to produce the same.
    (3) Issuance of subpoena. Upon being satisfied that a witness will 
not appear and testify or produce documentary

[[Page 32]]

evidence and that the witness' evidence is essential, the Immigration 
Judge shall issue a subpoena. The subpoena shall state the title of the 
proceeding and shall command the person to whom it is directed to attend 
and to give testimony at a time and place specified. The subpoena may 
also command the person to whom it is directed to produce the books, 
papers, or documents specified in the subpoena.
    (4) Appearance of witness. If the witness is at a distance of more 
than 100 miles from the place of the proceeding, the subpoena shall 
provide for the witness' appearance at the Immigration Court nearest to 
the witness to respond to oral or written interrogatories, unless there 
is no objection by any party to the witness' appearance at the 
proceeding.
    (5) Service. A subpoena issued under this section may be served by 
any person over 18 years of age not a party to the case.
    (6) Invoking aid of court. If a witness neglects or refuses to 
appear and testify as directed by the subpoena served upon him or her in 
accordance with the provisions of this section, the Immigration Judge 
issuing the subpoena shall request the United States Attorney for the 
district in which the subpoena was issued to report such neglect or 
refusal to the United States District Court and to request such court to 
issue an order requiring the witness to appear and testify and to 
produce the books, papers or documents designated in the subpoena.

    (a) Referral. Jurisdiction for an Immigration Judge to review an 
adverse credible fear finding by an asylum officer pursuant to section 
235(b)(1)(B) of the Act shall commence with the filing by the Service of 
Form I-863, Notice of

[[Page 34]]

Referral to Immigration Judge. The Service shall also file with the 
notice of referral a copy of the written record of determination as 
defined in section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II) of the Act, including a copy of 
the alien's written request for review, if any.
    (b) Record of proceeding. The Immigration Court shall create a 
Record of Proceeding for a review of an adverse credible fear 
determination. This record shall not be merged with any later proceeding 
pursuant to section 240 of the Act involving the same alien.
    (c) Procedures and evidence. The Immigration Judge may receive into 
evidence any oral or written statement which is material and relevant to 
any issue in the review. The testimony of the alien shall be under oath 
or affirmation administered by the Immigration Judge. If an interpreter 
is necessary, one will be provided by the Immigration Court. The 
Immigration Judge shall determine whether the review shall be in person, 
or through telephonic or video connection (where available). The alien 
may consult with a person or persons of the alien's choosing prior to 
the review.
    (d) Standard of review. The Immigration Judge shall make a de novo 
determination as to whether there is a significant possibility, taking 
into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in 
support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the 
Immigration Judge, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum 
under section 208 of the Act.
    (e) Timing. The Immigration Judge shall conclude the review to the 
maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7 
days after the date the supervisory asylum officer has approved the 
asylum officer's negative credible fear determination issued on Form I-
869, Record of Negative Credible Fear Finding and Request for Review.
    (f) Decision. If an Immigration Judge determines that an alien has a 
credible fear of persecution, the Immigration Judge shall vacate the 
order entered pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I) of the Act. 
Subsequent to the order being vacated, the Service shall issue and file 
Form I-862, Notice to Appear, with the Immigration Court to commence 
removal proceedings. The alien shall have the opportunity to apply for 
asylum in the course of removal proceedings pursuant to section 240 of 
the Act. If an Immigration Judge determines that an alien does not have 
a credible fear of persecution, the Immigration Judge shall affirm the 
asylum officer's determination and remand the case to the Service for 
execution of the removal order entered pursuant to section 
235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I) of the Act. No appeal shall lie from a review of an 
adverse credible fear determination made by an Immigration Judge.
    (g) Custody. An Immigration Judge shall have no authority to review 
an alien's custody status in the course of a review of an adverse 
credible fear determination made by the Service.

    (d) Fee for motion to reopen waived. No filing fee is required for a

motion to reopen filed pursuant to the special rules of section 309(g) 
of IIRIRA, as amended by section 203(c) of NACARA, shall be filed with 
the Immigration Court, even if the Board of Immigration Appeals issued 
an order in the case. The Immigration Court that last had jurisdiction 
over the proceedings will adjudicate a motion to reopen filed pursuant 
to the special rules of section 309(g) of IIRIRA, as amended by section 
203(c) of NACARA.
    (2) The Board will remand to the Immigration Court any presently 
pending appeal in which the alien appears eligible to apply for 
suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal under the special 
rules of section 309(g) of IIRIRA, as amended by section 203 of NACARA, 
and appears prima facie eligible for that relief. The alien will then 
have the opportunity to apply for suspension or cancellation under the 
special rules of NACARA before the Immigration Court.

<R05>
Sec. 101.3  Creation of record of lawful permanent resident status for person born under diplomatic status in the United States.

    (a) Person born to foreign diplomat. (1) Status of person. A person 
born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer accredited to 
the United States, as a matter of international law, is not subject to 
the jurisdiction of the United States. That person is not a United 
States citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Such 
a person may be considered a lawful permanent resident at birth.
    (2) Definition of foreign diplomatic officer. Foreign diplomatic 
officer means a person listed in the State Department Diplomatic List, 
also known as the Blue List. It includes ambassadors, ministers, charges 
d'affaires, counselors, secretaries and attaches of embassies and 
legations as well as members of the Delegation of the Commission of the 
European Communities. The term also includes individuals with comparable 
diplomatic status and immunities who are accredited to the United 
Nations or to the Organization of American States, and other individuals 
who are also accorded comparable diplomatic status.
    (b) Child born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. A 
child born in the United States is born subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States and is a United States citizen if the parent is not a 
``foreign diplomatic officer'' as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. This includes, for example, a child born in the United States 
to one of the following foreign government officials or employees:
    (1) Employees of foreign diplomatic missions whose names appear in 
the State Department list entitled ``Employees of Diplomatic Missions 
Not Printed in the Diplomatic List,'' also known as the White List; 
employees of foreign diplomatic missions accredited to the United 
Nations or the Organization of American States; or foreign diplomats 
accredited to other foreign states. The majority of these individuals 
enjoy certain diplomatic immunities, but they are not ``foreign 
diplomatic officers'' as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 
The immunities, if any, of their family members are derived from the 
status of the employees or diplomats.
    (2) Foreign government employees with limited or no diplomatic 
immunity such as consular officials named on the State Department list 
entitled ``Foreign Consular Officers in the United States'' and their 
staffs.
    (c) Voluntary registration as lawful permanent resident of person 
born to foreign diplomat. Since a person born in the United States to a 
foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, his/her registration as a lawful permanent resident of 
the United States is voluntary. The provisions of section 262 of the Act 
do not apply to such a person unless and until that person ceases to 
have the

[[Page 61]]

rights, privileges, exemptions, or immunities which may be claimed by a 
foreign diplomatic officer.
    (d) Retention of lawful permanent residence. To be eligible for 
lawful permanent resident status under paragraph (a) of this section, an 
alien must establish that he/she has not abandoned his/her residence in 
the United States. One of the tests for retention of lawful permanent 
resident status is continuous residence, not continuous physical 
presence, in the United States. Such a person will not be considered to 
have abandoned his/her residence in the United States solely by having 
been admitted to the United States in a nonimmigrant classification 
under paragraph (15)(A) or (15)(G) of section 101(a) of the Act after a 
temporary stay in a foreign country or countries on one or several 
occasions.

as amended; 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20), 1103, 1302, 1304)

Sec. 101.4  Registration procedure.

    The procedure for an application for creation of a record of lawful 
permanent residence and a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-551, for a 
person eligible for presumption of lawful admission for permanent 
residence under Sec. 101.1 or Sec. 101.2 or for lawful permanent 
residence as a person born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic 
officer under Sec. 101.3 is described in Sec. 264.2 of this chapter.

(Secs. 101(a)(20), 103, 262, 264 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 
as amended; 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20), 1103, 1302, 1304)

[47 FR 941, Jan. 8, 1982, as amended at 63 FR 70315, Dec. 21, 1998]

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 70315, Dec. 21, 1998, Sec. 101.4 was 
amended by revising the phrase ``an Alien Registration Receipt Card'' to 
read ``a Permanent Resident Card'', effective Jan. 20, 1999.


<R05>
Sec. 101.5  Special immigrant status for certain G-4 nonimmigrants.

    (a) Application. An application for adjustment to special immigrant 
status under section 101(a)(27)(I) of the INA shall be made on Form I-
485. The application date of the I-485 shall be the date of acceptance 
by the Service as properly filed. If the application date is other than 
the fee receipt date it must be noted and initialed by a Service 
officer. The date of application for adjustment of status is the closing 
date for computing the residence and physical presence requirement. The 
applicant must have complied with all requirements as of the date of 
application.
    (b) Documentation. All documents must be submitted in accordance 
with Sec. 103.2(b) of this chapter. The application shall be accompanied 
by documentary evidence establishing the aggregate residence and 
physical presence required. Documentary evidence may include official 
employment verification, records of official or personnel transactions 
or recordings of events occurring during the period of claimed residence 
and physical presence. Affidavits of credible witnesses may also be 
accepted. Persons unable to furnish evidence in their own names may 
furnish evidence in the names of parents or other persons with whom they 
have been living, if affidavits of the parents or other persons are 
submitted attesting to the claimed residence and physical presence. The 
claimed family relationship to the principle G-4 international 
organization officer or employee must be substantiated by the submission 
of verifiable civil documents.
    (c) Residence and physical presence requirements. All applicants 
applying under sections 101(a)(27)(I) (i), (ii), and (iii) of the INA 
must have resided and been physically present in the United States for a 
designated period of time.
    For purposes of this section only, an absence from the United States 
to conduct official business on behalf of the employing organization, or 
approved customary leave shall not be subtracted from the aggregated 
period of required residence or physical presence for the current or 
former G-4 officer or employee or the accompanying spouse and unmarried 
sons or daughters of such officer or employee, provided residence in the 
United States is maintained during such absences, and the duty station 
of the principle G-4 nonimmigrant continues to be in the United States. 
Absence from the United States by the G-4 spouse or unmarried son or 
daughter without the

[[Page 62]]

principle G-4 shall not be subtracted from the aggregate period of 
residence and physical presence if on customary leave as recognized by 
the international organization employer. Absence by the unmarried son or 
daughter while enrolled in a school outside the United States will not 
be counted toward the physical presence requirement.
    (d) Maintenance of nonimmigrant status. Section 101(a)(27)(I) (i), 
and (ii) requires the applicant to accrue the required period of 
residence and physical presence in the United States while maintaining 
status as a G-4 or N nonimmigrant. Section 101(a)(27)(I)(iii) requires 
such time accrued only in G-4 nonimmigrant status.
    Maintaining G-4 status for this purpose is defined as maintaining 
qualified employment with a ``G'' international organization or 
maintaining the qualifying family relationship with the G-4 
international organization officer or employee. Maintaining status as an 
N nonimmigrant for this purpose requires the qualifying family 
relationship to remain in effect. Unauthorized employment will not 
remove an otherwise eligible alien from G-4 status for residence and 
physical presence requirements, provided the qualifying G-4 status is 
maintained.

<R05>
Sec. 103.2  Applications, petitions, and other documents.

    (a) Filing--(1) General. Every application, petition, appeal, 
motion, request, or other document submitted on the form prescribed by 
this chapter shall be executed and filed in accordance with the 
instructions on the form, such instructions (including where an 
application or petition should be filed) being hereby incorporated into 
the particular section of the regulations in this chapter requiring its 
submission. The form must be filed with the appropriate filing fee 
required by Sec. 103.7. Except as exempted by paragraph (e) of this 
section, forms which require an applicant, petitioner, sponsor, 
beneficiary, or other individual to complete Form FD-258, Applicant 
Card, must also be filed with the service fee for fingerprinting, as 
required by Sec. 103.7(b)(1), for each individual who requires 
fingerprinting. Filing fees and fingerprinting service fees are non-
refundable and, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, must be 
paid when the application is filed.
    (2) Signature. An applicant or petitioner must sign his or her 
application or petition. However, a parent or legal guardian may sign 
for a person who is less than 14 years old. A legal guardian may sign 
for a mentally incompetent person. By signing the application or 
petition, the applicant or petitioner, or parent or guardian certifies 
under penalty of perjury that the application or petition, and all 
evidence submitted with it, either at the time of filing or thereafter, 
is true and correct.
    (3) Representation. An applicant or petitioner may be represented by 
an attorney in the United States, as defined in Sec. 1.1(f) of this 
chapter, by an attorney outside the United States as defined in 
Sec. 292.1(a)(6) of this chapter, or by an accredited representative as 
defined in Sec. 292.1(a)(4) of this chapter. A beneficiary of a petition 
is not a recognized party in such a proceeding. An application or 
petition presented in person by someone who is not the applicant or 
petitioner, or his or her representative as defined in this paragraph, 
shall be treated as if received through the mail, and the person advised 
that the applicant or petitioner, and his or her representative, will be 
notified of the decision. Where a notice of representation is submitted 
that is not properly signed, the application or petition will be 
processed as if the notice had not been submitted.
    (4) Oath. Any required oath may be administered by an immigration 
officer or person generally authorized to administer oaths, including 
persons so authorized by Article 136 of the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice.

[[Page 70]]

    (5) Translation of name. If a document has been executed in an 
anglicized version of a name, the native form of the name may also be 
required.
    (6) Where to file. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an 
application or petition should be filed with the INS office or Service 
Center with jurisdiction over the application or petition and the place 
of residence of the applicant or petitioner as indicated in the 
instructions with the respective form.
    (7) Receipt date--(i) General. An application or petition received 
in a Service office shall be stamped to show the time and date of actual 
receipt and, unless otherwise specified in part 204 or part 245 of this 
chapter, shall be regarded as properly filed when so stamped, if it is 
properly signed and executed and the required filing fee is attached or 
a waiver of the filing fee is granted. An application or petition which 
is not properly signed or is submitted with the wrong filing fee shall 
be rejected as improperly filed. Rejected applications and petitions, 
and ones in which the check or other financial instrument used to pay 
the filing fee is subsequently returned as non-payable will not retain a 
filing date. An application or petition taken to a local Service office 
for the completion of biometric information prior to filing at a Service 
Center shall be considered received when physically received at a 
Service Center.
    (ii) Non-payment. If a check or other financial instrument used to 
pay a filing fee is subsequently returned as not payable, the remitter 
shall be notified and requested to pay the filing fee and associated 
service charge within 14 calendar days, without extension. If the 
application or petition is pending and these charges are not paid within 
14 days, the application or petition shall be rejected as improperly 
filed. If the application or petition was already approved, and these 
charges are not paid, the approval shall be automatically revoked 
because it was improperly field. If the application or petition was 
already denied, revoked, or abandoned, that decision will not be 
affected by the non-payment of the filing or fingerprinting fee. New 
fees will be required with any new application or petition. Any fee and 
service charges collected as the result of collection activities or 
legal action on the prior application or petition shall be used to cover 
the cost of the previous rejection, revocation, or other action.
    (b) Evidence and processing--(1) General. An applicant or petitioner 
must establish eligibility for a requested immigration benefit. An 
application or petition form must be completed as applicable and filed 
with any initial evidence required by regulation or by the instructions 
on the form. Any evidence submitted is considered part of the relating 
application or petition.
    (2) Submitting secondary evidence and affidavits--(i) General. The 
non-existence or other unavailability of required evidence creates a 
presumption of ineligibility. If a required document, such as a birth or 
marriage certificate, does not exist or cannot be obtained, an applicant 
or petitioner must demonstrate this and submit secondary evidence, such 
as church or school records, pertinent to the facts at issue. If 
secondary evidence also does not exist or cannot be obtained, the 
applicant or petitioner must demonstrate the unavailability of both the 
required document and relevant secondary evidence, and submit two or 
more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by persons who are not parties to 
the petition who have direct personal knowledge of the event and 
circumstances. Secondary evidence must overcome the unavailability of 
primary evidence, and affidavits must overcome the unavailability of 
both primary and secondary evidence.
    (ii) Demonstrating that a record is not available. Where a record 
does not exist, the applicant or petitioner must submit an original 
written statement on government letterhead establishing this from the 
relevant government or other authority. The statement must indicate the 
reason the record does not exist, and indicate whether similar records 
for the time and place are available. However, a certification from an 
appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not 
required where the Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual 
indicates this type of document generally does not exist. An applicant 
or petitioner who has not been able to acquire

[[Page 71]]

the necessary document or statement from the relevant foreign authority 
may submit evidence that repeated good faith attempts were made to 
obtain the required document or statement. However, where the Service 
finds that such documents or statements are generally available, it may 
require that the applicant or petitioner submit the required document or 
statement.
    (iii) Evidence provided with a self-petition filed by a spouse or 
child of abusive citizen or resident. The Service will consider any 
credible evidence relevant to a self-petition filed by a qualified 
spouse or child of an abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident under 
section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or 
204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act. The self-petitioner may, but is not 
required to, demonstrate that preferred primary or secondary evidence is 
unavailable. The determination of what evidence is credible and the 
weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of 
the Service.
    (3) Translations. Any document containing foreign language submitted 
to the Service shall be accompanied by a full English language 
translation which the translator has certified as complete and accurate, 
and by the translator's certification that he or she is competent to 
translate from the foreign language into English.
    (4) Submitting copies of documents. Application and petition forms 
must be submitted in the original. Forms and documents issued to support 
an application or petition, such as labor certifications, Form IAP-66, 
medical examinations, affidavits, formal consultations, and other 
statements, must be submitted in the original unless previously filed 
with the Service. When submission is required, expired Service documents 
must be submitted in the original, as must Service documents required to 
be annotated to indicate the decision. In all other instances, unless 
the relevant regulations or instructions specifically require that an 
original document be filed with an application or petition, an ordinary 
legible photocopy may be submitted. Original documents submitted when 
not required will remain a part of the record, even if the submission 
was not required.
    (5) Request for an original document. Where a copy of a document is 
submitted with an application or petition, the Service may at any time 
require that the original document be submitted for review. If the 
requested original, other than one issued by the Service, is not 
submitted within 12 weeks, the petition or application shall be denied 
or revoked. There shall be no appeal from a denial or revocation based 
on the failure to submit an original document upon the request of the 
Service to substantiate a previously submitted copy. Further, an 
applicant or petitioner may not move to reopen or reconsider the 
proceeding based on the subsequent availability of the document. An 
original document submitted pursuant to a Service request shall be 
returned to the petitioner or applicant when no longer required.
    (6) Withdrawal. An applicant or petitioner may withdraw an 
application or petition at any time until a decision is issued by the 
Service or, in the case of an approved petition, until the person is 
admitted or granted adjustment or change of status, based on the 
petition. However, a withdrawal may not be retracted.
    (7) Testimony. The Service may require the taking of testimony, and 
may direct any necessary investigation. When a statement is taken from 
and signed by a person, he or she shall, upon request, be given a copy 
without fee. Any allegations made subsequent to filing an application or 
petition which are in addition to, or in substitution for, those 
originally made, shall be filed in the same manner as the original 
application, petition, or document, and acknowledged under oath thereon.
    (8) Request for evidence. If there is evidence of ineligibility in 
the record, an application or petition shall be denied on that basis 
notwithstanding any lack of required initial evidence. If the 
application or petition was pre-screened by the Service prior to filing 
and was filed even though the applicant or petitioner was informed that 
the required initial evidence was missing, the application or petition 
shall be denied for failure to contain the necessary evidence. Except as 
otherwise provided in this chapter, in other instances where

[[Page 72]]

there is no evidence of ineligibility, and initial evidence or 
eligibility information is missing or the Service finds that the 
evidence submitted either does not fully establish eligibility for the 
requested benefit or raises underlying questions regarding eligibility, 
the Service shall request the missing initial evidence, and may request 
additional evidence, including blood tests. In such cases, the applicant 
or petitioner shall be given 12 weeks to respond to a request for 
evidence. Additional time may not be granted. Within this period the 
applicant or petitioner may:
    (i) Submit all the requested initial or additional evidence;
    (ii) Submit some or none of the requested additional evidence and 
ask for a decision based on the record; or
    (iii) Withdraw the application or petition.
    (9) Request for appearance. An applicant, a petitioner, a sponsor, a 
beneficiary, or other individual residing in the United States at the 
time of filing an application or petition may be required to appear for 
fingerprinting or for an interview. A petitioner shall also be notified 
when a fingerprinting notice or an interview notice is mailed or issued 
to a beneficiary, sponsor, or other individual. The applicant, 
petitioner, sponsor, beneficiary, or other individual may appear as 
requested by the Service, or prior to the dates and times for 
fingerprinting or of the date and time of interview:
    (i) The individual to be fingerprinted or interviewed may, for good 
cause, request that the fingerprinting or interview be rescheduled; or
    (ii) The applicant or petitioner may withdraw the application or 
petition.
    (10) Effect of a request for initial or additional evidence for 
fingerprinting or interview rescheduling--(i) Effect on processing. The 
priority date of a properly filed petition shall not be affected by a 
request for missing initial evidence or request for other evidence. If 
an application or petition is missing required initial evidence, or an 
applicant, petitioner, sponsor, beneficiary, or other individual who 
requires fingerprinting requests that the fingerprinting appointment or 
interview be rescheduled, any time period imposed on Service processing 
will start over from the date of receipt of the required initial 
evidence or request for fingerprint or interview rescheduling. If the 
Service requests that the applicant or petitioner submit additional 
evidence or respond to other than a request for initial evidence, any 
time limitation imposed on the Service for processing will be suspended 
as of the date of request. It will resume at the same point where it 
stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or response, or 
a request for a decision based on the evidence.
    (ii) Effect on interim benefits. Interim benefits will not be 
granted based on an application or petition held in suspense for the 
submission of requested initial evidence, except that the applicant or 
beneficiary will normally be allowed to remain while an application or 
petition to extend or obtain status while in the United States is 
pending. The Service may choose to pursue other actions to seek removal 
of a person notwithstanding the pending application. Employment 
authorization previously accorded based on the same status and 
employment as that requested in the current application or petition may 
continue uninterrupted as provided in 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(20) during the 
suspense period.
    (11) Submission of evidence in response to a Service request. All 
evidence submitted in response to a Service request must be submitted at 
one time. The submission of only some of the requested evidence will be 
considered a request for a decision based on the record.
    (12) Effect where evidence submitted in response to a request does 
not establish eligibility at the time of filing. An application or 
petition shall be denied where evidence submitted in response to a 
request for initial evidence does not establish filing eligibility at 
the time the application or petition was filed. An application or 
petition shall be denied where any application or petition upon which it 
was based was filed subsequently.
    (13) Effect of failure to respond to a request for evidence or 
appearance. If all

[[Page 73]]

requested initial evidence and requested additional evidence is not 
submitted by the required date, the application or petition shall be 
considered abandoned and, accordingly, shall be denied. Except as 
provided in Sec. 335.6 of this chapter, if an individual requested to 
appear for fingerprinting or for an interview does not appear, the 
Service does not receive his or her request for rescheduling by the date 
of the fingerprinting appointment or interview, or the applicant or 
petitioner has not withdrawn the application or petition, the 
application or petition shall be considered abandoned and, accordingly, 
shall be denied.
    (14) Effect of request for decision. Where an applicant or 
petitioner does not submit all requested additional evidence and 
requests a decision based on the evidence already submitted, a decision 
shall be issued based on the record. Failure to submit requested 
evidence which precludes a material line of inquiry shall be grounds for 
denying the application or petition. Failure to appear for required 
fingerprinting or for a required interview, or to give required 
testimony, shall result in the denial of the related application or 
petition.
    (15) Effect of withdrawal or denial due to abandonment. The 
Service's acknowledgement of a withdrawal may not be appealed. A denial 
due to abandonment may not be appealed, but an applicant or petitioner 
may file a motion to reopen under Sec. 103.5. Withdrawal or denial due 
to abandonment does not preclude the filing of a new application or 
petition with a new fee. However, the priority or processing date of a 
withdrawn or abandoned application or petition may not be applied to a 
later application petition. Withdrawal or denial due to abandonment 
shall not itself affect the new proceeding; but the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the prior application or petition shall 
otherwise be material to the new application or petition.
    (16) Inspection of evidence. An applicant or petitioner shall be 
permitted to inspect the record of proceeding which constitutes the 
basis for the decision, except as provided in the following paragraphs.
    (i) Derogatory information unknown to petitioner or applicant. If 
the decision will be adverse to the applicant or petitioner and is based 
on derogatory information considered by the Service and of which the 
applicant or petitioner is unaware, he/she shall be advised of this fact 
and offered an opportunity to rebut the information and present 
information in his/her own behalf before the decision is rendered, 
except as provided in paragraphs (b)(16)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
section. Any explanation, rebuttal, or information presented by or in 
behalf of the applicant or petitioner shall be included in the record of 
proceeding.
    (ii) Determination of statutory eligibility. A determination of 
statutory eligibility shall be based only on information contained in 
the record of proceeding which is disclosed to the applicant or 
petitioner, except as provided in paragraph (b)(16)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) Discretionary determination. Where an application may be 
granted or denied in the exercise of discretion, the decision to 
exercise discretion favorably or unfavorably may be based in whole or in 
part on classified information not contained in the record and not made 
available to the applicant, provided the regional commissioner has 
determined that such information is relevant and is classified under 
Executive Order No. 12356 (47 FR 14874; April 6, 1982) as requiring 
protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national 
security.
    (iv) Classified information. An applicant or petitioner shall not be 
provided any information contained in the record or outside the record 
which is classified under Executive Order No. 12356 (47 FR 14874; April 
6, 1982) as requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure in the 
interest of national security, unless the classifying authority has 
agreed in writing to such disclosure. Whenever he/she believes he/she 
can do so consistently with safeguarding both the information and its 
source, the regional commissioner should direct that the applicant or 
petitioner be given notice of the general nature of the information and 
an opportunity to offer opposing evidence.

[[Page 74]]

The regional commissioner's authorization to use such classified 
information shall be made a part of the record. A decision based in 
whole or in part on such classified information shall state that the 
information is material to the decision.
    (17) Verifying claimed citizenship or permanent resident status. The 
status of an applicant or petitioner who claims that he or she is a 
permanent resident of the United States will be verified from official 
records of the Service. The term official records, as used herein, 
includes Service files, arrival manifests, arrival records, Service 
index cards, Immigrant Identification Cards, Certificates of Registry, 
Declarations of Intention issued after July 1, 1929, Permanent Resident 
Cards Forms AR-3, AR-103, I-151 or I-551), passports, and reentry 
permits. To constitute an official record a Service index card must bear 
a designated immigrant visa symbol and must have been prepared by an 
authorized official of the Service in the course of processing immigrant 
admissions or adjustments to permanent resident status. Other cards, 
certificates, declarations, permits, and passports must have been issued 
or endorsed by the Service to show admission for permanent residence. 
Except as otherwise provided in 8 CFR part 101, and in the absence of 
countervailing evidence, such official records shall be regarded as 
establishing lawful admission for permanent residence. If a self-
petitioner filing under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 
204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act is unable to present 
primary or secondary evidence of the abuser's status, the Service will 
attempt to electronically verify the abuser's citizenship or immigration 
status from information contained in Service computerized records. Other 
Service records may also be reviewed at the discretion of the 
adjudicating officer. If the Service is unable to identify a record as 
relating to the abuser, or the record does not establish the abuser's 
immigration or citizenship status, the self-petition will be adjudicated 
based on the information submitted by the self-petitioner.
    (18) Withholding adjudication. A district director may authorize 
withholding adjudication of a visa petition or other application if the 
district director determines that an investigation has been undertaken 
involving a matter relating to eligibility or the exercise of 
discretion, where applicable, in connection with the application or 
petition, and that the disclosure of information to the applicant or 
petitioner in connection with the adjudication of the application or 
petition would prejudice the ongoing investigation. If an investigation 
has been undertaken and has not been completed within one year of its 
inception, the district director shall review the matter and determine 
whether adjudication of the petition or application should be held in 
abeyance for six months or until the investigation is completed, 
whichever comes sooner. If, after six months of the district director's 
determination, the investigation has not been completed, the matter 
shall be reviewed again by the district director and, if he/she 
concludes that more time is needed to complete the investigation, 
adjudication may be held in abeyance for up to another six months. If 
the investigation is not completed at the end of that time, the matter 
shall be referred to the regional commissioner, who may authorize that 
adjudication be held in abeyance for another six months. Thereafter, if 
the Associate Commissioner, Examinations, with the concurrence of the 
Associate Commissioner, Enforcement, determines it is necessary to 
continue to withhold adjudication pending completion of the 
investigation, he/she shall review that determination every six months.
    (19) Notification. An applicant or petitioner shall be sent a 
written decision on his or her application, petition, motion, or appeal. 
Where the applicant or petitioner has authorized representation pursuant 
to Sec. 103.2(a), that representative shall also be notified. Documents 
produced after an approval notice is sent, such as an alien registration 
card, shall be mailed directly to the applicant or petitioner.
    (c) Filing of applications for adjustment of status under sections 
210 and 245A of the Act, as amended. (1) The filing of an application 
for temporary resident status under section 245A(a) of the Act must 
conform to the provisions of

[[Page 75]]

Sec. 245a.2 of this chapter. The filing of an application for permanent 
resident status under section 245A(b)(1) of the Act must conform to the 
provisions of Sec. 245a.3 of this chapter. The filing of an application 
for adjustment of status to that of a temporary resident under section 
210(a) of the Act must conform to the provisions of Sec. 210.2 of this 
chapter.
    (2) An application for adjustment to temporary or permanent resident 
status pursuant to section 245A (a) or (b)(1) or section 210(a) of the 
Act may be accepted on behalf of the Attorney General by designated 
state, local and community organizations as well as designated voluntary 
organizations and persons. Each such application shall contain a 
certification signed by both the alien and the preparing member of the 
designated organization or entity, that the applicant has approved 
transmittal of the application to the Service for adjudication.
    (3) An application accepted by any of the designated entities shall 
be stamped with an endorsement as to the date of preparation and 
authorization for transmittal, and may be brought to the legalization 
office with the applicant as an application ready for adjudication. 
However, such application shall not be considered as complete until 
accepted for adjudication by and until the appropriate fee has been paid 
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
    (d) Filing of petitions for adjustment of status under section 210A 
of the Act, as amended. (1) The filing of a petition for temporary 
resident status as a Replenishment Agricultural Worker, and waivers 
incident to such filing, under section 210A of the Act must conform to 
the provisions of part 210a of this title.
    (2) A petition for adjustment to temporary resident status pursuant 
to section 210A of the Act shall be accepted only by the Service, or by 
personnel employed under contract to the Service, who are under Service 
supervision, and are specifically designated responsibility for the 
initial processing of petitions and waivers. Only Service officers may 
make decisions with respect to the granting or denial of petitions and 
waivers filed under section 210A of the Act and part 210a of this title.
    (3) Petitions and waivers filed with the Service pursuant to part 
210a of this title shall not be considered as complete until accepted 
for adjudication by and until the appropriate fee has been paid to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
    (e) Fingerprinting--(1) General. Service regulations in this 
chapter, including the instructions to benefit applications and 
petitions, require certain applicants, petitioners, beneficiaries, 
sponsors, and other individuals to be fingerprinted on Form FD-258, 
Applicant Card, for the purpose of conducting criminal background 
checks. On and after December 3, 1997, the Service will accept Form FD-
258, Applicant Card, only if prepared by a Service office, a registered 
State or local law enforcement agency designated by a cooperative 
agreement with the Service to provide fingerprinting services (DLEA), a 
United States consular office at United States embassies and consulates, 
or a United States military installation abroad.
    (2) Fingerprinting individuals residing in the United States. 
Beginning on December 3, 1997, for naturalization applications, and on 
March 29, 1998, for all other applications and petitions, applications 
and petitions for immigration benefits shall be filed as prescribed in 
this chapter, without completed Form FD-258, Applicant Card. After the 
filing of an application or petion, the Service will issue a notice to 
all individuals who require fingerprinting and who are residing in the 
United States, as defined in section 101(a)(38) of the Act, and request 
their appearance for fingerprinting at a Service office or other 
location designated by the Service, to complete Form FD-258, Applicant 
Card, as prescribed in paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
    (3) Fingerprinting individuals residing abroad. Individuals who 
require fingerprinting and whose place of residence is outside of the 
United States, must submit a properly completed Form FD-258, Applicant 
Card, at the time of filing the application or petition for immigration 
benefits. In the case of individuals who reside abroad, a properly 
completed Form FD-258, Applicant Card, is one prepared by the Service, a 
United States consular office

[[Page 76]]

at a United States embassy or consulate or a United States military 
installation abroad. If an individual who requires fingerprinting and is 
residing abroad fails to submit a properly completed Form FD-258, 
Applicant Card, at the time of filing an application or petition, the 
Service will issue a notice to the individual requesting submission of a 
properly completed Form FD-258, Applicant Card. The applicant or 
petitioner will also be notified of the request for submission of a 
properly completed Form FD-258, Applicant Card. Failure to submit a 
properly completed Form FD-258, Applicant Card, in response to such a 
request within the time allotted in the notice will result in denial of 
the application or petition for failure to submit a properly completed 
Form FD-258, Applicant Card. There is no appeal from denial of an 
application or petition for failure to submit a properly completed Form 
FD-258, Applicant Card. A motion to re-open an application or petition 
denied for failure to submit a properly completed Form FD-258, Applicant 
Card, will be granted only on proof that:
    (i) A properly completed Form FD-258, Applicant Card, was submitted 
at the time of filing the application or petition;
    (ii) A properly completed Form FD-258, Applicant Card, was submitted 
in response to the notice within the time allotted in the notice; or
    (iii) The notice was sent to an address other than the address on 
the application or petition, or the notice of representation, or that 
the applicant or petitioner notified the Service, in writing, of a 
change of address or change of representation subsequent to filing and 
before the notice was sent and the Service's notice was not sent to the 
new address.
    (4) Submission of service fee for fingerprinting--(i) General. The 
Service will charge a fee, as prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1), for 
fingerprinting at a Service office or a registered State or local law 
enforcement agency designated by a cooperative agreement with the 
Service to provide fingerprinting services. Applications and petitions 
for immigration benefits shall be submitted with the service fee for 
fingerprinting for all individuals who require fingerprinting and who 
reside in the United States at the time of filing the application or 
petition.
    (ii) Exemptions--(A) Individual residing abroad. Individuals who 
require fingerprinting and who reside outside of the United States at 
the time of filing an application or petition for immigration benefits 
are exempt from the requirement to submit the service fee for 
fingerprinting with the application or petition for immigration 
benefits.
    (B) Asylum applicants. Asylum applicants are exempt from the 
requirement to submit the service fee for fingerprinting with the 
application for asylum.
    (iii) Insufficient service fee for fingerprinting; incorrect fees. 
Applications and petitions for immigration benefits received by the 
Service without the correct service fee for fingerprinting will not be 
rejected as improperly filed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this 
section. However, the application or petition will not continue 
processing and the Service will not issue a notice requesting appearance 
for fingerprinting to the individuals who require fingerprinting until 
the correct service fee for fingerprinting has been submitted. The 
Service will notify the remitter of the filing fee for the application 
or petition of the additional amount required for the fingerprinting 
service fee and request submission of the correct fee. The Service will 
also notify the applicant or petitioner, and, when appropriate, the 
applicant or petitioner's representative, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section, of the deficiency. Failure to submit the correct fee 
for fingerprinting in response to a notice of deficiency within the time 
allotted in the notice will result in denial of the application or 
petition for failure to submit the correct service fee for 
fingerprinting. There is no appeal from the denial of an application or 
petition for failure to submit the correct service fee for 
fingerprinting. A motion to re-open an application or petition denied 
for failure to submit the correct service fee for fingerprinting will be 
granted only on proof that:
    (A) The correct service fee for fingerprinting was submitted at the

[[Page 77]]

time of filing the application or petition;
    (B) The correct service fee for fingerprinting was submitted in 
response to the notice of deficiency within the time allotted in the 
notice; or
    (C) The notice of deficiency was sent to an address other than the 
address on the application or petition, or the notice of representation, 
or that the applicant or petitioner notified the Service, in writing, of 
a change of address or change of representation subsequent to filing and 
before the notice of deficiency was sent and the Service's notice of 
deficiency was not sent to the new address.
    (iv) Non-payment of service fee for fingerprinting. If a check or 
other financial instrument used to pay a service fee for fingerprinting 
is subsequently returned as not payable, the remitter shall be notified 
and requested to pay the correct service fee for fingerprinting and any 
associated service charges within 14 calendar days. The Service will 
also notify the applicant or petitioner and, when appropriate, the 
applicant or petitioner's representative as defined in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section, of the non-payment and request to pay. If the correct 
service fee for fingerprinting and associated service charges are not 
paid within 14 calendar days, the application or petition will be denied 
for failure to submit the correct service fee for fingerprinting.

Sec. 103.3  Denials, appeals, and precedent decisions.

    (a) Denials and appeals--(1) General--(i) Denial of application or 
petition. When a Service officer denies an application or petition filed 
under Sec. 103.2 of this part, the officer shall explain in writing the 
specific reasons for denial. If Form I-292 (a denial form including 
notification of the right of appeal) is used to notify the applicant or 
petitioner, the duplicate of Form I-292 constitutes the denial order.
    (ii) Appealable decisions. Certain unfavorable decisions on 
applications, petitions, and other types of cases may be appealed. 
Decisions under the appellate jurisdiction of the Board of Immigration 
Appeals (Board) are listed in Sec. 3.1(b) of this chapter. Decisions 
under the appellate jurisdiction of the Associate Commissioner, 
Examinations, are listed in Sec. 103.1(f)(2) of this part.
    (iii) Appeal--(A) Jurisdiction. When an unfavorable decision may be 
appealed, the official making the decision shall state the appellate 
jurisdiction and shall furnish the appropriate appeal form.
    (B) Meaning of affected party. For purposes of this section and 
Secs. 103.4 and 103.5 of this part, affected party (in addition to the 
Service) means the person or entity with legal standing in a proceeding. 
It does not include the beneficiary of a visa petition. An affected 
party may be represented by an attorney or representative in accordance 
with part 292 of this chapter.
    (C) Record of proceeding. An appeal and any cross-appeal or briefs 
become part of the record of proceeding.
    (D) Appeal filed by Service officer in case within jurisdiction of 
Board. If an appeal is filed by a Service officer, a copy must be served 
on the affected party.
    (iv) Function of Administrative Appeals Unit (AAU). The AAU is the 
appellate body which considers cases under the appellate jurisdiction of 
the Associate Commissioner, Examinations.
    (v) Summary dismissal. An officer to whom an appeal is taken shall 
summarily dismiss any appeal when the party concerned fails to identify 
specifically any erroneous conclusion of law or statement of fact for 
the appeal. The filing by an attorney or representative accredited under 
8 CFR 292.2(d) of an appeal which is summarily dismissed under this 
section may constitute frivolous behavior as defined in 8 CFR 
292.3(a)(15). Summary dismissal of an appeal under Sec. 103.3(a)(1)(v) 
in no way limits the other grounds and procedures for disciplinary 
action against attorneys or representatives provided

[[Page 78]]

in 8 CFR 292.2 or in any other statute or regulation.
    (2) AAU appeals in other than special agricultural worker and 
legalization cases--(i) Filing appeal. The affected party shall file an 
appeal on Form I-290B. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the 
affected party must pay the fee required by Sec. 103.7 of this part. The 
affected party shall file the complete appeal including any supporting 
brief with the office where the unfavorable decision was made within 30 
days after service of the decision.
    (ii) Reviewing official. The official who made the unfavorable 
decision being appealed shall review the appeal unless the affected 
party moves to a new jurisdiction. In that instance, the official who 
has jurisdiction over such a proceeding in that geographic location 
shall review it.
    (iii) Favorable action instead of forwarding appeal to AAU. The 
reviewing official shall decide whether or not favorable action is 
warranted. Within 45 days of receipt of the appeal, the reviewing 
official may treat the appeal as a motion to reopen or reconsider and 
take favorable action. However, that official is not precluded from 
reopening a proceeding or reconsidering a decision on his or her own 
motion under Sec. 103.5(a)(5)(i) of this part in order to make a new 
decision favorable to the affected party after 45 days of receipt of the 
appeal.
    (iv) Forwarding appeal to AAU. If the reviewing official will not be 
taking favorable action or decides favorable action is not warranted, 
that official shall promptly forward the appeal and the related record 
of proceeding to the AAU in Washington, DC.
    (v) Improperly filed appeal--(A) Appeal filed by person or entity 
not entitled to file it--(1) Rejection without refund of filing fee. An 
appeal filed by a person or entity not entitled to file it must be 
rejected as improperly filed. In such a case, any filing fee the Service 
has accepted will not be refunded.
    (2) Appeal by attorney or representative without proper Form G-28--
(i) General. If an appeal is filed by an attorney or representative 
without a properly executed Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or 
Representative (Form G-28) entitling that person to file the appeal, the 
appeal is considered improperly filed. In such a case, any filing fee 
the Service has accepted will not be refunded regardless of the action 
taken.
    (ii) When favorable action warranted. If the reviewing official 
decides favorable action is warranted with respect to an otherwise 
properly filed appeal, that official shall ask the attorney or 
representative to submit Form G-28 to the official's office within 15 
days of the request. If Form G-28 is not submitted within the time 
allowed, the official may, on his or her own motion, under 
Sec. 103.5(a)(5)(i) of this part, make a new decision favorable to the 
affected party without notifying the attorney or representative.
    (iii) When favorable action not warranted. If the reviewing official 
decides favorable action is not warranted with respect to an otherwise 
properly filed appeal, that official shall ask the attorney or 
representative to submit Form G-28 directly to the AAU. The official 
shall also forward the appeal and the relating record of proceeding to 
the AAU. The appeal may be considered properly filed as of its original 
filing date if the attorney or representative submits a properly 
executed Form G-28 entitling that person to file the appeal.
    (B) Untimely appeal--(1) Rejection without refund of filing fee. An 
appeal which is not filed within the time allowed must be rejected as 
improperly filed. In such a case, any filing fee the Service has 
accepted will not be refunded.
    (2) Untimely appeal treated as motion. If an untimely appeal meets 
the requirements of a motion to reopen as described in Sec. 103.5(a)(2) 
of this part or a motion to reconsider as described in Sec. 103.5(a)(3) 
of this part, the appeal must be treated as a motion, and a decision 
must be made on the merits of the case.
    (vi) Brief. The affected party may submit a brief with Form I-290B.
    (vii) Additional time to submit a brief. The affected party may make 
a written request to the AAU for additional time to submit a brief. The 
AAU may, for good cause shown, allow the affected party additional time 
to submit one.
    (viii) Where to submit supporting brief if additional time is 
granted. If the AAU grants additional time, the affected

[[Page 79]]

party shall submit the brief directly to the AAU.
    (ix) Withdrawal of appeal. The affected party may withdraw the 
appeal, in writing, before a decision is made.
    (x) Decision on appeal. The decision must be in writing. A copy of 
the decision must be served on the affected party and the attorney or 
representative of record, if any.
    (3) Denials and appeals of special agricultural worker and 
legalization applications and termination of lawful temporary resident 
status under sections 210 and 245A. (i) Whenever an application for 
legalization or special agricultural worker status is denied or the 
status of a lawful temporary resident is terminated, the alien shall be 
given written notice setting forth the specific reasons for the denial 
on Form I-692, Notice of Denial. Form I-692 shall also contain advice to 
the applicant that he or she may appeal the decision and that such 
appeal must be taken within 30 days after service of the notification of 
decision accompanied by any additional new evidence, and a supporting 
brief if desired. The Form I-692 shall additionally provide a notice to 
the alien that if he or she fails to file an appeal from the decision, 
the Form I-692 will serve as a final notice of ineligibility.
    (ii) Form I-694, Notice of Appeal, in triplicate, shall be used to 
file the appeal, and must be accompanied by the appropriate fee. Form I-
694 shall be furnished with the notice of denial at the time of service 
on the alien.
    (iii) Upon receipt of an appeal, the administrative record will be 
forwarded to the Administrative Appeals Unit as provided by 
Sec. 103.1(f)(2) of this part for review and decision. The decision on 
the appeal shall be in writing, and if the appeal is dismissed, shall 
include a final notice of ineligibility. A copy of the decision shall be 
served upon the applicant and his or her attorney or representative of 
record. No further administrative appeal shall lie from this decision, 
nor may the application be filed or reopened before an immigration judge 
or the Board of Immigration Appeals during exclusion or deportation 
proceedings.
    (iv) Any appeal which is filed that:
    (A) Fails to state the reason for appeal;
    (B) Is filed solely on the basis of a denial for failure to file the 
application for adjustment of status under section 210 or 245A in a 
timely manner; or
    (C) Is patently frivolous; will be summarily dismissed. An appeal 
received after the thirty (30) day period has tolled will not be 
accepted for processing.
    (4) Denials and appeal of Replenishment Agricultural Worker 
petitions and waivers and termination of lawful temporary resident 
status under section 210A. (i) Whenever a petition for Replenishment 
Agricultural Worker status, or a request for a waiver incident to such 
filing, is denied in accordance with the provisions of part 210a of this 
title, the alien shall be given written notice setting forth the 
specific reasons for the denial on Form I-692, Notice of Denial. Form I-
692 shall also contain advice to the alien that he or she may appeal the 
decision and that such appeal must be taken within thirty (30) days 
after service of the notification of decision accompanied by any 
additional new evidence, and a supporting brief if desired. The Form I-
692 shall additionally provide a notice to the alien that if he or she 
fails to file an appeal from the decision, the Form I-692 shall serve as 
a final notice of ineligibility.
    (ii) Form I-694, Notice of Appeal, in triplicate, shall be used to 
file the appeal, and must be accompanied by the appropriate fee. Form I-
694 shall be furnished with the notice of denial at the time of service 
on the alien.
    (iii) Upon receipt of an appeal, the administrative record will be 
forwarded to the Administrative Appeals Unit as provided by 
Sec. 103.1(f)(2) of this part for review and decision. The decision on 
the appeal shall be in writing, and if the appeal is dismissed, shall 
include a final notice of ineligibility. A copy of the decision shall be 
served upon the petitioner and his or her attorney or representative of 
record. No further administrative appeal shall lie from this decision, 
nor may the petition be filed or reopened before an immigration judge or 
the Board of Immigration Appeals during exclusion or deportation 
proceedings.

[[Page 80]]

    (iv) Any appeal which is filed that: Fails to state the reason for 
the appeal; is filed solely on the basis of a denial for failure to file 
the petition for adjustment of status under part 210a of this title in a 
timely manner; or is patently frivolous, will be summarily dismissed. An 
appeal received after the thirty (30) day period has tolled will not be 
accepted for processing.
    (b) Oral argument regarding appeal before AAU--(1) Request. If the 
affected party desires oral argument, the affected party must explain in 
writing specifically why oral argument is necessary. For such a request 
to be considered, it must be submitted within the time allowed for 
meeting other requirements.
    (2) Decision about oral argument. The Service has sole authority to 
grant or deny a request for oral argument. Upon approval of a request 
for oral argument, the AAU shall set the time, date, place, and 
conditions of oral argument.
    (c) Service precedent decisions. In addition to Attorney General and 
Board decisions referred to in Sec. 3.1(g) of this chapter, designated 
Service decisions are to serve as precedents in all proceedings 
involving the same issue(s). Except as these decisions may be modified 
or overruled by later precedent decisions, they are binding on all 
Service employees in the administration of the Act. Precedent decisions 
must be published and made available to the public as described in 
Sec. 103.9(a) of this part.

Sec. 103.4  Certifications.

    (a) Certification of other than special agricultural worker and 
legalization cases--(1) General. The Commissioner or the Commissioner's 
delegate may direct that any case or class of cases be certified to 
another Service official for decision. In addition, regional 
commissioners, regional service center directors, district directors, 
officers in charge in districts 33 (Bangkok, Thailand), 35 (Mexico City, 
Mexico), and 37 (Rome, Italy), and the Director, National Fines Office, 
may certify their decisions to the appropriate appellate authority (as 
designated in this chapter) when the case involves an unusually complex 
or novel issue of law or fact.
    (2) Notice to affected party. When a case is certified to a Service 
officer, the official certifying the case shall notify the affected 
party using a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C). The affected party 
may submit a brief to the officer to whom the case is certified within 
30 days after service of the notice. If the affected party does not wish 
to submit a brief, the affected party may waive the 30-day period.
    (3) Favorable action. The Service officer to whom a case is 
certified may suspend the 30-day period for submission of a brief if 
that officer takes action favorable to the affected party.
    (4) Initial decision. A case within the appellate jurisdiction of 
the Associate Commissioner, Examinations, or for which there is no 
appeal procedure may be certified only after an initial decision is 
made.
    (5) Certification to AAU. A case described in paragraph (a)(4) of

Sec. 103.5  Reopening or reconsideration.

    (a) Motions to reopen or reconsider in other than special 
agricultural worker and legalization cases--(1) When filed by affected 
party--(i) General. Except where the Board has jurisdiction and as 
otherwise provided in 8 CFR parts 3, 210, 242 and 245a, when the 
affected party files a motion, the official having jurisdiction may, for 
proper cause shown, reopen the proceeding or reconsider the prior 
decision. Motions to reopen or reconsider are not applicable to 
proceedings described in Sec. 274a.9 of this chapter. Any motion to 
reconsider an action by the Service filed by an applicant or petitioner 
must be filed within 30 days of the decision that the motion seeks to 
reconsider. Any motion to reopen a proceeding before the Service filed 
by an applicant or petitioner, must be filed within 30 days of the 
decision that the motion seeks to reopen, except that failure to file 
before this period expires, may be excused in the discretion of the 
Service where it is demonstrated that the delay was reasonable and was 
beyond the control of the applicant or petitioner.
    (ii) Jurisdiction. The official having jurisdiction is the official 
who made the latest decision in the proceeding unless the affected party 
moves to a new jurisdiction. In that instance, the new official having 
jurisdiction is the official over such a proceeding in the new 
geographical locations.
    (iii) Filing Requirements-- A motion shall be submitted on Form I-
290A, and may be accompanied by a brief. It must be--
    (A) In writing and signed by the affected party or the attorney or 
representative of record, if any;
    (B) Accompanied by a nonrefundable fee as set forth in Sec. 103.7;
    (C) Accompanied by a statement about whether or not the validity of 
the unfavorable decision has been or is the subject of any judicial 
proceeding and, if so, the court, nature, date, and status or result of 
the proceeding;
    (D) Addressed to the official having jurisdiction; and
    (E) Submitted to the office maintaining the record upon which the 
unfavorable decision was made for forwarding to the official having 
jurisdiction.
    (iv) Effect of motion or subsequent application or petition. Unless 
the Service directs otherwise, the filing of a motion to reopen or 
reconsider or of a subsequent application or petition does not stay the 
execution of any decision in a case or extend a previously set departure 
date.
    (2) Requirements for motion to reopen. A motion to reopen must state 
the new facts to be provided in the reopened proceeding and be supported 
by affidavits or other documentary evidence. A motion to reopen an 
application or petition denied due to abandonment must be filed with 
evidence that the decision was in error because:
    (i) The requested evidence was not material to the issue of 
eligibility;
    (ii) The required initial evidence was submitted with the 
application or petition, or the request for initial evidence or 
additional information or appearance was complied with during the 
allotted period; or
    (iii) The request for additional information or appearance was sent 
to an address other than that on the application, petition, or notice of 
representation, or that the applicant or petitioner advised the Service, 
in writing, of a change of address or change of representation 
subsequent to filing and before the Service's request was sent, and the 
request did not go to the new address.
    (3) Requirements for motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider 
must state the reasons for reconsideration and be supported by any 
pertinent precedent decisions to establish that the decision was based 
on an incorrect application of law or Service policy. A motion to 
reconsider a decision on an application or petition must, when filed, 
also establish that the decision was incorrect based on the evidence of 
record at the time of the initial decision.
    (4) Processing motions in proceedings before the Service. A motion 
that does not meet applicable requirements shall be dismissed. Where a 
motion to reopen is granted, the proceeding shall be reopened. The 
notice and any favorable decision may be combined.
    (5) Motion by Service officer--(i) Service motion with decision 
favorable to affected party. When a Service officer, on his or

[[Page 82]]

her own motion, reopens a Service proceeding or reconsiders a Service 
decision in order to make a new decision favorable to the affected 
party, the Service officer shall combine the motion and the favorable 
decision in one action.
    (ii) Service motion with decision that may be unfavorable to 
affected party. When a Service officer, on his or her own motion, 
reopens a Service proceeding or reconsiders a Service decision, and the 
new decision may be unfavorable to the affected party, the officer shall 
give the affected party 30 days after service of the motion to submit a 
brief. The officer may extend the time period for good cause shown. If 
the affected party does not wish to submit a brief, the affected party 
may waive the 30-day period.
    (6) Appeal to AAU from Service decision made as a result of a 
motion. A field office decision made as a result of a motion may be 
applied to the AAU only if the original decision was appealable to the 
AAU.
    (7) Other applicable provisions. The provisions of 
Sec. 103.3(a)(2)(x) of this part also apply to decisions on motions. The 
provisions of Sec. 103.3(b) of this part also apply to requests for oral 
argument regarding motions considered by the AAU.
    (8) Treating an appeal as a motion. The official who denied an 
application or petition may treat the appeal from that decision as a 
motion for the purpose of granting the motion.
    (b) Motions to reopen or reconsider denials of special agricultural 
worker and legalization applications. Upon the filing of an appeal to 
the Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit), 
the Director of a Regional Processing Facility or the consular officer 
at an Overseas Processing Office may sua sponte reopen any proceeding 
under his or her jurisdiction opened under part 210 or 245a of this 
chapter and may reconsider any decision rendered in such proceeding. The 
new decision must be served on the appellant within 45 days of receipt 
of any brief and/or new evidence, or upon expiration of the time allowed 
for the submission of a brief. The Associate Commissioner, Examinations, 
or the Chief of the Administrative Appeals Unit may sua sponte reopen 
any proceeding conducted by that Unit under part 210 or 245a of this 
chapter and reconsider any decision rendered in such proceeding. Motions 
to reopen a proceeding or reconsider a decision under part 210 or 245a 
of this chapter shall not be considered.
    (c) Motions to reopen or reconsider decisions on replenishment 
agricultural worker petitions. (1) The director of a regional processing 
facility may sua sponte reopen any proceeding under part 210a of this 
title which is within his or her jurisdiction and may render a new 
decision. This decision may reverse a prior favorable decision when it 
is determined that there was fraud during the registration or petition 
processes and the petitioner was not entitled to the status granted. The 
petitioner must be given an opportunity to offer evidence in support of 
the petition and in opposition to the grounds for reopening the petition 
before a new decision is rendered.
    (2) The Associate Commissioner, Examinations or the Chief of the 
Administrative Appeals Unit may sua sponte reopen any proceeding 
conducted by that unit under part 210a of this title and reconsider any 
decision rendered in such proceeding.
    (3) Motions to reopen a proceeding or reconsider a decision under 
part 210a of this title shall not be considered.

chapter.
    (a) Definitions--(1) Routine service. Routine service consists of

Sec. 103.6  Surety bonds.

    (a) Posting of surety bonds--(1) Extension agreements; consent of 
surety; collateral security. All surety bonds posted in immigration 
cases shall be executed on Form I-352, Immigration Bond, a copy of 
which, and any rider attached thereto, shall be furnished the obligor. A

[[Page 84]]

district director is authorized to approve a bond, a formal agreement to 
extension of liability of surety, a request for delivery of collateral 
security to a duly appointed and undischarged administrator or executor 
of the estate of a deceased depositor, and a power of attorney executed 
on Form I-312, Designation of Attorney in Fact. All other matters 
relating to bonds, including a power of attorney not executed on Form I-
312 and a request for delivery of collateral security to other than the 
depositor or his or her approved attorney in fact, shall be forwarded to 
the regional director for approval.
    (2) Bond riders--(i) General. Bond riders shall be prepared on Form 
I-351, Bond Riders, and attached to Form I-352. If a condition to be 
included in a bond is not on Form I-351, a rider containing the 
condition shall be executed.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (b) Acceptable sureties. Either a company holding a certificate from 
the Secretary of the Treasury under 6 U.S.C. 6-13 as an acceptable 
surety on Federal bonds, or a surety who deposits cash or U.S. bonds or 
notes of the class described in 6 U.S.C. 15 and Treasury Department 
regulations issued pursuant thereto and which are not redeemable within 
1 year from the date they are offered for deposit is an acceptable 
surety.
    (c) Cancellation--(1) Public charge bonds. A public charge bond 
posted for an immigrant shall be cancelled when the alien dies, departs 
permanently from the United States or is naturalized, provided the 
immigrant did not become a public charge prior to death, departure, or 
naturalization. The district director may cancel a public charge bond at 
any time if he/she finds that the immigrant is not likely to become a 
public charge. A bond may also be cancelled in order to allow 
substitution of another bond. A public charge bond shall be cancelled by 
the district director upon review following the fifth anniversity of the 
admission of the immigrant, provided that the alien has filed Form I-
356, Request for Cancellation of Public Charge Bond, and the district 
director finds that the immigrant did not become a public charge prior 
to the fifth anniversary. If Form I-356 is not filed, the bond shall 
remain in effect until the form is filed and the district director 
reviews the evidence supporting the form and renders a decision to 
breach or cancel the bond.
    (2) Maintenance of status and departure bonds. When the status of a 
nonimmigrant who has violated the conditions of his admission has been 
adjusted as a result of administrative or legislative action to that of 
a permanent resident retroactively to a date prior to the violation, any 
outstanding maintenance of status and departure bond shall be canceled. 
If an application for adjustment of status is made by a nonimmigrant 
while he is in lawful temporary status, the bond shall be canceled if 
his status is adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident or if he 
voluntarily departs within any period granted to him. As used in this 
paragraph, the term lawful temporary status means that there must not 
have been a violation of any of the conditions of the alien's 
nonimmigrant classification by acceptance of unauthorized employment or 
otherwise during the time he has been accorded such classification, and 
that from the date of admission to the date of departure or adjustment 
of status he must have had uninterrupted Service approval of his 
presence in the United States in the form of regular extensions of stay 
or dates set by which departure is to occur, or a combination of both. 
An alien admitted as a nonimmigrant shall not be regarded as having 
violated his nonimmigrant status by engaging in employment subsequent to 
his proper filing of an application for adjustment of status under 
section 245 of the Act and part 245 of this chapter. A maintenance of 
status and departure bond posted at the request of an American consular 
officer abroad in behalf of an alien who did not travel to the United 
States shall be canceled upon receipt of notice from an American 
consular officer that the alien is outside the United States and the 
nonimmigrant visa issued pursuant to the posting of the bond has been 
canceled or has expired.
    (3) Substantial performance. Substantial performance of all 
conditions imposed by the terms of a bond shall release the obligor from 
liability.

[[Page 85]]

    (d) Bond schedules--(1) Blanketbonds for departure of visitors and 
transits. The amount of bond required for various numbers of 
nonimmigrant visitors or transits admitted under bond on Forms I-352 
shall be in accordance with the following schedule:

                                 Aliens

1 to 4--$500 each.
5 to 9--$2,500 total bond.
10 to 24--$3,500 total bond.
25 to 49--$5,000 total bond.
50 to 74--$6,000 total bond.
75 to 99--$7,000 total bond.
100 to 124--$8,000 total bond.
125 to 149--$9,000 total bond.
150 to 199--$10,000 total bond.
200 or more--$10,000 plus $50 for each alien over 200.

    (2) Blanket bonds for importation of workers classified as 
nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H). The following schedule shall 
be employed by district directors when requiring employers or their 
agents or representatives to post bond as a condition to importing alien 
laborers into the United States from the West Indies, the British Virgin 
Islands, or from Canada:

Less than 500 workers--$15 each
500 to 1,000 workers--$10 each
1,000 or more workers--$5 each


A bond shall not be posted for less than $1,000 or for more than $12,000 
irrespective of the number of workers involved. Failure to comply with 
conditions of the bond will result in the employer's liability in the 
amount of $200 as liquidated damages for each alien involved.
    (e) Breach of bond. A bond is breached when there has been a 
substantial violation of the stipulated conditions. A final 
determination that a bond has been breached creates a claim in favor of 
the United States which may not be released or discharged by a Service 
officer. The district director having custody of the file containing the 
immigration bond executed on Form I-352 shall determine whether the bond 
shall be declared breached or cancelled, and shall notify the obligor on 
Form I-323 or Form I-391 of the decision, and, if declared breached, of 
the reasons therefor, and of the right to appeal in accordance with the 
provisions of this part.

regulations under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. These

or affording the opportunity for an in-person review of the original 
record or a copy thereof. The determination to permit an in-person

the

[[Page 91]]

requested records that are nonexempt in lieu of the in-person review.
    (b) The term decision means a final written determination in a 
proceeding under the Act accompanied by a statement of reasons. Orders 
made by check marks, stamps, or brief endorsements which are not 
supported by a reasoned explanation, or those incorporating preprinted 
language on Service forms are not decisions.

reports, and other papers maintained by the Service.
    (d) The term record of proceeding is the official history of any 
hearing, examination, or proceeding before the Service, and in addition

<R05>
Sec. 103.10  Requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act.

    (a) Place and manner of requesting records--(1) Place. Records 
should be requested from the office that maintains the records sought, 
if known, or from the Headquarters of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536.

[[Page 92]]

Records are maintained in the Headquarters, regional offices, service 
centers, district offices and the following suboffices: Agana, Guam; 
Albany, NY; Charlotte, NC; Cincinnati, OH; Hartford, CT; Indianapolis, 
IN; Las Vegas, NV; Louisville, KY; Memphis, TN; Milwaukee, WI; Norfolk, 
VA; Pittsburgh, PA; Providence, RI; Reno, NV; St. Louis, MO; Salt Lake 
City, UT; Spokane, WA; and St. Albans, VT. In certain cases, a district 
director may designate another Service office as a file control office. 
For locations of the Service's regional offices, service centers, 
district offices, and sub-offices see 8 CFR 100.4.
    (2) Manner of requesting records. All Freedom of Information Act 
requests must be in writing. Requests may be submitted in person or by 
mail. If a request is made by mail, both the envelope and its contents 
must be clearly marked: ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST'' or 
``INFORMATION REQUEST.'' Any request for information not marked and 
addressed as specified will be so marked by Service personnel as soon as 
it is properly identified and shall be forwarded immediately to the 
appropriate office designated to control Freedom of Information Act 
requests. A request will not be deemed to have been received for 
purposes of the time period under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) until the request 
has been received by the appropriate office, or would have been received 
with the exercise of due diligence by Service personnel. Service Form G-
639, Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Request, may be used for rapid 
identification as a Freedom of Information matter and to ensure 
expeditous handling; however, a request may be submitted in any written 
form. Each request made under this section pertaining to the 
availability of a record must describe the record with sufficient 
specificity with respect to names, dates, subject matter and location to 
permit it to be identified and located. A request for all records 
falling within a reasonably specific category shall be regarded as 
reasonably described if the description enables the records to be 
identified by any process not unreasonably burdensome. If it is 
determined that the request does not reasonably describe the records 
sought, the response rejecting the request on that ground shall specify 
the reason why the request failed to meet requirements and shall extend 
to the requester an opportunity to confer with Service personnel to 
reformulate the request. Individuals seeking access to records about 
themselves by mail shall establish their identity by submitting a 
notarized signature along with their address, date of birth, place of 
birth, and alien or employee identification number if applicable.
    (b) Authority to grant and deny requests--(1) Grant or deny. The 
Associate Commissioner for Information Resources Management, regional 
administrators, district directors, service center directors, and heads 
of suboffices specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or their 
designees, may grant or deny requests under exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 552 
(b) and (c).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Authority to state that a record cannot be located or does not 
exist. The head of any office specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section has authority to notify a requester that a record cannot be 
located from the information supplied, or is known to have been 
destroyed or otherwise disposed of.
    (c) Prompt response--(1) Response within 10 days. Within 10 days 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) of the receipt of a 
request by the Service (or in the case of an improperly addressed 
request, of its receipt by the appropriate office as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section), the authorized Service official shall 
either comply with or deny the request unless an extension of time is 
requested as required under 28 CFR 16.1(d). A request improperly 
addressed will not be deemed to have been received for purposes of 5 
U.S.C 552 (a)(6) until it has been or would have been received by the 
appropriate office with the exercise of due diligence by Service 
personnel.
    (2) Treatment of delay as a denial. If no substantive reply is made 
at the end of the 10 working day period, and any properly invoked 
extension period, requesters may deem their request to be denied and 
exercise their right to appeal in accordance with 28 CFR 16.8 and 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

[[Page 93]]

    (d) Disposition of requests--(1) Form of grant. When a requested 
record is available, the responsible office shall notify the requester 
when and where the record will be available. The notification shall also 
advise the requester of any applicable fees under 28 CFR 16.10. The 
Service shall have fulfilled its duty to grant access whenever it 
provides a copy of the record, or, at its discretion, makes the original 
record or a copy available for in-person review in response to an 
express request for such review. In-person review is discretionary and 
shall not be granted when doing so would unreasonably disrupt the normal 
operations of a Service office.
    (2) Form of denial. A reply denying a written request for a record 
in whole or in part shall be in writing, signed by one of the officials 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The reply shall include a 
reference to the specific exemption under the Freedom of Information Act 
authorizing withholding of the records. The notice of denial shall 
contain a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record 
withheld and, if the deciding official considers it appropriate, a 
statement of why the exempt record is being withheld. The notice of

principle place of business, or the district in which the agency records 
are situated, or the District of Columbia.
    (3) Right of appeal. When a request for records has been denied in

Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Both the envelope and letter must be 
clearly marked: ``FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL'' or ``INFORMATION 
APPEAL.''
    (e) Agreement to pay fees. In accordance with 28 CFR 16.3(c) a 
requester automatically agrees to pay fees up to $25.00 by filing a 
Freedom of Information Act request unless a waiver or reduction of fees 
is sought. Accordingly, all letters of acknowledgment must confirm the 
requester's obligation to pay.

Sec. 103.20  Purpose and scope.

    (a) Sections 103.20 through 103.36 comprise the regulations of the 
Service implementing the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-597. The 
regulations apply to all records contained in systems of records 
maintained by the Service which are identifiable by individual name or 
identifier and which are retrieved by individual name or identifier, 
except those personnel records governed by regulations of the Office of 
Personnel Management. The regulations set forth the procedures by which 
individuals may seek access to records pertaining to themselves and 
request correction of those records. The regulations also set forth the 
requirements applicable to Service employees maintaining, collecting, 
using or disseminating such records.
    (b) The Associate Commissioner, Information Systems, shall ensure 
that the provisions of Secs. 103.20 through 103.36 of this title and 28 
CFR 16.40 through 16.58, and any revisions, are brought to the attention 
of and made available to:
    (1) Each employee at the time of issuance of the regulations and at 
the time of any amendments; and
    (2) Each new employee at the time of employment.
    (c) The Associate Commissioner, Information Systems, shall be 
responsible for ensuring that employees of the Service are trained in 
the obligations imposed by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C 522a) and by 
these regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 103.21  Access by individuals to records maintained about them.

    (a) Access to available records. An individual who seeks access to 
records about himself or herself in a system of records must submit a 
written request in person or by mail to the Freedom of Information/
Privacy Act Officer at the location where the records are maintained. If 
the location is unknown, the request may be submitted to the nearest 
Service office or to the Headquarters FOIA/PA Officer, 425 I Street, 
NW., Washington, DC 20536. The outside of the envelope should be marked 
``Privacy Act Request.'' A Form G-639, Freedom of Information/Privacy 
Act Request may be used for convenience and to facilitate identification 
of the record requested. However, a request may be made in any written 
form and should clearly identity the record sought by the name and any 
other personal identifiers for the individual (such as the alien file 
number or Social Security Account Number), date and place of birth, and 
type of file in which the record is believed to be located.
    (b) Verification of identity. The following standards are applicable 
to any individual who requests records concerning himself, unless other 
provisions for identity verification are specified in

[[Page 95]]

the published notice pertaining to the particular system of records.
    (1) An individual seeking access to records about himself in person 
shall establish his identity by the presentation of a single document 
bearing a photograph (such as a passport, Permanent Resident Card or 
identification badge) or by the presentation of two items of 
identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear both a name 
and address (such as a driver's license, or credit card).
    (2) Individuals seeking access to records about themselves by mail 
shall establish their identify by submitting a notarized signature along 
with their address, date of birth, place of birth, and alien or employee 
identification number if applicable. Form DOJ 361, Certification of 
Identity, may be obtained from any Service office and used to obtain the 
notarized signature needed to verify identity.
    (c) Verification of guardianship. The parent or guardian of a child 
or of a person judicially determined to be incompetent and seeking to 
act on behalf of such child or incompetent, shall, in addition to 
establishing his own identity, establish the identity of the child or 
other person he represents as required in paragraph (b) of this section, 
and establish his own parentage or guardianship of the subject of the 
record by furnishing either a copy of a birth certificate showing 
parentage or a court order establishing the guardianship.
    (d) Accompanying persons. An individual seeking to review records 
pertaining to himself may be accompanied by another individual of his 
own choosing. Both the individual seeking access and the individual 
accompanying him shall be required to sign the required form indicating 
that the Service is authorized to discuss the contents of the subject 
record in the presence of both individuals.
    (e) Specification of records sought. Requests for access to records, 
either in person or by mail, shall describe the nature of the records 
sought, the approximate dates covered by the record, the system in which 
it is thought to be included as described in the ``Notice of Systems of 
Records'' published in the Federal Register, and the identity of the 
individual or office of the Service having custody of the system of 
records. In addition, the published ``Notice of Systems of Records'' for 
individual systems may include further requirements of specification, 
where necessary, to retrieve the individual record from the system.
    (f) Agreement to pay fees. In accordance with 28 CFR 16.3(c) a 
requester automatically agrees to pay fees up to $25.00 by filing a 
Privacy Act request unless a waiver or reduction of fees is sought. 
Accordingly, all letters of acknowledgement must confirm the requester's 
obligation to pay.

Sec. 103.22  Records exempt in whole or in part.

    (a) When individuals request records about themselves which are 
exempt from access pursuant to the Privacy Act exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 
552a(d)(5), (j) or (k), their requests shall also be considered under 
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and, unless the records 
are exempt under both Acts, the request shall be granted. If exemptions 
under both Acts permit the denial of the records sought and there is 
good reason to invoke the exemptions, the individual shall be provided a 
denial of his/her request in writing with the governing exemptions 
cited. If the disclosure of the existence of a criminal law enforcement 
proceeding record could itself interfere with a pending law enforcement 
proceeding of which there is reason to believe the subject is unaware, 
the Service may, during only such time as the circumstance continues, 
treat the records as not subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552.
    (b) Individual requests for access to records which have been 
exempted from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) shall be processed as 
follows:
    (1) A request for information classified by the Service under 
Executive

[[Page 96]]

Order 12356 on National Security Information requires the Service to 
review the information to determine whether it continues to warrant 
classification under the criteria of the Executive Order. Information 
which no longer warrants classification shall be declassified and made 
available to the individual, if not otherwise exempt. If the information 
continues to warrant classification, the individual shall be advised 
that the information sought is classified; that it has been reviewed and 
continues to warrant classification; and that it has been exempted from 
access under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). Information which has been exempted 
under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and which is also classified, shall be reviewed 
as required by this paragraph but the response to the individual shall 
be in the form prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) Requests for information which has been exempted from disclosure 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) shall be responded to in the manner 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section unless a review of the 
information indicates that the information has been used or is being 
used to deny the individual any right, privilege or benefit for which he 
is eligible or to which he would otherwise be entitled under Federal 
law. In that event, the individual shall be advised of the existence of 
the record and shall be provided the information except to the extent it 
would identify a confidential source. If and only if information 
identifying a confidential source can be deleted or the pertinent parts 
of the record summarized in a manner which protects the identity of the 
confidential source, the document with deletions made or the summary 
shall be furnished to the requester.
    (3) Information compiled as part of an employee background 
investigation which has been exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) 
shall be made available to an individual upon request except to the 
extent that it identifies a confidential source. If and only if 
information identifying a confidential source can be deleted or the 
pertinent parts of the record summarized in a manner which protects the 
identity of the confidential source, the document with deletions made or 
the summary shall be furnished to the requester.
    (4) Testing or examination material which has been exempted pursuant 
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) shall not be made available to an individual if 
disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing 
or examination process but shall be made available if no such compromise 
possibility exists.
    (5) The Service records which are exempted and the reasons for the 
exemptions are enumerated in 28 CFR 16.99.

Sec. 103.23  Special access procedures.

    (a) Records of other agencies. When information sought from a system 
of records of the Service includes information from other agencies or 
components of the Department of Justice that has been classified under 
Executive Order 12356, the request and the requested documents shall be 
referred to the appropriate agency or other component for classification 
review and processing. Only with the consent of the responsible agency 
or component, may the requester be informed of the referral as specified 
in section 3.4(f) of E.O. 12356.
    (b) Medical records. When an individual requests medical records 
concerning himself, which are not otherwise exempt from disclosure, the 
responsible official as specified in Sec. 103.10(a) of this part shall, 
if deemed necessary, advise the individual that records will be provided 
only to a physician designated in writing by the individual. Upon 
receipt of the designation, the responsible official as specified in 
Sec. 103.10(a) of this part will permit the physician to review the 
records or to receive copies of the records by mail, upon proper 
verification of identity. The determination of which records should be 
made available directly to the individual and which records should not 
be disclosed because of possible harm to the individual shall be made by 
the physician.

record outside the Department of Justice. Requests for accounting shall 
be directed to the appropriate responsible official as specified in 
Sec. 103.10(a) of this part listed in the ``Notice of Systems of 
Records''. Any available accounting, whether kept in accordance with the 
requirements of the Privacy Act or under procedures established prior to

    (a) How made. A request for amendment or correction is made by the 
individual concerned, either in person or by mail, by addressing the 
written request to the FOIA/PA Officer at the location where the record 
is maintained. The requester's identity must be established as provided

Washington, DC 20536. That officer will assist the requester in 
identifying the location of the records.
    (b) Initial determination. Within 10 working days of the receipt of

that the request has been received. If a correction is to be made, the 
requester shall be advised of the right to obtain a copy of the

Sec. 204.1  General information about immediate relative and family-sponsored petitions.

    (a) Types of petitions. Petitions may be filed for an alien's 
classification as an immediate relative under section 201(b) of the Act 
or as a preference immigrant under section 203(a) of the Act based on a 
qualifying relationship to a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the 
United States, as follows:
    (1) A citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States 
petitioning under section 204(a)(1)(A)(i) or 204(a)(1)(B)(i) of the Act 
for a qualifying relative's classification as an immediate relative 
under section 201(b) of the Act or as a preference immigrant under 
section 203(a) of the Act must file a Form I-130, Petition for Alien 
Relative. These petitions are described in Sec. 204.2;
    (2) A widow or widower of a United States citizen self-petitioning 
under section 204(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act as an immediate relative under 
section 201(b) of the Act must file a Form I-360, Petition for 
Amerasian, Widow, or Special Immigrant. These petitions are described in 
Sec. 204.2;
    (3) A spouse or child of an abusive citizen or lawful permanent 
resident of the United States self-petitioning under section 
204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or

[[Page 100]]

204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act for classification as an immediate relative 
under section 201(b) of the Act or as a preference immigrant under 
section 203(a) of the Act must file a Form I-360, Petition for 
Amerasian, Widow, or Special Immigrant. These petitions are described in 
Sec. 204.2;
    (4) A citizen of the United States seeking advanced processing of an 
orphan petition must file Form I-600A, Application for Advanced 
Processing of Orphan Petition. A citizen of the United States 
petitioning under section 204(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act for classification 
of an orphan described in section 101(b)(1)(F) of the Act as an 
immediate relative under section 201(b) of the Act must file Form I-600, 
Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative. These applications 
and petitions are described in Sec. 204.3; and
    (5) Any person filing a petition under section 204(f) of the Act as, 
or on behalf of, an Amerasian for classification as an immediate 
relative under section 201(b) of the Act or as a preference immigrant 
under section 203(a)(1) or 203(a)(3) of the Act must file a Form I-360, 
Petition for Amerasian, Widow, or Special Immigrant. These petitions are 
described in Sec. 204.4.
    (b) Filing fee. Forms I-130 and I-360 must be accompanied by the 
appropriate fee under 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1).
    (c) Filing date. The filing date of a petition shall be the date it 
is properly filed under paragraph (d) of this section and shall 
constitute the priority date.
    (d) Proper filing. A petition shall be considered properly filed if:
    (1) It is signed by the petitioner, and
    (2) A fee has been received by the Service office or United States 
Consular office having jurisdiction.
    (3) If, during normal processing, a delay results from deficiencies 
in the initial filing, the priority date will be established only when 
the petition is properly signed by the petitioner and the fee has been 
collected by the Service. If questions arise concerning the filing of 
the petition which cannot be resolved through a check of the Service fee 
receipting system (FARES) or other fee collection system, then the 
director may consider the date of receipt of the petition to be the 
priority date.
    (e) Jurisdiction--(1) Petitioner or self-petitioner residing in the 
United States. The petition or self-petition must be filed with the 
Service office having jurisdiction over the place where the petitioner 
or self-petitioner is residing. When the petition or self-petition is 
accompanied by an application for adjustment of status, the petition or 
self-petition may be filed with the Service office having jurisdiction 
over the beneficiary's or self-petitioner's place of residence.
    (2) Petitioner residing in certain countries abroad. The Service has 
overseas offices located in Vienna, Austria; Frankfurt, Germany; Athens, 
Greece; Hong Kong; New Delhi, India; Rome, Italy; Nairobi, Kenya; Seoul, 
Korea; Ciudad Juarez, Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Tijuana, 
Mexico; Manila, the Philippines; Singapore; Bangkok, Thailand; and 
London, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. If the 
petitioner resides in one of these countries, the petition must be filed 
with the Service office located in that country. The beneficiary does 
not have to reside in the same jurisdiction as the petitioner for the 
Service to accept the petition. The overseas Service officer may accept 
and adjudicate a petition filed by a petitioner who does not reside 
within the office's jurisdiction when it is established that emergent or 
humanitarian reasons for acceptance exist or when it is in the national 
interest. An overseas Service officer may not accept or approve a self-
petition filed by the spouse or child of an abusive citizen or lawful 
permanent resident of the United States under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 
204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act. 
These self-petitions must be filed with the Service office in the United 
States having jurisdiction over the self-petitioner's place of residence 
in the United States.
    (3) Jurisdiction assumed by United States consular officer. United 
States consular officers assigned to visa-issuing posts abroad, except 
those in countries listed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, are 
authorized to accept and approve a relative petition or a petition filed 
by a widow or widower if the petitioner resides in the area over

[[Page 101]]

which the post has jurisdiction, regardless of the beneficiary's 
residence or physical presence at the time of filing. In emergent or 
humanitarian cases and cases in the national interest, the United States 
consular officer may accept a petition filed by a petitioner who does 
not reside within the consulate's jurisdiction. While consular officers 
are authorized to approve petitions, they must refer any petition which 
is not clearly approvable to the appropriate Service office. Consular 
officers may consult with the appropriate Service office abroad prior to 
stateside referral, if they deem it necessary. A consular official may 
not accept or approve a self-petition filed by the spouse or child of an 
abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States under 
section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or 
204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act. These self-petitions must be filed with 
the Service office in the United States having jurisdiction over the 
self-petitioner's place of residence in the United States.
    (f) Supporting documentation. (1) Documentary evidence consists of 
those documents which establish the United States citizenship or lawful 
permanent resident status of the petitioner and the claimed relationship 
of the petitioner to the beneficiary. They must be in the form of 
primary evidence, if available. When it is established that primary 
evidence is not available, secondary evidence may be accepted. To 
determine the availability of primary documents, the Service will refer 
to the Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM). When the FAM 
shows that primary documents are generally available in the country of 
issue but the petitioner claims that his or her document is unavailable, 
a letter from the appropriate registrar stating that the document is not 
available will not be required before the Service will accept secondary 
evidence. The Service will consider any credible evidence relevant to a 
self-petition filed by a qualified spouse or child of an abusive citizen 
or lawful permanent resident under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 
204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act. The 
self-petitioner may, but is not required to, demonstrate that preferred 
primary or secondary evidence is unavailable. The determination of what 
evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be 
within the sole discretion of the Service.
    (2) Original documents or legible, true copies of original documents 
are acceptable. The Service reserves the right to require submission of 
original documents when deemed necessary. Documents submitted with the 
petition will not be returned to the petitioner, except when originals 
are requested by the Service. If original documents are requested by the 
Service, they will be returned to the petitioner after a decision on the 
petition has been rendered, unless their validity or authenticity is in 
question. When an interview is required, all original documents must be 
presented for examination at the interview.
    (3) Foreign language documents must be accompanied by an English 
translation which has been certified by a competent translator.
    (g) Evidence of petitioner's United States citizenship or lawful 
permanent residence--(1) Primary evidence. A petition must be 
accompanied by one of the following:
    (i) A birth certificate that was issued by a civil authority and 
that establishes the petitioner's birth in the United States;
    (ii) An unexpired United States passport issued initially for a full 
ten-year period to a petitioner over the age of eighteen years as a 
citizen of the United States (and not merely as a noncitizen national);
    (iii) An unexpired United States passport issued initially for a 
full five-year period to the petitioner under the age of eighteen years 
as a citizen of the United States (and not merely as a noncitizen 
national);
    (iv) A statement executed by a United States consular officer 
certifying the petitioner to be a United States citizen and the bearer 
of a currently valid United States passport;
    (v) The petitioner's Certificate of Naturalization or Certificate of 
Citizenship;
    (vi) Department of State Form FS-240, Report of Birth Abroad of a 
Citizen of the United States, relating to the petitioner;

[[Page 102]]

    (vii) The petitioner's Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card, or other 
proof given by the Service as evidence of lawful permanent residence. 
Photocopies of Form I-551 or of a Certificate of Naturalization or 
Certificate of Citizenship may be submitted as evidence of status as a 
lawfully permanent resident or United States citizen, respectively.
    (2) Secondary evidence. If primary evidence is unavailable, the 
petitioner must present secondary evidence. Any evidence submitted as 
secondary evidence will be evaluated for authenticity and credibility. 
Secondary evidence may include, but is not limited to, one or more of 
the following documents:
    (i) A baptismal certificate with the seal of the church, showing the 
date and place of birth in the United States and the date of baptism;
    (ii) Affidavits sworn to by persons who were living at the time and 
who have personal knowledge of the event to which they attest. The 
affidavits must contain the affiant's full name and address, date and 
place of birth, relationship to the parties, if any, and complete 
details concerning how the affiant acquired knowledge of the event;
    (iii) Early school records (preferably from the first school) 
showing the date of admission to the school, the child's date and place 
of birth, and the name(s) and place(s) of birth of the parent(s);
    (iv) Census records showing the name, place of birth, and date of 
birth or age of the petitioner; or
    (v) If it is determined that it would cause unusual delay or 
hardship to obtain documentary proof of birth in the United States, a 
United States citizen petitioner who is a member of the Armed Forces of 
the United States and who is serving outside the United States may 
submit a statement from the appropriate authority of the Armed Forces. 
The statement should attest to the fact that the personnel records of 
the Armed Forces show that the petitioner was born in the United States 
on a certain date.
    (3) Evidence submitted with a self-petition. If a self-petitioner 
filing under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 
204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act is unable to present 
primary or secondary evidence of the abuser's status, the Service will 
attempt to electronically verify the abuser's citizenship or immigration 
status from information contained in Service computerized records. Other 
Service records may also be reviewed at the discretion of the 
adjudicating officer. If the Service is unable to identify a record as 
relating to the abuser or the record does not establish the abuser's 
immigration or citizenship status, the self-petition will be adjudicated 
based on the information submitted by the self-petitioner.
    (h) Requests for additional documentation. When the Service 
determines that the evidence is not sufficient, an explanation of the 
deficiency will be provided and additional evidence will be requested. 
The petitioner will be given 60 days to present additional evidence, to 
withdraw the petition, to request a decision based on the evidence 
submitted, or to request additional time to respond. If the director 
determines that the initial 60-day period is insufficient to permit the 
presentation of additional documents, the director may provide an 
additional 60 days for the submission. The total time shall not exceed 
120 days, unless unusual circumstances exist. Failure to respond to a 
request for additional evidence will result in a decision based on the 
evidence previously submitted.

phrase ``Alien Registration Receipt Card'' to read ``Permanent Resident 
Card'', effective Jan. 20, 1999.


<R05>
Sec. 204.2  Petitions for relatives, widows and widowers, and abused spouses and children.

    (a) Petition for a spouse--(1) Eligibility. A United States citizen 
or alien admitted for lawful permanent residence may file a petition on 
behalf of a spouse.
    (i) Marriage within five years of petitioner's obtaining lawful 
permanent resident status. (A) A visa petition filed on

[[Page 103]]

behalf of an alien by a lawful permanent resident spouse may not be 
approved if the marriage occurred within five years of the petitioner 
being accorded the status of lawful permanent resident based upon a 
prior marriage to a United States citizen or alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence, unless:
    (1) The petitioner establishes by clear and convincing evidence that 
the marriage through which the petitioner gained permanent residence was 
not entered into for the purposes of evading the immigration laws; or
    (2) The marriage through which the petitioner obtained permanent 
residence was terminated through death.
    (B) Documentation. The petitioner should submit documents which 
cover the period of the prior marriage. The types of documents which may 
establish that the prior marriage was not entered into for the purpose 
of evading the immigration laws include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Documentation showing joint ownership of property;
    (2) A lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;
    (3) Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;
    (4) Birth certificate(s) of child(ren) born to the petitioner and 
prior spouse;
    (5) Affidavits sworn to or affirmed by third parties having personal 
knowledge of the bona fides of the prior marital relationship. (Each 
affidavit must contain the full name and address, date and place of 
birth of the person making the affidavit; his or her relationship, if 
any, to the petitioner, beneficiary or prior spouse; and complete 
information and details explaining how the person acquired his or her 
knowledge of the prior marriage. The affiant may be required to testify 
before an immigration officer about the information contained in the 
affidavit. Affidavits should be supported, if possible, by one or more 
types of documentary evidence listed in this paragraph.); or
    (6) Any other documentation which is relevant to establish that the 
prior marriage was not entered into in order to evade the immigration 
laws of the United States.
    (C) The petitioner must establish by clear and convincing evidence 
that the prior marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading 
the immigration laws. Failure to meet the ``clear and convincing 
evidence'' standard will result in the denial of the petition. Such a 
denial shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new petition once 
the petitioner has acquired five years of lawful permanent residence. 
The director may choose to initiate deportation proceedings based upon 
information gained through the adjudication of the petition; however, 
failure to initiate such proceedings shall not establish that the 
petitioner's prior marriage was not entered into for the purpose of 
evading the immigration laws. Unless the petition is approved, the 
beneficiary shall not be accorded a filing date within the meaning of 
section 203(c) of the Act based upon any spousal second preference 
petition.
    (ii) Fraudulent marriage prohibition. Section 204(c) of the Act 
prohibits the approval of a visa petition filed on behalf of an alien 
who has attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for the purpose 
of evading the immigration laws. The director will deny a petition for 
immigrant visa classification filed on behalf of any alien for whom 
there is substantial and probative evidence of such an attempt or 
conspiracy, regardless of whether that alien received a benefit through 
the attempt or conspiracy. Although it is not necessary that the alien 
have been convicted of, or even prosecuted for, the attempt or 
conspiracy, the evidence of the attempt or conspiracy must be contained 
in the alien's file.
    (iii) Marriage during proceedings--general prohibition against 
approval of visa petition. A visa petition filed on behalf of an alien 
by a United States citizen or a lawful permanent resident spouse shall 
not be approved if the marriage creating the relationship occurred on or 
after November 10, 1986, and while the alien was in exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceedings, or judicial proceedings relating 
thereto. Determination of commencement and termination of proceedings 
and exemptions shall be in accordance with Sec. 245.1(c)(9) of this 
chapter, except that the burden in visa petition proceedings to 
establish eligibility for the exemption in

[[Page 104]]

Sec. 245.1(c)(9)(iii)(F) of this chapter shall rest with the petitioner.
    (A) Request for exemption. No application or fee is required to 
request an exemption. The request must be made in writing and submitted 
with the Form I-130. The request must state the reason for seeking the 
exemption and must be supported by documentary evidence establishing 
eligibility for the exemption.
    (B) Evidence to establish eligibility for the bona fide marriage 
exemption. The petitioner should submit documents which establish that 
the marriage was entered into in good faith and not entered into for the 
purpose of procuring the alien's entry as an immigrant. The types of 
documents the petitioner may submit include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Documentation showing joint ownership of property;
    (2) Lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;
    (3) Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;
    (4) Birth certificate(s) of child(ren) born to the petitioner and 
beneficiary;
    (5) Affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides 
of the marital relationship (Such persons may be required to testify 
before an immigration officer as to the information contained in the 
affidavit. Affidavits must be sworn to or affirmed by people who have 
personal knowledge of the marital relationship. Each affidavit must 
contain the full name and address, date and place of birth of the person 
making the affidavit and his or her relationship to the spouses, if any. 
The affidavit must contain complete information and details explaining 
how the person acquired his or her knowledge of the marriage. Affidavits 
should be supported, if possible, by one or more types of documentary 
evidence listed in this paragraph); or
    (6) Any other documentation which is relevant to establish that the 
marriage was not entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of 
the United States.
    (C) Decision. Any petition filed during the prohibited period shall 
be denied, unless the petitioner establishes eligibility for an 
exemption from the general prohibition. The petitioner shall be notified 
in writing of the decision of the director.
    (D) Denials. The denial of a petition because the marriage took 
place during the prohibited period shall be without prejudice to the 
filing of a new petition after the beneficiary has resided outside the 
United States for the required period of two years following the 
marriage. The denial shall also be without prejudice to the 
consideration of a new petition or a motion to reopen the visa petition 
proceedings if deportation or exclusion proceedings are terminated after 
the denial other than by the beneficiary's departure from the United 
States. Furthermore, the denial shall be without prejudice to the 
consideration of a new petition or motion to reopen the visa petition 
proceedings, if the petitioner establishes eligibility for the bona fide 
marriage exemption contained in this part: Provided, That no motion to 
reopen visa petition proceedings may be accepted if the approval of the 
motion would result in the beneficiary being accorded a priority date 
within the meaning of section 203(c) of the Act earlier than November 
29, 1990.
    (E) Appeals. The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals 
concerning the denial of a relative visa petition because the petitioner 
failed to establish eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption 
contained in this part will constitute the single level of appellate 
review established by statute.
    (F) Priority date. A preference beneficiary shall not be accorded a 
priority date within the meaning of section 203(c) of the Act based upon 
any relative petition filed during the prohibited period, unless an 
exemption contained in this part has been granted. Furthermore, a 
preference beneficiary shall not be accorded a priority date prior to 
November 29, 1990, based upon the approval of a request for 
consideration for the bona fide marriage exemption contained in this 
part.
    (2) Evidence for petition for a spouse. In addition to evidence of 
United States citizenship or lawful permanent residence, the petitioner 
must also provide evidence of the claimed relationship. A petition 
submitted on behalf of a

[[Page 105]]

spouse must be accompanied by a recent ADIT-style photograph of the 
petitioner, a recent ADIT-style photograph of the beneficiary, a 
certificate of marriage issued by civil authorities, and proof of the 
legal termination of all previous marriages of both the petitioner and 
the beneficiary. However, non-ADIT-style photographs may be accepted by 
the district director when the petitioner or beneficiary reside(s) in a 
country where such photographs are unavailable or cost prohibitive.
    (3) Decision on and disposition of petition. The approved petition 
will be forwarded to the Department of State's Processing Center. If the 
beneficiary is in the United States and is eligible for adjustment of 
status under section 245 of the Act, the approved petition will be 
retained by the Service. If the petition is denied, the petitioner will 
be notified of the reasons for the denial and of the right to appeal in 
accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 3.3.
    (4) Derivative beneficiaries. No alien may be classified as an 
immediate relative as defined in section 201(b) of the Act unless he or 
she is the direct beneficiary of an approved petition for that 
classification. Therefore, a child of an alien approved for 
classification as an immediate relative spouse is not eligible for 
derivative classification and must have a separate petition filed on his 
or her behalf. A child accompanying or following to join a principal 
alien under section 203(a)(2) of the Act may be included in the 
principal alien's second preference visa petition. The child will be 
accorded second preference classification and the same priority date as 
the principal alien. However, if the child reaches the age of twenty-one 
prior to the issuance of a visa to the principal alien parent, a 
separate petition will be required. In such a case, the original 
priority date will be retained if the subsequent petition is filed by 
the same petitioner. Such retention of priority date will be accorded 
only to a son or daughter previously eligible as a derivative 
beneficiary under a second preference spousal petition.
    (b) Petition by widow or widower of a United States citizen--(1) 
Eligibility. A widow or widower of a United States citizen may file a 
petition and be classified as an immediate relative under section 201(b) 
of the Act if:
    (i) He or she had been married for at least two years to a United 
States citizen.

    (Note: The United States citizen is not required to have had the 
status of United States citizen for the entire two year period, but must 
have been a United States citizen at the time of death.)


    (ii) The petition is filed within two years of the death of the 
citizen spouse or before November 29, 1992, if the citizen spouse died 
before November 29, 1990;
    (iii) The alien petitioner and the citizen spouse were not legally 
separated at the time of the citizen's death; and
    (iv) The alien spouse has not remarried.
    (2) Evidence for petition of widow or widower. If a petition is 
submitted by the widow or widower of a deceased United States citizen, 
it must be accompanied by evidence of citizenship of the United States 
citizen and primary evidence, if available, of the relationship in the 
form of a marriage certificate issued by civil authorities, proof of the 
termination of all prior marriages of both husband and wife, and the 
United States citizen's death certificate issued by civil authorities. 
To determine the availability of primary documents, the Service will 
refer to the Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM). When 
the FAM shows that primary documents are generally available in the 
country at issue but the petitioner claims that his or her document is 
unavailable, a letter from the appropriate registrar stating that the 
document is not available will be required before the Service will 
accept secondary evidence. Secondary evidence will be evaluated for its 
authenticity and credibility. Secondary evidence may include:
    (i) Such evidence of the marriage and termination of prior marriages 
as religious documents, tribal records, census records, or affidavits; 
and
    (ii) Such evidence of the United States citizen's death as religious 
documents, funeral service records, obituaries, or affidavits. 
Affidavits submitted as secondary evidence pursuant to paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this

[[Page 106]]

section must be sworn to or affirmed by people who have personal 
knowledge of the event to which they attest. Each affidavit should 
contain the full name and address, date and place of birth of the person 
making the affidavit and his or her relationship, if any, to the widow 
or widower. Any such affidavit must contain complete information and 
details explaining how knowledge of the event was acquired.
    (3) Decision on and disposition of petition. The approved petition 
will be forwarded to the Department of State's Processing Center. If the 
widow or widower is in the United States and is eligible for adjustment 
of status under section 245 of the Act, the approved petition will be 
retained by the Service. If the petition is denied, the widow or widower 
will be notified of the reasons for the denial and of the right to 
appeal in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 3.3.
    (4) Derivative beneficiaries. A child of an alien widow or widower 
classified as an immediate relative is eligible for derivative 
classification as an immediate relative. Such a child may be included in 
the principal alien's immediate relative visa petition, and may 
accompany or follow to join the principal alien to the United States. 
Derivative benefits do not extend to an unmarried or married son or 
daughter of an alien widow or widower.
    (c) Self-petition by spouse of abusive citizen or lawful permanent 
resident--(1) Eligibility--(i) Basic eligibility requirements. A spouse 
may file a self-petition under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 
204(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act for his or her classification as an 
immediate relative or as a preference immigrant if he or she:
    (A) Is the spouse of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the 
United States;
    (B) Is eligible for immigrant classification under section 
201(b)(2)(A)(i) or 203(a)(2)(A) of the Act based on that relationship;
    (C) Is residing in the United States;
    (D) Has resided in the United States with the citizen or lawful 
permanent resident spouse;
    (E) Has been battered by, or has been the subject of extreme cruelty 
perpetrated by, the citizen or lawful permanent resident during the 
marriage; or is that parent of a child who has been battered by, or has 
been the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by, the citizen or 
lawful permanent resident during the marriage;
    (F) Is a person of good moral character;
    (G) Is a person whose deportation would result in extreme hardship 
to himself, herself, or his or her child; and
    (H) Entered into the marriage to the citizen or lawful permanent 
resident in good faith.
    (ii) Legal status of the marriage. The self-petitioning spouse must 
be legally married to the abuser when the petition is properly filed 
with the Service. A spousal self-petition must be denied if the marriage 
to the abuser legally ended through annulment, death, or divorce before 
that time. After the self-petition has been properly filed, the legal 
termination of the marriage will have no effect on the decision made on 
the self-petition. The self-petitioner's remarriage, however, will be a 
basis for the denial of a pending self-petition.
    (iii) Citizenship or immigration status of the abuser. The abusive 
spouse must be a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent 
resident of the United States when the petition is filed and when it is 
approved. Changes in the abuser's citizenship or lawful permanent 
resident status after the approval will have no effect on the self-
petition. A self-petition approved on the basis of a relationship to an 
abusive lawful permanent resident spouse will not be automatically 
upgraded to immediate relative status. The self-petitioner would not be 
precluded, however, from filing a new self-petition for immediate 
relative classification after the abuser's naturalization, provided the 
self-petitioner continues to meet the self-petitioning requirements.
    (iv) Eligibility for immigrant classification. A self-petitioner is 
required to comply with the provisions of section 204(c) of the Act, 
section 204(g) of the Act, and section 204(a)(2) of the Act.
    (v) Residence. A self-petition will not be approved if the self-
petitioner is not residing in the United States when the self-petition 
is filed. The self-petitioner is not required to be living with the 
abuser when the petition is filed, but

[[Page 107]]

he or she must have resided with the abuser in the United States in the 
past.
    (vi) Battery or extreme cruelty. For the purpose of this chapter, 
the phrase ``was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty'' 
includes, but is not limited to, being the victim of any act or 
threatened act of violence, including any forceful detention, which 
results or threatens to result in physical or mental injury. 
Psychological or sexual abuse or exploitation, including rape, 
molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor), or forced prostitution 
shall be considered acts of violence. Other abusive actions may also be 
acts of violence under certain circumstances, including acts that, in 
and of themselves, may not initially appear violent but that are a part 
of an overall pattern of violence. The qualifying abuse must have been 
committed by the citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, must have 
been perpetrated against the self-petitioner or the self-petitioner's 
child, and must have taken place during the self-petitioner's marriage 
to the abuser.
    (vii) Good moral character. A self-petitioner will be found to lack 
good moral character if he or she is a person described in section 
101(f) of the Act. Extenuating circumstances may be taken into account 
if the person has not been convicted of an offense or offenses but 
admits to the commission of an act or acts that could show a lack of 
good moral character under section 101(f) of the Act. A person who was 
subjected to abuse in the form of forced prostitution or who can 
establish that he or she was forced to engage in other behavior that 
could render the person excludable under section 212(a) of the Act would 
not be precluded from being found to be a person of good moral 
character, provided the person has not been convicted for the commission 
of the offense or offenses in a court of law. A self-petitioner will 
also be found to lack good moral character, unless he or she establishes 
extenuating circumstances, if he or she willfully failed or refused to 
support dependents; or committed unlawful acts that adversely reflect 
upon his or her moral character, or was convicted or imprisoned for such 
acts, although the acts do not require an automatic finding of lack of 
good moral character. A self-petitioner's claim of good moral character 
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the 
provisions of section 101(f) of the Act and the standards of the average 
citizen in the community. If the results of record checks conducted 
prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa or approval of an application 
for adjustment of status disclose that the self-petitioner is no longer 
a person of good moral character or that he or she has not been a person 
of good moral character in the past, a pending self-petition will be 
denied or the approval of a self-petition will be revoked.
    (viii) Extreme hardship. The Service will consider all credible 
evidence of extreme hardship submitted with a self-petition, including 
evidence of hardship arising from circumstances surrounding the abuse. 
The extreme hardship claim will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis 
after a review of the evidence in the case. Self-petitioners are 
encouraged to cite and document all applicable factors, since there is 
no guarantee that a particular reason or reasons will result in a 
finding that deportation would cause extreme hardship. Hardship to 
persons other than the self-petitioner or the self-petitioner's child 
cannot be considered in determining whether a self-petitioning spouse's 
deportation would cause extreme hardship.
    (ix) Good faith marriage. A spousal self-petition cannot be approved 
if the self-petitioner entered into the marriage to the abuser for the 
primary purpose of circumventing the immigration laws. A self-petition 
will not be denied, however, solely because the spouses are not living 
together and the marriage is no longer viable.
    (2) Evidence for a spousal self-petition--(i) General. Self-
petitioners are encouraged to submit primary evidence whenever possible. 
The Service will consider, however, any credible evidence relevant to 
the petition. The determination of what evidence is credible and the 
weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of 
the Service.
    (ii) Relationship. A self-petition filed by a spouse must be 
accompanied by evidence of citizenship of the United

[[Page 108]]

States citizen or proof of the immigration status of the lawful 
permanent resident abuser. It must also be accompanied by evidence of 
the relationship. Primary evidence of a marital relationship is a 
marriage certificate issued by civil authorities, and proof of the 
termination of all prior marriages, if any, of both the self-petitioner 
and the abuser. If the self-petition is based on a claim that the self-
petitioner's child was battered or subjected to extreme cruelty 
committed by the citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, the self-
petition should also be accompanied by the child's birth certificate or 
other evidence showing the relationship between the self-petitioner and 
the abused child.
    (iii) Residence. One or more documents may be submitted showing that 
the self-petitioner and the abuser have resided together in the United 
States. One or more documents may also be submitted showing that the 
self-petitioner is residing in the United States when the self-petition 
is filed. Employment records, utility receipts, school records, hospital 
or medical records, birth certificates of children born in the United 
States, deeds, mortgages, rental records, insurance policies, affidavits 
or any other type of relevant credible evidence of residency may be 
submitted.
    (iv) Abuse. Evidence of abuse may include, but is not limited to, 
reports and affidavits from police, judges and other court officials, 
medical personnel, school officials, clergy, social workers, and other 
social service agency personnel. Persons who have obtained an order of 
protection against the abuser or have taken other legal steps to end the 
abuse are strongly encouraged to submit copies of the relating legal 
documents. Evidence that the abuse victim sought safe-haven in a 
battered women's shelter or similar refuge may be relevant, as may a 
combination of documents such as a photograph of the visibly injured 
self-petitioner supported by affidavits. Other forms of credible 
relevant evidence will also be considered. Documentary proof of non-
qualifying abuses may only be used to establish a pattern of abuse and 
violence and to support a claim that qualifying abuse also occurred.
    (v) Good moral character. Primary evidence of the self-petitioner's 
good moral character is the self-petitioner's affidavit. The affidavit 
should be accompanied by a local police clearance or a state-issued 
criminal background check from each locality or state in the United 
States in which the self-petitioner has resided for six or more months 
during the 3-year period immediately preceding the filing of the self-
petition. Self-petitioners who lived outside the United States during 
this time should submit a police clearance, criminal background check, 
or similar report issued by the appropriate authority in each foreign 
country in which he or she resided for six or more months during the 3-
year period immediately preceding the filing of the self-petition. If 
police clearances, criminal background checks, or similar reports are 
not available for some or all locations, the self-petitioner may include 
an explanation and submit other evidence with his or her affidavit. The 
Service will consider other credible evidence of good moral character, 
such as affidavits from responsible persons who can knowledgeably attest 
to the self-petitioner's good moral character.
    (vi) Extreme hardship. Evidence of extreme hardship may include 
affidavits, birth certificates of children, medical reports, protection 
orders and other court documents, police reports, and other relevant 
credible evidence.
    (vii) Good faith marriage. Evidence of good faith at the time of 
marriage may include, but is not limited to, proof that one spouse has 
been listed as the other's spouse on insurance policies, property 
leases, income tax forms, or bank accounts; and testimony or other 
evidence regarding courtship, wedding ceremony, shared residence and 
experiences. Other types of readily available evidence might include the 
birth certificates of children born to the abuser and the spouse; 
police, medical, or court documents providing information about the 
relationship; and affidavits of persons with personal knowledge of the 
relationship. All credible relevant evidence will be considered.
    (3) Decision on and disposition of the petition--(i) Petition 
approved. If the self-petitioning spouse will apply for adjustment of 
status under section 245

[[Page 109]]

of the Act, the approved petition will be retained by the Service. If 
the self-petitioner will apply for an immigrant visa abroad, the 
approved self-petition will be forwarded to the Department of State's 
National Visa Center.
    (ii) Notice of intent to deny. If the preliminary decision on a 
properly filed self-petition is adverse to the self-petitioner, the 
self-petitioner will be provided with written notice of this fact and 
offered an opportunity to present additional information or arguments 
before a final decision is rendered. If the adverse preliminary decision 
is based on derogatory information of which the self-petitioner is 
unaware, the self-petitioner will also be offered an opportunity to 
rebut the derogatory information in accordance with the provisions of 8 
CFR 103.2(b)(16).
    (iii) Petition denied. If the self-petition is denied, the self-
petitioner will be notified in writing of the reasons for the denial and 
of the right to appeal the decision.
    (4) Derivative beneficiaries. A child accompanying or following-to-
join the self-petitioning spouse may be accorded the same preference and 
priority date as the self-petitioner without the necessity of a separate 
petition, if the child has not been classified as an immigrant based on 
his or her own self-petition. A derivative child who had been included 
in a parent's self-petition may later file a self-petition, provided the 
child meets the self-petitioning requirements. A child who has been 
classified as an immigrant based on a petition filed by the abuser or 
another relative may also be derivatively included in a parent's self-
petition. The derivative child must be unmarried, less than 21 years 
old, and otherwise qualify as the self-petitioner's child under section 
101(b)(1)(F) of the Act until he or she becomes a lawful permanent 
resident based on the derivative classification.
    (5) Name change. If the self-petitioner's current name is different 
than the name shown on the documents, evidence of the name change (such 
as the petitioner's marriage certificate, legal document showing name 
change, or other similar evidence) must accompany the self-petition.
    (6) Prima facie determination. (i) Upon receipt of a self-petition 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Service shall make a 
determination as to whether the petition and the supporting 
documentation establish a ``prima facie case'' for purposes of 8 U.S.C. 
1641, as amended by section 501 of Public Law 104-208.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, a prima 
facie case is established only if the petitioner submits a completed 
Form I-360 and other evidence supporting all of the elements required of 
a self-petitioner in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A finding of 
prima facie eligibility does not relieve the petitioner of the burden of 
providing additional evidence in support of the petition and does not 
establish eligibility for the underlying petition.
    (iii) If the Service determines that a petitioner has made a ``prima 
facie case,'' the Service shall issue a Notice of Prima Facie Case to 
the petitioner. Such Notice shall be valid until the Service either 
grants or denies the petition.
    (iv) For purposes of adjudicating the petition submitted under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a prima facie determination--
    (A) Shall not be considered evidence in support of the petition;
    (B) Shall not be construed to make a determination of the 
credibility or probative value of any evidence submitted along with that 
petition; and,
    (C) Shall not relieve the self-petitioner of his or her burden of 
complying with all of the evidentiary requirements of paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section.
    (d) Petition for a child or son or daughter--(1) Eligibility. A 
United States citizen may file a petition on behalf of an unmarried 
child under twenty-one years of age for immediate relative 
classification under section 201(b) of the Act. A United States citizen 
may file a petition on behalf of an unmarried son or daughter over 
twenty-one years of age under section 203(a)(1) or for a married son or 
daughter for preference classification under section 203(a)(3) of the 
Act. An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence may file a 
petition on behalf of a child or an

[[Page 110]]

unmarried son or daughter for preference classification under section 
203(a)(2) of the Act.
    (2) Evidence to support petition for child or son or daughter. In 
addition to evidence of United States citizenship or lawful permanent 
resident, the petitioner must also provide evidence of the claimed 
relationship.
    (i) Primary evidence for a legitimate child or son or daughter. If a 
petition is submitted by the mother, the birth certificate of the child 
showing the mother's name must accompany the petition. If the mother's 
name on the birth certificate is different from her name on the 
petition, evidence of the name change must also be submitted. If a 
petition is submitted by the father, the birth certificate of the child, 
a marriage certificate of the parents, and proof of legal termination of 
the parents' prior marriages, if any, issued by civil authorities must 
accompany the petition. If the father's name has been legally changed, 
evidence of the name change must also accompany the petition.
    (ii) Primary evidence for a legitimated child or son or daughter. A 
child can be legitimated through the marriage of his or her natural 
parents, by the laws of the country or state of the child's residence or 
domicile, or by the laws of the country or state of the father's 
residence or domicile. If the legitimation is based on the natural 
parents' marriage, such marriage must have taken place while the child 
was under the age of eighteen. If the legitimation is based on the laws 
of the country or state of the child's residence or domicile, the law 
must have taken effect before the child's eighteenth birthday. If the 
legitimation is based on the laws of the country or state of the 
father's residence or domicile, the father must have resided--while the 
child was under eighteen years of age--in the country or state under 
whose laws the child has been legitimated. Primary evidence of the 
relationship should consist of the beneficiary's birth certificate and 
the parents' marriage certificate or other evidence of legitimation 
issued by civil authorities.
    (iii) Primary evidence for an illegitimate child or son or daughter. 
If a petition is submitted by the mother, the child's birth certificate, 
issued by civil authorities and showing the mother's name, must 
accompany the petition. If the mother's name on the birth certificate is 
different from her name as reflected in the petition, evidence of the 
name change must also be submitted. If the petition is submitted by the 
purported father of a child or son or daughter born out of wedlock, the 
father must show that he is the natural father and that a bona fide 
parent-child relationship was established when the child or son or 
daughter was unmarried and under twenty-one years of age. Such a 
relationship will be deemed to exist or to have existed where the father 
demonstrates or has demonstrated an active concern for the child's 
support, instruction, and general welfare. Primary evidence to establish 
that the petitioner is the child's natural father is the beneficiary's 
birth certificate, issued by civil authorities and showing the father's 
name. If the father's name has been legally changed, evidence of the 
name change must accompany the petition. Evidence of a parent/child 
relationship should establish more than merely a biological 
relationship. Emotional and/or financial ties or a genuine concern and 
interest by the father for the child's support, instruction, and general 
welfare must be shown. There should be evidence that the father and 
child actually lived together or that the father held the child out as 
being his own, that he provided for some or all of the child's needs, or 
that in general the father's behavior evidenced a genuine concern for 
the child. The most persuasive evidence for establishing a bona fide 
parent/child relationship and financial responsibility by the father is 
documentary evidence which was contemporaneous with the events in 
question. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to: money order 
receipts or cancelled checks showing the father's financial support of 
the beneficiary; the father's income tax returns; the father's medical 
or insurance records which include the beneficiary as a dependent; 
school records

[[Page 111]]

for the beneficiary; correspondence between the parties; or notarized 
affidavits of friends, neighbors, school officials, or other associates 
knowledgeable about the relationship.
    (iv) Primary evidence for a stepchild. If a petition is submitted by 
a stepparent on behalf of a stepchild or stepson or stepdaughter, the 
petition must be supported by the stepchild's or stepson's or 
stepdaughter's birth certificate, issued by civil authorities and 
showing the name of the beneficiary's parent to whom the petitioner is 
married, a marriage certificate issued by civil authorities which shows 
that the petitioner and the child's natural parent were married before 
the stepchild or stepson or stepdaughter reached the age of eighteen; 
and evidence of the termination of any prior marriages of the petitioner 
and the natural parent of the stepchild or stepson or stepdaughter.
    (v) Secondary evidence. When it is established that primary evidence 
is not available, secondary evidence may be accepted. To determine the 
availability of primary documents, the Service will refer to the 
Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM). When the FAM shows 
that primary documents are generally available in the country at issue 
but the petitioner claims that his or her document is unavailable, a 
letter from the appropriate registrar stating that the document is not 
available will be required before the Service will accept secondary 
evidence. Secondary evidence will be evaluated for its authenticity and 
credibility. Secondary evidence may take the form of historical 
evidence; such evidence must have been issued contemporaneously with the 
event which it documents any may include, but is not limited to, medical 
records, school records, and religious documents. Affidavits may also by 
accepted. When affidavits are submitted, they must be sworn to by 
persons who were born at the time of and who have personal knowledge of 
the event to which they attest. Any affidavit must contain the affiant's 
full name and address, date and place of birth, relationship to the 
party, if any, and complete details concerning how the affiant acquired 
knowledge of the event.
    (vi) Blood tests. The director may require that a specific Blood 
Group Antigen Test be conducted of the beneficiary and the beneficiary's 
father and mother. In general, blood tests will be required only after 
other forms of evidence have proven inconclusive. If the specific Blood 
Group Antigen Test is also found not to be conclusive and the director 
determines that additional evidence is needed, a Human Leucocyte Antigen 
(HLA) test may be requested. Tests will be conducted, at the expense of 
the petitioner or beneficiary, by the United States Public Health 
Service physician who is authorized overseas or by a qualified medical 
specialist designated by the district director. The results of the test 
should be reported on Form G-620. Refusal to submit to a Specific Blood 
Group Antigen or HLA test when requested may constitute a basis for 
denial of the petition, unless a legitimate religious objection has been 
established. When a legitimate religious objection is established, 
alternate forms of evidence may be considered based upon documentation 
already submitted.
    (vii) Primary evidence for an adopted child or son or daughter. A 
petition may be submitted on behalf of an adopted child or son or 
daughter by a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident if the 
adoption took place before the beneficiary's sixteenth birthday, and if 
the child has been in the legal custody of the adopting parent or 
parents and has resided with the adopting parent or parents for at least 
two years. A copy of the adoption decree, issued by the civil 
authorities, must accompany the petition.
    (A) Legal custody means the assumption of responsibility for a minor 
by an adult under the laws of the state and under the order or approval 
of a court of law or other appropriate government entity. This provision 
requires that a legal process involving the courts or other recognized 
government entity take place. If the adopting parent was granted legal 
custody by the court or recognized governmental entity prior to the 
adoption, that period may be counted toward fulfillment of the two-year 
legal custody requirement. However, if custody was not granted prior to 
the adoption, the adoption decree

[[Page 112]]

shall be deemed to mark the commencement of legal custody. An informal 
custodial or guardianship document, such as a sworn affidavit signed 
before a notary public, is insufficient for this purpose.
    (B) Evidence must also be submitted to show that the beneficiary 
resided with the petitioner for at least two years. Generally, such 
documentation must establish that the petitioner and the beneficiary 
resided together in a familial relationship. Evidence of parental 
control may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the adoptive 
parent owns or maintains the property where the child resides and 
provides financial support and day-to-day supervision. The evidence must 
clearly indicate the physical living arrangements of the adopted child, 
the adoptive parent(s), and the natural parent(s) for the period of time 
during which the adoptive parent claims to have met the residence 
requirement. When the adopted child continued to reside in the same 
household as a natural parent(s) during the period in which the adoptive 
parent petitioner seeks to establish his or her compliance with this 
requirement, the petitioner has the burden of establishing that he or 
she exercised primary parental control during that period of residence.
    (C) Legal custody and residence occurring prior to or after the 
adoption will satisfy both requirements. Legal custody, like residence, 
is accounted for in the aggregate. Therefore, a break in legal custody 
or residence will not affect the time already fulfilled. To meet the 
definition of child contained in sections 101(b)(1)(E) and 101(b)(2) of 
the Act, the child must have been under 16 years of age when the 
adoption is finalized.
    (3) Decision on and disposition of petition. The approved petition 
will be forwarded to the Department of State's Processing Center. If the 
beneficiary is in the United States and is eligible for adjustment of 
status under section 245 of the Act, the approved petition will be 
retained by the Service. If the petition is denied, the petitioner will 
be notified of the reasons for the denial and of the right to appeal in 
accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 3.3.
    (4) Derivative beneficiaries. A spouse or child accompanying or 
following to join a principal alien as used in this section may be 
accorded the same preference and priority date as the principal alien 
without the necessity of a separate petition. However, a child of an 
alien who is approved for classification as an immediate relative is not 
eligible for derivative classification and must have a separate petition 
approved on his or her behalf.
    (5) Name change. When the petitioner's name does not appear on the 
child's birth certificate, evidence of the name change (such as the 
petitioner's marriage certificate, legal document showing name change, 
or other similar evidence) must accompany the petition. If the 
beneficiary's name has been legally changed, evidence of the name change 
must also accompany the petition.
    (e) Self-petition by child of abusive citizen or lawful permanent 
resident--(1) Eligibility. (i) A child may file a self-petition under 
section 204(a)(1)(A)(iv) or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act if he or she:
    (A) Is the child of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the 
United States;
    (B) Is eligible for immigrant classification under section 
201(b)(2)(A)(i) or 203(a)(2)(A) of the Act based on that relationship;
    (C) Is residing in the United States;
    (D) Has resided in the United States with the citizen or lawful 
permanent resident parent;
    (E) Has been battered by, or has been the subject of extreme cruelty 
perpetrated by, the citizen or lawful permanent resident parent while 
residing with that parent;
    (F) Is a person of good moral character; and
    (G) Is a person whose deportation would result in extreme hardship 
to himself or herself.
    (ii) Parent-child relationship to the abuser. The self-petitioning 
child must be unmarried, less than 21 years of age, and otherwise 
qualify as the abuser's child under the definition of child contained in 
section 101(b)(1) of the Act when the petition is filed and when it is 
approved. Termination of the abuser's parental rights or a change in 
legal

[[Page 113]]

custody does not alter the self-petitioning relationship provided the 
child meets the requirements of section 101(b)(1) of the Act.
    (iii) Citizenship or immigration status of the abuser. The abusive 
parent must be a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent 
resident of the United States when the petition is filed and when it is 
approved. Changes in the abuser's citizenship or lawful permanent 
resident status after the approval will have no effect on the self-
petition. A self-petition approved on the basis of a relationship to an 
abusive lawful permanent resident will not be automatically upgraded to 
immediate relative status. The self-petitioning child would not be 
precluded, however, from filing a new self-petition for immediate 
relative classification after the abuser's naturalization, provided the 
self-petitioning child continues to meet the self-petitioning 
requirements.
    (iv) Eligibility for immigrant classification. A self-petitioner is 
required to comply with the provisions of section 204(c) of the Act, 
section 204(g) of the Act, and section 204(a)(2) of the Act.
    (v) Residence. A self-petition will not be approved if the self-
petitioner is not residing in the United States when the self-petition 
is filed. The self-petitioner is not required to be living with the 
abuser when the petition is filed, but he or she must have resided with 
the abuser in the United States in the past.
    (vi) Battery or extreme cruelty. For the purpose of this chapter, 
the phrase ``was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty'' 
includes, but is not limited to, being the victim of any act or 
threatened act of violence, including any forceful detention, which 
results or threatens to result in physical or mental injury. 
Psychological or sexual abuse or exploitation, including rape, 
molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor), or forced prostitution 
shall be considered acts of violence. Other abusive actions may also be 
acts of violence under certain circumstances, including acts that, in 
and of themselves, may not initially appear violent but are a part of an 
overall pattern of violence. The qualifying abuse must have been 
committed by the citizen or lawful permanent resident parent, must have 
been perpetrated against the self-petitioner, and must have taken place 
while the self-petitioner was residing with the abuser.
    (vii) Good moral character. A self-petitioner will be found to lack 
good moral character if he or she is a person described in section 
101(f) of the Act. Extenuating circumstances may be taken into account 
if the person has not been convicted of an offense or offenses but 
admits to the commission of an act or acts that could show a lack of 
good moral character under section 101(f) of the Act. A person who was 
subjected to abuse in the form of forced prostitution or who can 
establish that he or she was forced to engage in other behavior that 
could render the person excludable under section 212(a) of the Act would 
not be precluded from being found to be a person of good moral 
character, provided the person has not been convicted for the commission 
of the offense or offenses in a court of law. A self-petitioner will 
also be found to lack good moral character, unless he or she establishes 
extenuating circumstances, if he or she willfully failed or refused to 
support dependents; or committed unlawful acts that adversely reflect 
upon his or her moral character, or was convicted or imprisoned for such 
acts, although the acts do not require an automatic finding of lack of 
good moral character. A self-petitioner's claim of good moral character 
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the 
provisions of section 101(f) of the Act and the standards of the average 
citizen in the community. If the results of record checks conducted 
prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa or approval of an application 
for adjustment of status disclose that the self-petitioner is no longer 
a person of good moral character or that he or she has not been a person 
of good moral character in the past, a pending self-petition will be 
denied or the approval of a self-petition will be revoked.
    (viii) Extreme hardship. The Service will consider all credible 
evidence of extreme hardship submitted with a self-petition, including 
evidence of hardship arising from circumstances surrounding the abuse. 
The extreme hardship claim will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis 
after a review of the

[[Page 114]]

evidence in the case. Self-petitioners are encouraged to cite and 
document all applicable factors, since there is no guarantee that a 
particular reason or reasons will result in a finding that deportation 
would cause extreme hardship. Hardship to persons other than the self-
petitioner cannot be considered in determining whether a self-
petitioning child's deportation would cause extreme hardship.
    (2) Evidence for a child's self-petition--(i) General. Self-
petitioners are encouraged to submit primary evidence whenever possible. 
The Service will consider, however, any credible evidence relevant to 
the petition. The determination of what evidence is credible and the 
weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of 
the Service.
    (ii) Relationship. A self-petition filed by a child must be 
accompanied by evidence of citizenship of the United States citizen or 
proof of the immigration status of the lawful permanent resident abuser. 
It must also be accompanied by evidence of the relationship. Primary 
evidence of the relationship between:
    (A) The self-petitioning child and an abusive biological mother is 
the self-petitioner's birth certificate issued by civil authorities;
    (B) A self-petitioning child who was born in wedlock and an abusive 
biological father is the child's birth certificate issued by civil 
authorities, the marriage certificate of the child's parents, and 
evidence of legal termination of all prior marriages, if any;
    (C) A legitimated self-petitioning child and an abusive biological 
father is the child's birth certificate issued by civil authorities, and 
evidence of the child's legitimation;
    (D) A self-petitioning child who was born out of wedlock and an 
abusive biological father is the child's birth certificate issued by 
civil authorities showing the father's name, and evidence that a bona 
fide parent-child relationship has been established between the child 
and the parent;
    (E) A self-petitioning stepchild and an abusive stepparent is the 
child's birth certificate issued by civil authorities, the marriage 
certificate of the child's parent and the stepparent showing marriage 
before the stepchild reached 18 years of age, and evidence of legal 
termination of all prior marriages of either parent, if any; and
    (F) An adopted self-petitioning child and an abusive adoptive parent 
is an adoption decree showing that the adoption took place before the 
child reached 16 years of age, and evidence that the child has been 
residing with and in the legal custody of the abusive adoptive parent 
for at least 2 years.
    (iii) Residence. One or more documents may be submitted showing that 
the self-petitioner and the abuser have resided together in the United 
States. One or more documents may also be submitted showing that the 
self-petitioner is residing in the United States when the self-petition 
is filed. Employment records, school records, hospital or medical 
records, rental records, insurance policies, affidavits or any other 
type of relevant credible evidence of residency may be submitted.
    (iv) Abuse. Evidence of abuse may include, but is not limited to, 
reports and affidavits from police, judges and other court officials, 
medical personnel, school officials, clergy, social workers, and other 
social service agency personnel. Persons who have obtained an order of 
protection against the abuser or taken other legal steps to end the 
abuse are strongly encouraged to submit copies of the relating legal 
documents. Evidence that the abuse victim sought safe-haven in a 
battered women's shelter or similar refuge may be relevant, as may a 
combination of documents such as a photograph of the visibly injured 
self-petitioner supported by affidavits. Other types of credible 
relevant evidence will also be considered. Documentary proof of non-
qualifying abuse may only be used to establish a pattern of abuse and 
violence and to support a claim that qualifying abuse also occurred.
    (v) Good moral character. Primary evidence of the self-petitioner's 
good moral character is the self-petitioner's affidavit. The affidavit 
should be accompanied by a local police clearance or a state-issued 
criminal background check from each locality or state in the United 
States in which the self-petitioner has resided for six or more

[[Page 115]]

months during the 3-year period immediately preceding the filing of the 
self-petition. Self-petitioners who lived outside the United States 
during this time should submit a police clearance, criminal background 
check, or similar report issued by the appropriate authority in the 
foreign country in which he or she resided for six or more months during 
the 3-year period immediately preceding the filing of the self-petition. 
If police clearances, criminal background checks, or similar reports are 
not available for some or all locations, the self-petitioner may include 
an explanation and submit other evidence with his or her affidavit. The 
Service will consider other credible evidence of good moral character, 
such as affidavits from responsible persons who can knowledgeably attest 
to the self-petitioner's good moral character. A child who is less than 
14 years of age is presumed to be a person of good moral character and 
is not required to submit affidavits of good moral character, police 
clearances, criminal background checks, or other evidence of good moral 
character.
    (vi) Extreme hardship. Evidence of extreme hardship may include 
affidavits, medical reports, protection orders and other court 
documents, police reports, and other relevant credible evidence.
    (3) Decision on and disposition of the petition--(i) Petition 
approved. If the self-petitioning child will apply for adjustment of 
status under section 245 of the Act, the approved petition will be 
retained by the Service. If the self-petitioner will apply for an 
immigrant visa abroad, the approved self-petition will be forwarded to 
the Department of State's National Visa Center.
    (ii) Notice of intent to deny. If the preliminary decision on a 
properly filed self-petition is adverse to the self-petitioner, the 
self-petitioner will be provided with written notice of this fact and 
offered an opportunity to present additional information or arguments 
before a final decision is rendered. If the adverse preliminary decision 
is based on derogatory information of which the self-petitioner is 
unaware, the self-petitioner will also be offered an opportunity to 
rebut the derogatory information in accordance with the provisions of 8 
CFR 103.2(b)(16).
    (iii) Petition denied. If the self-petition is denied, the self-
petitioner will be notified in writing of the reasons for the denial and 
of the right to appeal the decision.
    (4) Derivative beneficiaries. A child of a self-petitioning child is 
not eligible for derivative classification and must have a petition 
filed on his or her behalf if seeking immigrant classification.
    (5) Name change. If the self-petitioner's current name is different 
than the name shown on the documents, evidence of the name change (such 
as the petitioner's marriage certificate, legal document showing the 
name change, or other similar evidence) must accompany the self-
petition.
    (6) prima facie determination. (i) Upon receipt of a self-petition 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Service shall make a 
determination as to whether the petition and the supporting 
documentation establish a ``prima facie case'' for purposes of 8 U.S.C. 
1641, as amended by section 501 of Public Law 104-208.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section, a prima 
facie case is established only if the petitioner submits a completed 
Form I-360 and other evidence supporting all of the elements required of 
a self-petitioner in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. A finding of 
prima facie eligibility does not relieve the petitioner of the burden of 
providing additional evidence in support of the petition and does not 
establish eligibility for the underlying petition.
    (iii) If the Service determines that a petitioner has made a ``prima 
facie case'' the Service shall issue a Notice of Prima Facie Case to the 
petitioner. Such Notice shall be valid until the Service either grants 
or denies the petition.
    (iv) For purposes of adjudicating the petition submitted under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a prima facie determination:
    (A) Shall not be considered evidence in support of the petition;
    (B) Shall not be construed to make a determination of the 
credibility or probative value of any evidence submitted along with that 
petition; and,

[[Page 116]]

    (C) Shall not relieve the self-petitioner of his or her burden of 
complying with all of the evidentiary requirements of paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section.
    (f) Petition for a parent--(1) Eligibility. Only a United States 
citizen who is twenty-one years of age or older may file a petition on 
behalf of a parent for classification under section 201(b) of the Act.
    (2) Evidence to support a petition for a parent. In addition to 
evidence of United States citizenship as listed in Sec. 204.1(g) of this 
part, the petitioner must also provide evidence of the claimed 
relationship.
    (i) Primary evidence if petitioner is a legitimate son or daughter. 
If a petition is submitted on behalf of the mother, the birth 
certificate of the petitioner showing the mother's name must accompany 
the petition. If the mother's name on the birth certificate is different 
from her name as reflected in the petition, evidence of the name change 
must also be submitted. If a petition is submitted on behalf of the 
father, the birth certificate of the petitioner, a marriage certificate 
of the parents, and proof of legal termination of the parents' prior 
marriages, if any, issued by civil authorities must accompany the 
petition. If the father's name on the birth certificate has been legally 
changed, evidence of the name change must also accompany the petition.
    (ii) Primary evidence if petitioner is a legitimated son or 
daughter. A child can be legitimated through the marriage of his or her 
natural parents, by the laws of the country or state of the child's 
residence or domicile, or by the laws of the country or state of the 
father's residence or domicile. If the legitimation is based on the 
natural parent's marriage, such marriage must have taken place while the 
child was under the age of eighteen. If the legitimation is based on the 
laws of the country or state of the child's residence or domicile, the 
law must have taken effect before the child's eighteenth birthday. If 
the legitimation is based on the laws of the country or state of the 
father's residence or domicile, the father must have resided--while the 
child was under eighteen years of age--in the country or state under 
whose laws the child has been legitimated. Primary evidence of the 
relationship should consist of petitioner's birth certificate and the 
parents' marriage certificate or other evidence of legitimation issued 
by civil authorities.
    (iii) Primary evidence if the petitioner is an illegitimate son or 
daughter. If a petition is submitted on behalf of the mother, the 
petitioner's birth certificate, issued by civil authorities and showing 
the mother's name, must accompany the petition. If the mother's name on 
the birth certificate is different from her name as reflected in the 
petition, evidence of the name change must also be submitted. If the 
petition is submitted on behalf of the purported father of the 
petitioner, the petitioner must show that the beneficiary is his or her 
natural father and that a bona fide parent-child relationship was 
established when the petitioner was unmarried and under twenty-one years 
of age. Such a relationship will be deemed to exist or to have existed 
where the father demonstrates or has demonstrated an active concern for 
the child's support, instruction, and general welfare. Primary evidence 
to establish that the beneficiary is the petitioner's natural father is 
the petitioner's birth certificate, issued by civil authorities and 
showing the father's name. If the father's name has been legally 
changed, evidence of the name change must accompany the petition. 
Evidence of a parent/child relationship should establish more than 
merely a biological relationship. Emotional and/or financial ties or a 
genuine concern and interest by the father for the child's support, 
instruction, and general welfare must be shown. There should be evidence 
that the father and child actually lived together or that the father 
held the child out as being his own, that he provided for some or all of 
the child's needs, or that in general the father's behavior evidenced a 
genuine concern for the child. The most persuasive evidence for 
establishing a bona fide parent/child relationship is documentary 
evidence which was contemporaneous with the events in question. Such 
evidence may include, but is not limited to: money order receipts or 
cancelled checks showing the father's financial support

[[Page 117]]

of the beneficiary; the father's income tax returns; the father's 
medical or insurance records which include the petitioner as a 
dependent; school records for the petitioner; correspondence between the 
parties; or notarized affidavits of friends, neighbors, school 
officials, or other associates knowledgeable as to the relationship.
    (iv) Primary evidence if petitioner is an adopted son or daughter. A 
petition may be submitted for an adoptive parent by a United States 
citizen who is twenty-one years of age or older if the adoption took 
place before the petitioner's sixteenth birthday and if the two year 
legal custody and residence requirements have been met. A copy of the 
adoption decree, issued by the civil authorities, must accompany the 
petition.
    (A) Legal custody means the assumption of responsibility for a minor 
by an adult under the laws of the state and under the order or approval 
of a court of law or other appropriate government entity. This provision 
requires that a legal process involving the courts or other recognized 
government entity take place. If the adopting parent was granted legal 
custody by the court or recognized governmental entity prior to the 
adoption, that period may be counted toward fulfillment of the two-year 
legal custody requirement. However, if custody was not granted prior to 
the adoption, the adoption decree shall be deemed to mark the 
commencement of legal custody. An informal custodial or guardianship 
document, such as a sworn affidavit signed before a notary public, is 
insufficient for this purpose.
    (B) Evidence must also be submitted to show that the beneficiary 
resided with the petitioner for at least two years. Generally, such 
documentation must establish that the petitioner and the beneficiary 
resided together in a parental relationship. The evidence must clearly 
indicate the physical living arrangements of the adopted child, the 
adoptive parent(s), and the natural parent(s) for the period of time 
during which the adoptive parent claims to have met the residence 
requirement.
    (C) Legal custody and residence occurring prior to or after the 
adoption will satisfy both requirements. Legal custody, like residence, 
is accounted for in the aggregate. Therefore, a break in legal custody 
or residence will not affect the time already fulfilled. To meet the 
definition of child contained in sections 101(b)(1)(E) and 101(b)(2) of 
the Act, the child must have been under 16 years of age when the 
adoption is finalized.
    (v) Name change. When the petition is filed by a child for the 
child's parent, and the parent's name is not on the child's birth 
certificate, evidence of the name change (such as the parent's marriage 
certificate, a legal document showing the parent's name change, or other 
similar evidence) must accompany the petition. If the petitioner's name 
has been legally changed, evidence of the name change must also 
accompany the petition.
    (3) Decision on and disposition of petition. The approved petition 
will be forwarded to the Department of State's Processing Center. If the 
beneficiary is in the United States and is eligible for adjustment of 
status under section 245 of the Act, the approved petition will be 
retained by the Service. If the petition is denied, the petitioner will 
be notified of the reasons for the denial and of the right to appeal in 
accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 3.3.
    (4) Derivative beneficiaries. A child or a spouse of a principal 
alien who is approved for classification as an immediate relative is not 
eligible for derivative classification and must have a separate petition 
approved on his or her behalf.
    (g) Petition for a brother or sister--(1) Eligibility. Only a United 
States citizen who is twenty-one years of age or older may file a 
petition of a brother or sister for classification under section 
203(a)(4) of the Act.
    (2) Evidence to support a petition for brother or sister. In 
addition to evidence of United States citizenship, the petitioner must 
also provide evidence of the claimed relationship.
    (i) Primary evidence if the siblings share a common mother or are 
both legitimate children of a common father. If a sibling relationship 
is claimed through a common mother, the petition must be supported by a 
birth certificate of the petitioner and a birth certificate of the 
beneficiary showing a common

[[Page 118]]

mother. If the mother's name on one birth certificate is different from 
her name as reflected on the other birth certificate or in the petition, 
evidence of the name change must also be submitted. If a sibling 
relationship is claimed through a common father, the birth certificates 
of the beneficiary and petitioner, a marriage certificate of the 
parents' and proof of legal termination of the parents, prior 
marriage(s), if any, issued by civil authorities must accompany the 
petition. If the father's name has been legally changed, evidence of the 
name change must also accompany the petition.
    (ii) Primary evidence if either or both siblings are legitimated. A 
child can be legitimated through the marriage of his or her natural 
parents, by the laws of the country or state of the child's residence or 
domicile, or by the laws of the country or state of the father's 
residence or domicile. If the legitimation is based on the natural 
parents' marriage, such marriage must have taken place while the child 
was under the age of eighteen. If the legitimation is based on the laws 
of the country or state of the child's residence or domicile, the law 
must have taken effect before the child's eighteenth birthday. If based 
on the laws of the country or state of the father's residence or 
domicile, the father must have resided--while the child was under 
eighteen years of age--in the country or state under whose laws the 
child has been legitimated. Primary evidence of the relationship should 
consist of the petitioner's birth certificate, the beneficiary's birth 
certificate, and the parents' marriage certificate or other evidence of 
legitimation issued by civil authorities.
    (iii) Primary evidence if either sibling is illegitimate. If one or 
both of the siblings is (are) the illegitimate child(ren) of a common 
father, the petitioner must show that they are the natural children of 
the father and that a bona fide parent-child relationship was 
established when the illegitimate child(ren) was (were) unmarried and 
under twenty-one years of age. Such a relationship will be deemed to 
exist or to have existed where the father demonstrates or has 
demonstrated an active concern for the child's support, instruction, and 
general welfare. Primary evidence is the petitioner's and beneficiary's 
birth certificates, issued by civil authorities and showing the father's 
name, and evidence that the siblings have or had a bona fide parent/
child relationship with the natural father. If the father's name has 
been legally changed, evidence of the name change must accompany the 
petition. Evidence of a parent/child relationship should establish more 
than merely a biological relationship. Emotional and/or financial ties 
or a genuine concern and interest by the father for the child's support, 
instruction, and general welfare must be shown. There should be evidence 
that the father and child actually lived together or that the father 
held the child out as being his own, that he provided for some or all of 
the child's needs, or that in general the father's behavior evidenced a 
genuine concern for the child. The most persuasive evidence for 
establishing a bona fide parent/child relationship is documentary 
evidence which was contemporaneous with the events in question. Such 
evidence may include, but is not limited to: money order receipts or 
canceled checks showing the father's financial support of the 
beneficiary; the father's income tax returns; the father's medical or 
insurance records which include the beneficiary as a dependent; school 
records for the beneficiary; correspondence between the parties; or 
notarized affidavits of friends, neighbors, school officials, or other 
associates knowledgeable about the relationship.
    (iv) Primary evidence for stepsiblings. If the petition is submitted 
on behalf of a brother or sister having a common father, the 
relationship of both the petitioner and the beneficiary to the father 
must be established as required in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) and (g)(2)(iii) 
of this section. If the petitioner and beneficiary are stepsiblings 
through the marriages of their common father to different mothers, the 
marriage certificates of the parents and evidence of the termination of 
any prior marriages of the parents must be submitted.
    (3) Decision on and disposition of petition. The approved petition 
will be forwarded to the Department of State's Processing Center. If the 
beneficiary is in the United States and is eligible for

[[Page 119]]

adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, the approved petition 
will be retained by the Service. If the petition is denied, the 
petitioner will be notified of the reasons for the denial and of the 
right to appeal in accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR 3.3.
    (4) Derivative beneficiaries. A spouse or a child accompanying or 
following to join a principal alien beneficiary under this section may 
be accorded the same preference and priority date as the principal alien 
without the necessity of a separate petition.
    (5) Name change. If the name of the petitioner, the beneficiary, or 
both has been legally changed, evidence showing the name change (such as 
a marriage certificate, a legal document showing the name change, or 
other similar evidence) must accompany the petition.
    (h) Validity of approved petitions--(1) General. Unless terminated 
pursuant to section 203(g) of the Act or revoked pursuant to part 205 of 
this chapter, the approval of a petition to classify an alien as a 
preference immigrant under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) 
of section 203 of the Act, or as an immediate relative under section 
201(b) of the Act, shall remain valid for the duration of the 
relationship to the petitioner and of the petitioner's status as 
established in the petition.
    (2) Subsequent petition by same petitioner for same beneficiary. 
When a visa petition has been approved, and subsequently a new petition 
by the same petitioner is approved for the same preference 
classification on behalf of the same beneficiary, the latter approval 
shall be regarded as a reaffirmation or reinstatement of the validity of 
the original petition, except when the original petition has been 
terminated pursuant to section 203(g) of the Act or revoked pursuant to 
part 205 of this chapter, or when an immigrant visa has been issued to 
the beneficiary as a result of the petition approval. A self-petition 
filed under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 
204(a)(1)(B)(ii), 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act based on the relationship 
to an abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States 
will not be regarded as a reaffirmation or reinstatement of a petition 
previously filed by the abuser. A self-petitioner who has been the 
beneficiary of a visa petition filed by the abuser to accord the self-
petitioner immigrant classification as his or her spouse or child, 
however, will be allowed to transfer the visa petition's priority date 
to the self-petition. The visa petition's priority date may be assigned 
to the self-petition without regard to the current validity of the visa 
petition. The burden of proof to establish the existence of and the 
filing date of the visa petition lies with the self-petitioner, although 
the Service will attempt to verify a claimed filing through a search of 
the Service's computerized records or other records deemed appropriate 
by the adjudicating officer. A new self-petition filed under section 
204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(B)(ii), or 
204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act will not be regarded as a reaffirmation or 
reinstatement of the original self-petition unless the prior and the 
subsequent self-petitions are based on the relationship to the same 
abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States.
    (i) Automatic conversion of preference classification--(1) By change 
in beneficiary's marital status. (i) A currently valid petition 
previously approved to classify the beneficiary as the unmarried son or 
daughter of a United States citizen under section 203(a)(1) of the Act 
shall be regarded as having been approved for preference status under 
section 203(a)(3) of the Act as of the date the beneficiary marries. The 
beneficiary's priority date is the same as the date the petition for 
classification under section 203(a)(1) of the Act was properly filed.
    (ii) A currently valid petition previously approved to classify a 
child of a United States citizen as an immediate relative under section 
201(b) of the Act shall be regarded as having been approved for 
preference status under section 203(a)(3) of the Act as of the date the 
beneficiary marries. The beneficiary's priority date is the same as the 
date the petition for 201(b) classification was properly filed.
    (iii) A currently valid petition classifying the married son or 
married daughter of a United States citizen for preference status under 
section 203(a)(3) of the Act shall, upon legal

[[Page 120]]

termination of the beneficiary's marriage, be regarded as having been 
approved under section 203(a)(1) of the Act if the beneficiary is over 
twenty-one years of age. The beneficiary's priority date is the same as 
the date the petition for classification under section 203(a)(3) of the 
Act was properly filed. If the beneficiary is under twenty-one years of 
age, the petition shall be regarded as having been approved for 
classification as an immediate relative under section 201(b) of the Act 
as of the date the petition for classification under section 203(a)(3) 
of the Act was properly filed.
    (2) By the beneficiary's attainment of the age of twenty-one years. 
A currently valid petition classifying the child of a United States 
citizen as an immediate relative under section 201(b) of the Act shall 
be regarded as having been approved for preference status under section 
203(a)(1) of the Act as of the beneficiary's twenty-first birthday. The 
beneficiary's priority date is the same as the date the petition for 
section 201(b) classification was filed.
    (3) By the petitioner's naturalization. Effective upon the date of 
naturalization of a petitioner who had been lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence, a currently valid petition according preference 
status under section 203(a)(2) of the Act to the petitioner's spouse and 
unmarried children under twenty-one years of age shall be regarded as 
having been approved for immediate relative status under section 201(b) 
of the Act. Similarly, a currently valid petition according preference 
status under section 203(a)(2) of the Act for the unmarried son or 
daughter over twenty-one years of age shall be regarded as having been 
approved under section 203(a)(1) of the Act. In any case of conversion 
to classification under section 203(a)(1) of the Act, the beneficiary's 
priority date is the same as the date the petition for classification 
under section 203(a)(2) of the Act was properly filed. A self-petition 
filed under section 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act 
based on the relationship to an abusive lawful permanent resident of the 
United States for classification under section 203(a)(2) of the Act will 
not be affected by the abuser's naturalization and will not be 
automatically converted to a petition for immediate relative 
classification.

Sec. 204.3  Orphans.

    (a) General--(1) Background. This section addresses a number of 
issues that have arisen in the recent past because of the increased 
interest by United States citizens in the adoption of foreign-born 
orphans and is based on applicable provisions of the Act. It should be 
noted that this section was not drafted in connection with possible 
United States ratification and implementation of the Hague Convention on 
Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter-country 
Adoption.
    (2) Overview. The processing and adjudication of orphan cases is a 
Service priority. A child who meets the definition of orphan contained 
in section 101(b)(1)(F) of the Act is eligible for classification as the 
immediate relative of a United States citizen. Petitioning for an orphan 
involves two distinct determinations. The first determination concerns 
the advanced processing application which focuses on the ability of the 
prospective adoptive parents to provide a proper home environment and on 
their suitability as parents. This determination, based primarily on a 
home study and fingerprint checks, is essential for the protection of 
the orphan. The second determination concerns the orphan petition which 
focuses on whether the child is an orphan under section 101(b)(1)(F) of 
the Act. The prospective adoptive parents may submit the documentation 
necessary for each of these determinations separately or at one time, 
depending on when the orphan is identified. An orphan petition cannot be 
approved unless there is a favorable determination on the advanced 
processing application. However, a favorable determination on the 
advanced processing application does not guarantee that the orphan 
petition will be approved. Prospective adoptive parents may consult with 
the local Service office on matters relating to an advanced

[[Page 121]]

processing application and/or orphan petition.
    (b) Definitions. As used in this section, the term:
    Abandonment by both parents means that the parents have willfully 
forsaken all parental rights, obligations, and claims to the child, as 
well as all control over and possession of the child, without intending 
to transfer, or without transferring, these rights to any specific 
person(s). Abandonment must include not only the intention to surrender 
all parental rights, obligations, and claims to the child, and control 
over and possession of the child, but also the actual act of surrending 
such rights, obligations, claims, control, and possession. A 
relinquishment or release by the parents to the prospective adoptive 
parents or for a specific adoption does not constitute abandonment. 
Similarly, the relinquishment or release of the child by the parents to 
a third party for custodial care in anticipation of, or preparation for, 
adoption does not constitute abandonment unless the third party (such as 
a governmental agency, a court of competent jurisdiction, an adoption 
agency, or an orphanage) is authorized under the child welfare laws of 
the foreign-sending country to act in such a capacity. A child who is 
placed temporarily in an orphanage shall not be considered to be 
abandoned if the parents express an intention to retrieve the child, are 
contributing or attempting to contribute to the support of the child, or 
otherwise exhibit ongoing parental interest in the child. A child who 
has been given unconditionally to an orphanage shall be considered to be 
abandoned.
    Adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' household means an 
individual, other than a prospective adoptive parent, over the age of 18 
whose principal or only residence is the home of the prospective 
adoptive parents. This definition excludes any child of the prospective 
adoptive parents, whose principal or only residence is the home of the 
prospective adoptive parents, who reaches his or her eighteenth birthday 
after the prospective adoptive parents have filed the advanced 
processing application (or the advanced processing application 
concurrently with the orphan petition) unless the director has an 
articulable and substantive reason for requiring an evaluation by a home 
study preparer and/or fingerprint check.
    Advanced processing application means Form I-600A (Application for 
Advanced Processing of Orphan Petition) completed in accordance with the 
form's instructions and submitted with the required supporting 
documentation and the fee as required in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1). The 
application must be signed in accordance with the form's instructions by 
the married petitioner and spouse, or by the unmarried petitioner.
    Application is synonymous with advanced processing application.
    Competent authority means a court or governmental agency of a 
foreign-sending country having jurisdiction and authority to make 
decisions in matters of child welfare, including adoption.
    Desertion by both parents means that the parents have willfully 
forsaken their child and have refused to carry out their parental rights 
and obligations and that, as a result, the child has become a ward of a 
competent authority in accordance with the laws of the foreign-sending 
country.
    Disappearance of both parents means that both parents have 
unaccountably or inexplicably passed out of the child's life, their 
whereabouts are unknown, there is no reasonable hope of their 
reappearance, and there has been a reasonable effort to locate them as

foreign-sending country.
    Foreign-sending country means the country of the orphan's 
citizenship, or if he or she is not permanently residing in the country 
of citizenship, the country of the orphan's habitual residence. This 
excludes a country to which the orphan travels temporarily, or to which 
he or she travels either as a prelude to, or in conjunction with, his or 
her adoption and/or immigration to the United States.
    Home study preparer means any party licensed or otherwise authorized 
under the law of the State of the orphan's proposed residence to conduct 
the research and preparation for a home study, including the required

[[Page 122]]

interview(s). This term includes a public agency with authority under 
that State's law in adoption matters, public or private adoption 
agencies licensed or otherwise authorized by the laws of that State to 
place children for adoption, and organizations or individuals licensed 
or otherwise authorized to conduct the research and preparation for a 
home study, including the required personal interview(s), under the laws 
of the State of the orphan's proposed residence. In the case of an 
orphan whose adoption has been finalized abroad and whose adoptive 
parents reside abroad, the home study preparer includes any party 
licensed or otherwise authorized to conduct home studies under the law 
of any State of the United States, or any party licensed or otherwise 
authorized by the foreign country's adoption authorities to conduct home 
studies under the laws of the foreign country.
    Incapable of providing proper care means that a sole or surviving 
parent is unable to provide for the child's basic needs, consistent with 
the local standards of the foreign sending country.
    Loss from both parents means the involuntary severance or detachment 
of the child from the parents in a permanent manner such as that caused 
by a natural disaster, civil unrest, or other calamitous event beyond 
the control of the parents, as verified by a competent authority in 
accordance with the laws of the foreign sending country.
    Orphan petition means Form I-600 (Petition to Classify Orphan as an 
Immediate Relative). The petition must be completed in accordance with 
the form's instructions and submitted with the required supporting 
documentation and, if there is not an advanced processing application 
approved within the previous 18 months or pending, the fee as required 
in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1). The petition must be signed in accordance with the 
form's instructions by the married petitioner and spouse, or the 
unmarried petitioner.
    Overseas site means the Department of State immigrant visa-issuing 
post having jurisdiction over the orphan's residence, or in foreign 
countries in which the Services has an office or offices, the Service 
office having jurisdiction over the orphan's residence.
    Petition is synonymous with orphan petition.
    Petitioner means a married United States citizen of any age, or an 
unmarried United States citizen who is at least 24 years old at the time 
he or she files the advanced processing application and at least 25 
years old at the time he or she files the orphan petition. In the case 
of a married couple, both of whom are United States citizens, either 
party may be the petitioner.
    Prospective adoptive parents means a married United States citizen 
of any age and his or her spouse of any age, or an unmarried United 
States citizen who is at least 24 years old at the time he or she files 
the advanced processing application and at least 25 years old at the

lawful immigration status if residing in the United States.
    Separation from both parents means the involuntary severance of the 
child from his or her parents by action of a competent authority for 
good cause and in accordance with the laws of the foreign-sending 
country. The parents must have been properly notified and granted the 
opportunity to contest such action. The termination of all parental 
rights and obligations must be permanent and unconditional.
    Sole parent means the mother when it is established that the child 
is illegitimate and has not acquired a parent within the meaning of 
section 101(b)(2) of the Act. An illegitimate child shall be considered 
to have a sole parent if his or her father has severed all parental 
ties, rights, duties, and obligations to the child, or if his or her 
father has, in writing, irrevocably released the child for emigration 
and adoption. This definition is not applicable to children born in 
countries which make no distinction between a child born in or out of 
wedlock, since all such children are considered to be legitimate. In all 
cases, a sole parent must be incapable of providing proper care as that 
term is defined in this section.

[[Page 123]]

    Surviving parent means the child's living parent when the child's 
other parent is dead, and the child has not acquired another parent 
within the meaning of section 101(b)(2) of the Act. In all cases, a 
surviving parent must be incapable of providing proper care as that term 
is defined in this section.
    (c) Supporting documentation for an advanced processing application. 
The prospective adoptive parents may file an advanced processing 
application before an orphan is identified in order to secure the 
necessary clearance to file the orphan petition. Any document not in the 
English language must be accompanied by a certified English translation.
    (1) Required supporting documentation that must accompany the 
advanced processing application. The following supporting documentation 
must accompany an advanced processing application at the time of filing:
    (i) Evidence of the petitioner's United States citizenship as set 
forth in Sec. 204.1(g) and, if the petitioner is married and the married 
couple is residing in the United States, evidence of the spouse's United 
States citizenship or lawful immigration status;
    (ii) A copy of the petitioner's marriage certificate to his or her 
spouse, if the petitioner is currently married;
    (iii) Evidence of legal termination of all previous marriages for 
the petitioner and/or spouse, if previously married; and
    (iv) Evidence of compliance with preadoption requirements, if any, 
of the State of the orphan's proposed residence in cases where it is 
known that there will be no adoption abroad, or that both members of the 
married prospective adoptive couple or the unmarried prospective 
adoptive parent will not personally see the child prior to, or during, 
the adoption abroad, and/or that the adoption abroad will not be full 
and final. Any preadoption requirements which cannot be met at the time 
the advanced processing application is filed because of operation of 
State law must be noted and explained when the application is filed. 
Preadoption requirements must be met at the time the petition is filed, 
except for those which cannot be met until the orphan arrives in the 
United States.
    (2) Home study. The home study must comply with the requirements 
contained in paragraph (e) of this section. If the home study is not 
submitted when the advanced processing application is filed, it must be 
submitted within one year of the filing date of the advanced processing 
application, or the application will be denied pursuant to paragraph 
(h)(5) of this section.
    (3) After receipt of a properly filed advanced processing 
application, the Service will fingerprint each member of the married 
prospective adoptive couple or the unmarried prospective adoptive 
parent, as prescribed in Sec. 103.2(e) of this chapter. The Service will 
also fingerprint each additional adult member of the prospective 
adoptive parents' household, as prescribed in Sec. 103.2(e) of this 
chapter. The Service may waive the requirement that each additional 
adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' household be 
fingerprinted when it determines that such adult is physically unable to 
be fingerprinted because of age or medical condition.
    (d) Supporting documentation for a petition for an identified 
orphan. Any document not in the English language must be accompanied by 
a certified English translation. If an orphan has been identified for 
adoption and the advanced processing application is pending, the 
prospective adoptive parents may file the orphan petition at the Service 
office where the application is pending. The prospective adoptive 
parents who have an approved advanced processing application must file 
an orphan petition and all supporting documents within eighteen months 
of the date of the approval of the advanced processing application. If 
the prospective adoptive parents fail to file the orphan petition within 
the eighteen-month period, the advanced processing application shall be 
deemed abandoned pursuant to paragraph (h)(7) of this section. If the 
prospective adoptive parents file the orphan petition after the 
eighteen-month period, the petition shall be denied pursuant to 
paragraph (h)(13) of this section. Prospective adoptive parents who do 
not have an advanced processing application approved or pending may file 
the application and petition concurrently on one Form I-600 if they

[[Page 124]]

have identified an orphan for adoption. An orphan petition must be 
accompanied by full documentation as follows:
    (1) Filing an orphan petition after the advanced processing 
application has been approved. The following supporting documentation 
must accompany an orphan petition filed after approval of the advanced 
processing application:
    (i) Evidence of approval of the advanced processing application;
    (ii) The orphan's birth certificate, or if such a certificate is not 
available, an explanation together with other proof of identity and age;
    (iii) Evidence that the child is an orphan as appropriate to the 
case:
    (A) Evidence that the orphan has been abandoned or deserted by, 
separated or lost from both parents, or that both parents have 
disappeared as those terms are defined in paragraph (b) of this section; 
or
    (B) The death certificate(s) of the orphan's parent(s), if 
applicable;
    (C) If the orphan has only a sole or surviving parent, as defined in 
paragraph (b) of this section, evidence of this fact and evidence that 
the sole or surviving parent is incapable of providing for the orphan's 
care and has irrevocably released the orphan for emigration and 
adoption; and
    (iv) Evidence of adoption abroad or that the prospective adoptive 
parents have, or a person or entity working on their behalf has, custody 
of the orphan for emigration and adoption in accordance with the laws of 
the foreign-sending country:
    (A) A legible, certified copy of the adoption decree, if the orphan 
has been the subject of a full and final adoption abroad, and evidence 
that the unmarried petitioner, or married petitioner and spouse, saw the 
orphan prior to or during the adoption proceeding abroad; or
    (B) If the orphan is to be adopted in the United States because 
there was no adoption abroad, or the unmarried petitioner, or married 
petitioner and spouse, did not personally see the orphan prior to or 
during the adoption proceeding abroad, and/or the adoption abroad was 
not full and final:
    (1) Evidence that the prospective adoptive parents have, or a person 
or entity working on their behalf has, secured custody of the orphan in 
accordance with the laws of the foreign-sending country;
    (2) An irrevocable release of the orphan for emigration and adoption 
from the person, organization, or competent authority which had the 
immediately previous legal custody or control over the orphan if the 
adoption was not full and final under the laws of the foreign-sending 
country;
    (3) Evidence of compliance with all preadoption requirements, if 
any, of the State of the orphan's proposed residence. (Any such 
requirements that cannot be complied with prior to the orphan's arrival 
in the United States because of State law must be noted and explained); 
and
    (4) Evidence that the State of the orphan's proposed residence 
allows readoption or provides for judicial recognition of the adoption 
abroad if there was an adoption abroad which does not meet statutory 
requirements pursuant to section 101(b)(1)(F) of the Act, because the 
unmarried petitioner, or married petitioner and spouse, did not 
personally see the orphan prior to or during the adoption proceeding 
abroad, and/or the adoption abroad was not full and final.
    (2) Filing an orphan petition while the advanced processing 
application is pending. An orphan petition filed while an advanced 
processing application is pending must be filed at the Service office 
where the application is pending. The following supporting documentation 
must accompany an orphan petition filed while the advanced processing 
application is pending:
    (i) A photocopy of the fee receipt relating to the advanced 
processing application, or if not available, other evidence that the 
advanced processing application has been filed, such as a statement 
including the date when the application was filed;
    (ii) The home study, if not already submitted; and
    (iii) The supporting documentation for an orphan petition required 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except for paragraph (d)(1)(i) of 
this section.
    (3) Filing an orphan petition concurrently with the advanced 
processing application. A petition filed concurrently

[[Page 125]]

with the advanced processing application must be submitted on Form I-
600, completed and signed in accordance with the form's instructions. 
(Under this concurrent procedure, Form I-600 serves as both the Forms I-
600A and I-600, and the prospective adoptive parents should not file a 
separate Form I-600A). The following supporting documentation must 
accompany a petition filed concurrently with the application under this 
provision:
    (i) The supporting documentation for an advanced processing 
application required in paragraph (c) of this section; and
    (ii) The supporting documentation for an orphan petition required in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except for paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section.
    (e) Home study requirements. For immigration purposes, a home study 
is a process for screening and preparing prospective adoptive parents 
who are interested in adopting an orphan from another country. The home 
study should be tailored to the particular situation of the prospective 
adoptive parents: for example, a family which previously has adopted 
children will require different preparation than a family that has no 
adopted children. If there are any additional adult members of the 
prospective adoptive parents' household, the home study must address 
this fact. The home study preparer must interview any additional adult 
member of the prospective adoptive parents' household and assess him or 
her in light of the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2)(i), (iii), 
(iv), and (v) of this section. A home study must be conducted by a home 
study preparer, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The home 
study, or the most recent update to the home study, must not be more 
than six months old at the time the home study is submitted to the 
Service. Only one copy of the home study must be submitted to the 
Service. Ordinarily, a home study (or a home study and update as 
discussed above) will not have to be updated after it has been submitted 
to the Service unless there is a significant change in the household of 
the prospective adoptive parents such as a change in residence, marital 
status, criminal history, financial resources, and/or the addition of 
one or more children or other dependents to the family prior to the 
orphan's immigration into the United States. In addition to meeting any 
State, professional, or agency requirements, a home study must include 
the following:
    (1) Personal interview(s) and home visit(s). The home study preparer 
must conduct at least one interview in person, and at least one home 
visit, with the prospective adoptive couple or the unmarried prospective 
adoptive parent. Each additional adult member of the prospective 
adoptive parents' household must also be interviewed in person at least 
once. The home study report must state the number of such interviews and 
visits, and must specify any other contacts with the prospective 
adoptive parents and any adult member of the prospective adoptive 
parents' household.
    (2) Assessment of the capabilities of the prospective adoptive 
parents to properly parent the orphan. The home study must include a 
discussion of the following areas:
    (i) Assessment of the physical, mental, and emotional capabilities 
of the prospective adoptive parents to properly parent the orphan. The 
home study preparer must make an initial assessment of how the physical, 
mental, and emotional health of the prospective adoptive parents would 
affect their ability to properly care for the prospective orphan. If the 
home study preparer determines that there are areas beyond his or her 
expertise which need to be addressed, he or she shall refer the 
prospective adoptive parents to an appropriate licensed professional, 
such as a physician, psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or clinical 
social worker for an evaluation. Some problems may not necessarily 
disqualify applicants. For example, certain physical limitations may 
indicate which categories of children may be most appropriately placed 
with certain prospective adoptive parents. Certain mental and emotional 
health problems may be successfully treated. The home study must include 
the home study preparer's assessment of any such potential problem 
areas, a copy of any outside evaluation(s), and the home study 
preparer's recommended restrictions, if any, on the

[[Page 126]]

characteristics of the child to be placed in the home. Additionally, the 
home study preparer must apply the requirements of this paragraph to 
each adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' household.
    (ii) Assessment of the finances of the prospective adoptive parents. 
The financial assessment must include a description of the income, 
financial resources, debts, and expenses of the prospective adoptive 
parents. A statement concerning the evidence that was considered to 
verify the source and amount of income and financial resources must be 
included. Any income designated for the support of one or more children 
in the care and custody of the prospective adoptive parents, such as 
funds for foster care, or any income designated for the support of 
another member of the household must not be counted towards the 
financial resources available for the support of a prospective orphan. 
The Service will not routinely require a detailed financial statement or 
supporting financial documents. However, should the need arise, the 
Service reserves the right to ask for such detailed documentation.
    (iii) History of abuse and/or violence.
    (A) Screening for abuse and violence.
    (1) Checking available child abuse registries. The home study 
preparer must ensure that a check of each prospective adoptive parent 
and each adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' household has 
been made with available child abuse registries and must include in the 
home study the results of the checks including, if applicable, a report 
that no record was found to exist. Depending on the access allowed by 
the state of proposed residence of the orphan, the home study preparer 
must take one of the following courses of action:
    (i) If the home study preparer is allowed access to information from 
the child abuse registries, he or she shall make the appropriate checks 
for each of the prospective adoptive parents and for each adult member 
of the prospective adoptive parents' household;
    (ii) If the State requires the home study preparer to secure 
permission from each of the prospective adoptive parents and for each 
adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' household before 
gaining access to information in such registries, the home study 
preparer must secure such permission from those individuals, and make 
the appropriate checks;
    (iii) If the State will only release information directly to each of 
the prospective adoptive parents and directly to the adult member of the 
prospective adoptive parents' household, those individuals must secure 
such information and provide it to the home study preparer. The home 
study preparer must include the results of these checks in the home 
study;
    (iv) If the State will not release information to either the home 
study preparer or the prospective adoptive parents and the adult members 
of the prospective adoptive parents' household, this must be noted in 
the home study; or
    (v) If the State does not have a child abuse registry, this must be 
noted in the home study.
    (2) Inquiring about abuse and violence. The home study preparer must 
ask each prospective adoptive parent whether he or she has a history of 
substance abuse, sexual or child abuse, or domestic violence, even if it 
did not result in an arrest or conviction. The home study preparer must 
include each prospective adoptive parent's response to the questions 
regarding abuse and violence. Additionally, the home study preparer must 
apply the requirements of this paragraph to each adult member of the 
prospective adoptive parents' household.
    (B) Information concerning history of abuse and/or violence. If the 
petitioner and/or spouse, if married, disclose(s) any history of abuse 
and/or violence as set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section, or if, in the absence of such disclosure, the home study 
preparer becomes aware of any of the foregoing, the home study report 
must contain an evaluation of the suitability of the home for adoptive 
placement of an orphan in light of this history. This evaluation must 
include information concerning all arrests or convictions or history of 
substance abuse, sexual or child abuse, and/or domestic violence

[[Page 127]]

and the date of each occurrence. A certified copy of the documentation 
showing the final disposition of each incident, which resulted in 
arrest, indictment, conviction, and/or any other judicial or 
administrative action, must accompany the home study. Additionally, the 
prospective adoptive parent must submit a signed statement giving 
details including mitigating circumstances, if any, about each incident. 
The home study preparer must apply the requirements of this paragraph to 
each adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' household.
    (C) Evidence of rehabilitation. If a prospective adoptive parent has 
a history of substance abuse, sexual or child abuse, and/or domestic 
violence, the home study preparer may, nevertheless, make a favorable 
finding if the prospective adoptive parent has demonstrated appropriate 
rehabilitation. In such a case, a discussion of such rehabilitation 
which demonstrates that the prospective adoptive parent is and will be 
able to provide proper care for the orphan must be included in the home 
study. Evidence of rehabilitation may include an evaluation of the 
seriousness of the arrest(s), conviction(s), or history of abuse, the 
number of such incidents, the length of time since the last incident, 
and any type of counseling or rehabilitation programs which have been 
successfully completed. Evidence of rehabilitation may also be provided 
by an appropriate licensed professional, such as a psychiatrist, 
clinical psychologist, or clinical social worker. The home study report 
must include all facts and circumstances which the home study preparer 
has considered, as well as the preparer's reasons for a favorable 
decision regarding the prospective adoptive parent. Additionally, if any 
adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' household has a 
history of substance abuse, sexual or child abuse, and/or domestic 
violence, the home study preparer must apply the requirements of this 
paragraph to that adult member of the prospective adoptive parents' 
household.
    (D) Failure to disclose or cooperate. Failure to disclose an arrest, 
conviction, or history of substance abuse, sexual or child abuse, and/or 
domestic violence by the prospective adoptive parents or an adult member 
of the prospective adoptive parents' household to the home study 
preparer and to the Service, may result in the denial of the advanced 
processing application or, if applicable, the application and orphan 
petition, pursuant to paragraph (h)(4) of this section. Failure by the 
prospective adoptive parents or an adult member of the prospective 
adoptive parents' household to cooperate in having available child abuse 
registries in accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A)(1) and 
(e)(2)(iii)(A)(1)(i) through (e)(2)(iii)(A)(1)(iii) of this section will 
result in the denial of the advanced processing application or, if 
applicable, the application and orphan petition, pursuant to paragraph 
(h)(4) of this section.
    (iv) Previous rejection for adoption or prior unfavorable home 
study. The home study preparer must ask each prospective adoptive parent 
whether he or she previously has been rejected as a prospective adoptive 
parent or has been the subject of an unfavorable home study, and must 
include each prospective adoptive parent's response to this question in 
the home study report. If a prospective adoptive parent previously has 
been rejected or found to be unsuitable, the reasons for such a finding 
must be set forth as well as the reason(s) why he or she is not being 
favorably considered as a prospective adoptive parent. A copy of each 
previous rejection and/or unfavorable home study must be attached to the 
favorable home study. Additionally, the home study preparer must apply 
the requirements of this paragraph to each adult member of the 
prospective adoptive parents' household.
    (v) Criminal history. The prospective adoptive parents and the adult 
members of the prospective adoptive parents' household are expected to 
disclose to the home study preparer and the Service any history of 
arrest and/or conviction early in the advanced processing procedure. 
Failure to do so may result in denial pursuant to paragraph (h)(4) of 
this section or in delays. Early disclosure provides the prospective 
adoptive parents with the best opportunity to gather and present 
evidence, and it gives the home study preparer

[[Page 128]]

and the Service the opportunity to properly evaluate the criminal record 
in light of such evidence. When such information is not presented early 
in the process, it comes to light when the fingerprint checks are 
received by the Service. By that time, the prospective adoptive parents 
are usually well into preadoption proceedings of identifying a child and 
may even have firm travel plans. At times, the travel plans have to be 
rescheduled while the issues raised by the criminal record are 
addressed. It is in the best interests of all parties to have any 
criminal records disclosed and resolved early in the process.
    (3) Living accommodations. The home study must include a detailed 
description of the living accommodations where the prospective adoptive 
parents currently reside. If the prospective adoptive parents are 
planning to move, the home study must include a description of the 
living accommodations where the child will reside with the prospective 
adoptive parents, if known. If the prospective adoptive parents are 
residing abroad at the time of the home study, the home study must 
include a description of the living accommodations where the child will 
reside in the United States with the prospective adoptive parents, if 
known. Each description must include an assessment of the suitability of 
accommodations for a child and a determination whether such space meets 
applicable State requirements, if any.
    (4) Handicapped or special needs orphan. A home study conducted in 
conjunction with the proposed adoption of a special needs or handicapped 
orphan must contain a discussion of the prospective adoptive parents' 
preparation, willingness, and ability to provide proper care for such an 
orphan.
    (5) Summary of the counseling given and plans for post-placement 
counseling. The home study must include a summary of the counseling 
given to prepare the prospective adoptive parents for an international 
adoption and any plans for post-placement counseling. Such preadoption 
counseling must include a discussion of the processing, expenses, 
difficulties, and delays associated with international adoptions.
    (6) Specific approval of the prospective adoptive parents for 
adoption. If the home study preparer's findings are favorable, the home 
study must contain his or her specific approval of the prospective 
adoptive parents for adoption and a discussion of the reasons for such 
approval. The home study must include the number of orphans which the 
prospective adoptive parents may adopt. The home study must state 
whether there are any specific restrictions to the adoption such as 
nationality, age, or gender of the orphan. If the home study preparer 
has approved the prospective parents for a handicapped or special needs 
adoption, this fact must be clearly stated.
    (7) Home study preparer's certification and statement of authority 
to conduct home studies. The home study must include a statement in 
which the home study preparer certifies that he or she is licensed or 
otherwise authorized by the State of the orphan's proposed residence to 
research and prepare home studies. In the case of an orphan whose 
adoption was finalized abroad and whose adoptive parents reside abroad, 
the home study preparer must certify that he or she is licensed or 
otherwise authorized to conduct home studies under the law of any State 
of the United States, or authorized by the adoption authorities of the 
foreign country to conduct home studies under the laws of the foreign 
country. In every case, this statement must cite the State or country 
under whose authority the home study preparer is licensed or authorized, 
the specific law or regulation authorizing the preparer to conduct home 
studies, the license number, if any, and the expiration date, if any, of 
this authorization or license.
    (8) Review of home study. If the prospective adoptive parents reside 
in a State which requires the State to review the home study, such a 
review must occur and be documented before the home study is submitted 
to the Service. If the prospective adoptive parents reside abroad, an 
appropriate public or private adoption agency licensed, or otherwise 
authorized, by any State of the United States to place children for 
adoption, must review and

[[Page 129]]

favorably recommend the home study before it is submitted to the 
Service.
    (9) Home study updates and amendments--(i) Updates. If the home 
study is more than six months old at the time it would be submitted to 
the Service, the prospective adoptive parents must ensure that it is 
updated by a home study preparer before it is submitted to the Service. 
Each update must include screening in accordance with paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (ii) Amendments. If there have been any significant changes, such as 
a change in the residence of the prospective adoptive parents, marital 
status, criminal history, financial resources, and/or the addition of 
one or more children or other dependents to the family, the prospective 
adoptive parents must ensure that the home study is amended by a home 
study preparer to reflect any such changes. If the orphan's proposed 
State of residence has changed, the home study amendment must contain a 
recommendation in accordance with paragraph (e)(8) of this section, if 
required by State law. Any preadoption requirements of the new State 
must be complied with in the case of an orphan coming to the United 
States to be adopted.
    (10) ``Grandfather'' provision for home study. A home study properly 
completed in conformance with the regulations in force prior to 
September 30, 1994, shall be considered acceptable if submitted to the 
Service within 90 days of September 30, 1994. Any such home study 
accepted under this ``grandfather'' provision must include screening in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. 
Additionally, any such home study submitted under this ``grandfather'' 
provision which is more than six months old at the time of its 
submission must be amended or updated pursuant to the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(9) of this section.
    (f) State preadoption requirements--(1) General. Many States have 
preadoption requirements which, under the Act, must be complied with in 
every case in which a child is coming to such a State as an orphan to be 
adopted in the United States.
    (2) Child coming to be adopted in the United States. An orphan is 
coming to be adopted in the United States if he or she will not be or 
has not been adopted abroad, or if the unmarried petitioner or both the 
married petitioner and spouse did not or will not personally see the 
orphan prior to or during the adoption proceeding abroad, and/or if the 
adoption abroad will not be, or was not, full and final. If the 
prospective adoptive parents reside in a State with preadoption 
requirements and they plan to have the child come to the United States 
for adoption, they must submit evidence of compliance with the State's 
preadoption requirements to the Service. Any preadoption requirements 
which by operation of State law cannot be met before filing the advanced 
processing application must be noted. Such requirements must be met 
prior to filing the petition, except for those which cannot be met by 
operation of State law until the orphan is physically in the United 
States. Those requirements which cannot be met until the orphan is 
physically present in the United States must be noted.
    (3) Special circumstances. If both members of the prospective 
adoptive couple or the unmarried prospective adoptive parent intend to 
travel abroad to see the child prior to or during the adoption, the Act 
permits the application and/or petition, if otherwise approvable, to be 
approved without preadoption requirements having been met. However, if 
plans change and both members of the prospective adoptive couple or the 
unmarried prospective adoptive parent fail to see the child prior to or 
during the adoption, then preadoption requirements must be met before 
the immigrant visa can be issued, except for those preadoption 
requirements that cannot be met until the child is physically in the 
United States because of operation of State law.
    (4) Evidence of compliance. In every case where compliance with 
preadoption requirements is required, the evidence of compliance must be 
in accordance with applicable State law, regulation, and procedure.

    (g) Where to file--(1) Where to file an advanced processing 
application. An advanced processing application must be filed with the 
Service as follows:
    (i) Prospective adoptive parents residing in the United States. If 
the prospective adoptive parents reside in the United States, the 
application must be filed with the Service office having jurisdiction 
over their place of residence.
    (ii) Prospective adoptive parents residing in Canada. If the 
prospective adoptive parents reside in Canada, the application must be 
filed with the stateside Service office having jurisdiction over the 
proposed place of residence of the prospective adoptive parents in the 
United States.
    (iii) Prospective adoptive parents residing in a foreign country 
other than Canada. If the prospective adoptive parents reside outside of 
the United States or Canada, the application may be filed with the 
overseas Service office having jurisdiction over the current place of 
residence pursuant to Sec. 100.4(b) of this chapter, or with the 
stateside Service office having jurisdiction over the proposed place of 
residence of the prospective adoptive parents in the United States.
    (2) Where to file an orphan petition when the advanced processing 
application has been approved. An orphan petition must be filed with the 
appropriate Service office or immigrant visa-issuing post of the 
Department of State as follows:
    (i) Prospective adoptive parents residing in the United States who 
do not travel abroad to locate and/or adopt an orphan. If the 
prospective adoptive parents reside in the United States and do not 
travel abroad to locate and/or adopt an orphan, the petition must be 
filed with the Service office having jurisdiction over the place of 
residence of the prospective adoptive parents.
    (ii) Prospective adoptive parents residing in the United States, 
with one or both members of the prospective adoptive couple, or the 
unmarried prospective adoptive parent, traveling abroad to locate and/or 
adopt an orphan. If the prospective adoptive parents reside in the 
United States, and one or both members of the prospective adoptive 
couple, or the unmarried prospective adoptive parent, travel abroad to 
locate and/or adopt an orphan, the petition may be filed with the 
stateside Service office having jurisdiction over the place of residence 
of the prospective adoptive parents in the United States or at the 
overseas site. The petitioner may file the orphan petition at the 
overseas site only while he or she is physically present within the 
jurisdiction of the overseas site. If only one member of a married 
couple, which includes an alien, travels abroad to file the petition, it 
must be the United States citizen who travels abroad so that the 
overseas site will have jurisdiction over the petition.
    (iii) Prospective adoptive parents residing outside the United 
States. Prospective adoptive parents residing outside of the United 
States may file the petition with the overseas site, or with the 
stateside Service office having jurisdiction over the proposed place of 
residence of the prospective adoptive parents in the United States.
    (3) Where to file an orphan petition when the advanced processing 
application is pending. When the advanced processing application is 
pending, the petition must be filed at the Service office at which the 
application is pending.
    (4) Where to file an orphan petition concurrently with the advanced 
processing application. When the petition is filed concurrently with the 
advanced processing application, it must be filed in accordance with the 
instruction for filing an advanced processing application in paragraphs 
(g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (h) Adjudication and decision--(1) ``Grandfather'' provision for 
advanced processing application and/or orphan petition. All applications 
and petitions filed under prior regulations which are filed before and 
are still pending on September 30, 1994, shall be processed and 
adjudicated under the prior regulations.
    (2) Director's responsibility to make an independent decision in an 
advanced processing application. No advanced processing application 
shall be approved unless the director is satisfied that proper care will 
be provided for the orphan. If the director has reason to believe that a 
favorable home study, or update, or both are based on an inadequate or 
erroneous evaluation of all

[[Page 131]]

the facts, he or she shall attempt to resolve the issue with the home 
study preparer, the agency making the recommendation pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(8) of this section, if any, and the prospective adoptive 
parents. If such consultations are unsatisfactory, the director may 
request a review and opinion from the appropriate State Government 
authorities.
    (3) Advanced processing application approved. If the advanced 
processing application is approved, the prospective adoptive parents 
shall be advised in writing. The application and supporting documents 
shall be forwarded to the overseas site where the orphan resides. 
Additionally, if the petitioner advises the director that he or she 
intends to travel abroad to file the petition, telegraphic notification 
shall be sent overseas as detailed in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. 
The approved application shall be valid for eighteen months from its 
approval date. During this time, the prospective adoptive parents may 
file an orphan petition for one orphan without fee. If approved in the 
home study for more than one orphan, the prospective adoptive parents 
may file a petition for each of the additional children, to the maximum 
number approved. If the orphans are siblings, no additional fee is 
required. If the orphans are not siblings, an additional fee is required 
for each orphan beyond the first orphan. Approval of an advanced 
processing application does not guarantee that the orphan petition will 
be approved.
    (4) Advanced processing application denied for failure to disclose 
history of abuse and/or violence, or for failure to disclose a criminal 
history, or for failure to cooperate in checking child abuse registries. 
Failure to disclose an arrest, conviction, or history of substance 
abuse, sexual or child abuse, and/or domestic violence, or a criminal 
history to the home study preparer and to the Service in accordance with 
paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) and (e)(2)(v) of this section may 
result in the denial of the advanced processing application, or if 
applicable, the application and orphan petition filed concurrently. 
Failure by the prospective adoptive parents or an adult member of the 
prospective adoptive parents' household to cooperate in having available 
child abuse registries checked in accordance with paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iii)(A)(1) and (e)(2)(iii)(A)(1)(i) through 
(e)(2)(iii)(A)(1)(iii) of this section will result in the denial of the 
advanced processing application or, if applicable, the application and 
orphan petition filed concurrently. Any new application and/or petition 
filed within a year of such denial will also be denied.
    (5) Advanced processing denied for failure to submit home study. If 
the home study is not submitted within one year of the filing date of 
the advanced processing application, the application shall be denied. 
This action shall be without prejudice to a new filing at any time with 
fee.
    (6) Advanced processing application otherwise denied. If the 
director finds that the prospective adoptive parents have otherwise 
failed to establish eligibility, the applicable provisions of 8 CFR part 
103 regarding a letter of intent to deny, if appropriate, and denial and 
notification of appeal rights shall govern.
    (7) Advanced processing application deemed abandoned for failure to 
file orphan petition within eighteen months of application's approval 
date. If an orphan petition is not properly filed within eighteen months 
of the approval date of the advanced processing application, the 
application shall be deemed abandoned. Supporting documentation shall be 
returned to the prospective adoptive parents, except for documentation 
submitted by a third party which shall be returned to the third party, 
and documentation relating to the fingerprint checks. The director shall 
dispose of documentation relating to fingerprint checks in accordance 
with current policy. Such abandonment shall be without prejudice to a 
new filing at any time with fee.
    (8) Orphan petition approved by a stateside Service office. If the 
orphan petition is approved by a stateside Service office, the 
prospective adoptive parents shall be advised in writing, telegraphic 
notification shall be sent to the immigrant visa-issuing post pursuant 
to paragraph (j)(3) of this section, and the petition and supporting 
documents shall be forwarded to the Department of State.

[[Page 132]]

    (9) Orphan petition approved by an overseas Service office. If the 
orphan petition is approved by an overseas Service office located in the 
country of the orphan's residence, the prospective adoptive parents 
shall be advised in writing, and the petition and supporting documents 
shall be forwarded to the immigrant visa-issuing post having 
jurisdiction for immigrant visa processing.
    (10) Orphan petition approved at an immigrant visa-issuing post. If 
the orphan petition is approved at an immigrant visa-issuing post, the 
post shall initiate immigrant visa processing.
    (11) Orphan petition found to be ``not readily approvable'' by a 
consular officer. If the consular officer adjudicating the orphan 
petition finds that it is ``not readily approvable,'' he or she shall 
notify the prospective adoptive parents in his or her consular district 
and forward the petition, the supporting documents, the findings of the 
I-604 investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this 
section, and any other relating documentation to the overseas Service 
office having jurisdiction pursuant to Sec. 100.4(b) of this chapter.
    (12) Orphan petition denied: petitioner fails to establish that the 
child is an orphan. If the director finds that the petitioner has failed 
to establish that the child is an orphan who is eligible for the 
benefits sought, the applicable provisions of 8 CFR part 103 regarding a 
letter of intent to deny and notification of appeal rights shall govern.
    (13) Orphan petition denied: petitioner files orphan petition more 
than eighteen months after the approval of the advanced processing 
application. If the petitioner files the orphan petition more than 
eighteen months after the approval date of the advanced processing 
application, the petition shall be denied. This action shall be without 
prejudice to a new filing at any time with fee.
    (14) Revocation. The approval of an advanced processing application 
or an orphan petition shall be automatically revoked in accordance with 
Sec. 205.1 of this chapter, if an applicable reason exists. The approval 
of an advanced processing application or an orphan petition shall be 
revoked if the director becomes aware of information that would have 
resulted in denial had it been known at the time of adjudication. Such a 
revocation or any other revocation on notice shall be made in accordance 
with Sec. 205.2 of this chapter.
    (i) Child-buying as a ground for denial. An orphan petition must be 
denied under this section if the prospective adoptive parents or 
adoptive parent(s), or a person or entity working on their behalf, have 
given or will given money or other consideration either directly or 
indirectly to the child's parent(s), agent(s), other individual(s), or 
entity as payment for the child or as an inducement to release the 
child. Nothing in this paragraph shall be regarded as precluding 
reasonable payment for necessary activities such as administrative, 
court, legal, translation, and/or medical services related to the 
adoption proceedings.
    (j) Telegraphic notifications--(1) Telegraphic notification of 
approval of advanced processing application. Unless conditions preclude 
normal telegraphic transmissions, whenever an advanced processing 
application is approved in the United States, the director shall send 
telegraphic notification of the approval to the overseas site if a 
prospective adoptive parent advises the director that the petitioner 
intends to travel abroad and file the orphan petition abroad.
    (2) Requesting a change in visa-issuing posts. If a prospective 
adoptive parent is in the United States, he or she may request the 
director to transfer notification of the approved advanced processing 
application to another visa-issuing post. Such a request shall be made 
on Form I-824 (Application for Action on an Approved Application or 
Petition) with the appropriate fee. The director shall send a Visas 37 
telegram to both the previously and the newly designated posts. The 
following shall be inserted after the last numbered standard entry. 
``To: [insert name of previously designated visa-issuing post or 
overseas Service office]. Pursuant to the petitioner's request, the 
Visas 37 cable previously sent to your post/office in this matter is 
hereby invalidated. The approval is being transferred to the other post/
office addressed in this telegram. Please forward the

[[Page 133]]

approved advanced processing application to that destination.'' Prior to 
sending such a telegram, the director must ensure that the change in 
posts does not alter any conditions of the approval.
    (3) Telegraphic notification of approval of an orphan petition. 
Unless conditions preclude normal telegraphic transmissions, whenever a 
petition is approved by a stateside Service office, the director shall 
send telegraphic notification of the approval to the immigrant visa-
issuing post.
    (k) Other considerations--(1) I-604 investigations. An I-604 
investigation must be completed in every orphan case. The investigation 
must be completed by a consular officer except when the petition is 
properly filed at a Service office overseas, in which case it must be 
completed by a Service officer. An I-604 investigation shall be 
completed before a petition is adjudicated abroad. When a petition is 
adjudicated by a stateside Service office, the I-604 investigation is 
normally completed after the case has been forwarded to visa-issuing 
post abroad. However, in a case where the director of a stateside 
Service office adjudicating the petition has articulable concerns that 
can only be resolved through the I-604 investigation, he or she shall 
request the investigation prior to adjudication. In any case in which 
there are significant differences between the facts presented in the 
approved advanced processing application and/or orphan petition and the 
facts uncovered by the I-604 investigation, the overseas site may 
consult directly with the appropriate Service office. In any instance 
where an I-604 investigation reveals negative information sufficient to 
sustain a denial or revocation, the investigation report, supporting 
documentation, and petition shall be forwarded to the appropriate 
Service office for action. Depending on the circumstances surrounding 
the case, the I-604 investigation shall include, but shall not 
necessarily be limited to, document checks, telephonic checks, 
interview(s) with the natural parent(s), and/or a field investigation.
    (2) Authority of consular officers. An American consular officer is 
authorized to approve an orphan petition if the Service has made a 
favorable determination on the related advanced processing application, 
and the petitioner, who has traveled abroad to a country with no Service 
office in order to locate or adopt an orphan, has properly filed the 
petition, and the petition is approvable. A consular officer, however, 
shall refer any petition which is ``not clearly approvable'' for a 
decision by the Service office having jurisdiction pursuant to 
Sec. 100.4(b) of this chapter. The consular officer's adjudication 
includes all aspects of eligibility for classification as an orphan 
under section 101(b)(1)(F) of the Act other than the issue of the 
ability of the prospective adoptive parents to furnish proper care to 
the orphan. However, if the consular officer has a well-founded and 
substantive reason to believe that the advanced processing approval was 
obtained on the basis of fraud or misrepresentation, or has knowledge of 
a change in material fact subsequent to the approval of the advanced 
processing application, he or she shall consult with the Service office 
having jurisdiction pursuant to Sec. 100.4(b) of this chapter.
    (3) Child in the United States. A child who is in parole status and 
who has not been adopted in the United States is eligible for the 
benefits of an orphan petition when all the requirements of sections 
101(b)(1)(F) and 204 (d) and (e) of the Act have been met. A child in 
the United States either illegally or as a nonimmigrant, however, is 
ineligible for the benefits of an orphan petition.
    (4) Liaison. Each director shall develop and maintain liaison with 
State Government adoption authorities having jurisdiction within his or 
her jurisdiction, including the administrator(s) of the Interstate 
Compact on the Placement of Children, and with other parties with 
interest in international adoptions. Such parties include, but are not 
necessarily limited to, adoption agencies, organizations representing 
adoption agencies, organizations representing adoptive parents, and 
adoption attorneys.

<R05>
Sec. 204.4  Amerasian child of a United States citizen.

    (a) Eligibility. An alien is eligible for benefits under Public Law 
97-359 as the Amerasian child or son or daughter of a United States 
citizen if there is reason to believe that the alien was born in Korea, 
Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, or Thailand after December 31, 1950, and 
before October 22, 1982, and was fathered by a United States citizen. 
Such an alien is eligible for classification under sections 201(b), 
203(a)(1), or 203(a)(3) of the Act as the Amerasian child or son or 
daughter of a United States citizen, pursuant to section 204(f) of the 
Act.
    (b) Filing petition. Any alien claiming to be eligible for benefits 
as an Amerasian under Public Law 97-359, or any person on the alien's 
behalf, may file a petition, Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow, 
or Special Immigrant. Any person filing the petition must either be 
eighteen years of age or older or be an emancipated minor. In addition, 
a corporation incorporated in the United States may file the petition on 
the alien's behalf.
    (c) Jurisdiction. The petition must be filed with the Service office 
having jurisdiction over the place of the alien's intended residence in 
the United States or with the overseas Service office having 
jurisdiction over the alien's residence abroad.
    (d) Two-stage processing--(1) Preliminary processing. Upon initial 
submission of a petition with the documentary evidence required in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the director shall adjudicate the 
petition to determine whether there is reason to believe the beneficiary 
was fathered by a United States citizen. If the preliminary processing 
is completed in a satisfactory manner, the director shall advise the 
petitioner to submit the documentary evidence required in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section and shall fingerprint the sponsor in accordance 
with Sec. 103.2(e) of this chapter. The petitioner must submit all 
required documents within one year of the date of the request or the 
petition will be considered to have been abandoned. To reactivate an 
abandoned petition, the petitioner must submit a new petition, Form I-
360, without the previously submitted documentation, to the Service 
office having jurisdiction over the prior petition.
    (2) Final processing. Upon submission of the documentary evidence 
required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the director shall 
complete the adjudication of the petition.
    (e) One-stage processing. If all documentary evidence required in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section is available when the petition is 
initially filed, the petitioner may submit it at that time. In that 
case, the director shall consider all evidence without using the two-
stage processing procedure set out in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) Evidence to support a petition for an Amerasian child of a 
United States citizen--(1) Two-stage processing of petition--(i) 
Preliminary processing. (A) A petition filed by or on behalf of an 
Amerasian under this section must be accompanied by evidence that the 
beneficiary was born in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea, or Thailand 
after December 31, 1950, and before October 22, 1982. If the beneficiary 
was born in Vietnam, the beneficiary's ID card must be submitted, if 
available. If it is not available, the petitioner must submit an 
affidavit explaining why the beneficiary's ID card is not available. 
Evidence that the beneficiary was fathered by a United States citizen 
must also be presented. The putative father must have been a United 
States citizen at the time of the beneficiary's birth or at the time of 
the father's death, if his death occurred prior to the beneficiary's 
birth. It is not required that the name of the father be given. Such 
evidence may include, but need not be limited to:
    (1) The beneficiary's birth and baptismal certificates or other 
religious documents;
    (2) Local civil records;
    (3) Affidavits from knowledgeable witnesses;
    (4) Letters or evidence of financial support from the beneficiary's 
putative father;
    (5) Photographs of the beneficiary's putative father, especially 
with the beneficiary; and
    (6) Evidence of the putative father's United States citizenship.
    (B) The beneficiary's photograph must be submitted.

[[Page 135]]

    (C) The beneficiary's marriage certificate, if married, and evidence 
of the termination of any previous marriages, if applicable, is 
required.
    (D) If the beneficiary is under eighteen years of age, a written 
irrevocable release for emigration must be received from the 
beneficiary's mother or legal guardian. The mother or legal guardian 
must authorize the placing agency or agencies to make decisions 
necessary for the child's immediate care until the sponsor receives 
custody. Interim costs are the responsibility of the sponsor. The mother 
or legal guardian must show an understanding of the effects of the 
release and state before signing the release whether any money was paid 
or any coercion was used. The signature of the mother or legal guardian 
must be authenticated by the local registrar, the court of minors, or a 
United States immigration or consular officer. The release must include 
the mother's or legal guardian's full name, date and place of birth, and 
current or permanent address.
    (ii) Final processing. (A) If the director notifies the petitioner 
that all preliminary processing has been completed in a satisfactory 
manner, the petitioner must then submit Form I-361, Affidavit of 
Financial Support and Intent to Petition for Legal Custody for Public 
Law 97-359 Amerasian, executed by the beneficiary's sponsor, along with 
the documentary evidence of the sponsor's financial ability required by 
that form. If the beneficiary is under eighteen years of age, the 
sponsor must agree to petition the court having jurisdiction, within 
thirty days of the beneficiary's arrival in the United States, for legal 
custody under the laws of the state where the beneficiary will reside 
until the beneficiary is eighteen years of age. The term ``legal 
custody'' as used in this section means the assumption of responsibility 
for a minor by an adult under the laws of the state in a court of law. 
The sponsor must be a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident 
who is twenty-one years of age or older and who is of good moral 
character.
    (B) Other documents necessary to support the petition are:
    (1) Evidence of the age of the beneficiary's sponsor;
    (2) Evidence of United States citizenship or lawful permanent 
residence of the sponsor as provided in Sec. 204.1(f); and
    (C) If the beneficiary is under eighteen years of age, evidence that 
a public, private, or state agency licensed in the United States to 
place children and actively involved, with recent experience, in the 
intercountry placement of children has arranged the beneficiary's 
placement in the United States. Evidence must also be provided that the 
sponsor with whom the beneficiary is being placed is able to accept the 
beneficiary for care in the sponsor's home under the laws of the state 
of the beneficiary's intended residence. The evidence must demonstrate 
the agency's capability, including financial capability, to arrange the 
placement as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, either 
directly or through cooperative agreement with other suitable 
provider(s) of service.
    (iii) Arrangements for placement of beneficiary under eighteen years 
of age. (A) If the beneficiary is under eighteen years of age, the 
petitioner must submit evidence of the placement arrangement required 
under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. A favorable home study of the 
sponsor is necessary and must be conducted by an agency in the United 
States legally authorized to conduct that study. If the sponsor resides 
outside the United States, a home study of the sponsor must be conducted 
by an agency legally authorized to conduct home studies in the state of 
the sponsor's and beneficiary's intended residence in the United States 
and must be submitted with a favorable recommendation by the agency.
    (B) A plan from the agency to provide follow-up services, including 
mediation and counselling, is required to ensure that the sponsor and 
the beneficiary have satisfactorily adjusted to the placement and to 
determine whether the terms of the sponsorship are being observed. A 
report from the agency concerning the placement, including information 
regarding any family separation or dislocation abroad that results from 
the placement, must also be submitted. In addition, the agency must 
submit to the Director, Outreach Program, Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, Washington, DC, within

[[Page 136]]

90 days of each occurrence, reports of any breakdowns in sponsorship 
that occur, and reports of the steps taken to remedy these breakdowns. 
The petitioner must also submit a statement from the agency:
    (1) Indicating that, before signing the sponsorship agreement, the 
sponsor has been provided a report covering pre-placement screening and 
evaluation, including a health evaluation, of the beneficiary;
    (2) Describing the agency's orientation of both the sponsor and the 
beneficiary on the legal and cultural aspects of the placement;
    (3) Describing the initial facilitation of the placement through 
introduction, translation, and similar services; and
    (4) Describing the contingency plans to place the beneficiary in 
another suitable home if the initial placement fails. The new sponsor 
must execute and submit a Form I-361 to the Service office having 
jurisdiction over the beneficiary's residence in the United States. The 
original sponsor nonetheless retains financial responsibility for the 
beneficiary under the terms of the guarantee of financial support and 
intent to petition for legal custody which that sponsor executed, unless 
that responsibility is assumed by a new sponsor. In the event that the 
new sponsor does not comply with the terms of the new guarantee of 
financial support and intent to petition for legal custody and if, for 
any reason, that guarantee is not enforced, the original sponsor again 
becomes financially responsible for the beneficiary.
    (2) One-stage processing of petition. If the petitioner chooses to 
have the petition processed under the one-stage processing procedure 
described in paragraph (e) of this section, the petitioner must submit 
all evidence required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (g) Decision--(1) General. The director shall notify the petitioner 
of the decision and, if the petition is denied, of the reasons for the 
denial. If the petition is denied, the petitioner may appeal the 
decision under part 103 of this chapter.
    (2) Denial upon completion of preliminary processing. The director 
may deny the petition upon completion of the preliminary processing 
under paragraph (d) of this section for:
    (i) Failure to establish that there is reason to believe the alien 
was fathered by a United States citizen; or
    (ii) Failure to meet the sponsorship requirements if the 
fingerprints of the sponsor, required in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, were submitted during the preliminary processing and the 
completed background check of the sponsor discloses adverse information 
resulting in a finding that the sponsor is not of good moral character.
    (3) Denial upon completion of final processing. The director may 
deny the petition upon completion of final processing if it is 
determined that the sponsorship requirements, or one or more of the 
other applicable requirements, have not been met.
    (4) Denial upon completion of one-stage processing. The director may 
deny the petition upon completion of all processing if any of the 
applicable requirements in a case being processed under the one-stage 
processing described in paragraph (e) of this section are not met.
    (h) Classification of Public Law 97-359 Amerasian. If the petition 
is approved the beneficiary is classified as follows:
    (1) An unmarried beneficiary under the age of twenty-one is 
classified as the child of a United States citizen under section 201(b) 
of the Act;
    (2) An unmarried beneficiary twenty-one years of age or older is 
classified as the unmarried son or daughter of a United States citizen 
under section 203(a)(1) of the Act; and
    (3) A married beneficiary is classified as the married son or 
daughter of a United States citizen under section 203(a)(3) of the Act.
    (i) Enforcement of affidavit of financial support and intent to 
petition for legal custody. A guarantee of financial support and intent 
to petition for legal custody on Form I-361 may be enforced against the 
alien's sponsor in a civil suit brought by the Attorney General in the

Sec. 204.5  Petitions for employment-based immigrants.

    (a) General. A petition to classify an alien under section 
203(b)(1), 203(b)(2), or 203(b)(3) of the Act must be filed on Form I-
140, Petition for Immigrant Worker. A petition to classify an alien 
under section 203(b)(4) (as it relates to special immigrants under 
section 101(a)(27)(C)) must be filed on kForm I-360, Petition for 
Amerasian, Widow, or Special Immigrant. A separate Form I-140 or I-360 
must be filed for each beneficiary, accompanied by the applicable fee. A 
petition is considered properly filed if it is:
    (1) Accepted for processing under the provisions of part 103;
    (2) Accompanied by any required individual labor certification, 
application for Schedule A designation, or evidence that the alien's 
occupation qualifies as a shortage occupation within the Department of 
Labor's Labor Market Information Pilot Program; and
    (3) Accompanied by any other required supporting documentation.
    (b) Jurisdiction. Form I-140 or I-360 must be filed with the Service 
Center having jurisdiction over the intended place of employment, unless 
specifically designated for local filing by the Associate Commissioner 
for Examinations.
    (c) Filing petition. Any United States employer desiring and 
intending to employ an alien may file a petition for classification of 
the alien under section 203(b)(1)(B), 203(b)(1)(C), 203(b)(2), or 
203(b)(3) of the Act. An alien, or any person in the alien's behalf, may 
file a petition for classification under section 203(b)(1)(A) or 
203(b)(4) of the Act (as it relates to special immigrants under section 
101(a)(27)(C) of the Act).
    (d) Priority date. The priority date of any petition filed for 
classification under section 203(b) of the Act which is accompanied by 
an individual labor certification from the Department of Labor shall be 
the date the request for certification was accepted for processing by 
any office within the employment service system of the Department of 
Labor. The priority date of any petition filed for classification under 
section 203(b) of the Act which is accompanied by an application for 
Schedule A designation or with evidence that the alien's occupation is a 
shortage occupation within the Department of Labor's Labor Market 
Information Pilot Program shall be the date the completed, signed 
petition (including all initial evidence and the correct fee) is 
properly filed with the Service. The priority date of a petition filed 
for classification as a special immigrant under section 203(b)(4) of the 
Act shall be the date the completed, signed petition (including all 
initial evidence and the correct fee) is properly filed with the 
Service. The priority date of an alien who filed for classification as a 
special immigrant prior to October 1, 1991, and who is the beneficiary 
of an approved I-360 petition after October 1, 1991, shall be the date 
the alien applied for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status. In the 
case of a special immigrant alien who applied for adjustment before 
October 1, 1991, Form I-360 may be accepted and adjudicated at a Service 
District Office or sub-office.
    (e) Retention of section 203(b) (1), (2), or (3) priority date. A 
petition approved on behalf of an alien under sections 203(b) (1), (2), 
or (3) of the Act accords the alien the priority date of the approved 
petition for any subsequently filed petition for any classification 
under sections 203(b) (1), (2), or (3) of the Act for which the alien 
may qualify. In the event that the alien is the beneficiary of multiple 
petitions under sections 203(b) (1), (2), or (3) of the Act, the alien 
shall be entitled to the earliest priority date. A petition revoked 
under sections 204(e) or 205 of the Act will not confer a priority date, 
nor will any priority

[[Page 138]]

date be established as a result of a denied petition. A priority date is 
not transferable to another alien.
    (f) Maintaining the priority date of a third or sixth preference 
petition filed prior to October 1, 1991. Any petition filed before 
October 1, 1991, and approved on any date, to accord status under 
section 203(a)(3) or 203(a)(6) of the Act, as in effect before October 
1, 1991, shall be deemed a petition approved to accord status under 
section 203(b)(2) or within the appropriate classification under section 
203(b)(3), respectively, of the Act as in effect on or after October 1, 
1991, provided that the alien applies for an immigrant visa or 
adjustment of status within the two years following notification that an 
immigrant visa is immediately available for his or her use.
    (g) Initial evidence--(1) General. Specific requirements for initial 
supporting documents for the various employment-based immigrant 
classifications are set forth in this section. In general, ordinary 
legible photocopies of such documents (except for labor certifications 
from the Department of Labor) will be acceptable for initial filing and 
approval. However, at the discretion of the director, original documents 
may be required in individual cases. Evidence relating to qualifying 
experience or training shall be in the form of letter(s) from current or 
former employer(s) or trainer(s) and shall include the name, address, 
and title of the writer, and a specific description of the duties 
performed by the alien or of the training received. If such evidence is 
unavailable, other documentation relating to the alien's experience or 
training will be considered.
    (2) Ability of prospective employer to pay wage. Any petition filed 
by or for an employment-based immigrant which requires an offer of 
employment must be accompanied by evidence that the prospective United 
States employer has the ability to pay the proffered wage. The 
petitioner must demonstrate this ability at the time the priority date 
is established and continuing until the beneficiary obtains lawful 
permanent residence. Evidence of this ability shall be either in the 
form of copies of annual reports, federal tax returns, or audited 
financial statements. In a case where the prospective United States 
employer employs 100 or more workers, the director may accept a 
statement from a financial officer of the organization which establishes 
the prospective employer's ability to pay the proffered wage. In 
appropriate cases, additional evidence, such as profit/loss statements, 
bank account records, or personnel records, may be submitted by the 
petitioner or requested by the Service.
    (h) Aliens with extraordinary ability. (1) An alien, or any person 
on behalf of the alien, may file an I-140 visa petition for 
classification under section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Act as an alien of

athletics.

the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence shall 
include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary 
translation;
    (iv) Evidence of the alien's participation, either individually or 
on a panel, as a judge of the work of others in the

[[Page 139]]

same or an allied field of specification for which classification is

    (4) If the above standards do not readily apply to the beneficiary's 
occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish 
the beneficiary's eligibility.
    (5) No offer of employment required. Neither an offer for employment 
in the United States nor a labor certification is required for this 
classification; however, the petition must be accompanied by clear 
evidence that the alien is coming to the United States to continue work 
in the area of expertise. Such evidence may include letter(s) from 
prospective employer(s), evidence of prearranged commitments such as 
contracts, or a statement from the beneficiary detailing plans on how he 
or she intends to continue his or her work in the United States.

academic field;
    (ii) Evidence that the alien has at least three years of experience

section 203(b)(2) of the Act as an alien who is a member of the 
professions holding an advanced degree or an alien of exceptional 
ability in the sciences, arts, or business. If an alien is claiming 
exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business and is seeking an 
exemption from the requirement of a job offer in the United States 
pursuant to section 203(b)(2)(B) of the Act, then the alien, or anyone 
in the alien's behalf, may be the petitioner.
    (2) Definitions. As used in this section: Advanced degree means any 
United States academic or professional degree or a foreign equivalent 
degree above that of baccalaureate. A United States baccalaureate degree 
or a foreign equivalent degree followed by at least five years of 
progressive experience in the specialty shall be considered the 
equivalent of a master's degree. If a doctoral degree is customarily 
required by the specialty, the alien must have a United States doctorate 
or a foreign equivalent degree.
    Exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business means a 
degree of expertise significantly above that ordinarily encountered in 
the sciences, arts, or business.

[[Page 142]]

    Profession means one of the occupations listed in section 101(a)(32) 
of the Act, as well as any occupation for which a United States 
baccalaureate degree or its foreign equivalent is the minimum

advanced degree or an alien of exceptional ability in the sciences, the 
arts, or business.
    (i) To show that the alien is a professional holding an advanced 
degree, the petition must be accompanied by:
    (A) An official academic record showing that the alien has a United 
States advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree; or

experience in the specialty.
    (ii) To show that the alien is an alien of exceptional ability in 
the sciences, arts, or business, the petition must be accompanied by at 
least three of the following:
    (A) An official academic record showing that the alien has a degree, 
diploma, certificate, or similar award from a college, university, 
school, or other institution of learning relating to the area of

experience in the occupation for which he or she is being sought;

particular profession or occupation;
    (D) Evidence that the alien has commanded a salary, or other 
renumeration for services, which demonstrates exceptional ability;

    (F) Evidence of recognition for achievements and significant 
contributions to the industry or field by peers, governmental entities, 
or professional or business organizations.

beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence 
to establish the beneficiary's eligibility.
    (4) Labor certification or evidence that alien qualifies for Labor 
Market Information Pilot Program--(i) General. Every petition under this 
classification must be accompanied by an individual labor certification 
from the Department of Labor, by an application for Schedule A 
designation (if applicable), or by documentation to establish that the 
alien qualifies for one of the shortage occupations in the Department of 
Labor's Labor Market Information Pilot Program. To apply for Schedule A 
designation or to establish that the alien's occupation is within the 
Labor Market Information Program, a fully executed uncertified Form ETA-
750 in duplicate must accompany the petition. The job offer portion of 
the individual labor certification, Schedule A application, or Pilot 
Program application must demonstrate that the job requires a 
professional holding an advanced degree or the equivalent or an alien of 
exceptional ability.
    (ii) Exemption from job offer. The director may exempt the 
requirement of a job offer, and thus of a labor certification, for 
aliens of exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business if 
exemption would be in the national interest. To apply for the exemption, 
the petitioner must submit Form ETA-750B, Statement of Qualifications of 
Alien, in duplicate, as well as evidence to support the claim that such 
exemption would be in the national interest.
    (l) Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers. (1) Any 
United States employer may file a petition on Form I-140 for 
classification of an alien under section 203(b)(3) as a skilled worker, 
professional, or other (unskilled) worker.
    (2) Definitions. As used in this part:
    Other worker means a qualified alien who is capable, at the time of 
petitioning for this classification, of performing unskilled labor 
(requiring less than two years training or experience), not of a 
temporary or seasonal nature, for

[[Page 143]]

which qualified workers are not available in the United States.
    Professional means a qualified alien who holds at least a United 
States baccalaureate degree or a foreign equivalent degree and who is a 
member of the professions.
    Skilled worker means an alien who is capable, at the time of 
petitioning for this classification, of performing skilled labor 
(requiring at least two years training or experience), not of a 
temporary or seasonal nature, for which qualified workers are not 
available in the United States. Relevant post-secondary education may be 
considered as training for the purposes of this provision.
    (3) Initial evidence--(i) Labor certification or evidence that alien 
qualifies for Labor Market Information Pilot Program. Every petition 
under this classification must be accompanied by an individual labor 
certification from the Department of Labor, by an application for 
Schedule A designation, or by documentation to establish that the alien 
qualifies for one of the shortage occupations in the Department of 
Labor's Labor Market Information Pilot Program. To apply for Schedule A 
designation or to establish that the alien's occupation is a shortage 
occupation with the Labor Market Pilot Program, a fully executed 
uncertified Form ETA-750 in duplicate must accompany the petition. The 
job offer portion of an individual labor certification, Schedule A 
application, or Pilot Program application for a professional must 
demonstrate that the job requires the minimum of a baccalaureate degree.
    (ii) Other documentation--(A) General. Any requirements of training 
or experience for skilled workers, professionals, or other workers must 
be supported by letters from trainers or employers giving the name, 
address, and title of the trainer or employer, and a description of the 
training received or the experience of the alien.
    (B) Skilled workers. If the petition is for a skilled worker, the 
petition must be accompanied by evidence that the alien meets the 
educational, training or experience, and any other requirements of the 
individual labor certification, meets the requirements for Schedule A 
designation, or meets the requirements for the Labor Market Information 
Pilot Program occupation designation. The minimum requirements for this 
classification are at least two years of training or experience.
    (C) Professionals. If the petition is for a professional, the 
petition must be accompanied by evidence that the alien holds a United 
States baccalaureate degree or a foreign equivalent degree and by 
evidence that the alien is a member of the professions. Evidence of a 
baccalaureate degree shall be in the form of an official college or 
university record showing the date the baccalaureate degree was awarded 
and the area of concentration of study. To show that the alien is a 
member of the professions, the petitioner must submit evidence showing 
that the minimum of a baccalaureate degree is required for entry into 
the occupation.
    (D) Other workers. If the petition is for an unskilled (other) 
worker, it must be accompanied by evidence that the alien meets any 
educational, training and experience, and other requirements of the 
labor certification.
    (4) Differentiating between skilled and other workers. The 
determination of whether a worker is a skilled or other worker will be 
based on the requirements of training and/or experience placed on the 
job by the prospective employer, as certified by the Department of 
Labor. In the case of a Schedule A occupation or a shortage occupation 
within the Labor Market Pilot Program, the petitioner will be required 
to establish to the director that the job is a skilled job, i.e., one 
which requires at least two years of training and/or experience.
    (m) Religious workers--(1) An alien, or any person in behalf of the 
alien, may file an I-360 visa petition for classification under section 
203(b)(4) of the Act as a section 101(a)(27)(C) special immigrant 
religious worker. Such a petition may be filed by or for an alien, who 
(either abroad or in the United States) for at least the two years 
immediately preceding the filing of the petition has been a member of a 
religious denomination which has a bona fide nonprofit religious 
organization in the United States. The alien must be coming to

[[Page 144]]

the United States solely for the purpose of carrying on the vocation of 
a minister of that religious denomination, working for the organization 
at the organization's request in a professional capacity in a religious 
vocation or occupation for the organization or a bona fide organization 
which is affiliated with the religious denomination and is exempt from 
taxation as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at the request of the organization. All 
three types of religious workers must have been performing the vocation, 
professional work, or other work continuously (either abroad or in the 
United States) for at least the two-year period immediately preceding 
the filing of the petition. Professional workers and other workers must 
obtain permanent resident status through immigration or adjustment of 
status on or before September 30, 1997, in order to immigrate under 
section 203(b)(4) of the Act as section 101(a)(27)(C) special immigrant 
religious workers.
    (2) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Bona fide nonprofit religious organization in the United States 
means an organization exempt from taxation as described in section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as it relates to 
religious organizations, or one that has never sought such exemption but 
establishes to the satisfaction of the Service that it would be eligible 
therefor if it had applied for tax exempt status.
    Bona fide organization which is affiliated with the religious 
denomination means an organization which is closely associated with the 
religious denomination and which is exempt from taxation as described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as it relates to 
religious organizations.
    Minister means an individual duly authorized by a recognized 
religious denomination to conduct religious worship and to perform other 
duties usually performed by authorized members of the clergy of that 
religion. In all cases, there must be a reasonable connection between 
the activities performed and the religious calling of the minister. The 
term does not include a lay preacher not authorized to perform such 
duties.
    Professional capacity means an activity in a religious vocation or 
occupation for which the minimum of a United States baccalaureate degree 
or a foreign equivalent degree is required.
    Religious denomination means a religious group or community of 
believers having some form of ecclesiastical government, a creed or 
statement of faith, some form of worship, a formal or informal code of 
doctrine and discipline, religious services and ceremonies, established 
places of religious worship, religious congregations, or comparable 
indicia of a bona fide religious denomination. For the purposes of this 
definition, an inter-denominational religious organization which is 
exempt from taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 will be treated as a religious denomination.
    Religious occupation means an activity which relates to a 
traditional religious function. Examples of individuals in religious 
occupations include, but are not limited to, liturgical workers, 
religious instructors, religious counselors, cantors, catechists, 
workers in religious hospitals or religious health care facilities, 
missionaries, religious translators, or religious broadcasters. This 
group does not include janitors, maintenance workers, clerks, fund 
raisers, or persons solely involved in the solicitation of donations.
    Religious vocation means a calling to religious life evidenced by 
the demonstration of commitment practiced in the religious denomination, 
such as the taking of vows. Examples of individuals with a religious 
vocation include, but are not limited to, nuns, monks, and religious 
brothers and sisters.
    (3) Initial evidence. Unless otherwise specified, each petition for 
a religious worker must be accompanied by:
    (i) Evidence that the organization qualifies as a nonprofit 
organization in the form of either:
    (A) Documentation showing that it is exempt from taxation in 
accordance with section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
as it relates to religious organizations (in appropriate cases, evidence 
of the organization's assets and methods of operation and

[[Page 145]]

the organization's papers of incorporation under applicable state law 
may be requested); or
    (B) Such documentation as is required by the Internal Revenue 
Service to establish eligibility for exemption under section 501(c)(3) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as it relates to religious 
organizations; and
    (ii) A letter from an authorized official of the religious 
organization in the United States which (as applicable to the particular 
alien) establishes:
    (A) That, immediately prior to the filing of the petition, the alien 
has the required two years of membership in the denomination and the 
required two years of experience in the religious vocation, professional 
religious work, or other religious work; and
    (B) That, if the alien is a minister, he or she has authorization to 
conduct religious worship and to perform other duties usually performed 
by authorized members of the clergy, including a detailed description of 
such authorized duties. In appropriate cases, the certificate of 
ordination or authorization may be requested; or
    (C) That, if the alien is a religious professional, he or she has at 
least a United States baccalaureate or its foreign equivalent required 
for entry into the religious profession. In all professional cases, an 
official academic record showing that the alien has the required degree 
must be submitted; or
    (D) That, if the alien is to work in another religious vocation or 
occupation, he or she is qualified in the religious vocation or 
occupation. Evidence of such qualifications may include, but need not be 
limited to, evidence establishing that the alien is a nun, monk, or 
religious brother, or that the type of work to be done relates to a 
traditional religious function.
    (iii) If the alien is to work in a non-ministerial and non-
professional capacity for a bona fide religious organization which is 
affiliated with the religious denomination, the letter from the 
authorized official must explain how the affiliation exists. A tax-
exempt certificate indicating that the affiliated organization is exempt 
from taxation in accordance with section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 as it relates to religious organizations is 
required in this instance.
    (iv) In appropriate cases, the director may request appropriate 
additional evidence relating to the eligibility under section 203(b)(4) 
of the Act of the religious organization, the alien, or the affiliated 
organization.
    (4) Job offer. The letter from the authorized official of the 
religious organization in the United States must also state how the 
alien will be solely carrying on the vocation of a minister (including 
any terms of payment for services or other remuneration), or how the 
alien will be paid or remunerated if the alien will work in a 
professional religious capacity or in other religious work. The 
documentation should clearly indicate that the alien will not be solely 
dependent on supplemental employment or solicitation of funds for 
support. In doubtful cases, additional evidence such as bank letters, 
recent audits, church membership figures, and/or the number of 
individuals currently receiving compensation may be requested.
    (n) Closing action--(1) Approval. An approved employment-based 
petition will be forwarded to the United States Consulate selected by 
the petitioner and indicated on the petition. If a United States 
Consulate is not designated, the petition will be forwarded to the 
consulate having jurisdiction over the place of the alien's last 
residence abroad. If the petition indicates that the alien will apply 
for adjustment to permanent residence in the United States, the approved 
petition will be retained by the Service for consideration with the 
application for permanent resident (Form I-485).
    (2) Denial. The denial of a petition for classification under 
section 203(b)(1), 203(b)(2), 203(b)(3), or 203(b)(4) of the Act (as it 
relates to special immigrants under section 101(a)(27)(C) of the Act) 
shall be appealable to the Associate Commissioner for Examinations. The 
petitioner shall be informed in plain language of the reasons for denial 
and of his or her right to appeal.
    (3) Validity of approved petitions. Unless revoked under section 
203(e) or 205

[[Page 146]]

of the Act, an employment-based petition is valid indefinitely.

Sec. 204.6  Petitions for employment creation aliens.

    (a) General. A petition to classify an alien under section 203(b)(5) 
of the Act must be filed on Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien 
Entrepreneur. The petition must be accompanied by the appropriate fee. 
Before a petition is considered properly filed, the petition must be 
signed by the petitioner, and the initial supporting documentation 
required by this section must be attached. Legible photocopies of 
supporting documents will ordinarily be acceptable for initial filing 
and approval. However, at the discretion of the director, original 
documents may be required.
    (b) Jurisdiction. The petition must be filed with the Service Center 
having jurisdiction over the area in which the new commercial enterprise 
is or will be principally doing business.
    (c) Eligibility to file. A petition for classification as an alien 
entrepreneur may only be filed by any alien on his or her own behalf.
    (d) Priority date. The priority date of a petition for 
classification as an alien entrepreneur is the date the petition is 
properly filed with the Service or, if filed prior to the effective date 
of these regulations, the date the Form I-526 was received at the 
appropriate Service Center.
    (e) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Capital means cash, equipment, inventory, other tangible property, 
cash equivalents, and indebtedness secured by assets owned by the alien 
entrepreneur, provided that the alien entrepreneur is personally and 
primarily liable and that the assets of the new commercial enterprise 
upon which the petition is based are not used to secure any of the 
indebtedness. All capital shall be valued at fair market value in United 
States dollars. Assets acquired, directly or indirectly, by unlawful 
means (such as criminal activities) shall not be considered capital for 
the purposes of section 203(b)(5) of the Act.
    Commercial enterprise means any for-profit activity formed for the 
ongoing conduct of lawful business including, but not limited to, a sole 
proprietorship, partnership (whether limited or general), holding 
company, joint venture, corporation, business trust, or other entity 
which may be publicly or privately owned. This definition includes a 
commercial enterprise consisting of a holding company and its wholly-
owned subsidiaries, provided that each such subsidiary is engaged in a 
for-profit activity formed for the ongoing conduct of a lawful business. 
This definition shall not include a noncommercial activity such as 
owning and operating a personal residence.
    Employee means an individual who provides services or labor for the 
new commercial enterprise and who receives wages or other remuneration 
directly from the new commercial enterprise. In the case of the 
Immigrant Investor Pilot Program, ``employee'' also means an individual 
who provides services or labor in a job which has been created 
indirectly through investment in the new commercial enterprise. This 
definition shall not include independent contractors.
    Full-time employment means employment of a qualifying employee by 
the new commercial enterprise in a position that requires a minimum of 
35 working hours per week. In the case of the Immigrant Investor Pilot 
Program, ``full-time employment'' also means employment of a qualifying 
employee in a position that has been created indirectly through revenues 
generated from increased exports resulting from the Pilot Program that 
requires a minimum of 35 working hours per week. A job-sharing 
arrangement whereby two or more qualifying employees share a full-time 
position shall count as full-time employment provided the hourly 
requirement per week is met. This definition shall not include 
combinations of part-time positions even if, when combined, such 
positions meet the hourly requirement per week.
    High employment area means a part of a metropolitan statistical area 
that at the time of investment:

[[Page 147]]

    (i) Is not a targeted employment area; and
    (ii) Is an area with an unemployment rate significantly below the 
national average unemployment rates.
    Invest means to contribute capital. A contribution of capital in 
exchange for a note, bond, convertible debt, obligation, or any other 
debt arrangement between the alien entrepreneur and the new commercial 
enterprise does not constitute a contribution of capital for the 
purposes of this part.
    New means established after November 29, 1990.
    Qualifying employee means a United States citizen, a lawfully 
admitted permanent resident, or other immigrant lawfully authorized to 
be employed in the United States including, but not limited to, a 
conditional resident, a temporary resident, an asylee, a refugee, or an 
alien remaining in the United States under suspension of deportation. 
This definition does not include the alien entrepreneur, the alien 
entrepreneur's spouse, sons, or daughters, or any nonimmigrant alien.
    Regional center means any economic unit, public or private, which is 
involved with the promotion of economic growth, including increased 
export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, and 
increased domestic capital investment.
    Rural area means any area not within either a metropolitan 
statistical area (as designated by the Office of Management and Budget) 
or the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 
or more.
    Targeted employment area means an area which, at the time of 
investment, is a rural area or an area which has experienced 
unemployment of at least 150 percent of the national average rate.
    Troubled business means a business that has been in existence for at 
least two years, has incurred a net loss for accounting purposes 
(determined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles) 
during the twelve- or twenty-four month period prior to the priority 
date on the alien entrepreneur's Form  I-526, and the loss for such 
period is at least equal to twenty percent of the troubled business's 
net worth prior to such loss. For purposes of determining whether or not 
the troubled business has been in existence for two years, successors in 
interest to the troubled business will be deemed to have been in 
existence for the same period of time as the business they succeeded.
    (f) Required amounts of capital. (1) General. Unless otherwise 
specified, the amount of capital necessary to make a qualifying 
investment in the United States is one million United States dollars 
($1,000,000).
    (2) Targeted employment area. The amount of capital necessary to 
make a qualifying investment in a targeted employment area within the 
United States is five hundred thousand United States dollars ($500,000).
    (3) High employment area. The amount of capital necessary to make a 
qualifying investment in a high employment area within the United 
States, as defined in section 203(b)(5)(C)(iii) of the Act, is one 
million United States dollars ($1,000,000).
    (g) Multiple investors--(1) General. The establishment of a new 
commercial enterprise may be used as the basis of a petition for 
classification as an alien entrepreneur by more than one investor, 
provided each petitioning investor has invested or is actively in the 
process of investing the required amount for the area in which the new 
commercial enterprise is principally doing business, and provided each 
individual investment results in the creation of at least ten full-time 
positions for qualifying employees. The establishment of a new 
commercial enterprise may be used as the basis of a petition for 
classification as an alien entrepreneur even though there are several 
owners of the enterprise, including persons who are not seeking 
classification under section 203(b)(5) of the Act and non-natural 
persons, both foreign and domestic, provided that the source(s) of all 
capital invested is identified and all invested capital has been derived 
by lawful means.
    (2) Employment creation allocation. The total number of full-time 
positions created for qualifying employees shall be allocated solely to 
those alien entrepreneurs who have used the establishment of the new 
commercial enterprise as the basis of a petition on Form I-526.

[[Page 148]]

No allocation need be made among persons not seeking classification 
under section 203(b)(5) of the Act or among non-natural persons, either 
foreign or domestic. The Service shall recognize any reasonable 
agreement made among the alien entrepreneurs in regard to the 
identification and allocation of such qualifying positions.
    (h) Establishment of a new commercial enterprise. The establishment 
of a new commercial enterprise may consist of:
    (1) The creation of an original business;
    (2) The purchase of an existing business and simultaneous or 
subsequent restructuring or reorganization such that a new commercial 
enterprise results; or
    (3) The expansion of an existing business through the investment of 
the required amount, so that a substantial change in the net worth or 
number of employees results from the investment of capital. Substantial 
change means a 40 percent increase either in the net worth, or in the 
number of employees, so that the new net worth, or number of employees 
amounts to at least 140 percent of the pre-expansion net worth or number 
of employees. Establishment of a new commercial enterprise in this 
manner does not exempt the petitioner from the requirements of 8 CFR 
204.6(j) (2) and (3) relating to the required amount of capital 
investment and the creation of full-time employment for ten qualifying 
employees. In the case of a capital investment in a troubled business, 
employment creation may meet the criteria set forth in 8 CFR 
204.6(j)(4)(ii).
    (i) State designation of a high unemployment area. The state 
government of any state of the United States may designate a particular 
geographic or political subdivision located within a metropolitan 
statistical area or within a city or town having a population of 20,000 
or more within such state as an area of high unemployment (at least 150 
percent of the national average rate). Evidence of such designation, 
including a description of the boundaries of the geographic or political 
subdivision and the method or methods by which the unemployment 
statistics were obtained, may be provided to a prospective alien 
entrepreneur for submission with Form I-526. Before any such designation 
is made, an official of the state must notify the Associate Commissioner 
for Examinations of the agency, board, or other appropriate governmental 
body of the state which shall be delegated the authority to certify that 
the geographic or political subdivision is a high unemployment area.
    (j) Initial evidence to accompany petition. A petition submitted for 
classification as an alien entrepreneur must be accompanied by evidence 
that the alien has invested or is actively in the process of investing 
lawfully obtained capital in a new commercial enterprise in the United 
States which will create full-time positions for not fewer than 10 
qualifying employees. In the case of petitions submitted under the 
Immigrant Investor Pilot Program, a petition must be accompanied by 
evidence that the alien has invested, or is actively in the process of 
investing, capital obtained through lawful means within a regional 
center designated by the Service in accordance with paragraph (m)(4) of 
this section. The petitioner may be required to submit information or 
documentation that the Service deems appropriate in addition to that 
listed below.
    (1) To show that a new commercial enterprise has been established by 
the petitioner in the United States, the petition must be accompanied 
by:
    (i) As applicable, articles of incorporation, certificate of merger 
or consolidation, partnership agreement, certificate of limited 
partnership, joint venture agreement, business trust agreement, or other 
similar organizational document for the new commercial enterprise;
    (ii) A certificate evidencing authority to do business in a state or 
municipality or, if the form of the business does not require any such 
certificate or the State or municipality does not issue such a 
certificate, a statement to that effect; or
    (iii) Evidence that, as of a date certain after November 29, 1990, 
the required amount of capital for the area in which an enterprise is 
located has been transferred to an existing business, and that the 
investment has resulted in a substantial increase in the

[[Page 149]]

net worth or number of employees of the business to which the capital 
was transferred. This evidence must be in the form of stock purchase 
agreements, investment agreements, certified financial reports, payroll 
records, or any similar instruments, agreements, or documents evidencing 
the investment in the commercial enterprise and the resulting 
substantial change in the net worth, number of employees.
    (2) To show that the petitioner has invested or is actively in the 
process of investing the required amount of capital, the petition must 
be accompanied by evidence that the petitioner has placed the required 
amount of capital at risk for the purpose of generating a return on the 
capital placed at risk. Evidence of mere intent to invest, or of 
prospective investment arrangements entailing no present commitment, 
will not suffice to show that the petitioner is actively in the process 
of investing. The alien must show actual commitment of the required 
amount of capital. Such evidence may include, but need not be limited 
to:
    (i) Bank statement(s) showing amount(s) deposited in United States 
business account(s) for the enterprise;
    (ii) Evidence of assets which have been purchased for use in the 
United States enterprise, including invoices, sales receipts, and 
purchase contracts containing sufficient information to identify such 
assets, their purchase costs, date of purchase, and purchasing entity;
    (iii) Evidence of property transferred from abroad for use in the 
United States enterprise, including United States Customs Service 
commercial entry documents, bills of lading, and transit insurance 
policies containing ownership information and sufficient information to 
identify the property and to indicate the fair market value of such 
property;
    (iv) Evidence of monies transferred or committed to be transferred 
to the new commercial enterprise in exchange for shares of stock (voting 
or nonvoting, common or preferred). Such stock may not include terms 
requiring the new commercial enterprise to redeem it at the holder's 
request; or
    (v) Evidence of any loan or mortgage agreement, promissory note, 
security agreement, or other evidence of borrowing which is secured by 
assets of the petitioner, other than those of the new commercial 
enterprise, and for which the petitioner is personally and primarily 
liable.
    (3) To show that the petitioner has invested, or is actively in the 
process of investing, capital obtained through lawful means, the 
petition must be accompanied, as applicable, by:
    (i) Foreign business registration records;
    (ii) Corporate, partnership (or any other entity in any form which 
has filed in any country or subdivision thereof any return described in 
this subpart), and personal tax returns including income, franchise, 
property (whether real, personal, or intangible), or any other tax 
returns of any kind filed within five years, with any taxing 
jurisdiction in or outside the United States by or on behalf of the 
petitioner;
    (iii) Evidence identifying any other source(s) of capital; or
    (iv) Certified copies of any judgments or evidence of all pending 
governmental civil or criminal actions, governmental administrative 
proceedings, and any private civil actions (pending or otherwise) 
involving monetary judgments against the petitioner from any court in or 
outside the United States within the past fifteen years.
    (4) Job creation--(i) General. To show that a new commercial 
enterprise will create not fewer than ten (10) full-time positions for 
qualifying employees, the petition must be accompanied by:
    (A) Documentation consisting of photocopies of relevant tax records, 
Form I-9, or other similar documents for ten (10) qualifying employees, 
if such employees have already been hired following the establishment of 
the new commercial enterprise; or
    (B) A copy of a comprehensive business plan showing that, due to the 
nature and projected size of the new commercial enterprise, the need for 
not fewer than ten (10) qualifying employees will result, including 
approximate dates, within the next two years, and when such employees 
will be hired.
    (ii) Troubled business. To show that a new commercial enterprise 
which has

[[Page 150]]

been established through a capital investment in a troubled business 
meets the statutory employment creation requirement, the petition must 
be accompanied by evidence that the number of existing employees is 
being or will be maintained at no less than the pre-investment level for 
a period of at least two years. Photocopies of tax records, Forms I-9, 
or other relevant documents for the qualifying employees and a 
comprehensive business plan shall be submitted in support of the 
petition.
    (iii) Immigrant Investor Pilot Program. To show that the new 
commercial enterprise located within a regional center approved for 
participation in the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program meets the 
statutory employment creation requirement, the petition must be 
accompanied by evidence that the investment will create full-time 
positions for not fewer than 10 persons either directly or indirectly 
through revenues generated from increased exports resulting from the 
Pilot Program. Such evidence may be demonstrated by reasonable 
methodologies including those set forth in paragraph (m)(3) of this 
section.
    (5) To show that the petitioner is or will be engaged in the 
management of the new commercial enterprise, either through the exercise 
of day-to-day managerial control or through policy formulation, as 
opposed to maintaining a purely passive role in regard to the 
investment, the petition must be accompanied by:
    (i) A statement of the position title that the petitioner has or 
will have in the new enterprise and a complete description of the 
position's duties;
    (ii) Evidence that the petitioner is a corporate officer or a member 
of the corporate board of directors; or
    (iii) If the new enterprise is a partnership, either limited or 
general, evidence that the petitioner is engaged in either direct 
management or policy making activities. For purposes of this section, if 
the petitioner is a limited partner and the limited partnership 
agreement provides the petitioner with certain rights, powers, and 
duties normally granted to limited partners under the Uniform Limited 
Partnership Act, the petitioner will be considered sufficiently engaged 
in the management of the new commercial enterprise.
    (6) If applicable, to show that the new commercial enterprise has 
created or will create employment in a targeted employment area, the 
petition must be accompanied by:
    (i) In the case of a rural area, evidence that the new commercial 
enterprise is principally doing business within a civil jurisdiction not 
located within any standard metropolitan statistical area as designated 
by the Office of Management and Budget, or within any city or town 
having a population of 20,000 or more as based on the most recent 
decennial census of the United States; or
    (ii) In the case of a high unemployment area:
    (A) Evidence that the metropolitan statistical area, the specific 
county within a metropolitan statistical area, or the county in which a 
city or town with a population of 20,000 or more is located, in which 
the new commercial enterprise is principally doing business has 
experienced an average unemployment rate of 150 percent of the national 
average rate; or
    (B) A letter from an authorized body of the government of the state 
in which the new commercial enterprise is located which certifies that 
the geographic or political subdivision of the metropolitan statistical 
area or of the city or town with a population of 20,000 or more in which 
the enterprise is principally doing business has been designated a high 
unemployment area. The letter must meet the requirements of 8 CFR 
204.6(i).
    (k) Decision. The petitioner will be notified of the decision, and, 
if the petition is denied, of the reasons for the denial and of the 
petitioner's right of appeal to the Associate Commissioner for 
Examinations in accordance with the provisions of part 103 of this 
chapter. The decision must specify whether or not the new commercial 
enterprise is principally doing business within a targeted employment 
area.
    (l) Disposition of approved petition. The approved petition will be 
forwarded to the United States consulate selected by the petitioner and 
indicated on the petition. If a consulate

[[Page 151]]

has not been designated, the petition will be forwarded to the consulate 
having jurisdiction over the place of the petitioner's last residence 
abroad. If the petitioner is eligible for adjustment of status to 
conditional permanent residence, and if the petition indicates that the 
petitioner intends to apply for such adjustment, the approved petition 
will be retained by the Service for consideration in conjunction with 
the application for adjustment of status.
    (m) Immigrant Investor Pilot Program--(1) Scope. The Immigrant 
Investor Pilot Program is established solely pursuant to the provisions 
of section 610 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the 
Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, and subject to all 
conditions and restrictions stipulated in that section. Except as 
provided herein, aliens seeking to obtain immigration benefits under 
this paragraph continue to be subject to all conditions and restrictions 
set forth in section 203(b)(5) of the Act and this section.
    (2) Number of immigrant visas allocated. The annual allocation of 
the visas available under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program is set at 
300 for each of the five fiscal years commencing on October 1, 1993.
    (3) Requirements for regional centers. Each regional center wishing 
to participate in the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program shall submit a 
proposal to the Assistant Commissioner for Adjudications, which:
    (i) Clearly describes how the regional center focuses on a 
geographical region of the United States, and how it will promote 
economic growth through increased export sales, improved regional 
productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment;
    (ii) Provides in verifiable detail how jobs will be created 
indirectly through increased exports;
    (iii) Provides a detailed statement regarding the amount and source 
of capital which has been committed to the regional center, as well as a 
description of the promotional efforts taken and planned by the sponsors 
of the regional center;
    (iv) Contains a detailed prediction regarding the manner in which 
the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or 
national economy in general as reflected by such factors as increased 
household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, 
maintenance and repair, and construction both within and without the 
regional center; and
    (v) Is supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting 
tools, including, but not limited to, feasibility studies, analyses of 
foreign and domestic markets for the goods or services to be exported, 
and/or multiplier tables.
    (4) Submission of proposals to participate in the Immigrant Investor 
Pilot Program. On August 24, 1993, the Service will accept proposals 
from regional centers seeking approval to participate in the Immigrant 
Investor Pilot Program. Regional centers that have been approved by the 
Assistant Commissioner for Adjudications will be eligible to participate 
in the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program.
    (5) Decision to participate in the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program. 
The Assistant Commissioner for Adjudications shall notify the regional 
center of his or her decision on the request for approval to participate 
in the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program, and, if the petition is denied, 
of the reasons for the denial and of the regional center's right of 
appeal to the Associate Commissioner for Examinations. Notification of 
denial and appeal rights, and the procedure for appeal shall be the same 
as those contained in 8 CFR 103.3.
    (6) Termination of participation of regional centers. To ensure that 
regional centers continue to meet the requirements of section 610(a) of 
the Appropriations Act, the Assistant Commissioner for Adjudications 
shall issue a notice of intent to terminate the participation of a 
regional center in the pilot program upon a determination that the 
regional center no longer serves the purpose of promoting economic 
growth, including increased export sales, improved regional 
productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. 
The notice of intent to terminate shall be made upon notice to the 
regional center and shall set forth the reasons for termination. The 
regional center must be provided thirty days from receipt of

[[Page 152]]

the notice of intent to terminate to offer evidence in opposition to the 
ground or grounds alleged in the notice of intent to terminate. If the 
Assistant Commissioner for Adjudications determines that the regional 
center's participation in the Pilot Program should be terminated, the 
Assistant Commissioner for Adjudications shall notify the regional 
center of the decision and of the reasons for termination. The regional 
center may appeal the decision within thirty days after the service of 
notice to the Associate Commissioner for Examinations as provided in 8 
CFR 103.3.
    (7) Requirements for alien entrepreneurs. An alien seeking an 
immigrant visa as an alien entrepreneur under the Immigrant Investor 
Pilot Program must demonstrate that his or her qualifying investment is 
within a regional center approved pursuant to paragraph (m)(4) of this 
section and that such investment will create jobs indirectly through 
revenues generated from increased exports resulting from the new 
commercial enterprise.
    (i) Exports. For purposes of paragraph (m) of this section, the term 
``exports'' means services or goods which are produced directly or 
indirectly through revenues generated from a new commercial enterprise 
and which are transported out of the United States;
    (ii) Indirect job creation. To show that 10 or more jobs are 
actually created indirectly by the business, reasonable methodologies 
may be used. Such methodologies may include multiplier tables, 
feasibility studies, analyses of foreign and domestic markets for the 
goods or services to be exported, and other economically or 
statistically valid forecasting devices which indicate the likelihood 
that the business will result in increased employment.
    (8) Time for submission of petitions for classification as an alien 
entrepreneur under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program. Commencing on 
October 1, 1993, petitions will be accepted for filing and adjudicated 
in accordance with the provisions of this section if the alien 
entrepreneur has invested or is actively in the process of investing 
within a regional center which has been approved by the Service for 
participation in the Pilot Program.
    (9) Effect of termination of approval of regional center to 
participate in the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program. Upon termination of 
approval of a regional center to participate in the Immigrant Investor 
Pilot Program, the director shall send a formal written notice to any 
alien within the regional center who has been granted lawful permanent 
residence on a conditional basis under the Pilot Program, and who has 
not yet removed the conditional basis of such lawful permanent 
residence, of the termination of the alien's permanent resident status, 
unless the alien can establish continued eligibility for alien 
entrepreneur classification under section 203(b)(5) of the Act.

a United States business operating in Hong Kong pursuant to section 124 
of the Immigration Act of 1990 shall be filed by the employer on Form I-
140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. Since section 124 provides for

    (d) Eligibility. The alien beneficiary must:
    (1) Be a resident of Hong Kong who:
    (i) Is employed in Hong Kong and has been employed in Hong Kong

managerial or executive or involves specialized knowledge, by a 
qualifying business entity. A qualifying business entity is one which:
    (i) Is owned and organized in the United States (or is the

    (e) Determining managerial or executive capacities--(1) Supervisors

professional.
    (2) Staffing levels. If staffing levels are used as a factor in 
determining whether an individual is acting in a managerial or executive 
capacity, the reasonable needs of the organization, component, or 
function in light of the overall purpose and stage of development of the 
organization, component, or function shall be taken into account. An 
individual shall not be considered to be acting in a managerial or 
executive capacity merely on the basis of the number of employees that 
the individual supervises or has supervised or directs or has directed.

shall be accompanied by:
    (1) Form ETA-750B, Statement of Qualifications of Alien; and
    (2) A letter from the employer attesting to the information 
contained in paragraph (d) of this section. Since the alien's move to 
the United States from Hong Kong does not need to take place 
immediately, the employer's information on the job in the United States 
will be determined by the circumstances of the individual case. If 
immediate immigration is intended, a specific job description must be 
included with the employer's attestation. If immigration will be 
deferred, a simple commitment by the employer that a qualifying job will 
be available in the United States will be acceptable. Prior to seeking 
admission to the United States, a deferred visa applicant must present a 
specific job description letter for redetermination of eligibility. Such 
letter shall be presented to the visa-issuing consular post, or to the 
Service office where the alien is applying for adjustment of status in 
the United States.
    (g) Closing action--(1) Approval. If the alien is residing in Hong 
Kong, an approved petition will be forwarded for visa processing to the 
United States Consulate at Hong Kong. Whether the alien is in Hong Kong 
or is adjusting in the United States, the legend ``HONG KONG SEC. 124'' 
will be clearly printed

[[Page 155]]

in the block used for indicating preference at the top of Form I-140.
    (2) Denial. The denial of a petition filed under this provision 
shall be appealable to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations. 
Notification of denial and appeal rights, and the procedure for appeal 
shall be the same as those contained in 8 CFR 103.3.
    (3) Revocation. A petition approved under this provision shall be 
automatically revoked for the same reasons provided in 8 CFR 205.1(c). 
The procedure for revocation on notice shall be the procedure described 
in 8 CFR 205.2. Termination of employment shall be grounds for automatic 
revocation; however, a transfer within the same company to a different 
division, section, subsidiary, or affiliate (regardless of geographical 
location) will not be disqualifying.

<R05>
Sec. 204.9  Special immigrant status for certain aliens who have served honorably (or are enlisted to serve) in the Armed Forces of the United States for at 
          least 12 years.

    (a) Petition for Armed Forces special immigrant. An alien may not be 
classified as an Armed Forces special immigrant unless the alien is the 
beneficiary of an approved petition to classify such an alien as a 
special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act. The petition 
must be filed on Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow or Special 
Immigrant.
    (1) Who may file. An alien Armed Forces enlistee or veteran may file 
the petition for Armed Forces special immigrant status in his or her own 
behalf. The person filing the petition is not required to be a citizen 
or lawful permanent resident of the United States.
    (2) Where to file. The petition must be filed with the Service 
Center having jurisdiction over the place of the alien's current or 
intended place of residence in the United States, with the overseas 
Service office having jurisdiction over the alien's residence abroad, or 
in conjunction with 8 CFR 245.8.
    (b) Eligibility. An alien is eligible for classification as a 
special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act if:
    (1) The alien has served honorably on active duty in the Armed 
Forces of the United States after October 15, 1978;
    (2) The alien's original lawful enlistment was outside the United 
States (under a treaty or agreement in effect October 1, 1991) for a 
period or periods aggregating--
    (i) Twelve years, and who, if separated from such service, was never 
separated except under honorable conditions; or
    (ii) Six years, in the case of an immigrant who is on active duty at 
the time of seeking special immigrant status under this rule and who has 
reenlisted to incur a total active duty service obligation of at least 
12 years;
    (3) The alien is a national of an independent state which maintains 
a treaty or agreement allowing nationals of that state to enlist in the 
United States Armed Forces each year; and
    (4) The executive department under which the alien has served or is 
serving has recommended the granting of special immigrant status to the 
immigrant.
    (c) Derivative beneficiaries. A spouse or child accompanying or 
following to join a principal immigrant who has requested benefits under 
this section may be accorded the same special immigrant classification 
as the principal alien. This may occur whether or not the spouse or 
child is named in the petition and without the approval of a separate 
petition, but only if the executive department under which the immigrant 
serves or served recommends the granting of special immigrant status to 
the principal immigrant.
    (1) The relationship of spouse and child as defined in section 
101(b)(1) of the Act must have existed at the time the principal alien's 
special immigrant application under section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act was 
approved. The spouse or child of an immigrant classified as a section 
103(a)(27)(K) special immigrant is entitled to a derivative status 
corresponding to the classification and priority date of the beneficiary 
of the petition.
    (2) When a spouse or child of an alien granted special immigrant 
status under section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act is

[[Page 156]]

in the United States but was not included in the principal alien's 
application, the spouse or child shall file Form I-485, Application to 
Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, with the director having 
jurisdiction over his or her place of residence, regardless of the 
status of that spouse or child in the United States. The application 
must be supported by evidence that the principal alien has been granted 
special immigrant status under section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act.
    (3) Revocation of derivative status. The termination of special 
immigrant status for a person who was the principal applicant shall 
result in termination of the special immigrant status of a spouse or 
child whose status was based on the special immigrant application of the 
principal.
    (d) Documents which must be submitted in support of the petition.
    (1) A petition to classify an immigrant as a special immigrant under 
section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act must be accompanied by the following:
    (i) Certified proof of reenlistment (after 6 years of active duty 
service), or certification of past active duty status of 12 years, 
issued by the authorizing official of the executive department in which 
the applicant serves or has served, which certifies that the applicant 
has the required honorable active duty service and commitment. The 
authorizing official need not be at a level above the ``local command''. 
The certification must be submitted with Form I-360, Petition for 
Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant; and
    (ii) Birth certificate of the applicant establishing that the 
applicant is a national of an independent state which maintains a treaty 
or agreement allowing nationals of that state to enlist in the United 
States Armed Forces each year.
    (2) Any documents submitted in support of the petition must meet the 
evidentiary requirements as set forth in 8 CFR part 103.
    (3) Submission of an original Form DD-214, Certificate of Release or 
Discharge from Active Duty; Form G-325b, Biographic Information; and 
Form N-426, Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service, is 
not required for approval of a petition for special immigrant status.
    (e) Decision. The petitioner will be notified of the director's 
decision and, if the petition is denied, of the reasons for the denial. 
If the petition is denied, the petitioner will also be notified of the 
petitioner's right to appeal the decision to the Associate Commissioner 
for Examinations in accordance with 8 CFR part 103.
    (f) Revocation under section 205 of the Act. An alien who has been 
granted special immigrant classification under section 101(a)(27)(K) of 
the Act must meet the qualifications set forth in the Act at the time he 
or she is admitted to the United States for lawful permanent residence. 
If an Armed Forces special immigrant ceases to be a qualified enlistee 
by failing to complete the required active duty service obligation for 
reasons other than an honorable discharge prior to entering the United 
States with an immigrant visa or approval of an application for 
adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence, the petition designating his or her classification as a 
special immigrant is revoked automatically under the general provisions 
of section 205 of the Act. The Service shall obtain a current Form DD-
214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, from the 
appropriate executive department for verification of the alien's failure 
to maintain eligibility for the classification under section 
101(a)(27)(K) of the Act.

outside of the United States, or is in the United States but seeks to 
apply for an immigrant visa abroad, the approved petition will be 
forwarded by the service center to the Department of State's National

    (a) Definitions.
    Eligible for long-term foster care means that a determination has 
been made by the juvenile court that family reunification is no longer a 
viable option. A child who is eligible for long-term foster care will 
normally be expected to remain in foster care until reaching the age of 
majority, unless the child is adopted or placed in a guardianship 
situation. For the purposes of establishing and maintaining eligibility 
for classification as a special immigrant juvenile, a child who has been 
adopted or placed in guardianship situation after having been found 
dependent upon a juvenile court in the United States will continue to be 
considered to be eligible for long-term foster care.
    Juvenile court means a court located in the United States having 
jurisdiction under State law to make judicial determinations about the 
custody and care of juveniles.
    (b) Petition for special immigrant juvenile. An alien may not be 
classified as a special immigrant juvenile unless the alien is the

filed on Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special

    (1) Who may file. The alien, or any person acting on the alien's 
behalf, may file the petition for special immigrant juvenile status. The 
person filing the petition is not required to be a citizen or lawful 
permanent resident of the United States.
    (2) Where to file. The petition must be filed at the district office 
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service having jurisdiction over 
the alien's place of residence in the United States.
    (c) Eligibility. An alien is eligible for classification as a 
special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act if the alien:
    (1) Is under twenty-one years of age;
    (2) Is unmarried;
    (3) Has been declared dependent upon a juvenile court located in the 
United States in accordance with state law governing such declarations 
of dependency, while the alien was in the United States and under the 
jurisdiction of the court;
    (4) Has been deemed eligible by the juvenile court for long-term 
foster care;
    (5) Continues to be dependent upon the juvenile court and eligible 
for long-term foster care, such declaration, dependency or eligibility 
not having been vacated, terminated, or otherwise ended; and
    (6) Has been the subject of judicial proceedings or administrative 
proceedings authorized or recognized by the juvenile court in which it 
has been determined that it would not be in the alien's best interest to 
be returned to the country of nationality or last habitual residence of 
the beneficiary or his or her parent or parents; or
    (7) On November 29, 1990, met all the eligibility requirements for 
special immigrant juvenile status in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of 
this section, and for whom a petition for classification as a special 
immigrant juvenile is filed on Form I-360 before June 1, 1994.
    (d) Initial documents which must be submitted in support of the 
petition. (1) Documentary evidence of the alien's age, in the form of a 
birth certificate,

[[Page 159]]

passport, official foreign identity document issued by a foreign 
government, such as a Cartilla or a Cedula, or other document which in 
the discretion of the director establishes the beneficiary's age; and
    (2) One or more documents which include:
    (i) A juvenile court order, issued by a court of competent 
jurisdiction located in the United States, showing that the court has 
found the beneficiary to be dependent upon that court;
    (ii) A juvenile court order, issued by a court of competent 
jurisdiction located in the United States, showing that the court has 
found the beneficiary eligible for long-term foster care; and
    (iii) Evidence of a determination made in judicial or administrative 
proceedings by a court or agency recognized by the juvenile court and 
authorized by law to make such decisions, that it would not be in the 
beneficiary's best interest to be returned to the country of nationality 
or last habitual residence of the beneficiary or of his or her parent or 
parents.
    (e) Decision. The petitioner will be notified of the director's 
decision, and, if the petition is denied, of the reasons for the denial. 
If the petition is denied, the petitioner will also be notified of the 
petitioner's right to appeal the decision to the Associate Commissioner, 
Examinations, in accordance with part 103 of this chapter.

lawful permanent resident of the United States has petitioned to accord 
his or her spouse immediate relative or family-sponsored preference

the Act. The approval of a spousal self-petition based on the 
relationship to an abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident of the 
United States filed under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) 
of the Act, however, will not be revoked solely because of the 
termination of the marriage to the abuser.
    (E) Upon the remarriage of the spouse of an abusive citizen or 
lawful permanent resident of the United States when the spouse has self-
petitioned under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the

[61 FR 13077, Mar. 26, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 205.2  Revocation on notice.

    (a) General. Any Service officer authorized to approve a petition 
under section 204 of the Act may revoke the approval of that petition 
upon notice to the petitioner on any ground other than those specified 
in Sec. 205.1 when the necessity for the revocation comes to the 
attention of this Service.
    (b) Notice of intent. Revocation of the approval of a petition of 
self-petition under paragraph (a) of this section will be made only on 
notice to the petitioner or self-petitioner. The petitioner or self-
petitioner must be given the opportunity to offer evidence in support of

<R05>
Sec. 207.1  Eligibility.

    (a) Filing jurisdiction. Any alien who believes he or she is a 
refugee as defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Act, and is included in 
a refugee group identified in section 207(a) of the Act, may apply for 
admission to the United States by filing an application in accordance 
with Sec. 207.2 with the Service

[[Page 162]]

office having jurisdiction over the area where the applicant is located. 
In those areas too distant from a Service office, the application may be 
filed at a designated United States consular office.
    (b) Firmly resettled. A refugee is considered to be ``firmly 
resettled'' if he/she has been offered resident status, citizenship, or 
some other type of permanent resettlement by a country other than the 
United States and has travelled to and entered that country as a 
consequence of his/her flight from persecution. Any applicant who has 
become firmly resettled in a foreign country is not eligible for refugee 
status under this chapter.
    (c) Not firmly resettled. Any applicant who claims not to be firmly 
resettled in a foreign country must establish that the conditions of 
his/her residence in that country are so restrictive as to deny 
resettlement. In determining whether or not an applicant is firmly 
resettled in a foreign country, the officer reviewing the matter shall 
consider the conditions under which other residents of the country live: 
(1) Whether permanent or temporary housing is available to the refugee 
in the foreign country; (2) nature of employment available to the 
refugee in the foreign country; and (3) other benefits offered or denied 
to the refugee by the foreign country which are available to other 
residents, such as (i) right to property ownership, (ii) travel 
documentation, (iii) education, (iv) public welfare, and (v) 
citizenship.
    (d) Immediate relatives and special immigrants. Any applicant for 
refugee status who qualifies as an immediate relative or as a special 
immigrant shall not be processed as a refugee unless it is in the public 
interest. The alien shall be advised to obtain an immediate relative or 
special immigrant visa and shall be provided with the proper petition 
forms to send to any prospective petitioners. An applicant who may be 
eligible for classification under sections 203(a)(1), (2), (3), (4), 
(5), (6), or (7) of the Act, and for whom a visa number is now 
available, shall be advised of such eligibility but is not required to 
apply.

[46 FR 45118, Sept. 10, 1981, as amended at 62 FR 10336, Mar. 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 207.2  Applicant processing.

    (a) Forms. Each applicant who seeks admission as a refugee shall 
submit an individual Form I-590 (Registration for Classification as 
Refugee). Additionally, each applicant 14 years old or older must submit 
completed forms G-325C (Biographical Information) and FD-258 (Applicant 
Card).
    (b) Hearing. Each applicant 14 years old or older shall appear in 
person before an immigration officer for inquiry under oath to determine 
his/her eligibility for admission as a refugee.
    (c) Medical examination. Each applicant shall submit to a medical 
examination as required by sections 221(d) and 234 of the Act.
    (d) Sponsorship. Each applicant must be sponsored by a responsible 
person or organization. Transportation for the applicant from his/her 
present abode to the place of resettlement in the United States must be 
guaranteed by the sponsor. The application for refugee status will not 
be approved until the Service receives an acceptable sponsorship 
agreement and guaranty of transportation in behalf of the applicant.


<R05>
Sec. 207.3  Waivers of inadmissibility.

    (a) Authority. Section 207(c)(3) of the Act sets forth grounds of 
inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act which are not applicable 
and those which may be waived in the case of an otherwise qualified 
refugee and the conditions under which such waivers may be approved. 
Officers in charge of overseas offices are delegated authority to 
initiate the necessary investigations to establish the facts in each 
waiver application pending before them and to approve or deny such 
waivers.
    (b) Filing requirements. The applicant for a waiver must submit Form 
I-602, Application by Refugee for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, 
with the Service office processing his or her case. The burden is on the 
applicant to show that the waiver should be granted based upon 
humanitarian grounds,

[[Page 163]]

family unity, or the public interest. The applicant shall be notified in 
writing of the decision, including the reasons for denial, if the 
application is denied. There is no appeal from such decision.

[62 FR 10336, Mar. 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 207.4  Approved application.

    Approval of Form I-590 by an officer in charge outside the United 
States authorizes the district director of the port of entry in the 
United States to admit the applicant conditionally as a refugee upon 
arrival at the port within four months of the date the Form I-590 was 
approved. There is no appeal from a denial of refugee status under this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 207.5  Waiting lists and priority handling.

    Waiting lists are maintained for each designated refugee group of 
special humanitarian concern. Each applicant whose application is 
accepted for filing by the Immigration and Naturalization Service shall 
be registered as of the date of filing. The date of filing is the 
priority date for purposes of case control. Refugees or groups of 
refugees may be selected from these lists in a manner that will best 
support the policies and interests of the United States. The Attorney 
General may adopt appropriate criteria for selecting the refugees and 
assignment of processing priorities for each designated group based upon 
such considerations as: Reuniting families, close association with the 
United States, compelling humanitarian concerns, and public interest 
factors.


<R05>
Sec. 207.6  Control over approved refugee numbers.

    Current numerical accounting of approved refugees is maintained for 
each special group designated by the President. As refugee status is 
authorized for each applicant, the total count is reduced 
correspondingly from the appropriate group so that information is 
readily available to indicate how many refugee numbers remain available 
for issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 207.7  Derivatives of refugees.

    (a) Eligibility. A spouse, as defined in section 101(a)(35) of the 
Act, and/or child(ren), as defined in section 101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), 
(D), or (E) of the Act, shall be granted refugee status if accompanying 
or following-to-join the principal alien. An accompanying derivative is 
a spouse or child of a refugee who is in the physical company of the 
principal refugee when he or she is admitted to the United States, or a 
spouse or child of a refugee who is admitted within 4 months following 
the principal refugee's admission. A following-to-join derivative, on 
the other hand, is a spouse or child of a refugee who seeks admission 
more than 4 months after the principal refugee's admission to the United 
States.
    (b) Ineligibility. The following relatives of refugees are 
ineligible for accompanying or following-to-join benefits:
    (1) A spouse or child who has previously been granted asylee or 
refugee status;
    (2) An adopted child, if the adoption took place after the child 
became 16 years old, or if the child has not been in the legal custody 
and living with the parent(s) for at least 2 years;
    (3) A stepchild, if the marriage that created this relationship took 
place after the child became 18 years old;
    (4) A husband or wife if each/both were not physically present at 
the marriage ceremony, and the marriage was not consummated (section 
101(a)(35) of the Act);
    (5) A husband or wife if the U.S. Attorney General has determined 
that such alien has attempted or conspired to enter into a marriage for 
the purpose of evading immigration laws; and
    (6) A parent, sister, brother, grandparent, grandchild, nephew, 
niece, uncle, aunt, cousin or in-law.
    (c) Relationship. The relationship of a spouse and child as defined 
in sections 101(a)(35) and 101(b) (1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E), 
respectively, of the Act, must have existed prior to the refugee's 
admission to the United States and must continue to exist at the time of 
filing for accompanying or following-to-join benefits and at the time of 
the spouse or child's subsequent admission to the United States. If the 
refugee proves

[[Page 164]]

that the refugee is the parent of a child who was born after the 
refugee's admission as a refugee, but who was in utero on the date of 
the refugee's admission as a refugee, the child shall be eligible to 
accompany or follow-to-join the refugee. The child's mother, if not the 
principal refugee, shall not be eligible to accompany or follow-to-join 
the principal refugee unless the child's mother was the principal 
refugee's spouse on the date of the principal refugee's admission as a 
refugee.
    (d) Filing. A refugee may request accompanying or following-to-join 
benefits for his/her spouse and unmarried, minor child(ren) (whether the 
spouse and children are in or outside the United States) by filing a 
separate Form I-730 Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, for each 
qualifying family member with the designated Service office. The Form I-
730 may only be filed by the principal refugee. Family members who 
derived their refugee status are not eligible to file the Form I-730 on 
behalf of their spouse and child(ren). A separate Form I-730 must be 
filed for each qualifying family member before February 28, 2000 or 
within 2 years of the refugee's admission to the United States, 
whichever is later, unless the Service determines that the filing period 
should be extended for humanitarian reasons. There is no time limit 
imposed on a family member's travel to the United States once the Form 
I-730 has been approved, provided that the relationship of spouse or 
child continues to exist and approval of the Form I-730 petition has not 
been subsequently revoked. There is no fee for filing this petition.
    (e) Evidence. Documentary evidence consists of those documents which 
establish that the petitioner is a refugee, and evidence of the claimed 
relationship of the petitioner to the beneficiary. The burden of proof 
is on the petitioner to establish by a preponderance of the evidence 
that any person on whose behalf he/she is making a request under this 
section is an eligible spouse or unmarried, minor child. Evidence to 
establish the claimed relationship for a spouse or unmarried, minor 
child as set forth in 8 CFR part 204 must be submitted with the request 
for accompanying or following-to-join benefits. Where possible this will 
consist of the documents specified in Sec. 204.2(a (1)(i)(B), 
(a)(1)(iii)(B), (a)(2), (d)(2), and (d)(5) of this chapter. In addition, 
a recent photograph of each derivative must accompany the Form I-730. 
The photograph must clearly identify the derivative, and will be made 
part of the derivative's immigration record for identification purposes.
    (f) Approvals--(1) Spouse or child in the United States. When a 
spouse or child of a refugee is in the United States and the Form I-730 
is approved, the Service will notify the refugee of such approval on 
Form I-797, Notice of Action. Employment will be authorized incident to 
status.
    (2) Spouse or child outside the United States. When a spouse or 
child of a refugee is outside the United States and the Form I-730 is 
approved, the Service will notify the refugee of such approval on Form 
I-797. The approved Form I-730 will be sent by the Service to the 
Department of State for forwarding to the American Embassy or Consulate 
having jurisdiction over the area in which the refugee's spouse or child 
is located.
    (3) Benefits. The approval of the Form I-730 shall remain valid for 
the duration of the relationship to the refugee and, in the case of a 
child, while the child is under 21 years of age and unmarried, provided 
also that the principal's status has not been revoked. However, the 
approved Form I-730 will cease to confer immigration benefits after it 
has been used by the beneficiary for admission to the United States as a 
derivative of a refugee. To demonstrate employment authorization, the 
Service will issue a Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, which also 
reflects the derivative's current status as a refugee, or the derivative 
may apply under Sec. 274a.12(a) of this chapter, using Form I-765, 
Application for Employment Authorization, and a copy of the Form I-797.
    (g) Denials. If the spouse or child of a refugee is found to be 
ineligible for derivative status, a written notice explaining the basis 
for denial shall be forwarded to the principal refugee. There shall be 
no appeal from this decision. However, the denial shall be without 
prejudice to the consideration of a

[[Page 165]]

new petition or motion to reopen the refugee or asylee relative petition 
proceeding, if the refugee establishes eligibility for the accompanying 
or following-to-join benefits contained in this part.

Sec. 207.8  Physical presence in the United States.

    For the purpose of adjustment of status under section 209(a)(1) of 
the Act, the required one year physical presence of the applicant in the 
United States is computed from the date the applicant entered the United 
States as a refugee.

Sec. 207.9  Termination of refugee status.

    The refugee status of any alien (and of the spouse or child of the 
alien) admitted to the United States under section 207 of the Act shall 
be terminated by any district director in whose district the alien is 
found if the alien was not a refugee within the meaning of section 
101(a)(42) of the Act at the time of admission. The district director 
shall notify the alien in writing of the Service's intent to terminate 
the alien's refugee status. The alien shall have 30 days from the date 
notice is served upon him/her or, delivered to his/her last known 
address, to present written or oral evidence to show why the alien's 
refugee status should not be terminated. There is no appeal under this 
chapter from the termination of refugee status by the district director. 
Upon termination of refugee status, the district director shall process 
the alien under sections 235, 240, and 241 of the Act.

reconsider must meet the requirements of sections 240(c)(5) and (c)(6) 
of the Act, and 8 CFR parts 3 and 103, where applicable.
    (b) Training of asylum officers. The Director of International 
Affairs shall ensure that asylum officers receive special training in 
international human rights law, nonadversarial interview techniques, and 
other relevant national and international refugee laws and principles. 
The Director of International Affairs shall also, in cooperation with 
the Department of State and other appropriate sources, compile and 
disseminate to asylum officers information concerning the persecution of 
persons in other countries on account of race, religion, nationality, 
membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, as well 
as other information relevant to asylum determinations, and shall 
maintain a documentation center with information on human rights 
conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 208.2  Jurisdiction.

    (a) Office of International Affairs. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section, the Office of International Affairs shall have 
initial jurisdiction over an asylum application filed by, or a credible 
fear determination pertaining to, an alien physically present in the 
United States or seeking admission at a port-of-entry. An application 
that is complete within the meaning of Sec. 208.3(c)(3) shall be either 
adjudicated or referred by asylum officers under this part in accordance 
with Sec. 208.14. An application that is incomplete within the meaning 
of Sec. 208.3(c)(3) shall be returned to the applicant. Except as 
provided in Sec. 208.16(a), an asylum officer shall not decide whether 
an alien is entitled to withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) 
of the Act.
    (b) Immigration Court--(1) Certain aliens not entitled to 
proceedings under section 240 of the Act. After Form I-863, Notice of 
Referral to Immigration Judge, has been filed with the Immigration 
Court, an immigration judge shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any 
asylum application filed on or after April 1, 1997, by:
    (i) An alien crewmember who:
    (A) Is an applicant for a landing permit;
    (B) Has been refused permission to land under section 252 of the 
Act; or
    (C) On or after April 1, 1997, was granted permission to land under 
section 252 of the Act, regardless of whether the alien has remained in 
the United States longer than authorized;
    (ii) An alien stowaway who has been found to have a credible fear of 
persecution pursuant to the procedure set forth in subpart B of this 
part;
    (iii) An alien who is an applicant for admission pursuant to the 
Visa Waiver Pilot Program under section 217 of the Act;
    (iv) An alien who was admitted to the United States pursuant to the 
Visa Waiver Pilot Program under section 217 of the Act and has remained 
longer than authorized or has otherwise violated his or her immigration 
status;
    (v) An alien who has been ordered removed under section 235(c) of 
the Act; or
    (vi) An alien who is an applicant for admission, or has been 
admitted, as an alien classified under section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act.
    (2) Rules of procedure--(i) General. Except as provided in this 
section, proceedings falling under the jurisdiction of the immigration 
judge pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be conducted in 
accordance with the same rules of procedure as proceedings conducted 
under 8 CFR part 240, except the scope of review shall be limited to a 
determination of whether the alien is eligible for asylum or withholding 
of removal and whether asylum shall be granted in the exercise of 
discretion.

[[Page 167]]

During such proceedings all parties are prohibited from raising or 
considering any other issues, including but not limited to issues of 
admissibility, removability, eligibility for waivers, and eligibility 
for any form of relief other than asylum or withholding of removal.
    (ii) Notice of hearing procedures and in-absentia decisions. The 
alien will be provided with notice of the time and place of the 
proceeding. The request for asylum and withholding of removal submitted 
by an alien who fails to appear for the hearing shall be denied. The 
denial of asylum and withholding of removal for failure to appear may be 
reopened only upon a motion filed with the immigration judge with 
jurisdiction over the case. Only one motion to reopen may be filed, and 
it must be filed within 90 days, unless the alien establishes that he or 
she did not receive notice of the hearing date or was in Federal or 
State custody on the date directed to appear. The motion must include 
documentary evidence which demonstrates that:
    (A) The alien did not receive the notice;
    (B) The alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to 
appear was through no fault of the alien; or
    (C) ``Exceptional circumstances,'' as defined in section 240(e)(1) 
of the Act, caused the failure to appear.
    (iii) Relief. The filing of a motion to reopen shall not stay 
removal of the alien unless the immigration judge grants a written 
request for a stay pending disposition of the motion. An alien who fails 
to appear for a proceeding under this section shall not be eligible for 
relief under section 208, 212(h), 212(i), 240A, 240B, 245, 248, or 249 
for a period of 10 years after the date of the denial.
    (3) Other aliens. Immigration judges shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by an alien who has been 
served Form I-221, Order to Show Cause; Form I-122, Notice to Applicant 
for Admission Detained for a Hearing before an Immigration Judge; or 
Form I-862, Notice to Appear, after a copy of the charging document has 
been filed with the Immigration Court. Immigration judges shall also 
have jurisdiction over any asylum applications filed prior to April 1, 
1997, by alien crewmembers who have remained in the United States longer 
than authorized, by applicants for admission under the Visa Waiver Pilot 
Program, and by aliens who have been admitted to the United States under 
the Visa Waiver Pilot Program.

<R05>
Sec. 208.3  Form of application.

    (a) An asylum applicant must file Form I-589, Application for Asylum 
or Withholding of Removal, together with any additional supporting 
evidence in accordance with the instructions on the form. The 
applicant's spouse and children shall be listed on the application and 
may be included in the request for asylum if they are in the United 
States. One additional copy of the principal applicant's Form I-589 must 
be submitted for each dependent included in the principal's application.
    (b) An asylum application shall be deemed to constitute at the same 
time an application for withholding of removal, unless adjudicated in 
deportation or exclusion proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997. 
In such instances, the asylum application shall be deemed to constitute 
an application for withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of 
the Act, as that section existed prior to April 1, 1997. Where a 
determination is made that an applicant is ineligible to apply for 
asylum under section 208(a)(2) of the Act, an asylum application shall 
be construed as an application for withholding of removal.
    (c) Form I-589 shall be filed under the following conditions and 
shall have the following consequences:
    (1) If the application was filed on or after January 4, 1995, 
information provided in the application may be used as a basis for the 
initiation of removal proceedings, or to satisfy any burden of proof in 
exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings;
    (2) The applicant and anyone other than a spouse, parent, son, or 
daughter of the applicant who assists the applicant in preparing the 
application must sign the application under penalty of

[[Page 168]]

perjury. The applicant's signature establishes a presumption that the 
applicant is aware of the contents of the application. A person other 
than a relative specified in this paragraph who assists the applicant in 
preparing the application also must provide his or her full mailing 
address;
    (3) An asylum application that does not include a response to each 
of the questions contained in the Form I-589, is unsigned, or is 
unaccompanied by the required materials specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section is incomplete. The filing of an incomplete application 
shall not commence the 150-day period after which the applicant may file 
an application for employment authorization in accordance with 
Sec. 208.7. An application that is incomplete shall be returned by mail 
to the applicant within 30 days of the receipt of the application by the 
Service. If the Service has not mailed the incomplete application back 
to the applicant within 30 days, it shall be deemed complete. An 
application returned to the applicant as incomplete shall be resubmitted 
by the applicant with the additional information if he or she wishes to 
have the application considered;
    (4) Knowing placement of false information on the application may 
subject the person placing that information on the application to 
criminal penalties under title 18 of the United States Code and to civil 
penalties under section 274C of the Act; and
    (5) Knowingly filing a frivolous application on or after April 1, 
1997, so long as the applicant has received the notice required by 
section 208(d)(4) of the Act, shall render the applicant permanently 
ineligible for any benefits under the Act pursuant to Sec. 208.18.


<R05>
Sec. 208.4  Filing the application.

    Except as prohibited in paragraph (a) of this section, asylum 
applications shall be filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (a) Prohibitions on filing. Section 208(a)(2) of the Act prohibits 
certain aliens from filing for asylum on or after April 1, 1997, unless 
the alien can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Attorney General 
that one of the exceptions in section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act applies. 
Such prohibition applies only to asylum applications under section 208 
of the Act and not to applications for withholding of removal under 
section 241 of the Act. If an applicant submits an asylum application 
and it appears that one or more of the prohibitions contained in section 
208(a)(2) of the Act apply, an asylum officer or an immigration judge 
shall review the application to determine if the application should be 
rejected or denied. For the purpose of making determinations under 
section 208(a)(2) of the Act, the following rules shall apply:
    (1) Authority. Only an asylum officer, an immigration judge, or the 
Board of Immigration Appeals is authorized to make determinations 
regarding the prohibitions contained in section 208(a)(2)(B) or (C) of 
the Act;
    (2) One-year filing deadline. (i) For purposes of section 
208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, an applicant has the burden of proving
    (A) By clear and convincing evidence that he or she applied within 
one year of the alien's arrival in the United States or
    (B) To the satisfaction of the asylum officer, immigration judge, or 
Board of Immigration Appeals that he or she qualifies for an exception 
to the one-year deadline.
    (ii) The one-year period shall be calculated from the date of the 
alien's last arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997, whichever is 
later. In the case of an application that appears to have been filed 
more than a year after the applicant arrived in the United States, an 
asylum officer or immigration judge will determine whether the applicant 
qualifies under one of the exceptions to the deadline;
    (3) Prior denial of application. For purposes of section 
208(a)(2)(C) of the Act, an asylum application has not been denied 
unless denied by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration 
Appeals;
    (4) Changed circumstances. (i) The term ``changed circumstances'' in 
section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act shall refer to circumstances materially 
affecting the applicant's eligibility for asylum. They may include:
    (A) Changes in conditions in the applicant's country of nationality 
or, if

[[Page 169]]

the person is stateless, country of last habitual residence or
    (B) Changes in objective circumstances relating to the applicant in 
the United States, including changes in applicable U.S. law, that create 
a reasonable possibility that applicant may qualify for asylum.
    (ii) The applicant shall apply for asylum within a reasonable period 
given those ``changed circumstances.''
    (5) The term extraordinary circumstances in section 208(a)(2)(D) of 
the Act shall refer to events or factors beyond the alien's control that 
caused the failure to meet the 1-year deadline. Such circumstances shall 
excuse the failure to file within the 1-year period so long as the alien 
filed the application within a reasonable period given those 
circumstances. The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish to 
the satisfaction of the asylum officer or immigration judge that the 
circumstances were both beyond his or her control and that, but for 
those circumstances, he or she would have filed within the 1-year 
period. These circumstances may include:
    (i) Serious illness or mental or physical disability of significant 
duration, including any effects of persecution or violent harm suffered 
in the past, during the 1-year period after arrival;
    (ii) Legal disability (e.g., the applicant was an unaccompanied 
minor or suffered from a mental impairment) during the first year after 
arrival;
    (iii) Ineffective assistance of counsel, provided that:
    (A) The alien files an affidavit setting forth in detail the 
agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions 
to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the 
respondent in this regard;
    (B) The counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned has 
been informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and given an 
opportunity to respond; and
    (C) The alien indicates whether a complaint has been filed with 
appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of 
counsel's ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not;
    (iv) The applicant maintained Temporary Protected Status until a 
reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application; and
    (v) The applicant submitted an asylum application prior to the 
expiration of the 1-year deadline, but that application was rejected by 
the Service as not properly filed, was returned to the applicant for 
corrections, and was refiled within a reasonable period thereafter.
    (b) Filing location--(1) With the service center by mail. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this 
section, asylum applications shall be filed directly by mail with the 
service center servicing the asylum office with jurisdiction over the 
place of the applicant's residence or, in the case of an alien without a 
United States residence, the applicant's current lodging or the land 
border port-of-entry through which the alien seeks admission to the 
United States.
    (2) With the asylum office. Asylum applications shall be filed 
directly with the asylum office having jurisdiction over the matter in 
the case of an alien who has received the express consent of the 
Director of Asylum to do so.
    (3) With the immigration judge. Asylum applications shall be filed 
directly with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the case in 
the following circumstances:
    (i) During exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, with the 
Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the port, district office, or 
sector after service and filing of the appropriate charging document.
    (ii) After completion of exclusion, deportation, or removal 
proceedings, and in conjunction with a motion to reopen pursuant to 8 
CFR part 3 where applicable, with the Immigration Court having 
jurisdiction over the prior proceeding. Any such motion must reasonably 
explain the failure to request asylum prior to the completion of the 
proceedings.
    (iii) In asylum proceedings pursuant to Sec. 208.2(b)(1) and after 
the Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge has been served on the alien 
and filed with the Immigration Court having jurisdiction over the case.
    (4) With the Board of Immigration Appeals. In conjunction with a 
motion to

[[Page 170]]

remand or reopen pursuant to Secs. 3.2 and 3.8 of this chapter where 
applicable, an initial asylum application shall be filed with the Board 
of Immigration Appeals if jurisdiction over the proceedings is vested in 
the Board of Immigration Appeals under 8 CFR part 3. Any such motion 
must reasonably explain the failure to request asylum prior to the 
completion of the proceedings.
    (5) With the district director. In the case of any alien described 
in Sec. 208.2(b)(1) and prior to the service on the alien of Form I-863, 
any asylum application shall be submitted to the district director 
having jurisdiction pursuant to 8 CFR part 103. The district director 
shall forward such asylum application to the appropriate Immigration 
Court with the Form I-863 being filed with that Immigration Court.
    (c) Amending an application after filing. Upon request of the alien 
and as a matter of discretion, the asylum officer or immigration judge 
having jurisdiction may permit an asylum applicant to amend or 
supplement the application, but any delay caused by such request shall 
extend the period within which the applicant may not apply for 
employment authorization in accordance with Sec. 208.7(a).


<R05>
Sec. 208.5  Special duties toward aliens in custody of the Service.

    (a) General. When an alien in the custody of the Service requests 
asylum or withholding of removal or expresses a fear of persecution or 
harm upon return to his or her country of origin or to agents thereof, 
the Service shall make available the appropriate application forms and 
shall provide the applicant with the information required by section 
208(d)(4) of the Act, except in the case of an alien who is in custody 
pending a credible fear of persecution determination under section 
235(b)(1)(B) of the Act. Where possible, expedited consideration shall 
be given to applications of detained aliens. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of this section, such alien shall not be excluded, 
deported, or removed before a decision is rendered on his or her asylum 
application.
    (b) Certain aliens aboard vessels. (1) If an alien crewmember or 
alien stowaway on board a vessel or other conveyance alleges, claims, or 
otherwise makes known to an immigration inspector or other official 
making an examination on the conveyance that he or she is unable or 
unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality or last 
habitual residence (if not a national of any country) because of 
persecution or a fear of persecution in that country on account of race, 
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or 
political opinion, the alien shall be promptly removed from the 
conveyance. If the alien makes such fear known to an official while off 
such conveyance, the alien shall not be returned to the conveyance but 
shall be retained in or transferred to the custody of the Service.
    (i) An alien stowaway will be referred to an asylum officer for a 
credible fear determination under Sec. 208.30.
    (ii) An alien crewmember shall be provided the appropriate 
application forms and information required by section 208(d)(4) of the 
Act and may then have 10 days within which to submit an asylum 
application to the district director having jurisdiction over the port 
of entry. The district director, pursuant to Sec. 208.4(b), shall serve 
Form I-863 on the alien and immediately forward any such application to 
the appropriate Immigration Court with a copy of the Form I-863 being 
filed with that court.
    (2) Pending adjudication of the application, and, in the case of a 
stowaway the credible fear determination and any review thereof, the 
alien may be detained by the Service or otherwise paroled in accordance 
with Sec. 212.5 of this chapter. However, pending the credible fear 
determination, parole of an alien stowaway may be permitted only when 
the Attorney General determines, in the exercise of discretion, that 
parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a 
legitimate law enforcement objective.
    (c) Exception to prohibition on removal. A motion to reopen or an 
order to remand accompanied by an asylum application pursuant to 
Sec. 208.4(b)(3)(iii) shall not stay execution of a final exclusion, 
deportation, or removal order unless such stay is specifically granted 
by the Board of Immigration Appeals or the immigration judge having 
jurisdiction over the motion.

[[Page 171]]


<R05>
Sec. 208.6  Disclosure to third parties.

    (a) Information contained in or pertaining to any asylum application 
shall not be disclosed without the written consent of the applicant, 
except as permitted by this section or at the discretion of the Attorney 
General.
    (b) The confidentiality of other records kept by the Service that 
indicate that a specific alien has applied for asylum shall also be 
protected from disclosure. The Service will coordinate with the 
Department of State to ensure that the confidentiality of these records 
is maintained if they are transmitted to Department of State offices in 
other countries.
    (c) This section shall not apply to any disclosure to:
    (1) Any United States Government official or contractor having a 
need to examine information in connection with:
    (i) The adjudication of asylum applications;
    (ii) The defense of any legal action arising from the adjudication 
of or failure to adjudicate the asylum application;
    (iii) The defense of any legal action of which the asylum 
application is a part; or
    (iv) Any United States Government investigation concerning any 
criminal or civil matter; or
    (2) Any Federal, state, or local court in the United States 
considering any legal action:
    (i) Arising from the adjudication of or failure to adjudicate the 
asylum application; or
    (ii) Arising from the proceedings of which the asylum application is 
a part.


<R05>
Sec. 208.7  Employment authorization.

    (a) Application and approval. (1) Subject to the restrictions 
contained in sections 208(d) and 236(a) of the Act, an applicant for 
asylum who is not an aggravated felon shall be eligible pursuant to 
Secs. 274a.12(c)(8) and 274a.13(a) of this chapter to submit a Form I-
765, Application for Employment Authorization. Except in the case of an 
alien whose asylum application has been recommended for approval, or in 
the case of an alien who filed an asylum application prior to January 4, 
1995, the application shall be submitted no earlier than 150 days after 
the date on which a complete asylum application submitted in accordance 
with Secs. 208.3 and 208.4 has been received. In the case of an 
applicant whose asylum application has been recommended for approval, 
the applicant may apply for employment authorization when he or she 
receives notice of the recommended approval. If an asylum application 
has been returned as incomplete in accordance with Sec. 208.3(c)(3), the 
150-day period will commence upon receipt by the Service of a complete 
asylum application. An applicant whose asylum application has been 
denied by an asylum officer or by an immigration judge within the 150-
day period shall not be eligible to apply for employment authorization. 
If an asylum application is denied prior to a decision on the 
application for employment authorization, the application for employment 
authorization shall be denied. If the asylum application is not so 
denied, the Service shall have 30 days from the date of filing of the 
Form I-765 to grant or deny that application, except that no employment 
authorization shall be issued to an asylum applicant prior to the 
expiration of the 180-day period following the filing of the asylum 
application filed on or after April 1, 1997.
    (2) The time periods within which the alien may not apply for 
employment authorization and within which the Service must respond to 
any such application and within which the asylum application must be 
adjudicated pursuant to section 208(d)(5)(A)(iii) of the Act shall begin 
when the alien has filed a complete asylum application in accordance 
with Secs. 208.3 and 208.4. Any delay requested or caused by the 
applicant shall not be counted as part of these time periods, including 
delays caused by failure without good cause to follow the requirements 
for fingerprint processing. Such time periods shall also be extended by 
the equivalent of the time between issuance of a request for evidence 
pursuant to Sec. 103.2(b)(8) of this chapter and the receipt of the 
applicant's response to such request.
    (3) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section 
apply to applications for asylum filed on or after January 4, 1995.

[[Page 172]]

    (4) Employment authorization pursuant to Sec. 274a.12(c)(8) of this 
chapter may not be granted to an alien who fails to appear for a 
scheduled interview before an asylum officer or a hearing before an 
immigration judge, unless the applicant demonstrates that the failure to 
appear was the result of exceptional circumstances.
    (b) Renewal and termination. Employment authorization shall be 
renewable, in increments to be determined by the Commissioner, for the 
continuous period of time necessary for the asylum officer or 
immigration judge to decide the asylum application and, if necessary, 
for completion of any administrative or judicial review.
    (1) If the asylum application is denied by the asylum officer, the 
employment authorization shall terminate at the expiration of the 
employment authorization document or 60 days after the denial of asylum, 
whichever is longer.
    (2) If the application is denied by the immigration judge, the Board 
of Immigration Appeals, or a Federal court, the employment authorization 
terminates upon the expiration of the employment authorization document, 
unless the applicant has filed an appropriate request for administrative 
or judicial review.
    (c) Supporting evidence for renewal of employment authorization. In 
order for employment authorization to be renewed under this section, the 
alien must provide the Service (in accordance with the instructions on 
or attached to the employment authorization application) with a Form I-
765, the required fee (unless waived in accordance with Sec. 103.7(c) of 
this chapter), and (if applicable) proof that he or she has continued to 
pursue his or her asylum application before an immigration judge or 
sought administrative or judicial review. For purposes of employment 
authorization, pursuit of an asylum application is established by 
presenting to the Service one of the following, depending on the stage 
of the alien's immigration proceedings:
    (1) If the alien's case is pending in proceedings before the 
immigration judge, and the alien wishes to continue to pursue his or her 
asylum application, a copy of any asylum denial, referral notice, or 
charging document placing the alien in such proceedings;
    (2) If the immigration judge has denied asylum, a copy of the 
document issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals to show that a 
timely appeal has been filed from a denial of the asylum application by 
the immigration judge; or
    (3) If the Board of Immigration Appeals has dismissed the alien's 
appeal of a denial of asylum, or sustained an appeal by the Service of a 
grant of asylum, a copy of the petition for judicial review or for 
habeas corpus pursuant to section 242 of the Act, date stamped by the 
appropriate court.
    (d) In order for employment authorization to be renewed before its 
expiration, the application for renewal must be received by the Service 
90 days prior to expiration of the employment authorization.

Sec. 208.8  Limitations on travel outside the United States.

    (a) An applicant who leaves the United States without first 
obtaining advance parole under Sec. 212.5(e) of this chapter shall be 
presumed to have abandoned his or her application under this section.
    (b) An applicant who leaves the United States pursuant to advance 
parole under Sec. 212.5(e) of this chapter and returns to the country of 
claimed persecution shall be presumed to have abandoned his or her 
application, unless the applicant is able to establish compelling 
reasons for such return.


<R05>
Sec. 208.9  Procedure for interview before an asylum officer.

    (a) The Service shall adjudicate the claim of each asylum applicant 
whose application is complete within the meaning of Sec. 208.3(c)(3) and 
is within the jurisdiction of the Service.
    (b) The asylum officer shall conduct the interview in a 
nonadversarial manner and, except at the request of the applicant, 
separate and apart from the general public. The purpose of the interview 
shall be to elicit all relevant and useful information bearing on the 
applicant's eligibility for asylum. At the time of the interview, the 
applicant

[[Page 173]]

must provide complete information regarding his or her identity, 
including name, date and place of birth, and nationality, and may be 
required to register this identity electronically or through any other 
means designated by the Attorney General. The applicant may have counsel 
or a representative present, may present witnesses, and may submit 
affidavits of witnesses and other evidence.
    (c) The asylum officer shall have authority to administer oaths, 
verify the identity of the applicant (including through the use of 
electronic means), verify the identity of any interpreter, present and 
receive evidence, and question the applicant and any witnesses.
    (d) Upon completion of the interview, the applicant or the 
applicant's representative shall have an opportunity to make a statement 
or comment on the evidence presented. The asylum officer may, in his or 
her discretion, limit the length of such statement or comment and may 
require its submission in writing. Upon completion of the interview, the 
applicant shall be informed that he or she must appear in person to 
receive and to acknowledge receipt of the decision of the asylum officer 
and any other accompanying material at a time and place designated by 
the asylum officer, except as otherwise provided by the asylum officer. 
An applicant's failure to appear to receive and acknowledge receipt of 
the decision shall be treated as delay caused by the applicant for 
purposes of Sec. 208.7(a)(3) and shall extend the period within which 
the applicant may not apply for employment authorization by the number 
of days until the applicant does appear to receive and acknowledge 
receipt of the decision or until the applicant appears before an 
immigration judge in response to the issuance of a charging document 
under Sec. 208.14(b).
    (e) The asylum officer shall consider evidence submitted by the 
applicant together with his or her asylum application, as well as any 
evidence submitted by the applicant before or at the interview. As a 
matter of discretion, the asylum officer may grant the applicant a brief 
extension of time following an interview during which the applicant may 
submit additional evidence. Any such extension shall extend by an 
equivalent time the periods specified by Sec. 208.7 for the filing and 
adjudication of any employment authorization application.
    (f) The asylum application, all supporting information provided by 
the applicant, any comments submitted by the Department of State or by 
the Service, and any other information specific to the applicant's case 
and considered by the asylum officer shall comprise the record.
    (g) An applicant unable to proceed with the interview in English 
must provide, at no expense to the Service, a competent interpreter 
fluent in both English and the applicant's native language or any other 
language in which the applicant is fluent. The interpreter must be at 
least 18 years of age. Neither the applicant's attorney or 
representative of record, a witness testifying on the applicant's 
behalf, nor a representative or employee of the applicant's country of 
nationality, or if stateless, country of last habitual residence, may 
serve as the applicant's interpreter. Failure without good cause to 
comply with this paragraph may be considered a failure to appear for the 
interview for purposes of Sec. 208.10.


<R05>
Sec. 208.10  Failure to appear at an interview before an asylum officer or failure to follow requirements for fingerprint processing.

    Failure to appear for a scheduled interview without prior 
authorization may result in dismissal of the application or waiver of 
the right to an interview. Failure to comply with fingerprint processing 
requirements without good cause may result in dismissal of the 
application or waiver of the right to an adjudication by an asylum 
officer. Failure to appear shall be excused if the notice of the 
interview or fingerprint appointment was not mailed to the applicant's 
current address and such address had been provided to the Office of 
International Affairs by the applicant prior to the date of mailing in 
accordance with section 265 of the Act and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, unless the asylum officer determines that the applicant 
received reasonable notice of the interview or fingerprinting 
appointment. Failure to

[[Page 174]]

appear at the interview or fingerprint appointment will be excused if 
the applicant demonstrates that such failure was the result of 
exceptional circumstances.

<R05>
Sec. 208.11  Comments from the Department of State.

    (a) The Service shall forward to the Department of State a copy of 
each completed application it receives. At its option, the Department of 
State may provide detailed country conditions information relevant to 
eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.
    (b) At its option, the Department of State may also provide:
    (1) An assessment of the accuracy of the applicant's assertions 
about conditions in his or her country of nationality or habitual 
residence and his or her particular situation;
    (2) Information about whether persons who are similarly situated to 
the applicant are persecuted in his or her country of nationality or 
habitual residence and the frequency of such persecution; or
    (3) Such other information as it deems relevant.
    (c) Asylum officers and immigration judges may request specific 
comments from the Department of State regarding individual cases or 
types of claims under consideration, or such other information as they 
deem appropriate.
    (d) Any such comments received pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section shall be made part of the record. Unless the comments are 
classified under the applicable Executive Order, the applicant shall be 
provided an opportunity to review and respond to such comments prior to 
the issuance of any decision to deny the application.


<R05>
Sec. 208.12  Reliance on information compiled by other sources.

    (a) In deciding an asylum application, or whether the alien has a 
credible fear of persecution pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B) of the 
Act, the asylum officer may rely on material provided by the Department 
of State, the Office of International Affairs, other Service offices, or 
other credible sources, such as international organizations, private 
voluntary agencies, news organizations, or academic institutions.
    (b) Nothing in this part shall be construed to entitle the applicant 
to conduct discovery directed toward the records, officers, agents, or 
employees of the Service, the Department of Justice, or the Department 
of State.


<R05>
Sec. 208.13  Establishing asylum eligibility.

    (a) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the applicant for 
asylum to establish that he or she is a refugee as defined in section 
101(a)(42) of the Act. The testimony of the applicant, if credible, may 
be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration. The 
fact that the applicant previously established a credible fear of 
persecution for purposes of section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act does not 
relieve the alien of the additional burden of establishing eligibility 
for asylum.
    (b) Persecution. The applicant may qualify as a refugee either 
because he or she has suffered past persecution or because he or she has 
a well-founded fear of future persecution.
    (1) Past persecution. An applicant shall be found to be a refugee on 
the basis of past persecution if he or she can establish that he or she 
has suffered persecution in the past in his or her country of 
nationality or last habitual residence on account of race, religion, 
nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political 
opinion, and that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to or avail 
himself or herself of the protection of that country owing to such 
persecution.
    (i) If it is determined that the applicant has established past 
persecution, he or she shall be presumed also to have a well-founded 
fear of persecution unless a preponderance of the evidence establishes 
that since the time the persecution occurred conditions in the 
applicant's country of nationality or last habitual residence have 
changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a well-
founded fear of being persecuted if he or she were to return.
    (ii) An application for asylum shall be denied if the applicant 
establishes past persecution under this paragraph but it is also 
determined that he or she

[[Page 175]]

does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, unless it is determined that the applicant has 
demonstrated compelling reasons for being unwilling to return to his or 
her country of nationality or last habitual residence arising out of the 
severity of the past persecution. If the applicant demonstrates such 
compelling reasons, he or she may be granted asylum unless such a grant 
is barred by paragraph (c) of this section .
    (2) Well-founded fear of persecution. An applicant shall be found to 
have a well-founded fear of persecution if he or she can establish 
first, that he or she has a fear of persecution in his or her country of 
nationality or last habitual residence on account of race, religion, 
nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political 
opinion; second, that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering 
such persecution if he or she were to return to that country; and third, 
that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to or avail himself or 
herself of the protection of that country because of such fear. In 
evaluating whether the applicant has sustained his or her burden of 
proving that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution, the 
asylum officer or immigration judge shall not require the applicant to 
provide evidence that he or she would be singled out individually for 
persecution if:
    (i) The applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in 
his or her country of nationality or last habitual residence of 
persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on 
account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular 
social group, or political opinion; and
    (ii) The applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in and 
identification with such group of persons such that his or her fear of 
persecution upon return is reasonable.
    (c) Mandatory denials--(1) Applications filed on or after April 1, 
1997. For applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, an applicant 
shall not qualify for asylum if section 208(a)(2) or 208(b)(2) of the 
Act applies to the applicant. If the applicant is found to be ineligible 
for asylum under either section 208(a)(2) or 208(b)(2) of the Act, the 
applicant shall be considered for eligibility for withholding of removal 
under section 241(b)(3) of the Act.
    (2) Applications filed before April 1, 1997. (i) An immigration 
judge or asylum officer shall not grant asylum to any applicant who 
filed his or her application before April 1, 1997, if the alien:
    (A) Having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly 
serious crime in the United States, constitutes a danger to the 
community;
    (B) Has been firmly resettled within the meaning of Sec. 208.15;
    (C) Can reasonably be regarded as a danger to the security of the 
United States;
    (D) Has been convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined in 
section 101(a)(43) of the Act; or
    (E) Ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the 
persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, 
membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
    (ii) If the evidence indicates that one of the above grounds apply 
to the applicant, he or she shall have the burden of proving by a 
preponderance of the evidence that he or she did not so act.
    (d) Discretionary denial. An asylum application may be denied in the 
discretion of the Attorney General if the alien can be removed to a 
third country which has offered resettlement and in which the alien 
would not face harm or persecution.


<R05>
Sec. 208.14  Approval, denial, or referral of application.

    (a) By an immigration judge. Unless otherwise prohibited in 
Sec. 208.13(c), an immigration judge may grant or deny asylum in the 
exercise of discretion to an applicant who qualifies as a refugee under 
section 101(a)(42) of the Act.
    (b) By an asylum officer. Unless otherwise prohibited in 
Sec. 208.13(c):
    (1) An asylum officer may grant asylum in the exercise of discretion 
to an applicant who qualifies as a refugee under section 101(a)(42) of 
the Act.
    (2) If the alien appears to be deportable, excludable or removable 
under section 240 of the Act, the asylum officer shall either grant 
asylum or refer

[[Page 176]]

the application to an immigration judge for adjudication in deportation, 
exclusion, or removal proceedings. An asylum officer may refer such an 
application after an interview conducted in accordance with Sec. 208.9, 
or if, in accordance with Sec. 208.10, the applicant is deemed to have 
waived his or her right to an interview or an adjudication by an asylum 
officer.
    (3) If the applicant is maintaining valid nonimmigrant status at the 
time the application is decided, the asylum officer may grant or deny 
asylum, except in the case of an applicant described in 
Sec. 208.2(b)(1).
    (c) Applicability of Sec. 103.2(b) of this chapter. No application 
for asylum or withholding of deportation shall be subject to denial 
pursuant to Sec. 103.2(b) of this chapter.
    (d) Duration. If the alien's asylum application is granted, the 
grant will be effective for an indefinite period, subject to termination 
as provided in Sec. 208.22.
    (e) Effect of denial of principal's application on separate 
applications by dependents. The denial of an asylum application filed by 
a principal applicant for asylum shall also result in the denial of 
asylum status to any dependents of that principal applicant who are 
included in that same application. Such denial shall not preclude a 
grant of asylum for an otherwise eligible dependent who has filed a 
separate asylum application, nor shall such denial result in an 
otherwise eligible dependent becoming ineligible to apply for asylum due 
to the provisions of section 208(a)(2)(C) of the Act.

[62 FR 10337, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 12986, Mar. 17, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 208.15  Definition of ``firm resettlement.''

    An alien is considered to be firmly resettled if, prior to arrival 
in the United States, he or she entered into another nation with, or 
while in that nation received, an offer of permanent resident status, 
citizenship, or some other type of permanent resettlement unless he or 
she establishes:
    (a) That his or her entry into that nation was a necessary 
consequence of his or her flight from persecution, that he or she 
remained in that nation only as long as was necessary to arrange onward 
travel, and that he or she did not establish significant ties in that 
nation; or
    (b) That the conditions of his or her residence in that nation were 
so substantially and consciously restricted by the authority of the 
country of refuge that he or she was not in fact resettled. In making 
his or her determination, the Asylum Officer or Immigration Judge shall 
consider the conditions under which other residents of the country live, 
the type of housing made available to the refugee, whether permanent or 
temporary, the types and extent of employment available to the refugee, 
and the extent to which the refugee received permission to hold property 
and to enjoy other rights and privileges, such as travel documentation 
including a right of entry or reentry, education, public relief, or 
naturalization, ordinarily available to others resident in the country.


<R05>
Sec. 208.16  Withholding of removal.

    (a) Consideration of application for withholding of removal. An 
asylum officer shall not decide whether the exclusion, deportation, or 
removal of an alien to a country where the alien's life or freedom would 
be threatened must be withheld, except in the case of an alien who is 
otherwise eligible for asylum but is precluded from being granted such 
status due solely to section 207(a)(5) of the Act. In exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceedings, an immigration judge may adjudicate 
both an asylum claim and a request for withholding of removal whether or 
not asylum is granted.
    (b) Eligibility for withholding of removal; burden of proof. The 
burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal to 
establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the 
proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, 
membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The 
testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain 
the burden of proof without corroboration. The evidence shall be 
evaluated as follows:
    (1) The applicant's life or freedom shall be found to be threatened 
if it is more likely than not that he or she

[[Page 177]]

would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, 
membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
    (2) If the applicant is determined to have suffered persecution in 
the past such that his or her life or freedom was threatened in the 
proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, 
membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, it shall 
be presumed that his or her life or freedom would be threatened on 
return to that country unless a preponderance of the evidence 
establishes that conditions in the country have changed to such an 
extent that it is no longer more likely than not that the applicant 
would be so persecuted there.
    (3) In evaluating whether the applicant has sustained the burden of 
proving that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in a 
particular country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership 
in a particular social group, or political opinion, the asylum officer 
or immigration judge shall not require the applicant to provide evidence 
that he or she would be singled out individually for such persecution 
if:
    (i) The applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in 
the country of proposed removal of persecution of a group of persons 
similarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion, 
nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political 
opinion; and
    (ii) The applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in and 
identification with such group of persons such that it is more likely 
than not that his or her life or freedom would be threatened upon 
return.
    (c) Approval or denial of application--(1) General. Subject to 
paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, an application for 
withholding of deportation or removal to a country of proposed removal 
shall be granted if the applicant's eligibility for withholding is 
established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Mandatory denials. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, an application for withholding of removal shall be denied 
if the applicant falls within section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act or, for 
applications for withholding of deportation adjudicated in proceedings 
commenced prior to April 1, 1997, within section 243(h)(2) of the Act as 
it appeared prior to that date. For purposes of section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) 
of the Act, or section 243(h)(2)(B) of the Act as it appeared prior to 
April 1, 1997, an alien who has been convicted of a particularly serious 
crime shall be considered to constitute a danger to the community. If 
the evidence indicates the applicability of one or more of the grounds 
for denial enumerated in the Act, the applicant shall have the burden of 
proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not 
apply.
    (3) Exception to the prohibition on withholding of deportation in 
certain cases. Section 243(h)(3) of the Act, as added by section 413 of 
Public Law 104-132, shall apply only to applications adjudicated in 
proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997, and in which final action 
had not been taken before April 24, 1996. The discretion permitted by 
that section to override section 243(h)(2) of the Act shall be exercised 
only in the case of an applicant convicted of an aggravated felony (or 
felonies) where he or she was sentenced to an aggregate term of 
imprisonment of less than 5 years and the immigration judge determines 
on an individual basis that the crime (or crimes) of which the applicant 
was convicted does not constitute a particularly serious crime. 
Nevertheless, it shall be presumed that an alien convicted of an 
aggravated felony has been convicted of a particularly serious crime. 
Except in the cases specified in this paragraph, the grounds for denial 
of withholding of deportation in section 243(h)(2) of the Act as it 
appeared prior to April 1, 1997, shall be deemed to comply with the 1967 
Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
    (d) Reconsideration of discretionary denial of asylum. In the event 
that an applicant is denied asylum solely in the exercise of discretion, 
and the applicant is subsequently granted withholding of deportation or 
removal under this section, thereby effectively precluding admission of 
the applicant's spouse or minor children following to join him or her, 
the denial of asylum shall be reconsidered. Factors to be

[[Page 178]]

considered will include the reasons for the denial and reasonable 
alternatives available to the applicant such as reunification with his 
or her spouse or minor children in a third country.


<R05>
Sec. 208.17  Decisions.

    The decision of an asylum officer to grant or to deny asylum or 
withholding of removal, or to refer an asylum application in accordance 
with Sec. 208.14(b), shall be communicated in writing to the applicant. 
Notices of decisions to grant or deny asylum, or to refer an 
application, by asylum officers shall generally be served in person 
unless, in the discretion of the asylum office director, routine service 
by mail is appropriate. A letter communicating denial of the application 
shall state the basis for denial of the asylum application. The letter 
also shall contain an assessment of the applicant's credibility, unless 
the denial is the result of the applicant's conviction of an aggravated 
felony. Pursuant to Sec. 208.9(d), an applicant must appear in person to 
receive and to acknowledge receipt of the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 208.18  Determining if an asylum application is frivolous.

    For applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, an applicant is 
subject to the provisions of section 208(d)(6) of the Act only if a 
final order by an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals 
specifically finds that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum 
application. For purposes of this section, an asylum application is 
frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated. 
Such finding shall only be made if the immigration judge or the Board is 
satisfied that the applicant, during the course of the proceedings, has 
had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or 
implausible aspects of the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 208.19  Admission of the asylee's spouse and children.

    (a) Eligibility. A spouse, as defined in section 101(a)(35) of the 
Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(35), or child, as defined in section 101(b)(1)(A), 
(B), (C), (D), (E), or (F) of the Act, also may be granted asylum if 
accompanying or following to join the principal alien who was granted 
asylum, unless it is determined that:
    (1) The spouse or child ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise 
participated in the persecution of any persons on account of race, 
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or 
political opinion;
    (2) The spouse or child, having been convicted by a final judgment 
of a particularly serious crime in the United States, constitutes a 
danger to the community of the United States;
    (3) The spouse or child has been convicted of an aggravated felony, 
as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act; or
    (4) There are reasonable grounds for regarding the spouse or child a 
danger to the security of the United States.
    (b) Relationship. The relationship of spouse and child as defined in 
sections 101(a)(35) and 101(b)(1) of the Act must have existed at the 
time the principal alien's asylum application was approved and must 
continue to exist at the time of filing for accompanying or following-
to-join benefits and at the time of the spouse or child's subsequent 
admission to the United States. If the asylee proves that the asylee is 
the parent of a child who was born after asylum was granted, but who was 
in utero on the date of the asylum grant, the child shall be eligible to 
accompany or follow-to-join the asylee. The child's mother, if not the 
principal asylee, shall not be eligible to accompany or follow-to-join 
the principal asylee unless the child's mother was the principal 
asylee's spouse on the date the principal asylee was granted asylum.
    (c) Spouse or child in the United States. When a spouse or child of 
an alien granted asylum is in the United States, but was not included in 
the asylee's application, the asylee may request accompanying or 
following-to-join benefits for his/her spouse or child by filing for 
each qualifying family member a separate Form I-730, Refugee/Asylee 
Relative Petition, and supporting evidence, with the designated Service 
office, regardless of the status of that spouse or child in the United 
States. A recent photograph of each derivative must accompany the Form 
I-730. The photograph must clearly identify the derivative, and will be 
made part of the

[[Page 179]]

derivative's immigration record for identification purposes. 
Additionally, a separate Form I-730 must be filed by the asylee for each 
qualifying family member before February 28, 2000, or within 2 years of 
the date in which he/she was granted asylum status, whichever is later, 
unless it is determined by the Service that this period should be 
extended for humanitarian reasons. Upon approval of the Form I-730, the 
Service will notify the asylee of such approval on Form I-797, Notice of 
Action. Employment will be authorized incident to status. To demonstrate 
employment authorization, the Service will issue a Form I-94, Arrival-
Departure Record, which also reflects the derivative's current status as 
an asylee, or the derivative may apply under Sec. 274a.12(a) of this 
chapter, using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and 
a copy of the Form I-797. The approval of the Form I-730 shall remain 
valid for the duration of the relationship to the asylee and, in the 
case of a child, while the child is under 21 years of age and unmarried, 
provided also that the principal's status has not been revoked. However, 
the approved Form I-730 will cease to confer immigration benefits after 
it has been used by the beneficiary for admission to the United States 
as a derivative of an asylee.
    (d) Spouse or child outside the United States. When a spouse or 
child of an alien granted asylum is outside the United States, the 
asylee may request accompanying or following-to-join benefits for his/
her spouse or child(ren) by filing a separate Form I-730 for each 
qualifying family member with the designated Service office, setting 
forth the full name, relationship, date and place of birth, and current 
location of each such person. A recent photograph of each derivative 
must accompany the Form I-730. The photograph must clearly identify the 
derivative, and will be made part of the derivative's immigration record 
for identification purposes. A separate Form I-730 for each qualifying 
family member must be filed before February 28, 2000, or within 2 years 
of the date in which the asylee was granted asylum status, whichever is 
later, unless the Service determines that the filing period should be 
extended for humanitarian reasons. When the Form I-730 is approved, the 
Service will notify the asylee of such approval on Form I-797. The 
approved Form I-730 shall be forwarded by the Service to the Department 
of State for delivery to the American Embassy or Consulate having 
jurisdiction over the area in which the asylee's spouse or child is 
located. The approval of the Form I-730 shall remain valid for the 
duration of the relationship to the asylee and, in the case of a child, 
while the child is under 21 years of age and unmarried, provided also 
that the principal's status has not been revoked. However, the approved 
Form I-730 will cease to confer immigration benefits after it has been 
used by the beneficiary for admission to the United States as a 
derivative of an asylee.
    (e) Denial. If the spouse or child is found to be ineligible for the 
status accorded under section 208(c) of the Act, a written notice 
stating the basis for denial shall be forwarded to the principal alien. 
No appeal shall lie from this decision.
    (f) Burden of proof. To establish the claimed relationship of spouse 
or child as defined in sections 101(a)(35) and 101(b)(1) of the Act, 
evidence must be submitted with the request as set forth in part 204 of 
this chapter. Where possible this will consist of the documents 
specified in Sec. 204.2 (a)(1)(i)(B), (a)(1)(iii)(B), (a)(2), (d)(2), 
and (d)(5) of this chapter. The burden of proof is on the principal 
alien to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that any person on 
whose behalf he or she is making a request under this section is an 
eligible spouse or child.
    (g) Duration. The spouse or child qualifying under section 208(c) of 
the Act shall be granted asylum for an indefinite period unless the 
principal's status is revoked.

Sec. 208.20  Effect on exclusion, deportation, and removal proceedings.

    (a) An alien who has been granted asylum may not be deported or 
removed unless his or her asylum status is terminated pursuant to 
Sec. 208.22. An

[[Page 180]]

alien in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings who is granted 
withholding of removal or deportation may not be deported or removed to 
the country to which his or her deportation or removal is ordered 
withheld unless the withholding order is terminated pursuant to 
Sec. 208.22.
    (b) When an alien's asylum status or withholding of removal or 
deportation is terminated under this chapter, the Service shall initiate 
removal proceedings under section 235 or 240 of the Act, as appropriate, 
if the alien is not already in exclusion, deportation, or removal 
proceedings. Removal proceedings may also be in conjunction with a 
termination hearing scheduled under Sec. 208.22(e).


<R05>
Sec. 208.21  Restoration of status.

    An alien who was maintaining his or her nonimmigrant status at the 
time of filing an asylum application and has such application denied may 
continue in or be restored to that status, if it has not expired.


<R05>
Sec. 208.22  Termination of asylum or withholding of removal or deportation.

    (a) Termination of asylum by the Service. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section, an asylum officer may terminate a grant 
of asylum made under the jurisdiction of an asylum officer or a district 
director if following an interview, the asylum officer determines that:
    (1) There is a showing of fraud in the alien's application such that 
he or she was not eligible for asylum at the time it was granted;
    (2) As to applications filed on or after April 1, 1997, one or more 
of the conditions described in section 208(c)(2) of the Act exist; or
    (3) As to applications filed before April 1, 1997, the alien no 
longer has a well-founded fear of persecution upon return due to a 
change of country conditions in the alien's country of nationality or 
habitual residence or the alien has committed any act that would have 
been grounds for denial of asylum under Sec. 208.13(c)(2).
    (b) Termination of withholding of deportation or removal by the 
Service. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, an asylum 
officer may terminate a grant of withholding of deportation or removal 
made under the jurisdiction of an asylum officer or a district director 
if the asylum officer determines, following an interview, that:
    (1) The alien is no longer entitled to withholding of deportation or 
removal due to a change of conditions in the country to which removal 
was withheld;
    (2) There is a showing of fraud in the alien's application such that 
the alien was not eligible for withholding of removal at the time it was 
granted;
    (3) The alien has committed any other act that would have been 
grounds for denial of withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(B) 
of the Act had it occurred prior to the grant of withholding of removal; 
or
    (4) For applications filed in proceedings commenced before April 1, 
1997, the alien has committed any act that would have been grounds for 
denial of withholding of deportation under section 243(h)(2) of the Act.
    (c) Procedure. Prior to the termination of a grant of asylum or 
withholding of deportation or removal, the alien shall be given notice 
of intent to terminate, with the reasons therefor, at least 30 days 
prior to the interview specified in paragraph (a) of this section before 
an asylum officer. The alien shall be provided the opportunity to 
present evidence showing that he or she is still eligible for asylum or 
withholding of deportation or removal. If the asylum officer determines 
that the alien is no longer eligible for asylum or withholding of 
deportation or removal, the alien shall be given written notice that 
asylum status or withholding of deportation or removal and any 
employment authorization issued pursuant thereto, are terminated.
    (d) Termination of derivative status. The termination of asylum 
status for a person who was the principal applicant shall result in 
termination of the asylum status of a spouse or child whose status was 
based on the asylum application of the principal. Such termination shall 
not preclude the spouse or child of such alien from separately asserting 
an asylum or withholding of deportation or removal claim.

[[Page 181]]

    (e) Termination of asylum or withholding of deportation or removal 
by the Executive Office for Immigration Review. An immigration judge or 
the Board of Immigration Appeals may reopen a case pursuant to Sec. 3.2 
or Sec. 3.23 of this chapter for the purpose of terminating a grant of 
asylum or withholding of deportation or removal made under the 
jurisdiction of an immigration judge. In such a reopened proceeding, the 
Service must establish, by a preponderance of evidence, one or more of 
the grounds set forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. In 
addition, an immigration judge may terminate a grant of asylum or 
withholding of deportation or removal made under the jurisdiction of the 
Service at any time after the alien has been provided a notice of intent 
to terminate by the Service. Any termination under this paragraph may 
occur in conjunction with an exclusion, deportation or removal 
proceeding.
    (f) Termination of asylum for arriving aliens. If the Service 
determines that an applicant for admission who had previously been 
granted asylum in the United States falls within conditions set forth in 
section 208(c)(2) of the Act and is inadmissible, the Service shall 
issue a notice of intent to terminate asylum and initiate removal 
proceedings under section 240 of the Act. The alien shall present his or 
her response to the intent to terminate during proceedings before the 
immigration judge.

                 Subpart B--Credible Fear of Persecution


<R05>
Sec. 208.30  Credible fear determinations involving stowaways and applicants for admission found inadmissible pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of 
          the Act.

    (a) Jurisdiction. The provisions of this subpart apply to aliens 
subject to sections 235(a)(2) and 235(b)(1) of the Act. Pursuant to 
section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act, the Service has exclusive jurisdiction 
to make credible fear determinations, and the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review has exclusive jurisdiction to review such 
determinations. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, paragraphs 
(b) through (e) of this section are the exclusive procedures applicable 
to credible fear interviews, determinations, and review under section 
235(b)(1)(B) of the Act.
    (b) Interview and procedure. The asylum officer, as defined in 
section 235(b)(1)(E) of the Act, will conduct the interview in a 
nonadversarial manner, separate and apart from the general public. At 
the time of the interview, the asylum officer shall verify that the 
alien has received Form M-444, Information about Credible Fear Interview 
in Expedited Removal Cases. The officer shall also determine that the 
alien has an understanding of the credible fear determination process. 
The alien may be required to register his or her identity electronically 
or through any other means designated by the Attorney General. The alien 
may consult with a person or persons of the alien's choosing prior to 
the interview or any review thereof, and may present other evidence, if 
available. Such consultation shall be at no expense to the Government 
and shall not unreasonably delay the process. Any person or persons with 
whom the alien chooses to consult may be present at the interview and 
may be permitted, in the discretion of the asylum officer, to present a 
statement at the end of the interview. The asylum officer, in his or her 
discretion, may place reasonable limits on the number of such persons 
who may be present at the interview and on the length of statement or 
statements made. If the alien is unable to proceed effectively in 
English, and if the asylum officer is unable to proceed competently in a 
language chosen by the alien, the asylum officer shall arrange for the 
assistance of an interpreter in conducting the interview. The 
interpreter may not be a representative or employee of the applicant's 
country of nationality or, if the applicant is stateless, the 
applicant's country of last habitual residence. The asylum officer shall 
create a summary of the material facts as stated by the applicant. At 
the conclusion of the interview, the officer shall review the summary 
with the alien and provide the alien with an opportunity to correct 
errors therein. The asylum officer shall create a written record of his 
or her determination, including a summary of

[[Page 182]]

the material facts as stated by the applicant, any additional facts 
relied on by the officer, and the officer's determination of whether, in 
light of such facts, the alien has established a credible fear of 
persecution. The decision shall not become final until reviewed by a 
supervisory asylum officer.
    (c) Authority. Asylum officers conducting credible fear interviews 
shall have the authorities described in Sec. 208.9(c).
    (d) Referral for an asylum hearing. If an alien, other than an alien 
stowaway, is found to have a credible fear of persecution, the asylum 
officer will so inform the alien and issue a Form I-862, Notice to 
Appear, for full consideration of the asylum claim in proceedings under 
section 240 of the Act. Parole of the alien may only be considered in 
accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act and Sec. 212.5 of this 
chapter. If an alien stowaway is found to have a credible fear of 
persecution, the asylum officer will so inform the alien and issue a 
Form I-863, Notice to Referral to Immigration Judge, for full 
consideration of the asylum claim in proceedings under Sec. 208.2(b)(1).
    (e) Removal of aliens with no credible fear of persecution. If an 
alien is found not to have a credible fear of persecution, the asylum 
officer shall provide the alien with a written notice of decision and 
inquire whether the alien wishes to have an immigration judge review the 
negative decision, using Form I-869, Record of Negative Credible Fear 
Finding and Request for Review by Immigration Judge, on which the alien 
shall indicate whether he or she desires such review. If the alien is 
not a stowaway, the officer shall also order the alien removed and issue 
a Form I-860, Notice and Order of Expedited Removal. If the alien is a 
stowaway and the alien does not request a review by an immigration 
judge, the asylum officer shall also refer the alien to the district 
director for completion of removal proceedings in accordance with 
section 235(a)(2) of the Act.
    (f) Review by immigration judge. The asylum officer's negative 
decision regarding credible fear shall be subject to review by an 
immigration judge upon the applicant's request, in accordance with 
section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) of the Act. If the alien requests such 
review, the asylum officer shall arrange for the detention of the alien 
and serve him or her with a Form I-863, Notice of Referral to 
Immigration Judge. The record of determination, including copies of the 
Form I-863, the asylum officer's notes, the summary of the material 
facts, and other materials upon which the determination was based shall 
be provided to the immigration judge with the negative determination. 
Upon review of the asylum officer's negative credible fear 
determination:
    (1) If the immigration judge concurs with the determination of the 
asylum officer that the alien does not have a credible fear of 
persecution, the case shall be returned to the Service for removal of 
the alien.
    (2) If the immigration judge finds that the alien, other than an 
alien stowaway, possesses a credible fear of persecution, the 
immigration judge shall vacate the order of the asylum officer issued on 
Form I-860 and the Service may commence removal proceedings under 
section 240 of the Act, during which time the alien may file an asylum 
application in accordance with Sec. 208.4(b)(3)(i).
    (3) If the immigration judge finds that an alien stowaway possesses 
a credible fear of persecution, the alien shall be allowed to file an 
asylum application before the immigration judge in accordance with 
Sec. 208.4(b)(3)(iii). The immigration judge shall decide the asylum 
application as provided in that section. Such decision may be appealed 
by either the stowaway or the Service to the Board of Immigration 
Appeals. If and when a denial of the asylum application becomes final, 
the alien shall be removed from the United States in accordance with 
section 235(a)(2) of the Act. If and when an approval of the asylum 
application becomes final, the Service shall terminate removal 
proceedings under section 235(a)(2) of the Act.

PART 209--ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS OF REFUGEES AND ALIENS GRANTED ASYLUM--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
209.1  Adjustment of status of refugees.

[[Page 183]]

209.2  Adjustment of status of alien granted asylum.

    Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1101, 1103, 1157, 1158, 1159, 1228, 1252, 1282; 
8 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 209.1   Adjustment of status of refugees.

    The provisions of this section shall provide the sole and exclusive 
procedure for adjustment of status by a refugee admitted under section 
207 of the Act whose application is based on his or her refugee status.
    (a) Eligibility. (1) Every alien in the United States who is 
classified as a refugee under part 207 of this chapter, whose status has 
not been terminated, is required to apply to the Service 1 year after 
entry in order for the Service to determine his or her admissibility 
under section 212 of the Act.
    (2) Every alien processed by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service abroad and paroled into the United States as a refugee after 
April 1, 1980, and before May 18, 1980, shall be considered as having 
entered the United States as a refugee under section 207(a) of the Act.
    (b) Application. Upon admission to the United States, every refugee 
entrant shall be notified of the requirement to submit an application 
for permanent residence 1 year after entry. An application for the 
benefits of section 209(a) of the Act shall be filed on Form I-485, 
without fee, with the director of the appropriate Service office 
identified in the instructions which accompany the Form I-485. A 
separate application must be filed by each alien. Every applicant who is 
14 years of age or older must submit a completed Form G-325A 
(Biographical Information) with the Form I-485 application. Following 
submission of the Form I-485 application, a refugee entrant who is 14 
years of age or older will be required to execute a Form FD-258 
(Applicant Fingerprint Card) at such time and place as the Service will 
designate.
    (c) Medical examination. A refugee seeking adjustment of status 
under section 209(a) of the Act is not required to repeat the medical 
examination performed under Sec. 207.2(c), unless there were medical 
grounds of inadmissibility applicable at the time of admission. The 
refugee is, however, required to establish compliance with the 
vaccination requirements described under section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the 
Act, by submitting with the adjustment of status application a 
vaccination supplement, completed by a designated civil surgeon in the 
United States.
    (d) Interview. The Service director having jurisdiction over the 
application will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether an 
interview by an immigration officer is necessary to determine the 
applicant's admissibility for permanent resident status under this part.
    (e) Decision. The director will notify the applicant in writing of 
the decision of his or her application for admission to permanent 
residence. If the applicant is determined to be inadmissible or no 
longer a refugee, the director will deny the application and notify the 
applicant of the reasons for the denial. The director will, in the same 
denial notice, inform the applicant of his or her right to renew the 
request for permanent residence in removal proceedings under section 240 
of the Act. There is no appeal of the denial of an application by the 
director, but such denial will be without prejudice to the alien's right 
to renew the application in removal proceedings under part 240 of this 
chapter. If the applicant is found to be admissible for permanent 
residence under section 209(a) of the Act, the director will approve the 
application and admit the applicant for lawful permanent residence as of 
the date of the alien's arrival in the United States. An alien admitted 
for lawful permanent residence will be issued Form I-551, Alien 
Registration Receipt Card.

Sec. 209.2  Adjustment of status of alien granted asylum.

    The provisions of this section shall be the sole and exclusive 
procedure for adjustment of status by an asylee admitted under section 
208 of the Act whose application is based on his or her asylee status.
    (a) Eligibility. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the status of any alien who has been granted asylum in the 
United States may be adjusted by the director to that of an

[[Page 184]]

alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, provided the alien:
    (i) Applies for such adjustment;
    (ii) Has been physically present in the United States for at least 
one year after having been granted asylum;
    (iii) Continues to be a refugee within the meaning of section 
101(a)(42) of the Act, or is the spouse or child of a refugee;
    (iv) Has not been firmly resettled in any foreign country; and
    (v) Is admissible to the United States as an immigrant under the Act 
at the time of examination for adjustment without regard to paragraphs 
(4), (5)(A), (5)(B), and (7)(A)(i) of section 212(a) of the Act, and 
(vi) has a refugee number available under section 207(a) of the Act.

If the application for adjustment filed under this part exceeds the 
refugee numbers available under section 207(a) of the Act for the fiscal 
year, a waiting list will be established on a priority basis by the date 
the application was properly filed.
    (2) An alien, who was granted asylum in the United States prior to 
November 29, 1990 (regardless of whether or not such asylum has been 
terminated under section 208(b) of the Act), and is no longer a refugee 
due to a change in circumstances in the foreign state where he or she 
feared persecution, may also have his or her status adjusted by the 
director to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
even if he or she is no longer able to demonstrate that he or she 
continues to be a refugee within the meaning of section 10l(a)(42) of 
the Act, or to be a spouse or child of such a refugee or to have been 
physically present in the United States for at least one year after 
being granted asylum, so long as he or she is able to meet the 
requirements noted in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (iv), and (v) of this 
section. Such persons are exempt from the numerical limitations of 
section 209(b) of the Act. However, the number of aliens who are natives 
of any foreign state who may adjust status pursuant to this paragraph in 
any fiscal year shall not exceed the difference between the per country 
limitation established under section 202(a) of the Act and the number of 
aliens who are chargeable to that foreign state in the fiscal year under 
section 202 of the Act. Aliens who applied for adjustment of status 
under section 209(b) of the Act before June 1, 1990, are also exempt 
from its numerical limitation without any restrictions.
    (b) Inadmissible Alien. An applicant who is inadmissible to the 
United States under section 212(a) of the Act, may, under section 209(c) 
of the Act, have the grounds of inadmissibility waived by the director 
(except for those grounds under paragraphs (27), (29), (33), and so much 
of (23) as relates to trafficking in narcotics) for humanitarian 
purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public 
interest. An application for the waiver may be filed on Form I-602 
(Application by Refugee for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability) with the 
application for adjustment. An applicant for adjustment who has had the 
status of an exchange alien nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(J) of 
the Act, and who is subject to the foreign resident requirement of 
section 212(e) of the Act, shall be eligible for adjustment without 
regard to the foreign residence requirement.
    (c) Application. An application for the benefits of section 209(b) 
of the Act may be filed on Form I-485, with the correct fee, with the 
director of the appropriate Service office identified in the 
instructions to the Form I-485. A separate application must be filed by 
each alien. Every applicant who is 14 years of age or older must submit 
a completed Form G-325A (Biographic Information) with the Form I-485 
application. Following submission of the Form I-485 application, every 
applicant who is 14 years of age or older will be required to execute a 
Form FD-258 (Applicant Fingerprint Card) at such time and place as the 
Service will designate. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, the application must also be supported by evidence that the 
applicant has been physically present in the United States for at least 
1 year. If an alien has been placed in deportation or exclusion 
proceedings, the application can be filed and considered only in 
proceedings under section 240 of the Act.

[[Page 185]]

    (d) Medical examination. An alien seeking adjustment of status under 
section 209(b) of the Act 1 year following the grant of asylum under 
section 208 of the Act shall submit the results of a medical examination 
to determine whether any grounds of inadmissibility described under 
section 212(a)(1)(A) of the Act apply. Form I-693, Medical Examination 
of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status, and a vaccination supplement to 
determine compliance with the vaccination requirements described under 
section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act must be completed by a designed 
civil surgeon in the United States and submitted at the time of 
application for adjustment of status.
    (e) Interview. Each applicant for adjustment of status under this 
part shall be interviewed by an immigration officer. The interview may 
be waived for a child under 14 years of age. The Service director having 
jurisdiction over the application will determine, on a case-by-case 
basis, whether an interview by an immigration officer is necessary to 
determine the applicant's admissibility for permanent resident status 
under this part.
    (f) Decision. The applicant shall be notified of the decision, and 
if the application is denied, of the reasons for denial. No appeal shall 
lie from the denial of an application by the director but such denial 
will be without prejudice to the alien's right to renew the application 
in proceedings under part 240 of this chapter. If the application is 
approved, the director shall record the alien's admission for lawful 
permanent residence as of the date one year before the date of the 
approval of the application, but not earlier than the date of the 
approval for asylum in the case of an applicant approved under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.

Service shall refer the case to a U.S. Attorney for possible 
prosecution.
    (f) Family unity. The term family unity as used in section

    (g) Group 1. Special agricultural workers who have performed 
qualifying agricultural employment in the United States for at least 90 
man-days in the aggregate in each of the twelve-month periods ending on

of not less than one hour of qualifying agricultural employment for 
wages paid. If employment records relating to an alien applicant show 
only piece rate units completed, then any day in which piece rate work 
was performed shall be counted as a man-day. Work for more than one 
employer in a single day shall be counted as no more than one man-day 
for the purposes of this part.
    (k) Nonfrivolous application. A complete application will be 
determined to be nonfrivolous at the time the applicant appears for an

the applicable grounds of excludability may be waived under the 
provisions of section 210(c)(2)(i) of the Act,
    (2) Evidence or information which shows on its face that the 
applicant performed at least 90 man-days of qualifying employment in

The Secretary of State has designated for this purpose the United States 
Embassy at Mexico City, and in all other countries the immigrant visa 
issuing of office at which the alien, if an applicant for an immigrant 
visa, would make such application. Consular officers assigned to such 
offices are authorized to recommend approval of an application for 
special agricultural worker status to the Service if the alien 
establishes eligibility for approval and to deny such an application if 
the alien fails to establish eligibility for approval or is found to 
have committed fraud or misrepresented facts in the application process.
    (m) Preliminary application. A preliminary application is defined as 
a fully completed and signed application with fee and photographs which 
contains specific information concerning the performance of qualifying 
employment in the United States, and identifies documentary evidence 
which the applicant intends to submit as proof of such employment. The 
applicant must be otherwise admissible to the United States and must 
establish to the satisfaction of the examining officer during an 
interview that his or her claim to eligibility for special agriculture 
worker status is credible.
    (n) Public cash assistance. Public cash assistance means income or 
needs-based monetary assistance. This includes but is not limited to 
supplemental security income received by the alien or his immediate

employment means the performance of ``seasonal agricultural services'' 
described at section 210(h) of the Act as that term is defined in 
regulations by the Secretary of Agriculture at 7 CFR part 1d.
    (q) Regional processing facility. Regional Processing Facilities are 
Service offices established in each of the four Service regions to 
adjudicate, under the authority of the Directors of the Regional 
Processing Facilities, applications for adjustment of status under 
sections 210 and 245a of the Act.
    (r) Service. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).

Sec. 210.2  Application for temporary resident status.

    (a)(1) Application for temporary resident status. An alien 
agricultural worker who believes that he or she is eligible for 
adjustment of status under the provisions of Sec. 210.3 of this part may 
file an application for such adjustment at a qualified designated 
entity, at a legalization office, or at an overseas processing office 
outside the United States. Such application must be filed within the 
application period.
    (2) Application for Group 1 status. An alien who believes that he or 
she qualifies for Group 1 status as defined in Sec. 210.1(f) of this 
part and who desires to apply for that classification must so endorse 
his or her application at the time of filing. Applications not so 
endorsed will be regarded as applications for Group 2 status as defined 
in Sec. 210.1(g) of this part.
    (3) Numerical limitations. The numerical limitations of sections 201 
and 202 of the Act do not apply to the adjustment of aliens to lawful 
temporary or permanent resident status under section 210 of the Act. No 
more than 350,000 aliens may be granted temporary resident status in the 
Group 1 classification. If more than 350,000 aliens are determined to be 
eligible for Group 1 classification, the first 350,000 applicants (in 
chronological order by date the application is filed at a legalization 
or overseas processing office) whose applications are approved for Group 
1 status shall be accorded that classification. Aliens admitted to the 
United States under the transitional admission standard placed in effect 
between July 1, 1987, and November 1, 1987, and under the preliminary 
application standard at Sec. 210.2(c)(4) who claim eligibility for Group 
1 classification shall be registered as applicants for that 
classification on the date of submission to a legalization office of a 
complete application as defined in Sec. 210.1(c) of this part. Other 
applicants who may be eligible for Group 1 classification shall be 
classified as Group 2 aliens. There is no limitation on the number of 
aliens whose resident status may be adjusted from temporary to permanent 
in Group 2 classification.
    (b) Filing date of application--(1) General. The date the alien 
submits an application to a qualified designated entity, legalization 
office or overseas processing office shall be considered the filing date 
of the application, provided that in the case of an application filed at 
a qualified designated entity the alien has consented to have the entity 
forward the application to a legalization office. Qualified designated 
entities are required to forward completed applications to the 
appropriate legalization office within 60 days after

[[Page 188]]

the applicant gives consent for such forwarding.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) Filing of application--(1) General. The application must be 
filed on Form I-700 at a qualified designated entity, at a legalization 
office, at a designated port of entry, or at an overseas processing 
office within the eighteen-month period beginning on June 1, 1987 and 
ending on November 30, 1988.
    (2) Applications in the United States. (i) The application must be 
filed on Form I-700 with the required fee and, if the applicant is 14 
years or older, the application must be accompanied by a completed Form 
FD-258 (Fingerprint Card).
    (ii) All fees for applications filed in the United States, other 
than those within the provisions of Sec. 210.2(c)(4), must be submitted 
in the exact amount in the form of a money order, cashier's check, or 
bank check made payable to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
No personal checks or currency will be accepted. Fees will not be waived 
or refunded under any circumstances.
    (iii) In the case of an application filed at a legalization office, 
including an application received from a qualified designated entity, 
the district director may, at his or her discretion, require filing 
either by mail or in person, or may permit filing in either manner.
    (iv) Each applicant, regardless of age, must appear at the 
appropriate Service legalization office and must be fingerprinted for 
the purpose of issuance of Form I-688A. Each applicant shall be 
interviewed by an immigration officer, except that the interview may be 
waived when it is impractical because of the health of the applicant.
    (3) Filing at overseas processing offices. (i) The application must 
be filed on Form I-700 and must include a completed State Department 
Form OF-179 (Biographic Data for Visa Purposes).
    (ii) Every applicant must appear at the appropriate overseas 
processing office to be interviewed by a consular officer. The overseas 
processing office will inform each applicant of the date and time of the 
interview. At the time of the interview every applicant shall submit the 
required fee.
    (iii) All fees for applications submitted to an overseas processing 
office shall be submitted in United States currency, or in the currency 
of the country in which the overseas processing office is located. Fees 
will not be waived or refunded under any circumstances.
    (iv) An applicant at an overseas processing office whose application 
is recommended for approval shall be provided with an entry document 
attached to the applicant's file. Upon admission to the United States, 
the applicant shall proceed to a legalization office for presentation or 
completion of Form FD-258 (Fingerprint Card), presentation of the 
applicant's file and issuance of the employment authorization Form I-
688A.
    (4) Border processing. The Commissioner will designate specific 
ports of entry located on the southern land border to accept and process 
applications under this part. Ports of entry so designated will process 
preliminary applications as defined at Sec. 210.1(l) under the authority 
of the district directors in whose districts they are located. The ports 
of entry at Calexico, California, Otay Mesa, California, and Laredo, 
Texas have been designated to conduct preliminary application 
processing. Designated ports of entry may be closed or added at the 
discretion of the Commissioner.
    (i) Admission standard. The applicant must present a fully completed 
and signed Form I-700, Application for Temporary Resident Status with 
the required fee and photographs at a designated port of entry. The 
application must contain specific information concerning the performance 
of qualifying employment in the United States and identify documentary 
evidence which the applicant intends to submit as proof of such 
employment. The applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the 
examining officer during an interview that his or her claim to 
eligibility for special agricultural worker classification is credible, 
and that he or she is otherwise admissible to the United States under 
the provisions of Sec. 210.3(e) of this part including, if required, 
approval of an application for waiver of grounds of excludability.

[[Page 189]]

    (ii) Procedures. The fee for any application under this paragraph 
including applications for waivers of grounds of excludability, must be 
submitted in United States currency. Application fees shall not be 
collected until the examining immigration officer has determined that 
the applicant has presented a preliminary application and is admissible 
to the United States including, if required, approval of an application 
for waiver of grounds of excludability as provided in this paragraph. 
Applicants at designated ports of entry must present proof of identity 
in the form of a valid passport, a ``cartilla'' (Mexican military 
service registration booklet), a Form 13 (``Forma trece''--Mexican lieu 
passport identity document), or a certified copy of a birth certificate 
accompanied by additional evidence of identity bearing a photograph and/
or fingerprint of the applicant. Upon a determination by an immigration 
officer at a designated port of entry that an applicant has presented a 
preliminary application, the applicant shall be admitted to the United 
States as an applicant for special agricultural worker status. All 
preliminary applicants shall be considered as prospective applicants for 
the Group 2 classification. However, such applicants may later submit a 
complete application for either the Group 1 or Group 2 classification to 
a legalization office. Preliminary applicants are not required to pay 
the application fee a second time when submitting the complete 
application to a legalization office.
    (iii) Conditions of admission. Aliens who present a preliminary 
application shall be admitted to the United States for a period of 
ninety (90) days with authorization to accept employment, if they are 
determined by an immigration officer to be admissible to the United 
States. Such aliens are required, within that ninety-day period, to 
submit evidence of eligibility which meets the provisions of Sec. 210.3 
of this part; to complete Form FD-258 (Fingerprint Card); to obtain a 
report of medical examination in accordance with Sec. 210.2(d) of this 
part; and to submit to a legalization office a complete application as 
defined at Sec. 210.1(c) of this part. The INS may, for good cause, 
extend the ninety-day period and grant further authorization to accept 
employment in the United States if an alien demonstrates he or she was 
unable to perfect an application within the initial period. If an alien 
described in this paragraph fails to submit a complete application to a 
legalization office within ninety days or within such additional period 
as may have been authorized, his or her application may be denied for 
lack of prosecution, without prejudice.
    (iv) Deportation is not stayed for an alien subject to deportation 
and removal under the INA, notwithstanding a claim to eligibility for 
SAW status, unless that alien has filed a nonfrivolous application.
    (d) Medical examination. An applicant under this part must be 
examined at no expense to the government by a designated civil surgeon 
or, in the case of an applicant abroad, by a physician or clinic 
designated to perform medical examinations of immigrant visa applicants. 
The medical report setting forth the findings concerning the mental and 
physical condition of the applicant shall be incorporated into the 
record. Any applicant certified under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or 
(5) of section 212(a) of the Act may appeal to a Board of Medical 
Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as provided in section 234 of 
the Act and part 235 of this chapter.
    (e) Limitation on access to information and confidentiality. (1) 
Except for consular officials engaged in the processing of applications 
overseas and employees of a qualified designated entity where an 
application is filed with that entity, no person other than a sworn 
officer or employee of the Department of Justice or bureau or agency 
thereof, or contract personnel employed by the Service to work in 
connection with the legalization program, will be permitted to examine 
individual applications.
    (2) Files and records prepared by qualified designated entities 
under this section are confidential. The Attorney General and the 
Service shall not have access to these files and records without the 
consent of the alien.
    (3) All information furnished pursuant to an application for 
temporary resident status under this part including documentary evidence 
filed with

[[Page 190]]

the application shall be used only in the determination process, 
including a determination under Sec. 210.4(d) of this part, or to 
enforce the provisions of section 210(b)(7) of the Act, relating to 
prosecutions for fraud and false statements made in connection with 
applications, as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (4) If a determination is made by the Service that the alien has, in 
connection with his or her application, engaged in fraud or willful 
misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, knowingly provided 
a false writing or document in making his or her application, knowingly 
made a false statement or representation, or engaged in any other 
activity prohibited by section 210(b)(7) of the Act, the Service shall 
refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney for prosecution of the alien or 
any person who created or supplied a false writing or document for use 
in an application for adjustment of status under this part.
    (f) Decision. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the 
decision and, if the application is denied, of the reason(s) therefor. 
An adverse decision under this part including an overseas application 
may be appealed to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations 
(Administrative Appeals Unit) on Form I-694. The appeal with the 
required fee shall be filed with the Regional Processing Facility in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.3(a)(2) of this chapter. An 
applicant for Group 1 status as defined in Sec. 210.1(f) of this part 
who is determined to be ineligible for that status may be classified as 
a temporary resident under Group 2 as defined in Sec. 210.1(g) of this 
part if otherwise eligible for Group 2 status. In such a case the 
applicant shall be notified of the decision to accord him or her Group 2 
status and to deny Group 1 status. He or she is entitled to file an 
appeal in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.3(a)(2) of this 
chapter from that portion of the decision denying Group 1 status. In the 
case of an applicant who is represented in the application process in 
accordance with 8 CFR part 292, the applicant's representative shall 
also receive notification of decision specified in this section.
    (g) Motions. In accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.5(b) of 
this chapter, the director of a regional processing facility or a 
consular officer at an overseas processing office may sua sponte reopen 
any proceeding under this part under his or her jurisdiction and reverse 
any adverse decision in such proceeding when appeal is taken under 
Sec. 103.3(a)(2) of this part from such adverse decision; the Associate 
Commissioner, Examinations, and the Chief of the Administrative Appeals 
Unit may sua sponte reopen any proceeding conducted by that unit under 
this part and reconsider any decision rendered in such proceeding. The 
decision must be served on the appealing party within forty-five (45) 
days of receipt of any briefs and/or new evidence, or upon expiration of 
the time allowed for the submission of any briefs. Motions to reopen a 
proceeding or reconsider a decision shall not be considered under this 
part.
    (h) Certifications. The regional processing facility director may, 
in accordance with Sec. 103.4 of this chapter, certify a decision to the 
Associate Commissioner, Examinations when the case involves an unusually 
complex or novel question of law or fact. A consular officer assigned to 
an overseas processing office is authorized to certify a decision in the 
same manner and upon the same basis.

FR 21975, May 4, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 210.3  Eligibility.

    (a) General. An alien who, during the twelve-month period ending on 
May 1, 1986, has engaged in qualifying agricultural employment in the 
United States for at least 90 man-days is eligible for status as an 
alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence if otherwise admissible 
under the provisions of section 210(c) of the Act and if he or she is 
not ineligible under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Proof of eligibility--(1) Burden of proof. An alien applying for 
adjustment of status under this part has the burden of proving by a 
preponderance of the evidence that he or she has worked the requisite 
number of man-days, is admissible to the United States under

[[Page 191]]

the provisions of section 210(c) of the Act, is otherwise eligible for 
adjustment of status under this section and in the case of a Group 1 
applicant, has resided in the United States for the requisite periods. 
If the applicant cannot provide documentation which shows qualifying 
employment for each of the requisite man-days, or in the case of a Group 
1 applicant, which meets the residence requirement, the applicant may 
meet his or her burden of proof by providing documentation sufficient to 
establish the requisite employment or residence as a matter of just and 
reasonable inference. The inference to be drawn from the documentation 
provided shall depend on the extent of the documentation, its 
credibility and amenability to verification as set forth in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (3) of this section. If an applicant establishes that he or 
she has in fact performed the requisite qualifying agricultural 
employment by producing sufficient evidence to show the extent of that 
employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference, the burden then 
shifts to the Service to disprove the applicant's evidence by showing 
that the inference drawn from the evidence is not reasonable.
    (2) Evidence. The sufficiency of all evidence produced by the 
applicant will be judged according to its probative value and 
credibility. Original documents will be given greater weight than 
copies. To meet his or her burden of proof, an applicant must provide 
evidence of eligibility apart from his or her own testimony. Analysis of 
evidence submitted will include consideration of the fact that work 
performed by minors and spouses is sometimes credited to a principal 
member of a family.
    (3) Verification. Personal testimony by an applicant which is not 
corroborated, in whole or in part, by other credible evidence (including 
testimony of persons other than the applicant) will not serve to meet an 
applicant's burden of proof. All evidence of identity, qualifying 
employment, admissibility, and eligibility submitted by an applicant for 
adjustment of status under this part will be subject to verification by 
the Service. Failure by an applicant to release information protected by 
the Privacy Act or related laws when such information is essential to 
the proper adjudication of an application may result in denial of the 
benefit sought. The Service may solicit from agricultural producers, 
farm labor contractors, collective bargaining organizations and other 
groups or organizations which maintain records of employment, lists of 
workers against which evidence of qualifying employment can be checked. 
If such corroborating evidence is not available and the evidence 
provided is deemed insufficient, the application may be denied.
    (4) Securing SAW employment records. When a SAW applicant alleges 
that an employer or farm labor contractor refuses to provide him or her 
with records relating to his or her employment and the applicant has 
reason to believe such records exist, the Service shall attempt to 
secure such records. However, prior to any attempt by the Service to 
secure the employment records, the following conditions must be met: a 
SAW application (Form I-700) must have been filed; an interview must 
have been conducted; the applicant's testimony must support credibly his 
or her claim; and, the Service must determine that the application 
cannot be approved in the absence of the employer or farm labor 
contractor records. Provided each of these conditions has been met, and 
after unsuccessful attempts by the Service for voluntary compliance, the 
District Directors shall utilize section 235 of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act and issue a subpoena in accordance with 8 CFR 287.4, in 
such cases where the employer or farm labor contractor refuses to 
release the needed employment records.
    (c) Documents. A complete application for adjustment of status must 
be accompanied by proof of identity, evidence of qualifying employment, 
evidence of residence and such evidence of admissibility or eligibility 
as may be requested by the examining immigration officer in accordance 
with requirements specified in this part. At the time of filing, 
certified copies of documents may be submitted in lieu of originals. 
However, at the time of the

[[Page 192]]

interview, wherever possible, the original documents must be presented 
except for the following: Official government records; employment or 
employment related records maintained by employers, unions, or 
collective bargaining organizations; medical records; school records 
maintained by a school or school board; or other records maintained by a 
party other than the applicant. Copies of records maintained by parties 
other than the applicant which are submitted in evidence must be 
certified as true and correct by such parties and must bear their seal 
or signature or the signature and title of persons authorized to act in 
their behalf. If at the time of the interview the return of original 
documents is desired by the applicant, they must be accompanied by 
notarized copies or copies certified true and correct by a qualified 
designated entity or by the alien's representative in the format 
prescribed in Sec. 204.2(j)(1) or (2) of this chapter. At the discretion 
of the district director or consular officer, original documents, even 
if accompanied by certified copies, may be temporarily retained for 
further examination.
    (1) Proof of identity. Evidence to establish identity is listed 
below in descending order of preference:
    (i) Passport;
    (ii) Birth certificate;
    (iii) Any national identity document from a foreign country bearing 
a photo and/or fingerprint (e.g., ``cedula'', ``cartilla'', ``carte 
d'identite,'' etc.);
    (iv) Driver's license or similar document issued by a state if it 
contains a photo;
    (v) Baptismal record or marriage certificate;
    (vi) Affidavits, or
    (vii) Such other documentation which may establish the identity of 
the applicant.
    (2) Assumed names--(i) General. In cases where an applicant claims 
to have met any of the eligibility criteria under an assumed name, the 
applicant has the burden of proving that the applicant was in fact the 
person who used that name.
    (ii) Proof of common identity. The most persuasive evidence is a 
document issued in the assumed name which identifies the applicant by 
photograph, fingerprint or detailed physical description. Other evidence 
which will be considered are affidavit(s) by a person or persons other 
than the applicant, made under oath, which identify the affiant by name 
and address and state the affiant's relationship to the applicant and 
the basis of the affiant's knowledge of the applicant's use of the 
assumed name. Affidavits accompanied by a photograph which has been 
identified by the affiant as the individual known to the affiant under 
the assumed name in question will carry greater weight. Other documents 
showing the assumed name may serve to establish the common identity when 
substantiated by corroborating detail.
    (3) Proof of employment. The applicant may establish qualifying 
employment through government employment records, or records maintained 
by agricultural producers, farm labor contractors, collective bargaining 
organizations and other groups or organizations which maintain records 
of employment, or such other evidence as worker identification issued by 
employers or collective bargaining organizations, union membership cards 
or other union records such as dues receipts or records of the 
applicant's involvement or that of his or her immediate family with 
organizations providing services to farmworkers, or work records such as 
pay stubs, piece work receipts, W-2 Forms or certification of the filing 
of Federal income tax returns on IRS Form 6166, or state verification of 
the filing of state income tax returns. Affidavits may be submitted 
under oath, by agricultural producers, foremen, farm labor contractors, 
union officials, fellow employees, or other persons with specific 
knowledge of the applicant's employment. The affiant must be identified 
by name and address; the name of the applicant and the relationship of 
the affiant to the applicant must be stated; and the source of the 
information in the affidavit (e.g. personal knowledge, reliance on 
information provided by others, etc.) must be indicated. The affidavit 
must also provide information regarding the crop and the type of work 
performed by the applicant and the period during which such work was 
performed. The affiant must provide a certified copy of corroborating 
records

[[Page 193]]

or state the affiant's willingness to personally verify the information 
provided. The weight and probative value of any affidavit accepted will 
be determined on the basis of the substance of the affidavit and any 
documents which may be affixed thereto which may corroborate the 
information provided.
    (4) Proof of residence. Evidence to establish residence in the 
United States during the requisite period(s) includes: Employment 
records as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; utility bills 
(gas, electric, phone, etc.), receipts, or letters from companies 
showing the dates during which the applicant received service; school 
records (letters, report cards, etc.) from the schools that the 
applicant or his or her children have attended in the United States 
showing the name of school, name and, if available, address of student, 
and periods of attendance, and hospital or medical records showing 
similar information; attestations by churches, unions, or other 
organizations to the applicant's residence by letter which: Identify 
applicant by name, are signed by an official (whose title is shown), 
show inclusive dates of membership, state the address where applicant 
resided during the membership period, include the seal of the 
organization impressed on the letter, establish how the author knows the 
applicant, and the origin of the information; and additional documents 
that could show that the applicant was in the United States at a 
specific time, such as: Money order receipts for money sent out of the 
country; passport entries; birth certificates of children born in the 
United States; bank books with dated transactions; letters of 
correspondence between the applicant and another person or organization; 
Social Security card; Selective Service card; automobile license 
receipts, title, vehicle registration, etc.; deeds, mortgages, contracts 
to which applicant has been a party; tax receipts; insurance policies, 
receipts, or letters; and any other document that will show that 
applicant was in the United States at a specific time. For Group 2 
eligibility, evidence of performance of the required 90 man-days of 
seasonal agricultural services shall constitute evidence of qualifying 
residence.
    (5) Proof of financial responsibility. Generally, the evidence of 
employment submitted under paragraph (c)(3) of this section will serve 
to demonstrate the alien's financial responsibility. If it appears that 
the applicant may be inadmissible under section 212(a)(15) of the Act, 
he or she may be required to submit documentation showing a history of 
employment without reliance on public cash assistance for all periods of 
residence in the United States.
    (d) Ineligible classes. The following classes of aliens are 
ineligible for temporary residence under this part:
    (1) An alien who at any time was a nonimmigrant exchange visitor 
under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act who is subject to the two-year 
foreign residence requirement unless the alien has complied with that 
requirement or the requirement has been waived pursuant to the 
provisions of section 212(e) of the Act;
    (2) An alien excludable under the provisions of section 212(a) of 
the Act whose grounds of excludability may not be waived, pursuant to 
section 210(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act;
    (3) An alien who has been convicted of a felony, or three or more 
misdemeanors.
    (e) Exclusion grounds--(1) Grounds of exclusion not to be applied. 
Sections (14), (20), (21), (25), and (32) of section 212(a) of the Act 
shall not apply to applicants applying for temporary resident status.
    (2) Waiver of grounds for exclusion. Except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section, the Service may waive any other provision of 
section 212(a) of the Act only in the case of individual aliens for 
humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when the granting of 
such a waiver is in the public interest. If an alien is excludable on 
grounds which may be waived as set forth in this paragraph, he or she 
shall be advised of the procedures for applying for a waiver of grounds 
of excludability on Form I-690. When an application for waiver of 
grounds of excludability is submitted in conjunction with an application 
for temporary residence under this section, it shall be accepted for 
processing at the legalization office, overseas processing office,

[[Page 194]]

or designated port of entry. If an application for waiver of grounds of 
excludability is submitted after the alien's preliminary interview at 
the legalization office it shall be forwarded to the appropriate 
regional processing facility. All applications for waivers of grounds of 
excludability must be accompanied by the correct fee in the exact 
amount. All fees for applications filed in the United States other than 
those within the provisions of Sec. 210.2(c)(4) must be in the form of a 
money order, cashier's check, or bank check. No personal checks or 
currency will be accepted. Fees for waiver applications filed at the 
designated port of entry under the preliminary application standard must 
be submitted in United States currency. Fees will not be waived or 
refunded under any circumstances. Generally, an application for waiver 
of grounds of excludability under this part submitted at a legalization 
office or overseas processing office will be approved or denied by the 
director of the regional processing facility in whose jurisdiction the 
applicant's application for adjustment of status was filed. However, in 
cases involving clear statutory ineligibility or admitted fraud, such 
application for a waiver may be denied by the district director in whose 
jurisdiction the application is filed; in cases filed at overseas 
processing offices, such application for a waiver may be denied by a 
consular officer; or, in cases returned to a legalization office for 
reinterview, such application may be approved at the discretion of the 
district director. Waiver applications filed at the port of entry under 
the preliminary application standard will be approved or denied by the 
district director having jurisdiction over the port of entry. The 
applicant shall be notified of the decision and, if the application is 
denied, of the reason(s) therefor. The applicant may appeal the decision 
within 30 days after the service of the notice pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 103.3(a)(2) of this chapter.
    (3) Grounds of exclusion that may not be waived. The following 
provisions of section 212(a) of the Act may not be waived:
    (i) Paragraphs (9) and (10) (criminals);
    (ii) Paragraph (15) (public charge) except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section.
    (iii) Paragraph (23) (narcotics) except for a single offense of 
simple possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana.
    (iv) Paragraphs (27), (prejudicial to the public interest), (28), 
(communists), and (29) (subversive);
    (v) Paragraph (33) (Nazi persecution).
    (4) Special Rule for determination of public charge. An applicant 
who has a consistent employment history which shows the ability to 
support himself and his or her family, even though his income may be 
below the poverty level, is not excludable under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of 
this section. The applicant's employment history need not be continuous 
in that it is uninterrupted. It should be continuous in the sense that 
the applicant shall be regularly attached to the workforce, has an 
income over a substantial period of the applicable time, and has 
demonstrated the capacity to exist on his or her income and maintain his 
or her family without reliance on public cash assistance. This 
regulation is prospective in that the Service shall determine, based on 
the applicant's history, whether he or she is likely to become a public 
charge. Past acceptance of public cash assistance within a history of 
consistent employment will enter into this decision. The weight given in 
considering applicability of the public charge provisions will depend on 
many factors, but the length of time an applicant has received public 
cash assistance will constitute a significant factor.

Sec. 210.4  Status and benefits.

    (a) Date of adjustment. The status of an alien whose application for 
temporary resident status is approved shall be adjusted to that of a 
lawful temporary resident as of the date on which the fee was paid at a 
legalization office, except that the status of an alien who applied for 
such status at an overseas processing office whose application has been 
recommended for approval by that office shall be adjusted as of the date 
of his or her admission into the United States.

[[Page 195]]

    (b) Employment and travel authorization--(1) General. Authorization 
for employment and travel abroad for temporary resident status 
applicants under section 210 of the Act be granted by the INS. In the 
case of an application which has been filed with a qualified designated 
entity, employment authorization may only be granted after a 
nonfrivolous application has been received at a legalization office, and 
receipt of the fee has been recorded.
    (2) Employment and travel authorization prior to the granting of 
temporary resident status. Permission to travel abroad and to accept 
employment will be granted to the applicant after an interview has been 
conducted in connection with a nonfrivolous application at a Service 
office. If an interview appointment cannot be scheduled within 30 days 
from the date an application is filed at a Service office, authorization 
to accept employment will be granted, valid until the scheduled 
appointment date. Employment authorization, both prior and subsequent to 
an interview, will be restricted to increments not exceeding 1 year, 
pending final determination on the application for temporary resident 
status. If a final determination has not been made prior to the 
expiration date on the Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766, 
Form I-688A or Form I-688B) that date may be extended upon return of the 
employment authorization document by the applicant to the appropriate 
Service office. Persons submitting applications who currently have work 
authorization incident to status as defined in Sec. 274a.12(b) of this 
chapter shall be granted work authorization by the Service effective on 
the date the alien's prior work authorization expires. Permission to 
travel abroad shall be granted in accordance with the Service's advance 
parole provisions contained in Sec. 212.5(e) of this chapter.
    (3) Employment and travel authorization upon grant of temporary 
resident status. Upon the granting of an application for adjustment to 
temporary resident status, the service center will forward a notice of 
approval to the applicant at his or her last known address and to his or 
her qualified designated entity or representative. The applicant may 
appear at any Service office, and upon surrender of the previously 
issued Employment Authorization Document, will be issued Form I-688, 
Temporary Resident Card. An alien whose status is adjusted to that of a 
lawful temporary resident under section 210 of the Act has the right to 
reside in the United States, to travel abroad (including commuting from 
a residence abroad), and to accept employment in the United States in 
the same manner as aliens lawfully admitted to permanent residence.
    (c) Ineligibility for immigration benefits. An alien whose status is 
adjusted to that of a lawful temporary resident under section 210 of the 
Act is not entitled to submit a petition pursuant to section 203(a)(2) 
of the Act or to any other benefit or consideration accorded under the 
Act to aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (d) Termination of temporary resident status--(1) General. The 
temporary resident status of a special agricultural worker is terminated 
automatically and without notice under section 210(a)(3) of the Act upon 
entry of a final order of deportation by an immigration judge based on a 
determination that the alien is deportable under section 241 of the Act.
    (2) The status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence 
under section 210(a)(2) of the Act, may be terminated before the alien 
becomes eligible for adjustment of status under Sec. 210.5 of this part, 
upon the occurrence of any of the following:
    (i) It is determined by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
adjustment to temporary resident status was the result of fraud or 
willful misrepresentation as provided in section 212(a)(19) of the Act;
    (ii) The alien commits an act which renders him or her inadmissible 
as an immigrant, unless a waiver is secured pursuant to Sec. 210.3(e)(2) 
of this part;
    (iii) The alien is convicted of any felony, or three or more 
misdemeanors in the United States.
    (3) Procedure. (i) Termination of an alien's status under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section will be made only on notice to the alien sent by 
certified mail

[[Page 196]]

directed to his or her last known address, and to his or her 
representative. The alien must be given an opportunity to offer evidence 
in opposition to the grounds alleged for termination of his or her 
status. Evidence in opposition must be submitted within thirty (30) days 
after the service of the Notice of Intent to Terminate. If the alien's 
status is terminated, the director of the regional processing facility 
shall notify the alien of the decision and the reasons for the 
termination, and further notify the alien that any Service Form I-94, 
Arrival-Departure Record or other official Service document issued to 
the alien authorizing employment and/or travel abroad, or any Form I-
688, Temporary Resident Card previously issued to the alien will be 
declared void by the director of the regional processing facility within 
thirty (30) days if no appeal of the termination decision is filed 
within that period. The alien may appeal the decision to the Associate 
Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit) using Form I-
694. Any appeal with the required fee shall be filed with the regional 
processing facility within thirty (30) days after the service of the 
notice of termination. If no appeal is filed within that period, the 
Forms I-94, I-688 or other official Service document shall be deemed 
void, and must be surrendered without delay to an immigration officer or 
to the issuing office of the Service.
    (ii) Termination proceedings must be commenced before the alien 
becomes eligible for adjustment of status under Sec. 210.5 of this part. 
The timely commencement of termination proceedings will preclude the 
alien from becoming a lawful permanent resident until a final 
determination is made in the proceedings, including any appeal.

permanent residence as of the following dates:
    (1) Group 1. Aliens determined to be eligible for Group 1 
classification, whose adjustment to temporary residence occurred prior 
to November 30, 1988, shall be adjusted to lawful permanent residence as

residence occurred after November 30, 1988 shall be adjusted to lawful 
permanent residence one year from the date of the adjustment to 
temporary residence.
    (2) Group 2. Aliens determined to be eligible for Group 2 
classification whose adjustment to temporary residence occurred prior to

December 1, 1990. Those aliens whose adjustment to temporary residence 
occurred after November 30, 1988 shall be adjusted to lawful permanent 
residence two years from the date of the adjustment to temporary 
residence.
    (b) ADIT processing--(1) General. To obtain proof of permanent 
resident status an alien described in paragraph (a) of this section must 
appear at a legalization or Service office designated for this purpose 
for preparation of Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card. Such appearance 
may be prior to the date of adjustment, but only upon invitation by the 
Service. Form I-551 shall be issued subsequent to the date of 
adjustment.
    (2) Upon appearance at a Service office for preparation of Form I-
551, an alien must present proof of identity, suitable ADIT photographs, 
and a fingerprint and signature must be obtained from the alien on Form 
I-89.

    (b) Waivers. (1) A waiver of the visa required in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be granted without fee or application by the district 
director, upon presentation of the child's birth certificate, to a child

returning resident, if the district director is satisfied that the alien 
has established good cause for the alien's failure to present an 
immigrant visa, Form I-551, or reentry permit. Filing the Form I-90 will 
serve as both application for replacement and as application for waiver 
of passport and visa, without the obligation to file a separate waiver 
application.

whose status has been adjusted to that of a temporary resident under the 
provisions of Sec. 210.1 of this chapter, such status not having 
changed, and who is returning to an unrelinquished residence within one 
year after a temporary absence abroad.

aggregate of all such absences abroad during the temporary residence 
period has not exceeded 90 days.

States, provided that the child's application for admission to the 
United States is made within 2 years of birth, the child is accompanied

upon the first return of the parent to the United States after the birth 
of the child, and the accompanying parent is found to be admissible to 
the United States;
    (4) Is a stateless person or a person who because of his or her 
opposition to Communism is unwilling or unable to obtain a passport from 
the country of his or her nationality, or is the accompanying spouse or

    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if an alien 
seeking admission as an immigrant with an immigrant visa believes that 
good cause exists for his or her failure to present a passport, the 
alien may file an application for a waiver of this requirement

that the alien has established good cause for the alien's failure to 
present a passport.


<R05>
Sec. 211.3  Expiration of immigrant visas, reentry permits, refugee travel documents, and Form I-551.

    An immigrant visa, reentry permit, refugee travel document, or Form 
I-551 shall be regarded as unexpired if the rightful holder embarked or 
enplaned before the expiration of his or her immigrant visa, reentry 
permit, or refugee travel document, or with respect to Form I-551, 
before the first anniversary of the date on which he or she departed 
from the United States, provided that the vessel or aircraft on which he 
or she so embarked or enplaned arrives in the United States or foreign 
contiguous territory on a continuous voyage. The continuity of the 
voyage shall not be deemed to have been interrupted by scheduled or 
emergency stops of the vessel or aircraft en route to the United States 
or foreign contiguous territory, or by a layover in foreign contiguous 
territory necessitated solely for the purpose of effecting a 
transportation connection to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 211.4  Waiver of documents for returning residents.

    (a) Pursuant to the authority contained in section 211(b) of the

permanent residence who, upon return from a temporary absence was 
inadmissible because of failure to have or to present a valid passport, 
immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing card, or other document 
required at the time of entry, may be granted a waiver of such 
requirement in the discretion of the district director if the district 
director determines that such alien:
    (1) Was not otherwise inadmissible at the time of entry, or having 
been otherwise inadmissible at the time of entry is with respect thereto 
qualified for an exemption from deportability under section 237(a)(1)(H) 
of the Act; and

    (b) Denial of a waiver by the district director is not appealable

reconsideration in proceedings before the immigration judge.


<R05>
Sec. 211.5  Alien commuters.

    (a) General. An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or a 
special agricultural worker lawfully admitted for temporary residence 
under section 210 of the Act may commence or continue to reside in 
foreign contiguous territory and commute as a special immigrant defined 
in section 101(a)(27)(A) of the Act to his or her place of employment in 
the United States. An alien commuter engaged in seasonal work will be 
presumed to have taken up residence in the United States if he or she is 
present in this country for more than 6 months, in the aggregate, during 
any continuous 12-month period. An alien commuter's address report under 
section 265 of the Act must show his or her actual residence address 
even though it is not in the United States.
    (b) Loss of residence status. An alien commuter who has been out of 
regular employment in the United States for a continuous period of 6 
months shall be deemed to have lost residence status, notwithstanding 
temporary entries in the interim for other than employment purposes. An 
exception applies when employment in the United States was interrupted 
for reasons beyond the individual's control other than lack of a job 
opportunity or the commuter can demonstrate that he or she has worked 90 
days in the United States in the aggregate during the 12-month period 
preceding the application for admission into the United States. Upon 
loss of status, Form I-551 or I-688 shall become invalid and must be 
surrendered to an immigration officer.
    (c) Eligibility for benefits under the immigration and nationality 
laws. Until he

[[Page 200]]

or she has taken up residence in the United States, an alien commuter 
cannot satisfy the residence requirements of the naturalization laws and 
cannot qualify for any benefits under the immigration laws on his or her 
own behalf or on behalf of his or her relatives other than as specified 
in paragraph (a) of this section. When an alien commuter takes up 
residence in the United States, he or she shall no longer be regarded as 
a commuter. He or she may facilitate proof of having taken up such 
residence by notifying the Service as soon as possible, preferably at 
the time of his or her first reentry for that purpose. Application for 
issuance of a new Permanent Resident Card to show that he or she has 
taken up residence in the United States shall be made on Form I-90.

under 19 years of age, bearing diplomatic or official passports, who are 
in the actual company of such official at the time of entry into the

(M) of the Act.
    (c-2)  Aliens entering pursuant to International Boundary and Water

States and its territories and possessions without regard to paragraphs 
(14), (20) and (26) of section 212(a) of the Act pursuant to the terms 
of Pub. L. 99-239. Pending issuance by the aforementioned governments of 
travel documents to eligible citizens, travel documents previously 
issued by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands will continue to be 
accepted for purposes of identification and to establish eligibility for 
admission into the United States, its territories and possessions.
    (e) Aliens entering Guam pursuant to section 14 of Pub. L. 99-396, 
``Omnibus Territories Act.'' (1) A visa is not required of an alien who

prior to embarkation and the alien is a citizen of a country that:
    (i) Has a visa refusal rate of 16.9% or less, or a country whose

Immigration and Naturalization Service that a threat exists will result 
in the immediate deletion of that country from the listing in paragraph 
(e)(3) of this section.

as stated in paragraph (e)(2) of this section: Australia, Brunei, Burma,

enroute may be rescinded whenever the number of inadmissible passengers 
arriving in Guam who have transited a territory of the United States 
enroute to Guam exceeds 20 percent of all the inadmissible passengers 
arriving in Guam within any consecutive two-month period. Such 
rescission will be published in the Federal Register.
    (ii) For the purposes of this section, the term citizen of a country 
as used in 8 CFR 212.1(e)(1) when applied to Taiwan refers only to 
residents of Taiwan who are in possession of Taiwan National Identity

the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It does not refer to any other 
holder of a Taiwan passport or a passport issued by the People's 
Republic of China.

Visa Waiver Information Form I-736.
    (f) Direct transits--(1) Transit without visa. A passport and visa 
are not required of an alien who is being transported in immediate and 
continuous transit through the United States in accordance with the 
terms of an agreement entered into between the transportation line and 
the Service under the provisions of section 238(d) of the Act on Form I-
426 to insure such immediate and continuous transit through, and 
departure from, the United States en route to a specifically designated 
foreign country: Provided, That such alien is in possession of a travel 
document or documents establishing his/her identity and nationality and 
ability to enter some country other than the United States.

Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, the German Democratic Republic, 
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolian People's Republic, People's 
Republic of China, Poland, Romania, or the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics resident in one of said countries, only if he/she is 
transiting the United States by aircraft of a transportation line 
signatory to an agreement with the Service on Form I-426 on a direct 
through flight which will depart directly to a foreign place from the 
port of arrival.
    (3) Unavailability to transit. This waiver of passport and visa 
requirement is not available to an alien who is a citizen of 
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cuba, India, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Sri 
Lanka, or a national of a Republic of the former Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (effective August 16, 1993) which includes

Korea) or Democratic Republic of Vietnam and is a resident of the said

    (4) Foreign government officials in transit. If an alien is of the

Upon a nonimmigrant's application on Form I-193, a district director at 
a port of entry may, in the exercise of his or her discretion, on a 
case-by-case basis, waive the documentary requirements, if satisfied 
that the nonimmigrant cannot present the required documents because of 
an unforeseen emergency. The district director or the Deputy 
Commissioner may at any time revoke a waiver previously authorized 
pursuant to this paragraph and notify the nonimmigrant in writing to 
that effect.
    (h) Fiancees or fiances of U.S. citizens. Notwithstanding any of the 
provisions of this part, an alien seeking admission as a fiancee or 
fiance of a U.S. citizen pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act 
shall be in possession of a nonimmigrant visa issued by an American 
consular officer classifying the alien under that section.

country designated under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, who seeks

visitor for business or pleasure.
    (j) Officers authorized to act upon recommendations of United States

Service at the seat of Government level by the Department of State. 
Neither an application nor fee are required if the concurrence in a 
passport or visa waiver is requested by a U.S. consular officer or by an 
officer of the Visa Office. The district director or the Deputy 
Commissioner, may at any time revoke a waiver previously authorized 
pursuant to this paragraph and notify the nonimmigrant alien in writing 
to that effect.
    (k) Cancellation of nonimmigrant visas by immigration officers. Upon 
receipt of advice from the Department of State that a nonimmigrant visa 
has been revoked or invalidated, and request by that Department for such 
action, immigration officers shall place an appropriate endorsement 
thereon.
    (l) Treaty traders and investors. Notwithstanding any of the 
provisions of this part, an alien seeking admission as a treaty trader 
or investor under the provisions of Chapter 16 of the North American

<R05>
Sec. 212.2  Consent to reapply for admission after deportation, removal or departure at Government expense.

    (a) Evidence. Any alien who has been deported or removed from the 
United States is inadmissible to the United States unless the alien has 
remained outside of the United States for five consecutive years since 
the date of deportation or removal. If the alien has been convicted of 
an aggravated felony, he or she must remain outside of the United States 
for twenty consecutive years from the deportation date before he or she 
is eligible to re-enter the United States. Any alien who has been 
deported or removed from the United States and is applying for a visa, 
admission to the United States, or adjustment of status, must present 
proof that he or she has remained outside of the United States for the 
time period required for re-entry after deportation or removal. The 
examining consular or immigration officer must be satisfied that since 
the alien's deportation or removal, the alien has remained outside the 
United States for more than five consecutive years, or twenty 
consecutive years in the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated 
felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act. Any alien who does 
not satisfactorily present proof of absence from the United States for 
more than five consecutive years, or twenty consecutive years in the 
case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, to the consular or 
immigration officer, and any alien who is seeking to enter the United 
States prior to the completion

[[Page 205]]

of the requisite five- or twenty-year absence, must apply for permission 
to reapply for admission to the United States as provided under this 
part. A temporary stay in the United States under section 212(d)(3) of 
the Act does not interrupt the five or twenty consecutive year absence 
requirement.
    (b) Alien applying to consular officer for nonimmigrant visa or 
nonresident alien border crossing card. (1) An alien who is applying to 
a consular officer for a nonimmigrant visa or a nonresident alien border 
crossing card, must request permission to reapply for admission to the 
United States if five years, or twenty years if the alien's deportation 
was based upon a conviction for an aggravated felony, have not elapsed 
since the date of deportation or removal. This permission shall be 
requested in the manner prescribed through the consular officer, and may 
be granted only in accordance with sections 212(a)(17) and 212(d)(3)(A) 
of the Act and Sec. 212.4 of this part. However, the alien may apply for 
such permission by submitting Form I-212, Application for Permission to 
Reapply for Admission into the United States after Deportation or 
Removal, to the consular officer if that officer is willing to accept 
the application, and recommends to the district director that the alien 
be permitted to apply.
    (2) The consular officer shall forward the Form I-212 to the 
district director with jurisdiction over the place where the deportation 
or removal proceedings were held.
    (c) Special provisions for an applicant for nonimmigrant visa under 
section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act. (1) An applicant for a nonimmigrant 
visa under section 101(a)(15)(K) must:
    (i) Be the beneficiary of a valid visa petition approved by the 
Service; and
    (ii) File an application on Form I-212 with the consular officer for 
permission to reapply for admission to the United States after 
deportation or removal.
    (2) The consular officer must forward the Form I-212 to the Service 
office with jurisdiction over the area within which the consular officer 
is located. If the alien is ineligible on grounds which, upon the 
applicant's marriage to the United States citizen petitioner, may be 
waived under section 212 (g), (h), or (i) of the Act, the consular 
officer must also forward a recommendation as to whether the waiver 
should be granted.
    (d) Applicant for immigrant visa. An applicant for an immigrant visa 
who is not physically present in the United States and who requires 
permission to reapply must file Form I-212 with the district director 
having jurisdiction over the place where the deportation or removal 
proceedings were held. If the applicant also requires a waiver under 
section 212 (g), (h), or (i) of the Act, Form I-601, Application for 
Waiver of Grounds of Excludability, must be filed simultaneously with 
the Form I-212 with the American consul having jurisdiction over the 
alien's place of residence. The consul must forward these forms to the 
appropriate Service office abroad with jurisdiction over the area within 
which the consul is located.
    (e) Applicant for adjustment of status. An applicant for adjustment 
of status under section 245 of the Act and part 245 of this chapter must 
request permission to reapply for entry in conjunction with his or her 
application for adjustment of status. This request is made by filing an 
application for permission to reapply, Form I-212, with the district 
director having jurisdiction over the place where the alien resides. If 
the application under section 245 of the Act has been initiated, 
renewed, or is pending in a proceeding before an immigration judge, the 
district director must refer the Form I-212 to the immigration judge for 
adjudication.
    (f) Applicant for admission at port of entry. Within five years of 
the deportation or removal, or twenty years in the case of an alien 
convicted of an aggravated felony, an alien may request permission at a 
port of entry to reapply for admission to the United States. The alien 
shall file the Form I-212 with the district director having jurisdiction 
over the port of entry.
    (g) Other applicants. (1) Any applicant for permission to reapply 
for admission under circumstances other than those described in 
paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section must file Form I-212. This 
form is filed with either:

[[Page 206]]

    (i) The district director having jurisdiction over the place where 
the deportation or removal proceedings were held; or
    (ii) The district director who exercised or is exercising 
jurisdiction over the applicant's most recent proceeding.
    (2) If the applicant is physically present in the United States but 
is ineligible to apply for adjustment of status, he or she must file the 
application with the district director having jurisdiction over his or 
her place of residence.
    (h) Decision. An applicant who has submitted a request for consent 
to reapply for admission after deportation or removal must be notified 
of the decision. If the application is denied, the applicant must be 
notified of the reasons for the denial and of his or her right to appeal 
as provided in part 103 of this chapter. Except in the case of an 
applicant seeking to be granted advance permission to reapply for 
admission prior to his or her departure from the United States, the 
denial of the application shall be without prejudice to the renewal of 
the application in the course of proceedings before an immigration judge 
under section 242 of the Act and this chapter.
    (i) Retroactive approval. (1) If the alien filed Form I-212 when 
seeking admission at a port of entry, the approval of the Form I-212 
shall be retroactive to either:
    (i) The date on which the alien embarked or reembarked at a place 
outside the United States; or
    (ii) The date on which the alien attempted to be admitted from 
foreign contiguous territory.
    (2) If the alien filed Form I-212 in conjunction with an application 
for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, the approval of 
Form I-212 shall be retroactive to the date on which the alien embarked 
or reembarked at a place outside the United States.
    (j) Advance approval. An alien whose departure will execute an order 
of deportation shall receive a conditional approval depending upon his 
or her satisfactory departure. However, the grant of permission to 
reapply does not waive inadmissibility under section 212(a) (16) or (17) 
of the Act resulting from exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings 
which are instituted subsequent to the date permission to reapply is 
granted.

<R05>
Sec. 212.3  Application for the exercise of discretion under section 212(c).

    (a) Jurisdiction. An application for the exercise of discretion 
under section 212(c) of the Act shall be submitted on Form I-191, 
Application for Advance Permission to Return to Unrelinquished Domicile, 
to:
    (1) The district director having jurisdiction over the area in which 
the applicant's intended or actual place of residence in the United 
States is located; or
    (2) The Immigration Court if the application is made in the course 
of proceedings under sections 235, 236, or 242 of the Act.
    (b) Filing of application. The application may be filed prior to, at 
the time of, or at any time after the applicant's departure from or 
arrival into the United States. All material facts and/or circumstances 
which the applicant knows or believes apply to the grounds of 
excludability or deportability must be described. The applicant must 
also submit all available documentation relating to such grounds.
    (c) Decision of the District Director. A district director may grant 
or deny an application for advance permission to return to an 
unrelinquished domicile under section 212(c) of the Act, in the exercise 
of discretion, unless otherwise prohibited by paragraph (f) of this 
section. The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, if the 
application is denied, of the reason(s) for denial. No appeal shall lie 
from denial of the application, but the application may be renewed 
before an Immigration Judge as provided in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (d) Validity. Once an application is approved, that approval is 
valid indefinitely. However, the approval covers only those specific 
grounds of excludability or deportability that were described in the 
application. An application who failed to describe any other grounds of 
excludability or deportability, or failed to disclose material facts 
existing at the time of the approval of

[[Page 207]]

the application, remains excludable or deportable under the previously 
unidentified grounds. If at a later date, the applicant becomes subject 
to exclusion or deportation based upon these previously unidentified 
grounds or upon new ground(s), a new application must be filed with the 
appropriate district director.
    (e) Filing or renewal of applications before an Immigration Judge. 
(1) An application for the exercise of discretion under section 212(c) 
of the Act may be renewed or submitted in proceedings before an 
Immigration Judge under sections 235, 236, or 242 of the Act, and under 
this chapter. Such application shall be adjudicated by the Immigration 
Judge, without regard to whether the applicant previously has made 
application to the district director.
    (2) The Immigration Judge may grant or deny an application for 
advance permission to return to an unrelinquished domicile under section 
212(c) of the Act, in the exercise of discretion, unless otherwise 
prohibited by paragraph (f) of this section.
    (3) An alien otherwise entitled to appeal to the Board of 
Immigration Appeals may appeal the denial by the Immigration Judge of 
this application in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3.36 of this 
chapter.
    (f) Limitations on discretion to grant an application under section 
212(c) of the Act. A district director or Immigration Judge shall deny 
an application for advance permission to enter under section 212(c) of 
the Act if:
    (1) The alien has not been lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence;
    (2) The alien has not maintained lawful domicile in the United 
States, as either a lawful permanent resident or a lawful temporary 
resident pursuant to section 245A or section 210 of the Act, for at 
least seven consecutive years immediately preceding the filing of the 
application;
    (3) The alien is subject to exclusion from the United States under 
paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), or (3)(E) of section 212(a) of the 
Act;
    (4) The alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony, as defined 
by section 101(a)(43) of the Act, and has served a term of imprisonment 
of at least five years for such conviction; or

years of the barring act as enumerated in one or more sections of 
section 242B(e) (1) through (4) of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 212.4  Applications for the exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(1) and 212(d)(3).

    (a) Applications under section 212(d)(3)(A)--(1) General. District 
directors and officers in charge outside the United States in the 
districts of Bangkok, Thailand; Mexico City, Mexico; and Rome, Italy are 
authorized to act upon recommendations made by consular officers for the 
exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act. The 
District Director, Washington, DC, has jurisdiction in such cases 
recommended to the Service at the seat-of-government level by the 
Department of State. When a consular officer or other State Department 
official recommends that the benefits of section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act 
be accorded an alien, neither an application nor fee shall be required. 
The recommendation shall specify:
    (i) The reasons for inadmissibility and each section of law under 
which the alien is inadmissible;
    (ii) Each intended date of arrival;
    (iii) The length of each proposed stay in the United States;
    (iv) The purpose of each stay;
    (v) The number of entries which the alien intends to make; and
    (vi) The justification for exercising the authority contained in 
section 212(d)(3) of the Act.

If the alien desires to make multiple entries and the consular officer 
or other State Department official believes that the circumstances 
justify the issuance of a visa valid for multiple entries rather than 
for a specified number of entries, and recommends that the alien be 
accorded an authorization valid for multiple entries, the information 
required by items (ii) and (iii) shall be furnished only with respect to 
the initial entry. Item (ii) does not apply to a bona fide crewman. The 
consular officer or other State Department official shall be notified of 
the decision on his recommendation. No appeal by

[[Page 208]]

the alien shall lie from an adverse decision made by a Service officer 
on the recommendation of a consular officer or other State Department 
official.
    (2) Authority of consular officers to approve section 212(d)(3)(A) 
recommendations pertaining to aliens inadmissible under section 
212(a)(28)(C). In certain categories of visa cases defined by the 
Secretary of State, United States consular officers assigned to visa-
issuing posts abroad may, on behalf of the Attorney General pursuant to 
section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act, approve a recommendation by another 
consular officer that an alien be admitted temporarily despite visa 
ineligibility solely because the alien is of the class of aliens defined 
at section 212(a)(28)(C) of the Act, as a result of presumed or actual 
membership in, or affiliation with, an organization described in that 
section. Authorizations for temporary admission granted by consular 
officers shall be subject to the terms specified in Sec. 212.4(c) of 
this chapter. Any recommendation which is not clearly approvable shall, 
and any recommendation may, be presented to the appropriate official of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service for a determination.
    (b) Applications under section 212(d)(3)(B). An application for the 
exercise of discretion under section 212(d)(3)(B) of the Act shall be 
submitted on Form I-192 to the district director in charge of the 
applicant's intended port of entry prior to the applicant's arrival in 
the United States. (For Department of State procedure when a visa is 
required, see 22 CFR 41.95 and paragraph (a) of this section.) If the 
application is made because the applicant may be inadmissible due to 
present or past membership in or affiliation with any Communist or other 
totalitarian party or organization, there shall be attached to the 
application a written statement of the history of the applicant's 
membership or affiliation, including the period of such membership or 
affiliation, whether the applicant held any office in the organization, 
and whether his membership or affiliation was voluntary or involuntary. 
If the applicant alleges that his membership or affiliation was 
involuntary, the statement shall include the basis for that allegation. 
When the application is made because the applicant may be inadmissible 
due to disease, mental or physical defect, or disability of any kind, 
the application shall describe the disease, defect, or disability. If 
the purpose of seeking admission to the United States is for treatment, 
there shall be attached to the application statements in writing to 
establish that satisfactory treatment cannot be obtained outside the 
United States; that arrangements have been completed for treatment, and 
where and from whom treatment will be received; what financial 
arrangements for payment of expenses incurred in connection with the 
treatment have been made, and that a bond will be available if required. 
When the application is made because the applicant may be inadmissible 
due to the conviction of one or more crimes, the designation of each 
crime, the date and place of its commission and of the conviction 
thereof, and the sentence or other judgment of the court shall be stated 
in the application; in such a case the application shall be supplemented 
by the official record of each conviction, and any other documents 
relating to commutation of sentence, parole, probation, or pardon. If 
the application is made at the time of the applicant's arrival to the 
district director at a port of entry, the applicant shall establish that 
he was not aware of the ground of inadmissibility and that it could not 
have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, and he 
shall be in possession of a passport and visa, if required, or have been 
granted a waiver thereof. The applicant shall be notified of the 
decision and if the application is denied of the reasons therefor and of 
his right to appeal to the Board within 15 days after the mailing of the 
notification of decision in accordance with the Provisions of part 3 of 
this chapter. If denied, the denial shall be without prejudice to 
renewal of the application in the course of proceedings before a special 
inquiry officer under sections 235 and 236 of the Act and this chapter. 
When an appeal may not be taken from a decision of a special inquiry 
officer excluding an alien but the alien has applied for the exercise of 
discretion under section 212(d)(3)(B) of the Act,

[[Page 209]]

the alien may appeal to the Board from a denial of such application in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 236.5(b) of this chapter.
    (c) Terms of authorization. Each authorization under section 
212(d)(3) (A) or (B) of the Act shall specify:
    (1) Each section of law under which the alien is inadmissible;
    (2) The intended date of each arrival;
    (3) The length of each stay authorized in the United States;
    (4) The purpose of each stay;
    (5) The number of entries for which the authorization is valid;
    (6) The dates on or between which each application for admission at 
ports of entry in the United States is valid; and
    (7) The justification for exercising the authority contained in 
section 212(d)(3) of the Act. If the consular officer has recommended 
under section 212(d)(3)(A), or an applicant under section 212(d)(3)(B) 
seeks, the issuance of an authorization valid for multiple entries 
rather than for a specified number of entries, and it is determined that 
the circumstances justify the issuance of the authorization valid for 
mutiple entries, the information required by items (2) and (3) shall be 
specified only with respect to the initial entry. Item (2) does not 
apply to a bona fide crewman. Authorizations granted to crewmen may be 
valid for a maximum period of 2 years for application for admission at 
U.S. ports of entry and may be valid for multiple entries. An 
authorization issued in conjunction with an application for a 
nonresident alien border crossing card shall be valid for a period not 
to exceed the validity of such card for applications for admission at 
U.S. ports of entry and shall be valid for multiple entries. A multiple 
entry authorization for a person other than a crewman or applicant for a 
border crossing card may be made valid for a maximum period of 1 year 
for applications for admission at U.S. ports of entry, except that a 
period in excess of 1 year may be permitted on the recommendation of the 
Department of State. A single entry authorization to apply for admission 
at a U.S. port of entry shall not be valid for more than 6 months from 
the date the authorization is issued. All admissions pursuant to section 
212(d)(3) of the Act shall be subject to the terms and conditions set 
forth in the authorization. The period for which the alien's admission 
is authorized pursuant to item (3) shall not exceed the period 
justified, subject to the limitations specified in part 214 of this 
chapter for each class of nonimmigrants. Each authorization shall 
specify that it is subject to revocation at any time. Unless the alien 
applies for admission during the period of validity of the 
authorization, a new authorization is required. An authorization may not 
be revalidated.
    (d) Admission of groups inadmissible under section 212(a)(28) for 
attendance at international conferences. When the Secretary of State 
recommends that a group of nonimmigrant aliens and their accompanying 
family members be admitted to attend international conferences 
notwithstanding their inadmissibility under section 212(a)(28) of the 
Act, the Deputy Commissioner, may enter an order pursuant to the 
authority contained in section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act specifying the 
terms and conditions of their admission and stay.
    (e) Inadmissibility under section 212(a)(1). Pursuant to the 
authority contained in section 212(d)(3) of the Act, the temporary 
admission of a nonimmigrant visitor is authorized notwithstanding 
inadmissibility under section 212(a)(1) of the Act, if such alien is 
accompanied by a member of his/her family, or a guardian who will be 
responsible for him/her during the period of admission authorized.
    (f) Action upon alien's arrival. Upon admitting an alien who has 
been granted the benefits of section 212(d)(3)(A) of the Act, the 
immigration officer shall be guided by the conditions and limitations 
imposed in the authorization and noted by the consular officer in the 
alien's passport. When admitting any alien who has been granted the 
benefits of section 212(d)(3)(B) of the Act, the Immigration officer 
shall note on the arrival-departure record, Form I-94, or crewman's 
landing permit, Form I-95, issued to the alien, the conditions and 
limitations imposed in the authorization.
    (g) Authorizations issued to crewmen without limitation as to period 
of validity.

[[Page 210]]

When a crewman who has a valid section 212(d)(3) authorization without 
any time limitation comes to the attention of the Service, his travel 
document shall be endorsed to show that the validity of his section 
212(d)(3) authorization expires as of a date six months thereafter, and 
any previously-issued Form I-184 shall be lifted and Form I-95 shall be 
issued in its place and similarly endorsed.
    (h) Revocation. The Deputy Commissioner or the district director may 
at any time revoke a waiver previously authorized under section 
212(d)(3) of the Act and shall notify the nonimmigrant in writing to 
that effect.
    (i) Alien witnesses and informants--(1) Waivers under section 
212(d)(1) of the Act. Upon the application of a federal or state law 
enforcement authority (``LEA''), which shall include a state or federal 
court or United States Attorney's Office, pursuant to the filing of Form 
I-854, Inter-Agency Alien Witness and Informant Record, for nonimmigrant 
classification described in section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, the 
Commissioner shall determine whether a ground of exclusion exists with 
respect to the alien for whom classification is sought and, if so, 
whether it is in the national interest to exercise the discretion to 
waive the ground of excludability, other than section 212(a)(3)(E) of 
the Act. The Commissioner may at any time revoke a waiver previously 
authorized under section 212(d)(1) of the Act. In the event the 
Commissioner decides to revoke a previously authorized waiver for an S 
nonimmigrant, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the 
relevant LEA shall be notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant 
Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to the 
decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, 
objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in 
the decision. In the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to 
the Deputy Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances 
shall the alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any 
decision to revoke.
    (2) Grounds of removal. Nothing shall prohibit the Service from 
removing from the United States an alien classified pursuant to section 
101(a)(15)(S) of the Act for conduct committed after the alien has been 
admitted to the United States as an S nonimmigrant, or after the alien's 
change to S classification, or for conduct or a condition undisclosed to 
the Attorney General prior to the alien's admission in, or change to, S 
classification, unless such conduct or condition is waived prior to 
admission and classification. In the event the Commissioner decides to 
remove an S nonimmigrant from the United States, the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA shall be notified in 
writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. Unless the 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he 
or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event 
of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, 
the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General 
for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the 
relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to remove.

Sec. 212.5  Parole of aliens into the United States.

    (a) The parole of aliens within the following groups who have been 
or are detained in accordance with Sec. 235.3(b) or (c) of this chapter 
would generally be justified only on a case-by-case basis for ``urgent 
humanitarian reasons'' or ``significant public benefit,'' provided the 
aliens present neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding:
    (1) Aliens who have serious medical conditions in which continued 
detention would not be appropriate;
    (2) Women who have been medically certified as pregnant;

[[Page 211]]

    (3) Aliens who are defined as juveniles in Sec. 236.3(a) of this 
chapter. The district director or chief patrol agent shall follow the 
guidelines set forth in Sec. 236.3(a) of this chapter and paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section in determining under what 
conditions a juvenile should be paroled from detention:
    (i) Juveniles may be released to a relative (brother, sister, aunt, 
uncle, or grandparent) not in Service detention who is willing to 
sponsor a minor and the minor may be released to that relative 
notwithstanding that the juvenile has a relative who is in detention.
    (ii) If a relative who is not in detention cannot be located to 
sponsor the minor, the minor may be released with an accompanying 
relative who is in detention.
    (iii) If the Service cannot locate a relative in or out of detention 
to sponsor the minor, but the minor has identified a non-relative in 
detention who accompanied him or her on arrival, the question of 
releasing the minor and the accompanying non-relative adult shall be 
addressed on a case-by-case basis;
    (4) Aliens who will be witnesses in proceedings being, or to be, 
conducted by judicial, administrative, or legislative bodies in the 
United States; or
    (5) Aliens whose continued detention is not in the public interest 
as determined by the district director or chief patrol agent.
    (b) In the cases of all other arriving aliens, except those detained 
under Sec. 235.3(b) or (c) of this chapter and paragraph (a) of this 
section, the district director or chief patrol agent may, after review 
of the individual case, parole into the United States temporarily in 
accordance with section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act, any alien applicant for 
admission, under such terms and conditions, including those set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section, as he or she may deem appropriate. An 
alien who arrives at a port-of-entry and applies for parole into the 
United States for the sole purpose of seeking adjustment of status under 
section 245A of the Act, without benefit of advance authorization as 
described in paragraph (e) of this section shall be denied parole and 
detained for removal in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 235.3(b) 
or (c) of this chapter. An alien seeking to enter the United States for 
the sole purpose of applying for adjustment of status under section 210 
of the Act shall be denied parole and detained for removal under 
Sec. 235.3(b) or (c) of this chapter, unless the alien has been 
recommended for approval of such application for adjustment by a 
consular officer at an Overseas Processing Office.
    (c) Conditions. In any case where an alien is paroled under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the district director or chief 
patrol agent may require reasonable assurances that the alien will 
appear at all hearings and/or depart the United States when required to 
do so. Not all factors listed need be present for parole to be 
exercised. The district director or chief patrol agent should apply 
reasonable discretion. The consideration of all relevant factors 
includes:
    (1) The giving of an undertaking by the applicant, counsel, or a 
sponsor to ensure appearances or departure, and a bond may be required 
on Form I-352 in such amount as the district director or chief patrol 
agent may deem appropriate;
    (2) Community ties such as close relatives with known addresses; and
    (3) Agreement to reasonable conditions (such as periodic reporting 
of whereabouts).
    (d) Termination of parole--(1) Automatic. Parole shall be 
automatically terminated without written notice (i) upon the departure 
from the United States of the alien, or, (ii) if not departed, at the 
expiration of the time for which parole was authorized, and in the 
latter case the alien shall be processed in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section except that no written notice shall be required.
    (2)(i) On notice. In cases not covered by paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, upon accomplishment of the purpose for which parole was 
authorized or when in the opinion of the district director or chief 
patrol agent in charge of the area in which the alien is located, 
neither humanitarian reasons nor public benefit warrants the continued 
presence of the alien in the United States, parole shall be terminated 
upon written notice to the alien and he or she shall be restored to the 
status that

[[Page 212]]

he or she had at the time of parole. When a charging document is served 
on the alien, the charging document will constitute written notice of 
termination of parole, unless otherwise specified. Any further 
inspection or hearing shall be conducted under section 235 or 240 of the 
Act and this chapter, or any order of exclusion, deportation, or removal 
previously entered shall be executed. If the exclusion, deportation, or 
removal order cannot be executed by removal within a reasonable time, 
the alien shall again be released on parole unless in the opinion of the 
district director or the chief patrol agent the public interest requires 
that the alien be continued in custody.
    (ii) An alien who is granted parole into the United States after 
enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 for other 
than the specific purpose of applying for adjustment of status under 
section 245A of the Act shall not be permitted to avail him or herself 
of the privilege of adjustment thereunder. Failure to abide by this 
provision through making such an application will subject the alien to 
termination of parole status and institution of proceedings under 
sections 235 and 236 of the Act without the written notice of 
termination required by Sec. 212.5(d)(2)(i) of this chapter.
    (e) Advance authorization. When parole is authorized for an alien 
who will travel to the United States without a visa, the alien shall be 
issued Form I-512.
    (f) Parole for certain Cuban nationals. Notwithstanding any other 
provision respecting parole, the determination whether to release on 
parole, or to revoke the parole of, a native of Cuba who last came to 
the United States between April 15, 1980, and October 20, 1980, shall be 
governed by the terms of Secs. 212.12 and 212.13.
    (g) Effect of parole of Cuban and Haitian nationals. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, any national of Cuba or 
Haiti who was paroled into the United States on or after October 10, 
1980, shall be considered to have been paroled in the special status for 
nationals of Cuba or Haiti, referred to in section 501(e)(1) of the 
Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, Public Law 96-422, as amended 
(8 U.S.C. 1522 note).
    (2) A national of Cuba or Haiti shall not be considered to have been 
paroled in the special status for nationals of Cuba or Haiti, referred 
to in section 501(e)(1) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, 
Public Law 96-422, as amended, if the individual was paroled into the 
United States:
    (i) In the custody of a Federal, State or local law enforcement or 
prosecutorial authority, for purposes of criminal prosecution in the 
United States; or
    (ii) Solely to testify as a witness in proceedings before a 
judicial, administrative, or legislative body in the United States.

Sec. 212.6  Nonresident alien border crossing cards.

    (a) Use--(1) Nonresident alien Canadian border crossing card, Form 
I-185. Any Canadian citizen or British subject residing in Canada may 
use Form I-185 for entry at a United States port of entry.
    (2) Mexican border crossing card, Form I-186 or I-586. The rightful 
holder of a nonresident alien Mexican border crossing card, Form I-186 
or I-586, may be admitted under Sec. 235.1(f) of this chapter if found 
otherwise admissible. However, any alien seeking entry as a visitor for 
business or pleasure must also present a valid passport and shall be 
issued Form I-94 if the alien is applying for admission from:
    (i) A country other than Mexico or Canada, or
    (ii) Canada if the alien has been in a country other than the United 
States or Canada since leaving Mexico.
    (b) Application. A citizen of Canada or a British subject residing 
in Canada must apply on Form I-175 for a nonresident alien border 
crossing card, supporting his/her application with evidence of Canadian 
or British citizenship, residence in Canada, and two photographs, size 
1\1/2\"  x  1\1/2\". Form I-175 must be submitted to an immigration 
officer at a Canadian border port of

[[Page 213]]

entry. A citizen of Mexico must apply on Form I-190 for a nonresident 
alien border crossing card, supporting his application with evidence of 
Mexican citizenship and residence, a valid unexpired passport or a valid 
Mexican Form 13, and one color photograph with a white background. The 
photograph must be glossy, unretouched and not mounted. Dimension of the 
facial image must be approximately one inch from chin to top of hair, 
and the applicant must be shown in \3/4\ frontal view showing right side 
of face with right ear visible. Form I-190 must be submitted to an 
immigration officer at a Mexican border port of entry or to an American 
consular officer in Mexico, other than one assigned to a consulate 
situated adjacent to the border between Mexico and the United States; 
however, Form FS-257 may be used in lieu of Form I-190 when the 
application is made to an American consular officer. If the application 
is submitted to an immigration officer, each applicant, regardless of 
age, must appear in person for an interview concerning eligibility for a 
nonresident alien border crossing card. If the application is submitted 
to a consular officer, each applicant, except a child under fourteen 
years of age, must appear in person for the interview. If the 
application is denied, the applicant shall be given a notice of denial 
with the reasons on Form I-180. There is no appeal from the denial but 
the denial is without prejudice to a subsequent application for a visa 
or for admission to the United States.
    (c) Validity. Notwithstanding any expiration dates which may appear 
thereon, Forms I-185, I-186, and I-586, are valid until revoked or 
voided.
    (d) Voidance--(1) At port of entry. Forms I-185, I-186 and I-586 may 
be declared void by a supervisory immigration officer at a port of 
entry. If the card is declared void, the applicant shall be advised in 
writing that he/she may request a hearing before an immigration judge to 
determine his/her admissibility in accordance with part 236 of this 
chapter and may be represented at this hearing by an attorney of his/her 
own choice at no expense to the Government. He/she shall also be advised 
of the availability of free legal services provided by organizations and 
attorneys qualified under part 3 of this chapter and organizations 
recognized under Sec. 292.2 of this chapter, located in the district 
where the exclusion hearing is to be held. If the applicant requests a 
hearing, Forms I-185, I-186 and I-586 shall be held at the port of entry 
for presentation to the immigration judge. If the applicant chooses not 
to have a hearing, the card shall be voided. The alien to whom the form 
was issued shall be notified of the action taken and the reasons 
therefore by means of form I-180 delivered in person or, if such action 
is not possible, by mailing the Form I-180 to the last known address.
    (2) Within the United States. If the holder of a Form I-185, I-186 
or I-586 is placed under deportation proceedings, no action to void the 
card shall be taken pending the outcome of the hearing. If the alien is 
ordered deported or granted voluntary departure, the card shall be 
voided by an immigration officer. In the case of an alien holder of a 
Form I-185, I-186 or I-586 who is granted voluntary departure without a 
hearing, the card may be declared void by an immigration officer who is 
authorized to issue an Order to Show Cause or to grant voluntary 
departure.
    (3) In Mexico or Canada. Forms I-185, I-186 or I-586 may be declared 
void by a consular officer in Mexico or Canada if the card was issued in 
one of those countries.
    (4) Grounds. Grounds for voidance of a Form I-185, I-186 or I-586 
shall be that the holder has violated the immigration laws; that he/she 
is inadmissible to the United States; or that he/she has abandoned his/
her residence in the country upon which the card was granted.
    (e) Replacement. If a nonresident alien border crossing card has 
been lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the person to show the card 
was issued may apply for a new card as provided for in this section. A 
fee as prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter must be submitted 
at time of application for the replacement card. The holder of a Form I-
185, I-186, or I-586 which is in poor condition because of improper 
production may be issued a new form without submitting fee or 
application upon surrendering the original card.

[[Page 214]]

    (f) Previous removal or deportation; waiver of inadmissibility. 
Pursuant to the authority contained in section 212 (d)(3) of the Act, 
the temporary admission of an alien who is inadmissible under paragraph 
(16) or (17) of section 212(a) of the Act is authorized if such alien is 
in possession of a Mexican Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card and he 
establishes that he is otherwise admissible as a nonimmigrant visitor or 
student except for his removal or deportation prior to November 1, 1956, 
because of entry without inspection or lack of required documents.

Sec. 212.7  Waiver of certain grounds of excludability.

    (a) Section 212(h) or (i)--(1) Filing procedure--(i) Immigrant visa 
or fiance(e) nonimmigrant visa applicant. An applicant for an immigrant 
visa or ``K'' nonimmigrant visa who is excludable and seeks a waiver 
under section 212(h) or (i) of the Act shall file an application on Form 
I-601 at the consular office considering the visa application. Upon 
determining that the alien is admissible except for the grounds for 
which a waiver is sought, the consular officer shall transmit the Form 
I-601 to the Service for decision.
    (ii) Adjustment of status applicant. An applicant for adjustment of 
status who is excludable and seeks a waiver under section 212(h) or (i) 
of the Act shall file an application on Form I-601 with the director or 
immigration judge considering the application for adjustment of status.
    (2) Termination of application for lack of prosecution. An applicant 
may withdraw the application at any time prior to the final decision, 
whereupon the case will be closed and the consulate notified. If the 
applicant fails to prosecute the application within a reasonable time 
either before or after interview the applicant shall be notified that if 
he or she fails to prosecute the application within 30 days the case 
will be closed subject to being reopened at the applicant's request. If 
no action has been taken within the 30-day period immediately 
thereafter, the case will be closed and the appropriate consul notified.
    (3) Decision. If the application is approved the director shall 
complete Form I-607 for inclusion in the alien's file and shall notify 
the alien of the decision. If the application is denied the applicant 
shall be notified of the decision, of the reasons therefor, and of the 
right to appeal in accordance with part 103 of this chapter.
    (4) Validity. A waiver granted under section 212(h) or section 
212(i) of the Act shall apply only to those grounds of excludability and 
to those crimes, events or incidents specified in the application for 
waiver. Once granted, the waiver shall be valid indefinitely, even if 
the recipient of the waiver later abandons or otherwise loses lawful 
permanent resident status, except that any waiver which is granted to an 
alien who obtains lawful permanent residence on a conditional basis 
under section 216 of the Act shall automatically terminate concurrently 
with the termination of such residence pursuant to the provisions of 
section 216. Separate notification of the termination of the waiver is 
not required when an alien is notified of the termination of residence 
under section 216 of the Act, and no appeal shall lie from the decision 
to terminate the waiver on this basis. However, if the respondent is 
found not to be deportable in a deportation proceeding based on the 
termination, the waiver shall again become effective. Nothing in this 
subsection shall preclude the director from reconsidering a decision to 
approve a waiver if the decision is determined to have been made in 
error.
    (b) Section 212(g) (tuberculosis and certain mental conditions)--(1) 
General. Any alien who is ineligible for a visa and is excluded from 
admission into the United States under section 212(a) (1), (3), or (6) 
of the Act may file an Application for Waiver of Grounds of 
Excludability (Form I-601) under section 212(g) of the Act at an office 
designated in paragraph (2). The family member specified in section 
212(g) of the Act may file the waiver for the applicant if

[[Page 215]]

the applicant is incompetent to file the waiver personally.
    (2) Locations for filing Form I-601. Form I-601 may be filed at any 
one of the following offices:
    (i) The American consulate where the application for a visa is being 
considered if the alien is outside the United States;
    (ii) The Service office having jurisdiction over the port of entry 
where the alien is applying for admission into the United States; or
    (iii) The Service office having jurisdiction over the alien if the 
alien is in the United States.
    (3) Section 212(a)(6) (tuberculosis). If the alien is excludable 
under section 212(a)(6) of the Act because of tuberculosis, he shall 
execute Statement A on the reverse of page 1 of Form I-601. In addition, 
he or his sponsor in the United States is responsible for having 
Statement B executed by the physician or health facility which has 
agreed to supply treatment or observation; and, if required, Statement C 
shall be executed by the appropriate local or State health officer.
    (4) Section 212(a) (1) or (3) (certain mental conditions)--(i) 
Arrangements for submission of medical report. If the alien is 
excludable under section 212(a) (1) or (3) (because of mental 
retardation or because of a past history of mental illness) he or his 
sponsoring family member shall submit an executed Form I-601 to the 
consular or Service office with a statement that arrangements have been 
made for the submission to that office of a medical report. The medical 
report shall contain a complete medical history of the alien, including 
details of any hospitalization or institutional care or treatment for 
any physical or mental condition; findings as to the current physical 
condition of the alien, including reports of chest X-ray examination and 
of serologic test for syphilis if the alien is 15 years of age or over, 
and other pertinent diagnostic tests; and findings as to the current 
mental condition of the alien, with information as to prognosis and life 
expectancy and with a report of a psychiatric examination conducted by a 
psychiatrist who shall, in case of mental retardation, also provide an 
evaluation of the alien's intelligence. For an alien with a past history 
of mental illness, the medical report shall also contain available 
information on which the U.S. Public Health Service can base a finding 
as to whether the alien has been free of such mental illness for a 
period of time sufficient in the light of such history to demonstrate 
recovery. Upon receipt of the medical report, the consular or Service 
office shall refer it to the U.S. Public Health Service for review.
    (ii) Submission of statement. Upon being notified that the medical 
report has been reviewed by the U.S. Public Health Service and 
determined to be acceptable, the alien or the alien's sponsoring family 
member shall submit a statement to the consular or Service office. The 
statement must be from a clinic, hospital, institution, specialized 
facility, or specialist in the United States approved by the U.S. Public 
Health Service. The alien or alien's sponsor may be referred to the 
mental retardation or mental health agency of the state of proposed 
residence for guidance in selecting a post-arrival medical examining 
authority who will complete the evaluation and provide an evaluation 
report to the Centers for Disease Control. The statement must specify 
the name and address of the specialized facility, or specialist, and 
must affirm that:
    (A) The specified facility or specialist agrees to evaluate the 
alien's mental status and prepare a complete report of the findings of 
such evaluation.
    (B) The alien, the alien's sponsoring family member, or another 
responsible person has made complete financial arrangements for payment 
of any charges that may be incurred after arrival for studies, care, 
training and service;
    (C) The Director, Division of Quarantine, Center for Prevention 
Services, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. 30333 shall be 
furnished:
    (1) The report evaluating the alien's mental status within 30 days 
after the alien's arrival; and
    (2) Prompt notification of the alien's failure to report to the 
facility or specialist within 30 days after being notified by the U.S. 
Public Health Service that the alien has arrived in the United States.

[[Page 216]]

    (D) The alien shall be in an outpatient, inpatient, study, or other 
specified status as determined by the responsible local physcian or 
specialist during the initial evaluation.
    (5) Assurances: Bonds. In all cases under paragraph (b) of this 
section the alien or his or her sponsoring family member shall also 
submit an assurance that the alien will comply with any special travel 
requirements as may be specified by the U.S. Public Health Service and 
that, upon the admission of the alien into the United States, he or she 
will proceed directly to the facility or specialist specified for the 
initial evaluation, and will submit to such further examinations or 
treatment as may be required, whether in an outpatient, inpatient, or 
other status. The alien, his or her sponsoring family member, or other 
responsible person shall provide such assurances or bond as may be 
required to assure that the necessary expenses of the alien will be met 
and that he or she will not become a public charge. For procedures 
relating to cancellation or breaching of bonds, see part 103 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Section 212(e). (1) An alien who was admitted to the United 
States as an exchange visitor, or who acquired that status after 
admission, is subject to the foreign residence requirement of section 
212(e) of the Act if his or her participation in an exchange program was 
financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a United States 
government agency or by the government of the country of his or her 
nationality or last foreign residence.
    (2) An alien is also subject to the foreign residence requirement of 
section 212(e) of the Act if at the time of admission to the United 
States as an exchange visitor or at the time of acquisition of exchange 
visitor status after admission to the United States, the alien was a 
national or lawful permanent resident of a country which the Director of 
the United States Information Agency had designated, through public 
notice in the Federal Register, as clearly requiring the services of 
persons engaged in the field of specialized knowledge or skill in which 
the alien was to engage in his or her exchange visitor program.
    (3) An alien is also subject to the foreign residence requirement of 
section 212(e) of the Act if he or she was admitted to the United States 
as an exchange visitor on or after January 10, 1977 to receive graduate 
medical education or training, or following admission, acquired such 
status on or after that date for that purpose. However, an exchange 
visitor already participating in an exchange program of graduate medical 
education or training as of January 9, 1977 who was not then subject to 
the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) and who proceeds or 
has proceeded abroad temporarily and is returning to the United States 
to participate in the same program, continues to be exempt from the 
foreign residence requirement.
    (4) A spouse or child admitted to the United States or accorded 
status under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act to accompany or follow to 
join an exchange visitor who is subject to the foreign residence 
requirement of section 212(e) of the Act is also subject to that 
requirement.
    (5) An alien who is subject to the foreign residence requirement and 
who believes that compliance therewith would impose exceptional hardship 
upon his/her spouse or child who is a citizen of the United States or a 
lawful permanent resident alien, or that he or she cannot return to the 
country of his or her nationality or last residence because he or she 
will be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or 
political opinion, may apply for a waiver on Form I-612. The alien's 
spouse and minor children, if also subject to the foreign residence 
requirement, may be included in the application, provided the spouse has 
not been a participant in an exchange program.
    (6) Each application based upon a claim to exceptional hardship must 
be accompanied by the certificate of marriage between the applicant and 
his or her spouse and proof of legal termination of all previous 
marriages of the applicant and spouse; the birth certificate of any 
child who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident alien, 
if the application is based upon a claim of exceptional hardship to a 
child, and evidence of the

[[Page 217]]

United States citizenship of the applicant's spouse or child, when the 
application is based upon a claim of exceptional hardship to a spouse or 
child who is a citizen of the United States.
    (7) Evidence of United States citizenship and of status as a lawful 
permanent resident shall be in the form provided in part 204 of this 
chapter. An application based upon exceptional hardship shall be 
supported by a statement, dated and signed by the applicant, giving a 
detailed explanation of the basis for his or her belief that his or her 
compliance with the foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) of 
the Act, as amended, would impose exceptional hardship upon his or her 
spouse or child who is a citizen of the United States or a lawful 
permanent resident thereof. The statement shall include all pertinent 
information concerning the incomes and savings of the applicant and 
spouse. If exceptional hardship is claimed upon medical grounds, the 
applicant shall submit a medical certificate from a qualified physician 
setting forth in terms understandable to a layman the nature and effect 
of the illness and prognosis as to the period of time the spouse or 
child will require care or treatment.
    (8) An application based upon the applicant's belief that he or she 
cannot return to the country of his or her nationality or last residence 
because the applicant would be subject to persecution on account of 
race, religion, or political opinion, must be supported by a statement, 
dated and signed by the applicant, setting forth in detail why the 
applicant believes he or she would be subject to persecution.
    (9) Waivers under Pub. L. 103-416 based on a request by a State 
Department of Public Health (or equivalent). In accordance with section 
220 of Pub. L. 103-416, an alien admitted to the United States as a 
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, or who acquired 
status under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act after admission to the 
United States, to participate in an exchange program of graduate medical 
education or training (as of January 9, 1977), may apply for a waiver of 
the 2-year home country residence and physical presence requirement (the 
``2-year requirement'') under section 212(e)(iii) of the Act based on a 
request by a State Department of Pubic Health, or its equivalent. To 
initiate the application for a waiver under Pub. L. 103-416, the 
Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, or the State in which 
the foreign medical graduate seeks to practice medicine, must request 
the Director of USIA to recommend a waiver to the Service. The waiver 
may be granted only if the Director of USIA provides the Service with a 
favorable waiver recommendation. Only the Service, however, may grant or 
deny the waiver application. If granted, such a waiver shall be subject 
to the terms and conditions imposed under section 214(l) of the Act (as 
redesignated by section 671(a)(3)(A) of Pub. L. 104-208). Although the 
alien is not required to submit a separate waiver application to the 
Service, the burden rests on the alien to establish eligibility for the 
waiver. If the Service approves a waiver request made under Pub. L. 103-
416, the foreign medical graduate (and accompanying dependents) may 
apply for change of nonimmigrant status, from J-1 to H-1B and, in the 
case of dependents of such a foreign medical graduate, from J-2 to H-4. 
Aliens receiving waivers under section 220 of Pub. L. 103-416 are 
subject, in all cases, to the provisions of section 214(g)(1)(A) of the 
Act.
    (i) Eligiblity criteria. J-1 foreign medical graduates (with 
accompanying J-2 dependents) are eligible to apply for a waiver of the 
2-year requirement under Pub. L. 103-416 based on a request by a State 
Department of Public Health (or its equivalent) if:
    (A) They were admitted to the United States under section 
101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, or acquired J nonimmigrant status before June 
1, 2002, to pursue graduate medical education or training in the United 
States.
    (B) They have entered into a bona fide, full-time employment 
contract for 3 years to practice medicine at a health care facility 
located in an area or areas designated by the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals (``HHS-
designated shortage area'');
    (C) They agree to commence employment within 90 days of receipt of 
the waiver under this section and agree to

[[Page 218]]

practice medicine for 3 years at the facility named in the waiver 
application and only in HHS-designated shortage areas. The health care 
facility named in the waiver application may be operated by:
    (1) An agency of the Government of the United States or of the State 
in which it is located; or
    (2) A charitable, educational, or other not-for-profit organization; 
or
    (3) Private medical practitioners.
    (D) The Department of Public Health, or its equivalent, in the State 
where the health care facility is located has requested the Director, 
USIA, to recommend the waiver, and the Director, USIA, submits a 
favorable waiver recommendation to the Service; and
    (E) Approval of the waiver will not cause the number of waivers 
granted pursuant to Pub. L. 103-416 and this section to foreign medical 
graduates who will practice medicine in the same state to exceed 20 
during the current fiscal year.
    (ii) Decision on waivers under Pub. L. 103-416 and notification to 
the alien--(A) Approval. If the Director of USIA submits a favorable 
waiver recommendation on behalf of a foreign medical graduate pursuant 
to Pub. L. 103-416, and the Service grants the waiver, the alien shall 
be notified of the approval on Form I-797 (or I-797A or I-797B, as 
appropriate). The approval notice shall clearly state the terms and 
conditions imposed on the waiver, and the Service's records shall be 
noted accordingly.
    (B) Denial. If the Director of USIA issues a favorable waiver 
recommendation under Pub. L. 103-416 and the Service denies the waiver, 
the alien shall be notified of the decision and of the right to appeal 
under 8 CFR part 103. However, no appeal shall lie where the basis for 
denial is that the number of waivers granted to the State in which the 
foreign medical graduate will be employed would exceed 20 for that 
fiscal year.
    (iii) Conditions. The foreign medical graduate must agree to 
commence employment for the health care facility specified in the waiver 
application within 90 days of receipt of the waiver under Pub. L. 103-
416. The foreign medical graduate may only fulfill the requisite 3-year 
employment contract as an H-1B nonimmigrant. A foreign medical graduate 
who receives a waiver under Pub. L. 103-416 based on a request by a 
State Department of Public Health (or equivalent), and changes his or 
her nonimmigrant classification from J-1 to H-1B, may not apply for 
permanent residence or for any other change of nonimmigrant 
classification unless he or she has fulfilled the 3-year employment 
contract with the health care facility and in the specified HHS-
designated shortage area named in the waiver application.
    (iv) Failure to fulfill the three-year employment contract due to 
extenuating circumstances. A foreign medical graduate who fails to meet 
the terms and conditions imposed on the waiver under section 214(l) of 
the Act and this paragraph will once again become subject to the 2-year 
requirement under section 212(e) of the Act.
    Under section 214(l)(1)(B) of the Act, however, the Service, in the 
exercise of discretion, may excuse early termination of the foreign 
medical graduate's 3-year period of employment with the health care 
facility named in the waiver application due to extenuating 
circumstances. Extenuating circumstances may include, but are not 
limited to, closure of the health care facility or hardship to the 
alien. In determining whether to excuse such early termination of 
employment, the Service shall base its decision on the specific facts of 
each case. In all cases, the burden of establishing eligibility for a 
favorable exercise of discretion rests with the foreign medical 
graduate. Depending on the circumstances, closure of the health care 
facility named in the waiver application may, but need not, be 
considered an extenuating circumstance excusing early termination of 
employment. Under no circumstances will a foreign medical graduate be 
eligible to apply for change of status to another nonimmigrant category, 
for an immigrant visa or for status as a lawful permanent resident prior 
to completing the requisite 3-year period of employment for a health 
care facility located in an HHS-designated shortage area.
    (v) Required evidence. A foreign medical graduate who seeks to have 
early

[[Page 219]]

termination of employment excused due to extenuating circumstances shall 
submit documentary evidence establishing such a claim. In all cases, the 
foreign medical graduate shall submit an employment contract with 
another health care facility located in an HHS-designated shortage area 
for the balance of the required 3-year period of employment. A foreign 
medical graduate claiming extenuating circumstances based on hardship 
shall also submit evidence establishing that such hardship was caused by 
unforeseen circumstances beyond his or her control. A foreign medical 
graduate claiming extenuating circumstances based on closure of the 
health care facility named in the waiver application shall also submit 
evidence that the facility has closed or is about to be closed.
    (vi) Notification requirements. A J-1 foreign medical graduate who 
has been granted a waiver of the 2-year requirement pursuant to Pub. L. 
103-416, is required to comply with the terms and conditions specified 
in section 214(l) of the Act and the implementing regulations in this 
section. If the foreign medical graduate subsequently applies for and 
receives H-1B status, he or she must also comply with the terms and 
conditions of that nonimmigrant status. Such compliance shall also 
include notifying the Service of any material change in the terms and 
conditions of the H-1B employment, by filing either an amended or a new 
H-1B petition, as required, under Secs. 214.2(h)(2)(i)(D), 
214.2(h)(2)(i)(E), and 214.2(h)(11) of this chapter.
    (A) Amended H-1B petitions. The health care facility named in the 
waiver application and H-1B petition shall file an amended H-1B 
petition, as required under Sec. 214.2(h)(2)(i)(E) of this chapter, if 
there are any material changes in the terms and conditions of the 
beneficiary's employment or eligibility as specified in the waiver 
application filed under Pub. L. 103-416 and in the subsequent H-1B 
petition. In such a case, an amended H-1B petition shall be accompanied 
by evidence that the alien will continue practicing medicine with the 
original employer in an HHS-designated shortage area.
    (B) New H-1B petitions. A health care facility seeking to employ a 
foreign medical graduate who has been granted a waiver under Pub. L. 
103-416 (prior to the time the alien has completed his or her 3-year 
contract with the facility named in the waiver application and original 
H-1B petition), shall file a new H-1B petition with the Service, as 
required under Secs. 214.2(h)(2)(i) (D) and (E) of this chapter. 
Although a new waiver application need not be filed, the new H-1B 
petition shall be accompanied by the documentary evidence generally 
required under Sec. 214.2(h) of this chapter, and the following 
additional documents:
    (1) A copy of Form I-797 (and/or I-797A and I-797B) relating to the 
waiver and nonimmigrant H status granted under Pub. L. 103-416;
    (2) An explanation from the foreign medical graduate, with 
supporting evidence, establishing that extenuating circumstances 
necessitate a change in employment;
    (3) An employment contract establishing that the foreign medical 
graduate will practice medicine at the health care facility named in the 
new H-1B petition for the balance of the required 3-year period; and
    (4) Evidence that the geographic area or areas of intended 
employment indicated in the new H-1B petition are in HHS-designated 
shortage areas.
    (C) Review of amended and new H-1B petitions for foreign medical 
graduates granted waivers under Pub. L. 103-416 and who seek to have 
early termination of employment excused due to extenuating 
circumstances--(1) Amended H-1B petitions. The waiver granted under Pub. 
L. 103-416 may be affirmed, and the amended H-1B petition may be 
approved, if the petitioning health care facility establishes that the 
foreign medical graduate otherwise remains eligible for H-1B 
classification and that he or she will continue practicing medicine in 
an HHS-designated shortage area.
    (2) New H-1B petitions. The Service shall review a new H-1B petition 
filed on behalf of a foreign medical graduate who has not yet fulfilled 
the required 3-year period of employment with the health care facility 
named in the waiver application and in the original H-1B

[[Page 220]]

petition to determine whether extenuating circumstances exist which 
warrant a change in employment, and whether the waiver granted under 
Pub. L. 103-416 should be affirmed. In conducting such a review, the 
Service shall determine whether the foreign medical graduate will 
continue practicing medicine in an HHS-designated shortage area, and 
whether the new H-1B petitioner and the foreign medical graduate have 
satisfied the remaining H-1B eligibility criteria described under 
section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act and Sec. 214.2(h) of this chapter. If 
these criteria have been satisfied, the waiver granted to the foreign 
medical graduate under Pub. L. 103-416 may be affirmed, and the new H1-B 
petition may be approved in the exercise of discretion, thereby 
permitting the foreign medical graduate to serve the balance of the 
requisite 3-year employment period at the health care facility named in 
the new H-1B petition.
    (D) Failure to notify the Service of any material changes in 
employment. Foreign medical graduates who have been granted a waiver of 
the 2-year requirement and who have obtained H-1B status under Pub. L. 
103-416 but fail to: Properly notify the Service of any material change 
in the terms and conditions of their H-1B employment, by having their 
employer file an amended or a new H-1B petition in accordance with this 
section and Sec. 214.2(h) of this chapter; or establish continued 
eligibility for the waiver and H-1B status, shall (together with their 
dependents) again become subject to the 2-year requirement. Such foreign 
medical graduates and their accompanying H-4 dependents also become 
subject to deportation under section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
    (10) The applicant and his or her spouse may be interviewed by an 
immigration officer in connection with the application and consultation 
may be had with the Director, United States Information Agency and the 
sponsor of any exchange program in which the applicant has been a 
participant.
    (11) The applicant shall be notified of the decision, and if the 
application is denied, of the reasons therefor and of the right of 
appeal in accordance with the provisions of part 103 of this chapter. 
However, no appeal shall lie from the denial of an application for lack 
of a favorable recommendation from the Secretary of State. When an 
interested United States Government agency requests a waiver of the two-
year foreign-residence requirement and the Director, United States 
Information Agency had made a favorable recommendation, the interested 
agency shall be notified of the decision on its request and, if the 
request is denied, of the reasons thereof, and of the right of appeal. 
If the foreign country of the alien's nationality or last residence has 
furnished statement in writing that it has no objection to his/her being 
granted a waiver of the foreign residence requirement and the Director, 
United States Information Agency has made a favorable recommendation, 
the Director shall be notified of the decision and, if the foreign 
residence requirement is not waived, of the reasons therefor and of the 
foregoing right of appeal. However, this ``no objection'' provision is 
not applicable to the exchange visitor admitted to the United States on 
or after January 10, 1977 to receive graduate medical education or 
training, or who acquired such status on or after that date for such 
purpose; except that the alien who commenced a program before January 
10, 1977 and who was readmitted to the United States on or after that 
date to continue participation in the same program, is eligible for the 
``no objection'' waiver.

Sec. 212.8  Certification requirement of section 212(a)(14).

    (a) General. The certification requirement of section 212(a)(14) of 
the Act applies to aliens seeking admission to the United States or 
adjustment of status

[[Page 221]]

under section 245 of the Act for the purpose of performing skilled or 
unskilled labor, who are preference immigrants as described in section 
203(a) (3) or (6) of the Act, or who are nonpreference immigrants as 
described in section 203(a)(8). The certification requirement shall not 
be applicable to a nonpreference applicant for admission to the United 
States or to a nonpreference applicant for adjustment of status under 
section 245 who establishes that he will not perform skilled or 
unskilled labor. A native of the Western Hemisphere who established a 
priority date with a consular officer prior to January 1, 1977 and who 
was found to be entitled to an exemption from the labor certification 
requirement of section 212(a)(14) of the Act under the law in effect 
prior to January 1, 1977 as the parent, spouse or child of a United 
States citizen or lawful permanent resident alien shall continue to be 
exempt from that requirement for so long as the relationship upon which 
the exemption is based continues to exist.
    (b) Aliens not required to obtain labor certifications. The 
following persons are not considered to be within the purview of section 
212(a)(14) of the Act and do not require a labor certification: (1) A 
member of the Armed Forces of the United States; (2) a spouse or child 
accompanying or following to join his spouse or parent who either has a 
labor certification or is a nondependent alien who does not require such 
a certification; (3) a female alien who intends to marry a citizen or 
alien lawful permanent resident of the United States, who establishes 
satisfactorily that she does not intend to seek employment in the United 
States and whose fiance has guaranteed her support; (4) an alien who 
establishes on Form I-526 that he has invested, or is actively in the 
process of investing, capital totaling at least $40,000 in an enterprise 
in the United States of which he will be a principal manager and that 
the enterprise will employ a person or persons in the United States of 
which he will be a principal manager and that the enterprise will employ 
a person or persons in the United States who are United States citizens 
or aliens lawfully admitted for permnanent residence, exclusive of the 
alien, his spouse and children. A copy of a document submitted in 
support of Form I-526 may be accepted though unaccompanied by the 
original, if the copy bears a certification by an attorney, typed or 
rubber-stamped in the language set forth in Sec. 204.2(j) of this 
chapter. However, the original document shall be submitted, if submittal 
is requested by the Service.

Sec. 212.9  Applicability of section 212(a)(32) to certain derivative third and sixth preference and nonpreference immigrants.

    A derivative beneficiary who is the spouse or child of a qualified 
third or sixth preference or nonpreference immigrant and who is also a 
graduate of a medical school as defined by section 101(a)(41) of the Act 
is not considered to be an alien who is coming to the United States 
principally to perform services as a member of the medical profession.

Sec. 212.12  Parole determinations and revocations respecting Mariel Cubans.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to any native of Cuba who last came 
to the United States between April 15, 1980, and October 20, 1980 
(hereinafter referred to as Mariel Cuban) and who is being detained by 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service (hereinafter referred to as 
the Service) pending his or her exclusion hearing, or pending his or her 
return to Cuba or to another country. It covers Mariel Cubans who have 
never been paroled as well as those Mariel Cubans whose previous parole 
has been revoked by the Service. It also applies to any Mariel Cuban, 
detained under the authority of the Immigration and Nationality Act in 
any facility, who has not been approved for release or who is currently 
awaiting movement to a Service or Bureau Of Prisons (BOP) facility. In 
addition, it covers the revocation of parole for those Mariel Cubans who 
have been released on parole at any time.
    (b) Parole authority and decision. Except as provided in 
Sec. 212.13, the authority to grant parole under section 212(d)(5) of 
the Act to a detained Mariel Cuban shall be exercised by the 
Commissioner, acting through the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement, 
as follows:
    (1) Parole decisions. The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement 
may, in the exercise of discretion, grant parole to a detained Mariel 
Cuban for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public 
interest. A decision to retain in custody shall briefly set forth the 
reasons for the continued detention. A decision to release on parole may 
contain such special conditions as are considered appropriate. A copy of 
any decision to parole or to detain, with an attached copy translated 
into Spanish, shall be provided to the detainee. Parole documentation 
for Mariel Cubans shall be issued by the district director having 
jurisdiction over the alien, in accordance with the parole determination 
made by the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement.
    (2) Additional delegation of authority. All references to the 
Commissioner and Associate Commissioner for Enforcement in this section 
shall be deemed to include any person or persons (including a committee) 
designated in writing by the Commissioner or Associate Commissioner for 
Enforcement to exercise powers under this section.
    (c) Review Plan Director. The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement 
shall appoint a Director of the Cuban Review Plan. The Director shall 
have authority to establish and maintain appropriate files respecting 
each Mariel Cuban to be reviewed for possible parole, to determine the 
order in which the cases shall be reviewed, and to coordinate activities 
associated with these reviews.
    (d) Recommendations to the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement. 
Parole recommendations for detained Mariel Cubans shall be developed in 
accordance with the following procedures.
    (1) Review Panels. The Director shall designate a panel or panels to 
make parole recommendations to the Associate Commissioner for 
Enforcement. A Cuban Review Panel shall, except as otherwise provided, 
consist of two persons. Members of a Review Panel shall be selected from 
the professional staff

[[Page 223]]

of the Service. All recommendations by a two-member Panel shall be 
unanimous. If the vote of a two-member Panel is split, it shall adjourn 
its deliberations concerning that particular detainee until a third 
Panel member is added. A recommendation by a three-member Panel shall be 
by majority vote. The third member of any Panel shall be the Director of 
the Cuban Review Plan or his designee.
    (2) Criteria for Review. Before making any recommendation that a 
detainee be granted parole, a majority of the Cuban Review Panel 
members, or the Director in case of a record review, must conclude that:
    (i) The detainee is presently a nonviolent person;
    (ii) The detainee is likely to remain nonviolent;
    (iii) The detainee is not likely to pose a threat to the community 
following his release; and
    (iv) The detainee is not likely to violate the conditions of his 
parole.
    (3) Factors for consideration. The following factors should be 
weighed in considering whether to recommend further detention or release 
on parole of a detainee:
    (i) The nature and number of disciplinary infractions or incident 
reports received while in custody;
    (ii) The detainee's past history of criminal behavior;
    (iii) Any psychiatric and psychological reports pertaining to the 
detainee's mental health;
    (iv) Institutional progress relating to participation in work, 
educational and vocational programs;
    (v) His ties to the United States, such as the number of close 
relatives residing lawfully here;
    (vi) The likelihood that he may abscond, such as from any 
sponsorship program; and
    (vii) Any other information which is probative of whether the 
detainee is likely to adjust to life in a community, is likely to engage 
in future acts of violence, is likely to engage in future criminal 
activity, or is likely to violate the conditions of his parole.
    (4) Procedure for review. The following procedures will govern the 
review process:
    (i) Record review. Initially, the Director or a Panel shall review 
the detainee's file. Upon completion of this record review, the Director 
or the Panel shall issue a written recommendation that the detainee be 
released on parole or scheduled for a personal interview.
    (ii) Personal interview. If a recommendation to grant parole after 
only a record review is not accepted or if the detainee is not 
recommended for release, a Panel shall personally interview the 
detainee. The scheduling of such interviews shall be at the discretion 
of the Director. The detainee may be accompanied during the interview by 
a person of his choice, who is able to attend at the time of the 
scheduled interview, to assist in answering any questions. The detainee 
may submit to the Panel any information, either orally or in writing, 
which he believes presents a basis for release on parole.
    (iii) Panel recommendation. Following completion of the interview 
and its deliberations, the Panel shall issue a written recommendation 
that the detainee be released on parole or remain in custody pending 
deportation or pending further observation and subsequent review. This 
written recommendation shall include a brief statement of the factors 
which the Panel deems material to its recommendation. The recommendation 
and appropriate file material shall be forwarded to the Associate 
Commissioner for Enforcement, to be considered in the exercise of 
discretion pursuant to Sec. 212.12(b).
    (e) Withdrawal of parole approval. The Associate Commissioner for 
Enforcement may, in his or her discretion, withdraw approval for parole 
of any detainee prior to release when, in his or her opinion, the 
conduct of the detainee, or any other circumstance, indicates that 
parole would no longer be appropriate.
    (f) Sponsorship. No detainee may be released on parole until 
suitable sponsorship or placement has been found for the detainee. The 
paroled detainee must abide by the parole conditions specified by the 
Service in relation to his sponsorship or placement. The following 
sponsorships and placements are suitable:

[[Page 224]]

    (1) Placement by the Public Health Service in an approved halfway 
house or mental health project;
    (2) Placement by the Community Relations Service in an approved 
halfway house or community project; and
    (3) Placement with a close relative such as a parent, spouse, child, 
or sibling who is a lawful permanent resident or a citizen of the United 
States.
    (g) Timing of reviews. The timing of review shall be in accordance 
with the following guidelines.
    (1) Parole revocation cases. The Director shall schedule the review 
process in the case of a new or returning detainee whose previous 
immigration parole has been revoked. The review process will commence 
with a scheduling of a file review, which will ordinarily be expected to 
occur within approximately three months after parole is revoked. In the 
case of a Mariel Cuban who is in the custody of the Service, the Cuban 
Review Plan Director may, in his or her discretion, suspend or postpone 
the parole review process if such detainee's prompt deportation is 
practicable and proper.
    (2) Continued detention cases. A subsequent review shall be 
commenced for any detainee within one year of a refusal to grant parole 
under either Sec. 212.12(b) or Sec. 212.13, whichever is later, unless a 
shorter interval is specified by the Director.
    (3) Discretionary reviews. The Cuban Review Plan Director, in his 
discretion, may schedule a review of a detainee at any time when the 
Director deems such a review to be warranted.
    (h) Revocation of parole. The Associate Commissioner for Enforcement 
shall have authority, in the exercise of discretion, to revoke parole in 
respect to Mariel Cubans. A district director may also revoke parole 
when, in the district director's opinion, revocation is in the public 
interest and circumstances do not reasonably permit referral of the case 
to the Associate Commissioner. Parole may be revoked in the exercise of 
discretion when, in the opinion of the revoking official:
    (1) The purposes of parole have been served;
    (2) The Mariel Cuban violates any condition of parole;
    (3) It is appropriate to enforce an order of exclusion or to 
commence proceedings against a Mariel Cuban; or
    (4) The period of parole has expired without being renewed.

Sec. 212.13  Departmental parole determinations respecting certain Mariel Cubans.

    (a) Scope. This section, establishing a Departmental Release Review 
Program, applies to all excludable Mariel Cubans who on the effective 
date of this regulation are detained by virtue of the Attorney General's 
authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act and whose parole has 
been denied after the exhaustion of the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 212.12. This Departmental Release Review Program shall be under the 
general supervision of the Associate Attorney General, who shall 
administer the Program and establish such additional procedures as may 
be required.
    (b) Single review. Each detainee described in paragraph (a) above 
shall be entitled to only one review before a Departmental Panel. Should 
a detainee denied parole under this section subsequently receive further 
review pursuant to Sec. 212.12 or any successor parole review plan of 
the Service, such detainee shall not be entitled to a second review 
before a Departmental Panel.
    (c) Departmental panels. The Associate Attorney General shall 
establish panels which will be comprised of three persons from within 
the Department of Justice, one of whom must be an attorney, and one of 
whom must be a representative of the Community Relations Service. The 
Immigration and Naturalization Service shall not be represented on the 
panels. These panels shall consider the cases of those Mariel Cubans 
whose parole has previously been denied pursuant to the provisions set 
forth in Sec. 212.12.
    (d) Parole authority. Each Departmental Panel shall be vested with 
the full discretion of the Attorney General under section 212(d)(5) of 
the Act to grant parole for emergent reasons or for reasons deemed 
strictly in the public interest.

[[Page 225]]

    (e) Notification and submission. Prior to the submission by the 
Service of a case to a Departmental Panel, the detainee shall receive 
notification from the Service that he is about to receive Departmental 
Panel consideration. Such notification shall inform the detainee that he 
may submit a written statement to a Departmental Panel, within 30 days 
from the date of service of the notification, setting forth any factors 
he deems relevant to the parole consideration and he may, at no expense 
to the government, have his representative or counsel assist in the 
preparation of this written statement.
    (f) Interviews. A Departmental Panel may designate one of its 
members to interview the detainee and report in writing to the full 
Panel whenever in its sole discretion it deems such action appropriate.
    (g) Panel decisions. The written decision of a Departmental Panel 
will be based on a review of the record created during the review by the 
Service pursuant to Sec. 212.12, the written submission, if any, from 
the detainee, and the information obtained from any Panel interview of 
the detainee. Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, all 
written decisions of a Departmental Panel will be final and subject to 
no further review.
    (h) Sponsorship. No detainee may be released on parole until 
suitable sponsorship or placement has been found for the detainee. The 
paroled detainee must abide by the parole conditions specified by the 
Service in relation to his sponsorship or placement. The following 
sponsorships and placements are suitable:
    (1) Placement by the Public Health Service in an approved halfway 
house or mental health project;
    (2) Placement by the Community Relations Service in an approved 
halfway house or community project; and
    (3) Placement with a close relative such as a parent, spouse, child, 
or sibling who is a lawful permanent resident or a citizen of the United 
States.
    (i) Withdrawal of parole approval. A Departmental Panel may, in its 
discretion, withdraw its approval for parole of any detainee prior to 
release when, in its opinion, the conduct of the detainee, or any other 
circumstance, indicates that parole would no longer be appropriate.
    (j) Parole revocations. Parole granted under this section may be 
revoked pursuant to Sec. 212.12.

Sec. 212.14  Parole determinations for alien witnesses and informants for whom a law enforcement authority (``LEA'') will request S classification.

    (a) Parole authority. Parole authorization under section 212(d)(5) 
of the Act for aliens whom LEAs seek to bring to the United States as 
witnesses or informants in criminal/counter terrorism matters and to 
apply for S classification shall be exercised as follows:
    (1) Grounds of eligibility. The Commissioner may, in the exercise of 
discretion, grant parole to an alien (and the alien's family members) 
needed for law enforcement purposes provided that a state or federal 
LEA:
    (i) Establishes its intention to file, within 30 days after the 
alien's arrival in the United States, a completed Form I-854, Inter-
Agency Alien Witness and Informant Record, with the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice, in accordance with 
the instructions on or attached to the form, which will include the 
names of qualified family members for whom parole is sought;
    (ii) Specifies the particular operational reasons and basis for the 
request, and agrees to assume responsibility for the alien during the 
period of the alien's temporary stay in the United States, including 
maintaining control and supervision of the alien and the alien's 
whereabouts and activities, and further specifies any other terms and 
conditions specified by the Service during the period for which the 
parole is authorized;
    (iii) Agrees to advise the Service of the alien's failure to report 
quarterly any criminal conduct by the alien, or any other activity or 
behavior on the alien's part that may constitute a ground of 
excludability or deportability;
    (iv) Assumes responsibility for ensuring the alien's departure on 
the date of termination of the authorized parole (unless the alien has 
been admitted in

[[Page 226]]

S nonimmigrant classification pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section), provides any and all assistance needed by the Service, 
if necessary, to ensure departure, and verifies departure in a manner 
acceptable to the Service;
    (v) Provide LEA seat-of-government certification that parole of the 
alien is essential to an investigation or prosecution, is in the 
national interest, and is requested pursuant to the terms and authority 
of section 212(d)(5) of the Act;
    (vi) Agrees that no promises may be, have been, or will be made by 
the LEA to the alien that the alien will or may:
    (A) Remain in the United States in parole status or any other 
nonimmigrant classification;
    (B) Adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident; or
    (C) Otherwise attempt to remain beyond the authorized parole. The 
alien (and any family member of the alien who is 18 years of age or 
older) shall sign a statement acknowledging an awareness that parole 
only authorizes a temporary stay in the United States and does not 
convey the benefits of S nonimmigrant classification, any other 
nonimmigrant classification, or any entitlement to further benefits 
under the Act; and
    (vii) Provides, in the case of a request for the release of an alien 
from Service custody, certification that the alien is eligible for 
parole pursuant to Sec. 235.3 of this chapter.
    (2) Authorization. (i) Upon approval of the request for parole, the 
Commissioner shall notify the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, of the approval.
    (ii) Upon notification of approval of a request for parole, the LEA 
will advise the Commissioner of the date, time, and place of the arrival 
of the alien. The Commissioner will coordinate the arrival of the alien 
in parole status with the port director prior to the time of arrival.
    (iii) Parole will be authorized for a period of thirty (30) days to 
commence upon the alien's arrival in the United States in order for the 
LEA to submit a completed Form I-854 to the Assistant Attorney General, 
Criminal Division. Upon the submission to the Assistant Attorney General 
of the Form I-854 requesting S classification, the period of parole will 
be automatically extended while the request is being reviewed. The 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, will notify the 
Commissioner of the submission of a Form I-854.
    (b) Termination of parole--(1) General. The Commissioner may 
terminate parole for any alien (including a member of the alien's 
family) in parole status under this section where termination is in the 
public interest. A district director may also terminate parole when, in 
the district director's opinion, termination is in the public interest 
and circumstances do not reasonably permit referral of the case to the 
Commissioner. In such a case, the Commissioner shall be notified 
immediately. In the event the Commissioner, or in the appropriate case, 
a district director, decides to terminate the parole of a alien witness 
or informant authorized under the terms of this paragraph, the Assistant 
Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA shall be 
notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, 
Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. Unless 
the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 
days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In 
the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy 
Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the 
alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to 
terminate parole.
    (2) Termination of parole and admission in S classification. When an 
LEA has filed a request for an alien in authorized parole status to be 
admitted in S nonimmigrant classification and that request has been 
approved by the Commissioner pursuant to the procedures outlines in 8 
CFR 214.2(t), the Commissioner may, in the exercise of discretion:
    (i) Terminate the alien's parole status;
    (ii) Determine eligibility for waivers; and
    (iii) Admit the alien in S nonimmigrant classification pursuant to

[[Page 227]]

the terms and conditions of section 101(a)(15(S) of the Act and 8 CFR 
214.2(t).
    (c) Departure. If the alien's parole has been terminated and the 
alien has been ordered excluded from the United States, the LEA shall 
ensure departure from the United States and so inform the district 
director in whose jurisdiction the alien has last resided. The district 
director, if necessary, shall oversee the alien's departure from the 
United States and, in any event, shall notify the Commissioner of the 
alien's departure. The Commissioner shall be notified in writing of the 
failure of any alien authorized parole under this paragraph to depart in 
accordance with an order of exclusion and deportation entered after 
parole authorized under this paragraph has been terminated.
    (d) Failure to comply with procedures. Any failure to adhere to the 
parole procedures contained in this section shall immediately be brought 
to the attention of the Commissioner, who will notify the Attorney 
General.

researchers, managers of health care facilities, and medical consultants 
to the insurance industry;
    (2) The spouse and dependent children of any immigrant alien who is 
seeking to immigrate in order to accompany or follow to join the 
principal alien; and
    (3) Any alien applying for adjustment of status to that of a 
permanent resident under any provision of law other than an alien who is 
seeking to immigrate on the basis of an employment-based immigrant visa 
petition which was filed for the purpose of obtaining the alien's 
services in a health care occupation described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Occupations affected by this provision. With the exception of 
the aliens described in paragraph (b) of this section, any alien seeking

her education or training, is subject to this provision:
    (1) Licensed practical nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and 
registered nurses.
    (2) Occupational therapists.
    (d) Presentation of the certificate. An alien described in paragraph 
(a) of this section who is applying for admission as an immigrant 
seeking to perform labor in a health care occupation as described in 
this section must present a certificate to a consular officer at the 
time of visa issuance and to the Service at the time of admission or 
adjustment of status. The certificate must be valid at the time of visa 
issuance and admission at a port-of-entry, or, if applicable, at the

experience are comparable with that required for an American health care 
worker of the same type;
    (7) Verification that the alien's education, training, license, and 
experience are authentic and, in the case of a license, unencumbered;
    (8) Verification that the alien's education, training, license, and 
experience meet all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for 
admission into the United States as an immigrant under section 203(b) of 
the Act. This verification is not binding on the Service; and
    (9) Verification either that the alien has passed a test predicting 
success on the occupation's licensing or certification examination, 
provided such a test is recognized by a majority of States licensing the 
occupation for which the certificate is issued, or that the alien has 
passed the occupation's licensing or certification examination.
    (g) English testing requirement. (1) With the exception of those 
aliens described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, every alien must 
meet certain English language requirements in order to obtain a 
certificate. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has determined 
that an alien must have a passing score on one of the two tests listed 
in paragraph (g)(3) of this section before he or she can be granted a 
certificate.
    (2) Aliens exempt from the English language requirement. Aliens who

Sec. 213a.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part, the term:
    Domicile means the place where a sponsor has a residence, as defined 
in section 101(a)(33) of the Act, in the United States, with the 
intention to maintain that residence for the foreseeable future, 
provided, that a permanent resident who is living abroad temporarily 
shall be considered to be domiciled in the United States if the 
permanent resident has applied for and obtained the preservation of 
residence benefit under section 316(b) or section 317 of the Act, and 
provided further, that a citizen who is living abroad temporarily shall 
be considered to be domiciled in the United States if the citizen's 
employment abroad meets the requirements of section 319(b)(1) of the 
Act.
    Federal poverty line means the level of income equal to the poverty 
guidelines as issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in 
accordance with 42 U.S.C. 9902 that is applicable to a household of the 
size involved. For purposes of considering the Form I-864, Affidavit of 
Support Under Section 213A of the Act, the Service and Consular Posts 
will use the most recent income-poverty guidelines published in the 
Federal Register by the Department of Health and Human Services. These 
guidelines are updated annually, and the Service and Consular Posts will 
begin to use updated guidelines on the first day of the second month 
after the date the guidelines are published in the Federal Register.
    Household income means the income used to determine whether the 
sponsor meets the minimum income requirements under sections 
213A(f)(1)(E), 213A(f)(3), or 213A(f)(5) of the Act. It includes the 
sponsor's income and may also include the incomes of any individuals who 
either are related to the sponsor by birth, marriage, or adoption and 
have been living in the sponsor's residence for the previous 6 months or 
are lawfully listed as dependents on the sponsor's Federal income tax 
return for the most recent tax year, even if such dependents do not live 
at the same residence as the sponsor.
    Household size means the number obtained by adding: (1) The sponsor 
and all persons living at the same residence with the sponsor who are 
related to the sponsor by birth, marriage, or adoption; (2) all persons 
whom the sponsor has claimed as a dependent on the sponsor's Federal 
income tax return for the most recent tax year, even if such persons do 
not live at the same residence as the sponsor; and (3) the number of 
aliens the sponsor has sponsored under any prior Forms I-864 for whom 
the sponsor's support obligation has not terminated, plus the number of 
aliens to be sponsored under the current Form I-864, even if such aliens 
do not or will not live at the same residence as the sponsor.
    Immigration Officer, solely for purposes of this part, includes a 
Consular Officer, as defined by section 101(a)(9)

[[Page 230]]

of the Act, as well as an Immigration Officer, as defined by 
Sec. 103.1(j) of this chapter.
    Income means an individual's gross income, for purposes of the 
individual's Federal income tax liability, including a joint income tax 
return.
    Intending immigrant means any beneficiary of an immigrant visa 
petition filed under section 204 of the Act, including any alien who

by funds provided by the Federal Government that the Federal agency 
administering the Federal funds has determined to be a Federal means-
tested public benefit under the Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193, or a State 
means-tested public benefit, which is any public benefit for which no 
Federal funds are provided that a State, State agency, or political 
subdivision of a State has determined to be a means-tested public 
benefit. No benefit shall be considered to be a means-tested public 
benefit if it is a benefit described in sections 401(b), 411(b), 422(b) 
or 423(d) of Public Law 104-193.
    Program official means the officer or employee of any Federal, 
State, or local government agency or of any private agency that 
administers any means-tested public benefit program who has authority to 
act on the agency's behalf in seeking reimbursement of means-tested 
public benefits.
    Relative means a husband, wife, father, mother, child, adult son, 
adult daughter, brother, or sister.
    Significant ownership interest means an ownership interest of 5 
percent or more in a for-profit entity that filed an immigrant visa 
petition to accord a prospective employee an immigrant status under 
section 203(b) of the Act.
    Sponsor means a person who either is eligible to execute or has 
executed an affidavit of support under this part.
    Sponsored immigrant means an immigrant on whose behalf a sponsor has 
executed an affidavit of support under this part, including any spouse 
or child who will accompany or follow-to-join the beneficiary of an 
immigrant visa petition filed by a sponsor.


<R05>
Sec. 213a.2  Use of affidavit of support.

    (a) General. (1) In any case specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, an intending immigrant is inadmissible as an alien likely to 
become a public charge, unless a sponsor has executed on behalf of the 
intending immigrant a Form I-864, Affidavit of Support Under Section 
213A of the Act, in accordance with section 213A of the Act, this 
section, and the instructions on Form I-864. An affidavit of support is 
executed when a sponsor signs a Form I-864 before a notary public or an 
Immigration or Consular Officer and that form I-864 is submitted to an 
Immigration or Consular officer. The sponsor must execute a separate 
affidavit of support for each visa petition beneficiary and for each 
alien who will accompany or follow-to-join a visa petition beneficiary. 
For any spouse or children immigrating with a sponsored immigrant, the 
sponsor may execute an affidavit of support by submitting photocopies of 
the Form I-864 and all accompanying documentation, but each photocopy of 
the Form I-864 must have an original signature. Under this rule, a 
spouse or child is immigrating with a sponsored immigrant if he or she 
is listed in Part 3 of Form I-864 and applies for an immigrant visa or 
adjustment of status within 6 months of the date the Form I-864 is 
originally signed. The signature on the Form I-864, including 
photocopies, must be notarized by a notary public or signed before an 
Immigration or Consular Officer.
    (2)(i) Except for cases specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section, paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to any application for 
an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status filed on or after December 
19, 1997, in which an intending immigrant seeks an immigrant visa, 
admission as an immigrant, or adjustment of status as:
    (A) An immediate relative under section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act;
    (B) A family-based immigrant under section 203(a) of the Act; or

[[Page 231]]

    (C) An employment-based immigrant under section 203(b) of the Act, 
if a relative of the intending immigrant either filed the employment-
based immigrant petition or has a significant ownership interest in the 
entity that filed the immigrant visa petition on behalf of the intending 
immigrant.
    (ii) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply if the 
intending immigrant:
    (A) Filed a visa petition on his or her own behalf pursuant to 
section 204(a)(1)(A)(ii), (iii), or (iv) or section 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) or 
(iii) of the Act, or who seeks to accompany or follow-to-join an 
immigrant who filed a visa petition on his or his own behalf pursuant to 
section 204(a)(1)(A)(ii), (iii), or (iv) or section 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) or 
(iii) of the Act; or
    (B) Seeks admission as an immigrant on or after December 19, 1997, 
in a category specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section with an 
immigrant visa issued before December 19, 1997.
    (b) Affidavit of support sponsors. The following individuals must 
execute Form I-864 on behalf of the intending immigrant in order for the 
intending immigrant to be found admissible on public charge grounds:
    (1) For immediate relatives and family-based immigrants. The person 
who filed the immigrant visa petition, the approval of which forms the 
basis of the intending immigrant's eligibility to apply for an immigrant 
visa or adjustment of status as an immediate relative or as a family-
sponsored immigrant, must execute a Form I-864 on behalf of the 
intending immigrant.
    (2) For employment-based immigrants. A relative of an intending 
immigrant seeking an immigrant visa under section 203(b) of the Act who 
either filed the immigrant visa petition on behalf of the intending 
immigrant or owns a significant ownership interest in an entity that 
filed an immigrant visa petition on behalf of the intending immigrant.
    (c) Sponsorship requirements--(1) General. A sponsor must:
    (i) Be at least 18 years of age;
    (ii) Be domiciled in the United States or any territory or 
possession of the United States; and
    (iii)(A) Be a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence in the case described in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section; or
    (B) Be a citizen or national of the United States or an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the case described in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section or if the individual is a joint 
sponsor.
    (2) Demonstration of ability to support sponsored immigrants. In 
order for the intending immigrant to overcome the public charge ground 
of inadmissibility, the sponsor must demonstrate the means to maintain 
an annual income of at least 125 percent of the Federal poverty line. If 
the sponsor is on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States 
(other than active duty for training) and the intending immigrant is the 
sponsor's spouse or child, the sponsor's income must equal at least 100 
percent of the Federal poverty line.
    (i) Proof of income. (A) The sponsor must file with the Form I-864 a 
copy of his or her Federal income tax returns for each of the 3 most 
recent taxable years, if he or she had a legal duty to file. By 
executing Form I-864, the sponsor certifies under penalty of perjury 
under United States law that each return is a true and correct copy of 
the return that the sponsor filed with the Internal Revenue Service for 
that taxable year.
    (B) If the sponsor had no legal duty to file a Federal income tax 
return for any of the 3 most recent tax years, the sponsor must explain 
why he or she had no legal duty to a file a Federal income tax return 
for each year for which no Federal income tax return is available. If 
the sponsor had no legal obligation to file a Federal income tax return, 
he or she may submit other evidence of annual income.
    (C)(1) The sponsor's ability to meet the income requirement will be 
determined based on the sponsor's household income. The sponsor may rely 
entirely on his or her own income as his or her household income if it 
is sufficient to meet the requirement. If needed, the sponsor may 
include in his or her household income the incomes of other individuals 
if they either are related to the sponsor by birth, marriage, or

[[Page 232]]

adoption and have been living in the sponsor's residence for the 
previous 6 months or are lawfully listed as dependents on the sponsor's 
Federal income tax return for the most recent tax year. In order for the 
Immigration Officer or Consular Officer to consider the income of any of 
these individuals, the sponsor must include with the Form I-864 a 
written contract on Form I-864A between the sponsor and each other 
individual on whose income the sponsor seeks to rely.
    Under this written contract each other individual must agree, in 
consideration of the sponsor's signing of the Form I-864, to provide to 
the sponsor as much financial assistance as may be necessary to enable 
the sponsor to maintain the sponsored immigrants at the annual income 
level required by section 213A(a)(1)(A) of the Act, to be jointly and 
severally liable for any reimbursement obligation that the sponsor may 
incur, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any court that has 
subject matter jurisdiction over a civil suit to enforce the contract or 
the affidavit of support. The sponsor, as a party to the contract, may 
bring suit to enforce the contract. The sponsored immigrants and any 
Federal, State, or local agency or private entity that provides a means-
tested public benefit to a sponsored immigrant are third party 
beneficiaries of the contract between the sponsor and the other 
individual or individuals on whose income the sponsor relies and may 
bring an action to enforce the contract in the same manner as third 
party beneficiaries of other contracts. If there is no spouse or child 
immigrating with the sponsored immigrant, then there will be no need for 
the sponsored immigrant to sign a Form I-864A, even if the sponsor will 
rely on the income of the sponsored immigrant to meet the income 
requirement. If, however, the sponsor seeks to rely on a sponsored 
immigrant's income to establish the sponsor's ability to support the 
sponsored immigrant's spouse or children, then the sponsored immigrant 
whose income is to be relied on must sign the Form I-864A.
    (2) If the sponsor relies on the income of any other individual, the 
sponsor must also attach that individual's Federal income tax returns 
for each of the 3 most recent tax years. That individual must certify, 
under penalty of perjury, on Form I-864A that each tax return submitted 
is a true and correct copy of the Federal income tax return filed with 
the Internal Revenue Service. If that individual has no legal obligation 
to file a Federal income tax return, he or she must explain and submit 
other evidence of annual income. If the individual whose income the 
sponsor will rely on is not lawfully claimed as a dependent on the 
sponsor's Federal income tax return for the most recent tax year, then 
the sponsor must also attach proof of the relationship between the 
sponsor and that individual and proof of residency in the sponsor's 
residence during at least the preceding 6 months.
    (ii) Proof of employment or self-employment. The sponsor must attach 
evidence of current employment which provides the sponsor's salary or 
wage, or evidence of current self employment. If the sponsor is 
unemployed or retired, the sponsor must state the length of his or her 
unemployment or retirement. The same information must be provided for 
any other person whose income is used to qualify under this section.
    (iii) Determining the sufficiency of an affidavit of support. The 
sufficiency of an affidavit of support shall be determined in accordance 
with this paragraph.
    (A) Income. The sponsor shall first calculate the total income 
attributable to the sponsor under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this 
section.
    (B) Number of persons to be supported. The sponsor shall then 
determine his or her household size as defined in Sec. 213a.1.
    (C) Sufficiency of Income. The sponsor's income shall be considered 
sufficient if the household income calculated under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section would equal at least 125 percent of the 
Federal poverty line for the sponsor's household size as defined in 
Sec. 213a.1, except that the sponsor's income need only equal at least 
100 percent of the Federal poverty line for the sponsor's household 
size, if the sponsor is on active duty (other than for training) in the 
Armed Forces of the United

[[Page 233]]

States and the intending immigrant is the sponsor's spouse or child.
    (iv) Inability to meet income requirement. If the sponsor is unable 
to meet the minimum income requirement in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this 
section, the intending immigrant is inadmissible unless the sponsor and/
or the intending immigrant demonstrates significant assets or a joint 
sponsor executes a separate Form I-864.
    (A) Significant assets. The sponsor may submit evidence of the 
sponsor's ownership of significant assets, such as savings accounts, 
stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, real estate, or other assets. A 
sponsored immigrant may submit evidence of the sponsored immigrant's 
assets as a part of the affidavit of support, even if the sponsored 
immigrant is not required to sign a Form I-864A. The assets of any 
person who has signed a Form I-864A will also be considered in 
determining whether the assets are sufficient to meet this requirement. 
The combined cash value of all the assets (the total value of the assets 
less any offsetting liabilities) must exceed five times the difference 
between the sponsor's household income and the Federal poverty line for 
the sponsor's household size (including all immigrants sponsored in any 
affidavit of support in force under this section).
    (B) Joint sponsor. A joint sponsor must execute a separate Form I-
864 on behalf of the intending immigrant(s) and be willing to accept 
joint and several liability with the sponsor. A joint sponsor must meet 
the eligibility requirements under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A 
joint sponsor's household income must meet or exceed the income 
requirement in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section unless the joint 
sponsor can demonstrate significant assets as provided in paragraph 
(c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.
    (v) Immigration or Consular Officer's determination of insufficient 
income and/or assets. Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(C) and 
(c)(2)(iv) (A) and (B) of this section, an Immigration Officer or 
Consular Officer may determine the income and/or assets of the sponsor 
or a joint sponsor to be insufficient if the Immigration Officer or 
Consular Officer determines, based on the sponsor's or joint sponsor's 
employment situation, income for the previous 3 years, assets, or 
receipt of welfare benefits, that the sponsor or joint sponsor cannot 
maintain his or her income at the required level.
    (vi) Verification of employment, income and assets. The Government 
may pursue verification of any information provided on or with Form I-
864, including information on employment, income, or assets, with the 
employer, financial or other institutions, the Internal Revenue Service, 
or the Social Security Administration.
    (vii) Effect of fraud or material concealment or misrepresentation. 
If the Consular Officer or Immigration Officer finds that the sponsor or 
joint sponsor has concealed or misrepresented facts concerning income, 
or household size, or any other material fact, the Consular Officer or 
Immigration Officer shall conclude that the affidavit of support is not 
sufficient to establish that the sponsored immigrant is not likely to 
become a public charge, and the sponsor or joint sponsor may be liable 
for criminal prosecution under the laws of the United States.
    (d) Legal effect of affidavit of support. Execution of a Form I-864 
under this section creates a contract between the sponsor and the U.S. 
Government for the benefit of the sponsored immigrant, and of any 
Federal, State, or local governmental agency or private entity that 
administers any means-tested public benefits program. The sponsored 
immigrant, or any Federal, State, or local governmental agency or 
private entity that provides any means-tested public benefit to the 
sponsored immigrant after the sponsored immigrant acquires permanent 
resident status, may seek enforcement of the sponsor's obligations 
through an appropriate civil action.
    (e) Termination of support obligation. (1)(i) The sponsor's support 
obligation with respect to a sponsored immigrant terminates by operation 
of law when the sponsored immigrant:
    (A) Becomes a citizen of the United States;
    (B) Has worked, or can be credited with, 40 qualifying quarters of 
work; provided, that the sponsored immigrant

[[Page 234]]

is not credited with any quarter beginning after December 31, 1996, 
during which the sponsored immigrant receives any Federal means-tested 
public benefit;
    (C) Ceases to hold the status of an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence and has departed the United States; or
    (D) Dies.
    (ii) The sponsor's support obligation also terminates if the sponsor 
dies.
    (2) The termination of the sponsor's support obligation does not 
relieve the sponsor (or the sponsor's estate) of any reimbursement 
obligation under section 213A(b) of the Act that accrued before the 
support obligation terminated.
    (f) In the case of an alien who seeks to follow-to-join the 
principal sponsored immigrant, as provided for by section 203(d) of the 
Act, the same sponsor who filed the visa petition and affidavit of 
support for the principal sponsored immigrant must, at the time that the 
alien seeks to follow-to-join the principal sponsored immigrant, sign an 
affidavit of support on behalf of the alien who seeks to follow-to-join 
the principal sponsored immigrant. If that sponsor has died, then the 
alien who seeks to follow-to-join the principal sponsored immigrant 
shall be held to be inadmissible, unless another person, who would 
qualify as a joint sponsor if the principal sponsor were still alive, 
submits on behalf of the alien who seeks to follow-to-join the principal 
sponsored immigrant, an affidavit of support that meets the requirements 
of this section. If the original sponsor is deceased and no other 
eligible sponsor is available, the principal sponsored immigrant may 
sign an affidavit of support on behalf of the alien seeking to follow-
to-join the principal immigrant, if the principal sponsored immigrant 
can meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 213a.3  Notice of change of address.

    (a) General. If the address of a sponsor (including a joint sponsor) 
changes for any reason while the sponsor's support obligation under the 
affidavit of support remains in effect with respect to any sponsored 
immigrant, the sponsor shall file Form I-865, Sponsor's Notice of Change 
of Address, with the Service no later than 30 days after the change of 
address becomes effective.
    (b) Civil penalty--(1) Amount of penalty. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if the sponsor fails to give 
notice in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Service may 
impose on the sponsor a civil penalty in an amount within the penalty 
range established in section 213A(d)(2)(A) of the Act.
    (ii) If the sponsor, knowing that the sponsored immigrant has 
received any means-tested public benefit, fails to give notice in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Service may impose on 
the sponsor a civil penalty in an amount within the penalty range 
established in section 213A(d)(2)(B) of the Act.
    (2) Procedure for imposing penalty. The procedure for imposing a 
civil penalty under this paragraph follows that which is established at 
8 CFR part 280.
    (c) Change of address. If the sponsor is an alien, filing Form I-865 
under this section does not satisfy or substitute for the change of 
address notice required under Sec. 265.1 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 213a.4  Actions for reimbursement, public notice, and congressional reports.

    (a) Requests for reimbursement. Requests for reimbursement under 
section 213A(b)(2) of the Act must be served by personal service, as 
defined by Sec. 103.5a(a)(2) of this chapter. The request for 
reimbursement shall specify the date the sponsor's affidavit of support 
was received by the Service, the sponsored immigrant's name, alien 
registration number, address, and date of birth, as well as the types of 
means-tested public benefit(s) that the sponsored immigrant received, 
the dates the sponsored immigrant received the means-tested public 
benefit(s), and the total amount of the means-tested public benefit(s) 
received. It is not necessary to make a separate request for each type 
of means-tested public benefit, nor for each separate payment. The 
agency may instead aggregate in a single request all benefit payments 
the agency has made as of the date of the

[[Page 235]]

request. The request for reimbursement shall also notify the sponsor 
that the sponsor must, within 45 days of the date of service, respond to 
the request for reimbursement either by paying the reimbursement or by 
arranging to commence payments pursuant to a payment schedule that is 
agreeable to the program official. Prior to filing a lawsuit against a 
sponsor to enforce the sponsor's support obligation under section 
213A(b)(2) of the Act, a Federal, State, or local governmental agency or 
a private entity must wait 45 days from the date it issues a written 
request for reimbursement under section 213A(b)(1) of the Act. If a 
sponsored immigrant, a Federal, State, or local agency, or a private 
entity sues the sponsor and obtains a final civil judgment against the 
sponsor, the sponsored immigrant, the Federal, State, or local agency, 
or the private entity shall mail a certified copy of the final civil 
judgment to the Service's Statistics Branch, 425 I Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20536. The copy should be accompanied by a cover letter 
that includes the reference ``Civil Judgments for Congressional Reports 
under section 213A(i)(3) of the Act.'' Failure to file a certified copy 
of the final civil judgment in accordance with this section has no 
effect on the plaintiff's ability to collect on the judgment pursuant to 
law.
    (b) Federal, State, and local government agencies should issue 
public notice of determinations regarding which benefits are considered 
``means-tested public benefits'' prior to December 19, 1997, the date 
the new affidavit of support goes into effect, or as soon as possible 
thereafter. Additional notices should be issued whenever an agency 
revises its determination of which benefits are considered ``means-
tested public benefits.''
    (c) Congressional reports. (1) For purposes of section 213A(i)(3) of 
the Act, a sponsor shall be considered to be in compliance with the 
financial obligations of section 213A of the Act unless the sponsored 
immigrant or a Federal, State, or local agency or private entity has 
sued the sponsor, obtained a final judgment enforcing the sponsor's 
obligations under section 213A(a)(1)(A) or 213A(b) of the Act, and 
mailed a certified copy of the final judgment to the Service's 
Statistics Branch, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536.
    (2) If a Federal, State, or local agency or private entity that 
administers any means-tested public benefit makes a determination under 
section 421(e) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Reconciliation Act of 1996 in the case of any sponsored immigrant, the 
program official shall send written notice of the determination, 
including the name of the sponsored immigrant and of the sponsor, to the 
Service's Statistics Branch. The written notice should include the 
reference ``Determinations under 421(e) of the Personal Responsibility 
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.''


<R05>
Sec. 213a.5  Relationship of this part to other affidavits of support.

    Nothing in this part precludes the continued use of Form I-134, 
Affidavit of Support (other than INA section 213A), or of Form I-361, 
Affidavit of Financial Support and Intent to Petition for Legal Custody 
for Public Law 97-359 Amerasian, in any case, other than a case 
described in Sec. 213a.2(a)(2), in which these forms were used prior to 
enactment of section 213A of the Act. The obligations of section 213A of 
the Act do not bind a person who executes Form I-134 or Form I-361, 
although the person who executes Form I-361 remains subject to the 
provisions of section 204(f)(4)(B) of the Act and of Sec. 204.4(i) of 
this chapter.

    (3) General requirements. Every nonimmigrant alien who applies for 
admission to, or an extension of stay in, the United States, shall 
establish that he or she is admissible to the United States, or that any 
ground of inadmissibility has been waived under section 212(d)(3) of the 
Act. Upon application for admission, the alien shall present a valid 
passport and valid visa unless either or both documents have been 
waived. However, an alien applying for extension of stay shall present a 
passport only if requested to do so by the Service. The passport of an 
alien applying for admission shall be valid for a minimum of six months 
from the expiration date of the contemplated period of stay, unless 
otherwise provided in this chapter, and the alien shall agree to abide 
by the terms and conditions of his or her admission. The passport of an 
alien applying for extension of stay shall be valid at the time of 
application for extension, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, 
and the alien shall agree to maintain the validity of his or her 
passport and to abide by all

[[Page 237]]

the terms and conditions of his extension. The alien shall also agree to 
depart the United States at the expiration of his or her authorized 
period of admission or extension, or upon abandonment of his or her 
authorized nonimmigrant status. At the time a nonimmigrant alien applies 
for admission or extension of stay he or she shall post a bond on Form 
I-352 in the sum of not less than $500, to insure the maintenance of his 
or her nonimmigrant status and departure from the United States, if 
required to do so by the director, immigration judge, or Board of 
Immigration Appeals.
    (b) Readmission of nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), 
or (M) to complete unexpired periods of previous admission or extension 
of stay--(1) Section 101(a)(15)(F). The inspecting immigration officer 
shall readmit for duration of status as defined in 
Sec. 214.2(f)(5)(iii), any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is 
considered automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and 
who is applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(F) of the Act, 
if the alien:
    (i) Is admissible;
    (ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United 
States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or 
adjacent islands;
    (iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the 
requirement for presentation of a passport; and
    (iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien 
who presents, an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94, issued to the 
alien in connection with the previous admission or stay, the alien's 
Form I-20 ID copy, and either:
    (A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20A-B if there has been no 
substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form 
I-20A since the form was initially issued; or
    (B) A new Form I-20A-B if there has been any substantive change in 
the information on the student's most recent Form I-20A since the form 
was initially issued.
    (2) Section 101(a)(15)(J). The inspecting immigration officer shall 
readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's 
departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered 
automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is 
applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, if the 
alien:
    (i) Is admissible;
    (ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence from the United 
States not exceeding thirty days solely in contiguous territory or 
adjacent islands;
    (iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the 
requirement for the presentation of a passport; and
    (iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien 
who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the 
previous admission or stay or copy three of the last Form IAP-66 issued 
to the alien. Form I-94 or Form IAP-66 must show the unexpired period of 
the alien's stay endorsed by the Service.
    (3) Section 101(a)(15)(M). The inspecting immigration officer shall 
readmit for the unexpired period of stay authorized prior to the alien's 
departure, any nonimmigrant alien whose nonimmigrant visa is considered 
automatically revalidated pursuant to 22 CFR 41.125(f) and who is 
applying for readmission under section 101(a)(15)(M) of the Act, if the 
alien:
    (i) Is admissible;
    (ii) Is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding 
thirty days solely in contiguous territory;
    (iii) Is in possession of a valid passport unless exempt from the 
requirement for presentation of a passport; and
    (iv) Presents, or is the accompanying spouse or child of an alien 
who presents, Form I-94 issued to the alien in connection with the 
previous admission or stay, the alien's Form I-20 ID copy, and a 
properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N.
    (c) Extensions of stay--(1) Filing on Form I-129. An employer 
seeking the services of an E-1, E-2, H-1A, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, 
O-1, O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, Q, R-1, or TC nonimmigrant beyond the period 
previously granted, must petition for an extension of stay on Form I-
129. The petition must be filed with the fee required in Sec. 103.7 of 
this chapter, and the initial evidence

[[Page 238]]

specified in Sec. 214.2, and on the petition form. Dependents holding 
derivative status may be included in the petition if it is for only one 
worker and the form version specifically provides for their inclusion. 
In all other cases dependents of the worker should file on Form I-539.
    (2) Filing on Form I-539. Any other nonimmigrant alien, except an 
alien in F or J status who has been granted duration of status, who 
seeks to extend his or her stay beyond the currently authorized period 
of admission, must apply for an extension of stay on Form I-539 with the 
fee required in Sec. 103.7 of this chapter together with any initial 
evidence specified in the applicable provisions of Sec. 214.2, and on 
the application form. More than one person may be included in an 
application where the co-applicants are all members of a single family 
group and either all hold the same nonimmigrant status or one holds a 
nonimmigrant status and the other co-applicants are his or her spouse 
and/or children who hold derivative nonimmigrant status based on his or 
her status. Extensions granted to members of a family group must be for 
the same period of time. The shortest period granted to any member of 
the family shall be granted to all members of the family.
    (3) Ineligible for extension of stay. A nonimmigrant in any of the 
following classes is ineligible for an extension of stay:
    (i) B-1 or B-2 where admission was pursuant to the Visa Waiver Pilot 
Program;
    (ii) C-1, C-2, C-3;
    (iii) D-1, D-2;
    (iv) K-1, K-2;
    (v) Any nonimmigrant admitted for duration of status, other than as 
provided in Sec. 214.2(f)(7); or
    (vi) Any nonimmigrant who is classified pursuant to section 
101(a)(15)(S) of the Act beyond a total of 3 years.
    (4) Timely filing and maintenance of status. An extension of stay 
may not be approved for an applicant who failed to maintain the 
previously accorded status or where such status expired before the 
application or petition was filed, except that failure to file before 
the period of previously authorized status expired may be excused in the 
discretion of the Service and without separate application, with any 
extension granted from the date the previously authorized stay expired, 
where it is demonstrated at the time of filing that:
    (i) The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the 
control of the applicant or petitioner, and the Service finds the delay 
commensurate with the circumstances;
    (ii) The alien has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant 
status;
    (iii) The alien remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and
    (iv) The alien is not the subject of deportation proceedings under 
section 242 of the Act (prior to April 1, 1997) or removal proceedings 
under section 240 of the Act.
    (5) Decision in Form I-129 or I-539 extension proceedings. Where an 
applicant or petitioner demonstrates eligibility for a requested 
extension, it may be granted at the discretion of the Service. There is 
no appeal from the denial of an application for extension of stay filed 
on Form I-129 or I-539.
    (d) Termination of status. Within the period of initial admission or 
extension of stay, the nonimmigrant status of an alien shall be 
terminated by the revocation of a waiver authorized on his or her behalf 
under section 212(d) (3) or (4) of the Act; by the introduction of a 
private bill to confer permanent resident status on such alien; or, 
pursuant to notification in the Federal Register, on the basis of 
national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons.
    (e) Employment. A nonimmigrant in the United States in a class 
defined in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act as a temporary visitor for 
pleasure, or section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act as an alien in transit 
through this country, may not engage in any employment. Any other 
nonimmigrant in the United States may not engage in any employment 
unless he has been accorded a nonimmigrant classification which 
authorizes employment or he has been granted permission to engage in 
employment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A 
nonimmigrant who is permitted to engage in employment may engage only in 
such employment as has been authorized. Any unauthorized employment by a 
nonimmigrant constitutes a failure to

[[Page 239]]

maintain status within the meaning of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the 
Act.
    (f) False information. A condition of a nonimmigrant's admission and 
continued stay in the United States is the full and truthful disclosure 
of all information requested by the Service. Willful failure by a 
nonimmigrant to provide full and truthful information requested by the 
Service (regardless of whether or not the information requested was 
material) constitutes a failure to maintain nonimmigrant status under 
section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
    (g) Criminal activity. A condition of a nonimmigrant's admission and 
continued stay in the United States is obedience to all laws of United 
States jurisdictions which prohibit the commission of crimes of violence 
and for which a sentence of more than one year imprisonment may be 
imposed. A nonimmigrant's conviction in a jurisdiction in the United 
States for a crime of violence for which a sentence of more than one 
year imprisonment may be imposed (regardless of whether such sentence is 
in fact imposed) constitutes a failure to maintain status under section 
241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 214.2  Special requirements for admission, extension, and maintenance of status.

    The general requirements in Sec. 214.1 are modified for the 
following nonimmigrant classes:
    (a) Foreign government officials--(1) General. The determination by 
a consular officer prior to admission and the recognition by the 
Secretary of State subsequent to admission is evidence of the proper 
classification of a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(A) of the Act. 
An alien who has a nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(A)(i) or 
(ii) of the Act is to be admitted for the duration of the period for 
which the alien continues to be recognized by the Secretary of State as 
being entitled to that status. An alien defined in section 
(101)(a)(15)(A)(iii) of the Act is to be admitted for an initial period 
of not more than three years, and may be granted extensions of temporary 
stay in increments of not more than two years. In addition, the 
application for extension of temporary stay must be accompanied by a 
statement signed by the employing official stating that he/she intends 
to continue to employ the applicant and describing the type of work the 
applicant will perform.
    (2) Definition of A-1 or A-2 dependent. For purposes of employment 
in the United States, the term dependent of an A-1 or A-2 principal 
alien, as used in Sec. 214.2(a), means any of the following immediate 
members of the family habitually residing in the same household as the 
principal alien who is an officer or employee assigned to a diplomatic 
or consular office in the United States:
    (i) Spouse;
    (ii) Unmarried children under the age of 21;
    (iii) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 23 who are in 
full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational 
institutions;
    (iv) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 25 who are in 
full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational 
institutions if a formal bilateral employment agreement permitting their 
employment in the United States was signed prior to November 21, 1988, 
and such bilateral employment agreement does not specify 23 as the 
maximum age for employment of such sons and daughters. The Office of 
Protocol of the Department of State shall maintain a listing of foreign 
states with which the United States has such bilateral employment 
agreements;
    (v) Unmarried sons or daughters who are physically or mentally 
disabled to the extent that they cannot adequately care for themselves 
or cannot establish, maintain or re-establish their own households. The 
Department of State or the Service may require certification(s) as it 
deems sufficient to document such mental or physical disability.

[[Page 240]]

    (3) Applicability of a formal bilateral agreement or an informal de 
facto arrangement for A-1 or A-2 dependents. The applicability of a 
formal bilateral agreement shall be based on the foreign state which 
employs the principal alien and not on the nationality of the principal 
alien or dependent. The applicability of an informal de facto 
arrangement shall be based on the foreign state which employs the 
principal alien, but under a de facto arrangement the principal alien 
also must be a national of the foreign state which employs him/her in 
the United States.
    (4) Income tax, Social Security liability; non-applicability of 
certain immunities. Dependents who are granted employment authorization 
under this section are responsible for payment of all federal, state and 
local income, employment and related taxes and Social Security 
contributions on any remuneration received. In addition, immunity from 
civil or administrative jurisdiction in accordance with Article 37 of 
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or other international 
agreements does not apply to these dependents with respect to matters 
arising out of their employment.
    (5) Dependent employment pursuant to formal bilateral employment 
agreements and informal de facto reciprocal arrangements. (i) The Office 
of Protocol shall maintain a listing of foreign states which have 
entered into formal bilateral employment agreements. Dependents of an A-
1 or A-2 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States 
may accept or continue in unrestricted employment based on such formal 
bilateral agreements upon favorable recommendation by the Department of 
State and issuance of employment authorization documentation by the 
Service in accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. The application procedures 
are set forth in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, an informal de facto reciprocal 
arrangement exists when the Department of State determines that a 
foreign state allows appropriate employment on the local economy for 
dependents of certain United States officials assigned to duty in that 
foreign state. The Office of Protocol shall maintain a listing of 
countries with which such reciprocity exists. Dependents of an A-1 or A-
2 principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States may be 
authorized to accept or continue in employment based upon informal de 
facto arrangements upon favorable recommendation by the Department of 
State and issuance of employment authorization by the Service in 
accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. Additionally, the procedures set forth 
in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must be complied with, and the 
following conditions must be met:
    (A) Both the principal alien and the dependent desiring employment 
are maintaining A-1 or A-2 status as appropriate;
    (B) The principal's assignment in the United States is expected to 
last more than six months;
    (C) Employment of a similar nature for dependents of United States 
Government officials assigned to official duty in the foreign state 
employing the principal alien is not prohibited by that foreign state's 
government;
    (D) The proposed employment is not in an occupation listed in the 
Department of Labor Schedule B (20 CFR part 656), or otherwise 
determined by the Department of Labor to be one for which there is an 
oversupply of qualified U.S. workers in the area of proposed employment. 
This Schedule B restriction does not apply to a dependent son or 
daughter who is a full-time student if the employment is part-time, 
consisting of not more than 20 hours per week, and/or if it is temporary 
employment of not more than 12 weeks during school holiday periods; and
    (E) The proposed employment is not contrary to the interest of the 
United States. Employment contrary to the interest of the United States 
includes, but is not limited to, the employment of A-1 or A-2 
dependents: who have criminal records; who have violated United States 
immigration laws or regulations, or visa laws or regulations; who have 
worked illegally in the United States; and/or who cannot establish that 
they have paid taxes and social security on income from current or 
previous United States employment.

[[Page 241]]

    (6) Application procedures. The following procedures are applicable 
to dependent employment applications under bilateral agreements and de 
facto arrangements:
    (i) The dependent must submit a completed Form I-566 to the 
Department of State through the office, mission, or organization which 
employs his/her principal alien. A dependent applying under paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section must submit a certified statement 
from the post-secondary educational institution confirming that he/she 
is pursuing studies on a full-time basis. A dependent applying under 
paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section must submit medical certification 
regarding his/her condition. The certification should identify the 
dependent and the certifying physician and give the physician's phone 
number; identify the condition, describe the symptoms and provide a 
prognosis; and certify that the dependent is unable to maintain a home 
of his or her own. Additionally, a dependent applying under the terms of 
a de facto arrangement must attach a statement from the prospective 
employer which includes the dependent's name; a description of the 
position offered and the duties to be performed; the salary offered; and 
verification that the dependent possesses the qualifications for the 
position.
    (ii) The Department of State reviews and verifies the information 
provided, makes its determination, and endorses the Form I-566.
    (iii) If the Department of State's endorsement is favorable, the 
dependent may apply to the Service. A dependent whose principal alien is 
stationed at a post in Washington, DC, or New York City shall apply to 
the District Director, Washington, DC, or New York City, respectively. A 
dependent whose principal alien is stationed elsewhere shall apply to 
the District Director, Washington, DC, unless the Service, through the 
Department of State, directs the dependent to apply to the district 
director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. 
Directors of the regional service centers may have concurrent 
adjudicative authority for applications filed within their respective 
regions. When applying to the Service, the dependent must present his or 
her Form I-566 with a favorable endorsement from the Department of State 
and any additional documentation as may be required by the Attorney 
General.
    (7) Period of time for which employment may be authorized. If 
approved, an application to accept or continue employment under this 
section shall be granted in increments of not more than three years 
each.
    (8) No appeal. There shall be no appeal from a denial of permission 
to accept or continue employment under this section.
    (9) Dependents or family members of principal aliens classified A-3. 
A dependent or family member of a principal alien classified A-3 may not 
be employed in the United States under this section.
    (10) Unauthorized employment. An alien classified under section 
101(a)(15)(A) of the Act who is not a principal alien and who engages in 
employment outside the scope of, or in a manner contrary to this 
section, may be considered in violation of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of 
the Act. An alien who is classified under section 101(a)(15)(A) of the 
Act who is a principal alien and who engages in employment outside the 
scope of his/her official position may be considered in violation of 
section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
    (b) Visitors--(1) General. any B-1 visitor for business or B-2 
visitor for pleasure may be admitted for not more than one year and may 
be granted extensions of temporary stay in increments of not more than 
six months each, except that alien members of a religious denomination 
coming temporarily and solely to do missionary work in behalf of a 
religious denomination may be granted extensions of not more than one 
year each, provided that such work does not involve the selling of 
articles or the solicitation or acceptance of donations. Those B-1 and 
B-2 visitors admitted pursuant to the waiver provided at Sec. 212.1(e) 
of this chapter may be admitted to and stay on Guam for period not to 
exceed fifteen days and are not eligible for extensions of stay.
    (2) Minimum six month admissions. Any B-2 visitor who is found 
otherwise admissible and is issued a Form I-94, will be admitted for a 
minimum period of

six months, regardless of whether less time is requested, provided, that 
any required passport is valid as specified in section 212(a)(26) of the 
Act. Exceptions to the minimum six month admission may be made only in 
individual cases upon the specific approval of the district director for 
good cause.

Canada, are those requirements which were in effect at the time of entry 
into force of the CFTA and, with respect to Mexico, are those 
requirements which are in effect at the time of entry into force of the 
NAFTA. Additionally, nothing shall preclude the admission of a citizen 
of Mexico or Canada who meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(ii) 
of this section.
    (i) Occupations and professions set forth in Appendix 1603.A.1 to

in the United States if all goods or passengers to be delivered were 
loaded in the territory of another Party. Furthermore, they may load 
from locations in the United States if all goods or passengers to be 
loaded will be delivered in the territory of another Party. Purely

entry under section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act, if such person otherwise 
meets the existing requirements for admission as prescribed by the 
Attorney General.
    (5) Construction workers not admissible. Aliens seeking to enter the 
country to perform building or construction work, whether on-site or in-
plant, are not eligible for classification or admission as B-1 
nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act. However, alien 
nonimmigrants otherwise qualified as B-1 nonimmigrants may be issued 
visas and may enter for the purpose of supervision or training of others 
engaged in building or construction work, but not for the purpose of 
actually performing any such building or construction work themselves.
    (c) Transits--(1) Without visas. An applicant for admission under 
the transit without visa privilege must establish that he is admissable 
under the immigration laws; that he has confirmed and onward 
reservations to at least the next country beyond the United States, and 
that he will continue his journey on the same line or a connecting line 
within 8 hours after his arrival; however, if there is no scheduled 
transportation within that 8-hour period, continuation of the journey 
thereafter on the first available transport will be satisfactory. 
Transfers from the equipment on which an applicant arrives to other 
equipment of the same or a connecting line shall be limited to 2 in 
number, with the last transport departing foreign (but not necessarily 
nonstop foreign), and the total period of waiting time for connecting 
transportation shall not exceed 8 hours except as provided above. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an applicant, if seeking to

[[Page 244]]

join a vessel in the United States as a crewman, shall be in possession 
of a valid ``D'' visa and a letter from the owner or agent of the vessel 
he seeks to join, shall proceed directly to the vessel on the first 
available transportation and upon joining the vessel shall remain aboard 
at all times until it departs from the United States. Except for transit 
from one part of foreign contiguous territory to another part of the 
same territory, application for direct transit without a visa must be 
made at one of the following ports of entry: Agana, Guam, Anchorage, AK, 
Atlanta, GA, Baltimore, MD, Bangor, ME, Boston, MA, Brownsville, TX, 
Buffalo, NY, Charlotte, NC, Charlotte Amalie, VI, Chicago, IL, 
Christiansted, VI, Dallas, TX, Daytona, FL, Denver, CO, Detroit, MI, 
Fairbanks, AK, Hartford, CT, Honolulu, HI, Houston, TX, Los Angeles, CA, 
Memphis, TN, Miami, FL, Newark, NJ, New Orleans, LA, New York, NY, 
Niagara Falls, NY, Norfolk, VA, Oakland, CA, Orlando, FL, Philadelphia, 
PA, Pittsburgh, PA, Ponce, PR, Port Everglades FL, Portland, OR, San 
Antonio, TX, San Diego, CA, Sanford, FL, San Francisco, CA, San Juan, 
PR, Seattle, WA, St. Paul, MN, Tampa, FL, Washington, DC. The privilege 
of transit without a visa may be authorized only under the conditions 
that the transportation line, without the prior consent of the Service, 
will not refund the ticket which was presented to the Service as 
evidence of the alien's confirmed and onward reservations; that the 
alien will not apply for extension of temporary stay or for adjustment 
of status under section 245 of the Act, and that until his departure 
from the United States responsibility for his continuous actual custody 
will lie with the transportation line which brought him to the United 
States unless at the direction of the district director he is in the 
custody of this Service or other custody approved by the Commissioner.
    (2) United Nations Headquarters District. An alien of the class 
defined in section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act, whose visa is limited to 
transit to and from the United Nations Headquarters District, if 
otherwise admissible, shall be admitted on the additional conditions 
that he proceed directly to the immediate vicinity of the United Nations 
Headquarters District, and remain there continuously, departing 
therefrom only if required in connection with his departure from the 
United States, and that he have a document establishing his ability to 
enter some country other than the United States following his sojourn in 
the United Nations Headquarters District. The immediate vicinity of the 
United Nations Headquarters District is that area lying within a twenty-
five mile radius of Columbus Circle, New York, NY.
    (3) Others. The period of admission of an alien admitted under 
section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act shall not exceed 29 days.
    (d) Crewmen. (1) The provisions of parts 251, 252, 253, and 258 of 
this chapter shall govern the landing of crewmen as nonimmigrants of the 
class defined in section 101(a)(15)(D) of the Act. An alien in this 
status may be employed only in a crewman capacity on the vessel or 
aircraft of arrival, or on a vessel or aircraft of the same 
transportation company, and may not be employed in connection with 
domestic flights or movements of a vessel or aircraft. However, 
nonimmigrant crewmen may perform crewmember duties through stopovers on 
an international flight for any United States carrier where such flight 
uses a single aircraft and has an origination or destination point 
outside the United States.
    (2) Denial of crewman status in the case of certain labor disputes 
(D nonimmigrants). (i) An alien shall be denied D crewman status as 
described in section 101(a)(15)(D) of the Act if:
    (A) The alien intends to land for the purpose of performing service 
on a vessel of the United States (as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(46)) or 
an aircraft of an air carrier (as defined in section 101(3) of the 
Federal Aviation Act of 1958); and
    (B) A labor dispute consisting of a strike or lockout exists in the 
bargaining unit of the employer in which the alien intends to perform 
such service; and
    (C) The alien is not already an employee of the company (as 
described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section).

[[Page 245]]

    (ii) Refusal to land. Any alien (except a qualified current employee 
as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section) who the examining 
immigration officer determines has arrived in the United States for the 
purpose of performing service on board a vessel or an aircraft of the 
United States when a strike or lockout is under way in the bargaining 
unit of the employer, shall be refused a conditional landing permit 
under section 252 of the Act.
    (iii) Ineligibility for parole. An alien described in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i) of this section may not be paroled into the United States 
under section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the purpose of performing 
crewmember duties unless the Attorney General determines that the parole 
of such alien is necessary to protect the national security of the 
United States. This paragraph does not prohibit the granting of parole 
for other purposes, such as medical emergencies.
    (iv) Qualified current employees. (A) Paragraphs (d)(2)(i), 
(d)(2)(ii), and (d)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply to an alien who 
is already an employee of the owner or operator of the vessel or air 
carrier and who at the time of inspection presents true copies of 
employer work records which satisfy the examining immigration officer 
that the alien:
    (1) Has been an employee of such employer for a period of not less 
than one year preceding the date that a strike or lawful lockout 
commenced;
    (2) Has served as a qualified crewman for such employer at least 
once in three different months during the 12-month period preceding the 
date that the strike or lockout commenced; and
    (3) Shall continue to provide the same crewman services that he or 
she previously provided to the employer.
    (B) An alien crewman who qualifies as a current employee under this 
paragraph remains subject to the restrictions on his or her employment 
in the United States contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (v) Strike or lockout determination. These provisions will take 
effect if the Attorney General, through the Commissioner of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service or his or her designee, after 
consultation with the National Mediation Board, determines that a 
strike, lockout, or labor dispute involving a work stoppage is in 
progress in the bargaining unit of the employer for whom the alien 
intends to perform such service.
    (e) Treaty traders and investors--(1) Treaty trader. An alien, if 
otherwise admissible, may be classified as a nonimmigrant treaty trader 
(E-1) under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(E)(i) of the Act if the 
alien:
    (i) Will be in the United States solely to carry on trade of a 
substantial nature, which is international in scope, either on the 
alien's behalf or as an employee of a foreign person or organization 
engaged in trade principally between the United States and the treaty 
country of which the alien is a national, taking into consideration any 
conditions in the country of which the alien is a national which may 
affect the alien's ability to carry on such substantial trade; and
    (ii) Intends to depart the United States upon the expiration or 
termination of treaty trader (E-1) status.
    (2) Treaty investor. An alien, if otherwise admissible, may be 
classified as a nonimmigrant treaty investor (E-2) under the provision 
of section 101(a)(15)(E)(ii) of the Act if the alien:
    (i) Has invested or is actively in the process of investing a 
substantial amount of capital in a bona fide enterprise in the United 
States, as distinct from a relatively small amount of capital in a 
marginal enterprise solely for the purpose of earning a living;
    (ii) Is seeking entry solely to develop and direct the enterprise; 
and
    (iii) Intends to depart the United States upon the expiration or 
termination of treaty investor (E-2) status.
    (3) Employee of treaty trader or treaty investor. An alien employee 
of a treaty trader, if otherwise admissible, may be classified as E-1, 
and an alien employee of a treaty investor, if otherwise admissible, may 
be classified as E-2 if the employee is in or is coming to the United 
States to engage in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or, 
if employed in a lesser capacity, the employee has special 
qualifications that make the alien's services essential to the efficient 
operation of the enterprise. The employee must have the same nationality 
as the principal alien

[[Page 246]]

employer. In addition, the employee must intend to depart the United 
States upon the expiration or termination of E-1 or E-2 status. The 
principal alien employer must be:
    (i) A person in the United States having the nationality of the 
treaty country and maintaining nonimmigrant treaty trader or treaty 
investor status or, if not in the United States, would be classifiable 
as a treaty trader or treaty investor; or
    (ii) An enterprise or organization at least 50 percent owned by 
persons in the United States having the nationality of the treaty 
country and maintaining nonimmigrant treaty trader or treaty investor 
status or who, if not in the United States, would be classifiable as 
treaty traders or treaty investors.
    (4) Spouse and children of treaty trader or treaty investor. The 
spouse and child of a treaty trader or treaty investor accompanying or 
following to join the principal alien, if otherwise admissible, may 
receive the same classification as the principal alien. The nationality 
of a spouse or child of a treaty trader or treaty investor is not 
material to the classification of the spouse or child under the 
provisions of section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act.
    (5) Nonimmigrant intent. An alien classified under section 
101(a)(15)(E) of the Act shall maintain an intention to depart the 
United States upon the expiration or termination of E-1 or E-2 status. 
However, an application for initial admission, change of status, or 
extension of stay in E classification may not be denied solely on the 
basis of an approved request for permanent labor certification or a 
filed or approved immigrant visa preference petition.
    (6) Treaty country. A treaty country is, for purposes of this 
section, a foreign state with which a qualifying Treaty of Friendship, 
Commerce, or Navigation or its equivalent exists with the United States. 
A treaty country includes a foreign state that is accorded treaty visa 
privileges under section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act by specific 
legislation.
    (7) Treaty country nationality. The nationality of an individual 
treaty trader or treaty investor is determined by the authorities of the 
foreign state of which the alien is a national. In the case of an 
enterprise or organization, ownership must be traced as best as is 
practicable to the individuals who are ultimately its owners.
    (8) Terms and conditions of E treaty status--(i) Limitations on 
employment. The Service determines the terms and conditions of E treaty 
status at the time of admission or approval of a request to change 
nonimmigrant status to E classification. A treaty trader, treaty 
investor, or treaty employee may engage only in employment which is 
consistent with the terms and conditions of his or her status and the 
activity forming the basis for the E treaty status.
    (ii) Subsidiary employment. Treaty employees may perform work for 
the parent treaty organization or enterprise, or any subsidiary of the 
parent organization or enterprise. Performing work for subsidiaries of a 
common parent enterprise or organization will not be deemed to 
constitute a substantive change in the terms and conditions of the 
underlying E treaty employment if, at the time the E treaty status was 
determined, the applicant presented evidence establishing:
    (A) The enterprise or organization, and any subsidiaries thereof, 
where the work will be performed; the requisite parent-subsidiary 
relationship; and that the subsidiary independently qualifies as a 
treaty organization or enterprise under this paragraph;
    (B) In the case of an employee of a treaty trader or treaty 
investor, the work to be performed requires executive, supervisory, or 
essential skills; and
    (C) The work is consistent with the terms and conditions of the 
activity forming the basis of the classification.
    (iii) Substantive changes. Prior Service approval must be obtained 
where there will be a substantive change in the terms or conditions of E 
status. In such cases, a treaty alien must file a new application on 
Form I-129 and E supplement, in accordance with the instructions on that 
form, requesting extension of stay in the United States. In support of 
an alien's Form I-129 application, the treaty alien must submit evidence 
of continued eligibility for E classification in the new capacity. 
Alternatively, the alien must obtain from

[[Page 247]]

a consular officer a visa reflecting the new terms and conditions and 
subsequently apply for admission at a port-of-entry. The Service will 
deem there to have been a substantive change necessitating the filing of 
a new Form I-129 application in cases where there has been a fundamental 
change in the employing entity's basic characteristics, such as a 
merger, acquisition, or sale of the division where the alien is 
employed.
    (iv) Non-substantive changes. Prior approval is not required, and 
there is no need to file a new Form I-129, if there is no substantive, 
or fundamental, change in the terms or conditions of the alien's 
employment which would affect the alien's eligibility for E 
classification. Further, prior approval is not required if corporate 
changes occur which do not affect the previously approved employment 
relationship, or are otherwise non-substantive. To facilitate admission, 
the alien may:
    (A) Present a letter from the treaty-qualifying company through 
which the alien attained E classification explaining the nature of the 
change;
    (B) Request a new Form I-797, Approval Notice, reflecting the non-
substantive change by filing with the appropriate Service Center Form I-
129, with fee, and a complete description of the change, or;
    (C) Apply directly to State for a new E visa reflecting the change. 
An alien who does not elect one of the three options contained in 
paragraph (e)(8)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section, is not precluded 
from demonstrating to the satisfaction of the immigration officer at the 
port-of-entry in some other manner, his or her admissibility under 
section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act.
    (v) Advice. To ascertain whether a change is substantive, an alien 
may file with the Service Center Form I-129, with fee, and a complete 
description of the change, to request appropriate advice. In cases 
involving multiple employees, an alien may request that a Service Center 
determine if a merger or other corporate restructuring requires the 
filing of separate applications by filing a single Form I-129, with fee, 
and attaching a list of the related receipt numbers for the employees 
involved and an explanation of the change or changes. Where employees 
are located within multiple jurisdictions, such a request for advice 
must be filed with the Service Center in Lincoln, Nebraska.
    (vi) Approval. If an application to change the terms and conditions 
of E status or employment is approved, the Service shall notify the 
applicant on Form I-797. An extension of stay in nonimmigrant E 
classification may be granted for the validity of the approved 
application. The alien is not authorized to begin the new employment 
until the application is approved. Employment is authorized only for the 
period of time the alien remains in the United States. If the alien 
subsequently departs from the United States, readmission in E 
classification may be authorized where the alien presents his or her 
unexpired E visa together with the Form I-797, Approval Notice, 
indicating Service approval of a change of employer or of a change in 
the substantive terms or conditions of treaty status or employment in E 
classification, or, in accordance with 22 CFR 41.112(d), where the alien 
is applying for readmission after an absence not exceeding 30 days 
solely in contiguous territory.
    (vii) An unauthorized change of employment to a new employer will 
constitute a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 
237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act. In all cases where the treaty employee will 
be providing services to a subsidiary under this paragraph, the 
subsidiary is required to comply with the terms of 8 CFR part 274a.
    (9) Trade--definitions. For purposes of this paragraph: Items of 
trade include but are not limited to goods, services, international 
banking, insurance, monies, transportation, communications, data 
processing, advertising, accounting, design and engineering, management 
consulting, tourism, technology and its transfer, and some news-
gathering activities. For purposes of this paragraph, goods are tangible 
commodities or merchandise having extrinsic value. Further, as used in 
this paragraph, services are legitimate economic activities which 
provide other than tangible goods.

[[Page 248]]

    Trade is the existing international exchange of items of trade for 
consideration between the United States and the treaty country. Existing 
trade includes successfully negotiated contracts binding upon the 
parties which call for the immediate exchange of items of trade. 
Domestic trade or the development of domestic markets without 
international exchange does not constitute trade for purposes of section 
101(a)(15)(E) of the Act. This exchange must be traceable and 
identifiable. Title to the trade item must pass from one treaty party to 
the other.
    (10) Substantial trade. Substantial trade is an amount of trade 
sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of international trade items 
between the United States and the treaty country. This continuous flow 
contemplates numerous transactions over time. Treaty trader status may 
not be established or maintained on the basis of a single transaction, 
regardless of how protracted or monetarily valuable the transaction. 
Although the monetary value of the trade item being exchanged is a 
relevant consideration, greater weight will be given to more numerous 
exchanges of larger value. There is no minimum requirement with respect 
to the monetary value or volume of each individual transaction. In the 
case of smaller businesses, an income derived from the value of numerous 
transactions which is sufficient to support the treaty trader and his or 
her family constitutes a favorable factor in assessing the existence of 
substantial trade.
    (11) Principal trade. Principal trade between the United States and 
the treaty country exists when over 50 percent of the volume of 
international trade of the treaty trader is conducted between the United 
States and the treaty country of the treaty trader's nationality.
    (12) Investment. An investment is the treaty investor's placing of 
capital, including funds and other assets (which have not been obtained, 
directly or indirectly, through criminal activity), at risk in the 
commercial sense with the objective of generating a profit. The treaty 
investor must be in possession of and have control over the capital 
invested or being invested. The capital must be subject to partial or 
total loss if investment fortunes reverse. Such investment capital must 
be the investor's unsecured personal business capital or capital secured 
by personal assets. Capital in the process of being invested or that has 
been invested must be irrevocably committed to the enterprise. The alien 
has the burden of establishing such irrevocable commitment. The alien 
may use any legal mechanism available, such as the placement of invested 
funds in escrow pending admission in, or approval of, E classification, 
that would not only irrevocably commit funds to the enterprise, but 
might also extend personal liability protection to the treaty investor 
in the event the application for E classification is denied.
    (13) Bona fide enterprise. The enterprise must be a real, active, 
and operating commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking which produces 
services or goods for profit. The enterprise must meet applicable legal 
requirements for doing business in the particular jurisdiction in the 
United States.
    (14) Substantial amount of capital. A substantial amount of capital 
constitutes an amount which is:
    (i) Substantial in relationship to the total cost of either 
purchasing an established enterprise or creating the type of enterprise 
under consideration;
    (ii) Sufficient to ensure the treaty investor's financial commitment 
to the successful operation of the enterprise; and
    (iii) Of a magnitude to support the likelihood that the treaty 
investor will successfully develop and direct the enterprise. Generally, 
the lower the cost of the enterprise, the higher, proportionately, the 
investment must be to be considered a substantial amount of capital.
    (15) Marginal enterprise. For purposes of this section, an 
enterprise may not be marginal. A marginal enterprise is an enterprise 
that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than 
enough income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and 
his or her family. An enterprise that does not have the capacity to 
generate such income, but that has a present or future capacity to make 
a significant economic contribution is

[[Page 249]]

not a marginal enterprise. The projected future income-generating 
capacity should generally be realizable within 5 years from the date the 
alien commences the normal business activity of the enterprise.
    (16) Solely to develop and direct. An alien seeking classification 
as a treaty investor (or, in the case of an employee of a treaty 
investor, the owner of the treaty enterprise) must demonstrate that he 
or she does or will develop and direct the investment enterprise. Such 
an applicant must establish that he or she controls the enterprise by 
demonstrating ownership of at least 50 percent of the enterprise, by 
possessing operational control through a managerial position or other 
corporate device, or by other means.
    (17) Executive and supervisory character. The applicant's position 
must be principally and primarily, as opposed to incidentally or 
collaterally, executive or supervisory in nature. Executive and 
supervisory duties are those which provide the employee ultimate control 
and responsibility for the enterprise's overall operation or a major 
component thereof. In determining whether the applicant has established 
possession of the requisite control and responsibility, a Service 
officer shall consider, where applicable:
    (i) That an executive position is one which provides the employee 
with great authority to determine the policy of, and the direction for, 
the enterprise;
    (ii) That a position primarily of supervisory character provides the 
employee supervisory responsibility for a significant proportion of an 
enterprise's operations and does not generally involve the direct 
supervision of low-level employees, and;
    (iii) Whether the applicant possesses executive and supervisory 
skills and experience; a salary and position title commensurate with 
executive or supervisory employment; recognition or indicia of the 
position as one of authority and responsibility in the overall 
organizational structure; responsibility for making discretionary 
decisions, setting policies, directing and managing business operations, 
supervising other professional and supervisory personnel; and that, if 
the position requires some routine work usually performed by a staff 
employee, such functions may only be of an incidental nature.
    (18) Special qualifications. Special qualifications are those skills 
and/or aptitudes that an employee in a lesser capacity brings to a 
position or role that are essential to the successful or efficient 
operation of the treaty enterprise. In determining whether the skills 
possessed by the alien are essential to the operation of the employing 
treaty enterprise, a Service officer must consider, where applicable:
    (i) The degree of proven expertise of the alien in the area of 
operations involved; whether others possess the applicant's specific 
skill or aptitude; the length of the applicant's experience and/or 
training with the treaty enterprise; the period of training or other 
experience necessary to perform effectively the projected duties; the 
relationship of the skill or knowledge to the enterprise's specific 
processes or applications, and the salary the special qualifications can 
command; that knowledge of a foreign language and culture does not, by 
itself, meet the special qualifications requirement, and;
    (ii) Whether the skills and qualifications are readily available in 
the United States. In all cases, in determining whether the applicant 
possesses special qualifications which are essential to the treaty 
enterprise, a Service officer must take into account all the particular 
facts presented. A skill that is essential at one point in time may 
become commonplace at a later date. Skills that are needed to start up 
an enterprise may no longer be essential after initial operations are 
complete and running smoothly. Some skills are essential only in the 
short-term for the training of locally hired employees. Under certain 
circumstances, an applicant may be able to establish his or her 
essentiality to the treaty enterprise for a longer period of time, such 
as, in connection with activities in the areas of product improvement, 
quality control, or the provision of a service not yet generally 
available in the United States. Where the treaty enterprise's need for 
the applicant's special qualifications, and therefore, the applicant's

[[Page 250]]

essentiality, is time-limited, Service officers may request that the 
applicant provide evidence of the period for which skills will be needed 
and a reasonable projected date for completion of start-up or 
replacement of the essential skilled workers.
    (19) Period of admission. Periods of admission are as follows:
    (i) A treaty trader or treaty investor may be admitted for an 
initial period of not more than 2 years.
    (ii) The spouse and minor children accompanying or following to join 
a treaty trader or treaty investor shall be admitted for the period 
during which the principal alien is in valid treaty trader or investor 
status. The temporary departure from the United States of the principal 
trader or investor shall not affect the derivative status of the 
dependent spouse and minor unmarried children, provided the familial 
relationship continues to exist and the principal remains eligible for 
admission as an E nonimmigrant to perform the activity.
    (iii) Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, an alien shall 
not be admitted in E classification for a period of time extending more 
than 6 months beyond the expiration date of the alien's passport.
    (20) Extensions of stay. Requests for extensions of stay may be 
granted in increments of not more than 2 years. A treaty trader or 
treaty investor in valid E status may apply for an extension of stay by 
filing an application for extension of stay on Form I-129 and E 
Supplement, with required accompanying documents, in accordance with 
Sec. 214.1 and the instructions on that form.
    (i) For purposes of eligibility for an extension of stay, the alien 
must prove that he or she:
    (A) Has at all times maintained the terms and conditions of his or 
her E nonimmigrant classification;
    (B) Was physically present in the United States at the time of 
filing the application for extension of stay; and
    (C) Has not abandoned his or her extension request.
    (ii) With limited exceptions, it is presumed that employees of 
treaty enterprises with special qualifications who are responsible for 
start-up operations should be able to complete their objectives within 2 
years. Absent special circumstances, therefore, such employees will not 
be eligible to obtain an extension of stay.
    (iii) Subject to paragraph (e)(5) of this section and the 
presumption noted in paragraph (e)(22)(ii) of this section, there is no 
specified number of extensions of stay that a treaty trader or treaty 
investor may be granted.
    (21) Change of nonimigrant status. (i) An alien in another valid 
nonimmigrant status may apply for change of status to E classification 
by filing an application for change of status on Form I-129 and E 
Supplement, with required accompanying documents establishing 
eligibility for a change of status and E classification, in accordance 
with 8 CFR part 248 and the instructions on Form I-129 and E Supplement.
    (ii) The spouse or minor children of an applicant seeking a change 
of status to that of treaty trader or treaty investor alien shall file 
concurrent applications for change of status to derivative treaty 
classification on the appropriate Service form. Applications for 
derivative treaty status shall:
    (A) Be approved only if the principal treaty alien is granted treaty 
alien status and continues to maintain that status;
    (B) Be approved for the period of admission authorized in paragraph 
(e)(20) of this section.
    (22) Denial of treaty trader or treaty investor status to citizens 
of Canada or Mexico in the case of certain labor disputes. (i) A citizen 
of Canada or Mexico may be denied E treaty trader or treaty investor 
status as described in section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act and section B of 
Annex 1603 of the NAFTA if:
    (A) The Secretary of Labor certifies to or otherwise informs the 
Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers in the alien's occupational classification is in 
progress at the place where the alien is or intends to be employed; and
    (B) Temporary entry of that alien may affect adversely either:
    (1) The settlement of any labor dispute that is in progress at the 
place or intended place of employment, or

[[Page 251]]

    (2) The employment of any person who is involved in such dispute.
    (ii) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United 
States and is participating in a strike or other labor dispute involving 
a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such strike or other labor 
dispute has been certified by the Secretary of Labor, or whether the 
Service has been otherwise informed that such a strike or labor dispute 
is in progress, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain 
his or her status solely on account of past, present, or future 
participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers, but is subject to the following terms and 
conditions:
    (A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act, and regulations promulgated in the 
same manner as all other E nonimmigrants; and
    (B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not 
modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in 
a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers.
    (iii) Although participation by an E nonimmigrant alien in a strike 
or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not 
constitute a ground for deportation, any alien who violates his or her 
status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized 
period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.
    (iv) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute 
is not certified under paragraph (e)(22)(i) of this section, or the 
Service has not otherwise been informed by the Secretary that such a 
strike or labor dispute is in progress, the Commissioner shall not deny 
entry to an applicant for E status.
    (f) Students in colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, 
academic high schools, elementary schools, other academic institutions, 
and in language training programs--(1) Admission of student--(i) 
Eligibility for admission. A nonimmigrant student and his or her 
accompanying spouse and minor children may be admitted into the United 
States in F-1 and F-2 classifications for duration of status under 
section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act, if the student:
    (A) Presents a properly completed Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID, Certificate 
of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status, which is issued by 
a school approved by the Service for attendance by foreign students;
    (B) Has documentary evidence of financial support in the amount 
indicated on the Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID; and
    (C) For students seeking initial admission only, intends to attend 
the school specified in the student's visa except where the student is 
exempt from the requirement for a visa, in which case the student must 
intend to attend the school indicated on the Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID.
    (ii) Disposition of Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID. Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID 
contains two copies, the I-20 School Copy and the I-20 ID (Student) 
Copy. For purposes of clarity, the entire Form I-20 A-B/I-20 ID shall be 
referred to as Form I-20 A-B and the I-20 ID (Student) Copy shall be 
referred to as the I-20 ID. When an F-1 student applies for admission 
with a complete Form I-20 A-B, the inspecting officer shall:
    (A) Transcribe the student's admission number from Form I-94 onto 
his or her Form I-20 A-B (for students seeking initial admission only);
    (B) Endorse all copies of the Form I-20 A-B;
    (C) Return the I-20 ID to the student; and
    (D) Forward the I-20 School Copy to the Service's processing center 
for data entry. (The school copy of Form I-20 A-B will be sent back to 
the school as a notice of the student's admission after data entry.)
    (2) I-20 ID. An F-1 student is expected to safekeep the initial I-20 
ID bearing the admission number and any subsequent copies which have 
been issued to him or her. Should the student lose his or her current I-
20 ID, a replacement copy bearing the same information as the lost copy, 
including any endorsement for employment and notations, may be issued by 
the designated school official (DSO) as defined in 8 CFR 214.3(l)(1)(i).
    (3) Spouse and minor children following to join student. The spouse 
and minor

[[Page 252]]

children following to join an F-1 student are eligible for admission to 
the United States if the F-1 student is, or will be within sixty days, 
enrolled in a full course of study or, if the student is engaged in 
approved practical training following completion of studies. The 
eligible spouse and minor children of an F-1 student may be admitted in 
F-2 status if they present the F-1 student's current I-20 ID with proper 
endorsement by the DSO. A new Form I-20 A-B is required where there has 
been any substantive change in the information on the student's current 
I-20 ID.
    (4) Temporary absence. An F-1 student returning to the United States 
from a temporary absence of five months or less may be readmitted for 
attendance at a Service-approved educational institution, if the student 
presents:
    (i) A current I-20 ID properly endorsed by the DSO for reentry if 
there is no substantive change on the most recent I-20 ID; or
    (ii) A new Form I-20 A-B if there has been any substantive change in 
the information on the student's most recent I-20 ID, such as in the 
case of a student who has changed the major area of study, who intends 
to transfer to another Service-approved institution, or who has advanced 
to a higher level of study.
    (5) Duration of status--(i) General. Duration of status is defined 
as the time during which an F-1 student is pursuing a full course of 
study at an educational institution approved by the Service for 
attendance by foreign students, or engaging in authorized practical 
training following completion of studies, plus sixty days to prepare for 
departure from the United States. The student is considered to be 
maintaining status if he or she is making normal progress toward 
completing a course of study.
    (ii) Change in educational levels. An F-1 student who continues from 
one educational level to another is considered to be maintaining status, 
provided that the transition to the new educational level is 
accomplished according to transfer procedures outlined in paragraph 
(f)(8) of this section.
    (iii) Annual vacation. An F-1 student at an academic institution is 
considered to be in status during the annual (or summer) vacation if the 
student is eligible and intends to register for the next term. A student 
attending a school on a quarter or trimester calendar who takes only one 
vacation a year during any one of the quarters or trimesters instead of 
during the summer is considered to be in status during that vacation, if 
the student has completed the equivalent of an academic year prior to 
taking the vacation.
    (iv) Illness or medical conditions. A student who is compelled by 
illness or other medical conditions to interrupt or reduce a full course 
of study is considered to be in status during the illness or other 
medical condition. The student must resume a full course of study upon 
recovery.
    (v) Emergent circumstances as determined by the Commissioner. Where 
the Commissioner has suspended the applicability of any or all of the 
requirements for on-campus or off-campus employment authorization for 
specified students pursuant to paragraphs (f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of 
this section by notice in the Federal Register, an affected student who 
needs to reduce his or her full course of study as a result of accepting 
employment authorized by such notice in the Federal Register will be 
considered to be in status during the authorized employment, subject to 
any other conditions specified in the notice, provided that, for the 
duration of the authorized employment, the student is registered for the 
number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term 
specified in the notice, which in no event shall be less than 6 semester 
or quarter hours of instruction per academic term if the student is at 
the undergraduate level or less than 3 semester or quarter hours of 
instruction per academic term if the student is at the graduate level, 
and is continuing to make progress toward completing the course of 
study.
    (6) Full course of study--(i) General. Successful completion of the 
full course of study must lead to the attainment of a specific 
educational or professional objective. A ``full course of study'' as 
required by section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act means:

[[Page 253]]

    (A) Postgraduate study or postdoctoral study at a college or 
university, or undergraduate or postgraduate study at a conservatory or 
religious seminary, certified by a DSO as a full course of study;
    (B) Undergraduate study at a college or university, certified by a 
school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours 
of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard 
semester, trimester, or quarter hour systems, where all undergraduate 
students who are enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter 
hours are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for 
other administrative purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the 
district director in the school approval process), except when the 
student needs a lesser course load to complete the course of study 
during the current term;
    (C) Study in a postsecondary language, liberal arts, fine arts, or 
other non-vocational program at a school which confers upon its 
graduates recognized associate or other degrees or has established that 
its credits have been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three 
institutions of higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or 
school system) owned and operated as a public educational institution by 
the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a 
school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which 
has been certified by a designated school official to consist of at 
least twelve clock hours of instruction a week, or its equivalent as 
determined by the district director in the school approval process;
    (D) Study in any other language, liberal arts, fine arts, or other 
nonvocational training program, certified by a designated school 
official to consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a 
week if the dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom 
instruction, or to consist of at least twenty-two clock hours a week if 
the dominant part of the course of study consists of laboratory work; or
    (E) Study in a primary school or academic high school curriculum 
certified by a designated school official to consist of class attendance 
for not less than the minimum number of hours a week prescribed by the 
school for normal progress towards graduation.
    (F) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(6)(i)(A) and (f)(6)(i)(B) of this 
section, an alien who has been granted employment authorization pursuant 
to the terms of a document issued by the Commissioner under paragraphs 
(f)(9)(i) or (f)(9)(ii) of this section and published in the Federal 
Register shall be deemed to be engaged in a ``full course of study'' if 
he or she remains registered for no less than the number of semester or 
quarter hours of instruction per academic term specified by the 
Commissioner in the notice for the validity period of such employment 
authorization.
    (ii) Institution of higher learning. For purposes of this paragraph, 
a college or university is an institution of higher learning which 
awards recognized associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate, or 
professional degrees. Schools which devote themselves exclusively or 
primarily to vocational, business, or language instruction are not 
included in the category of colleges or universities. Vocational or 
business schools which are classifiable as M-1 schools are provided for 
by regulations under 8 CFR 214.2(m).
    (iii) Reduced course load. The designated school official may advise 
an F-1 student to engage in less than a full course of study due to 
initial difficulties with the English language or reading requirements, 
unfamiliarity with American teaching methods, or improper course level 
placement. An F-1 student authorized to reduce course load by the DSO in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph is considered to be 
maintaining status. On-campus employment pursuant to the terms of a 
scholarship, fellowship, or assistantship is deemed to be part of the 
academic program of a student otherwise taking a full course of study.
    (7) Extension of stay--(i) General. An F-1 student is admitted for 
duration of status. The student is not required to apply for extension 
of stay as long as the student is maintaining status and making normal 
progress toward completing his or her educational objective. An F-1 
student who is unable to complete a full course of study in a timely 
manner must apply, in a 30-day

[[Page 254]]

period before the completion date on the Form I-20 A-B, to the DSO for a 
program extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Completion date on Form I-20 A-B. When determining the program 
completion date on Form I-20 A-B, the DSO should make a reasonable 
estimate based on the time an average foreign student would need to 
complete a similar program in the same discipline. A grace period of no 
more than one year may be added onto the DSO's estimate.
    (iii) Program extension for students in lawful status. An F-1 
student who is unable to meet the program completion date on the Form I-
20 A-B may be granted a program extension by the school, if the DSO 
certifies on a Form I-538 that the student has continually maintained 
status and that the delays are caused by compelling academic or medical 
reasons, such as changes of major or research topics, unexpected 
research problems, or documented illnesses. Delays caused by academic 
probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program 
extension. The DSO must notify the Service within 30 days of any 
approved program extensions by forwarding to the Service data processing 
center a certification on Form I-538 and the top page of a new Form I-20 
A-B showing a new program completion date.
    (iv) Failure to complete the educational program in a timely manner. 
An F-1 student who is unable to complete the educational program within 
the time period written on the Form I-20 A-B and who is ineligible for 
program extension pursuant to paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section is 
considered to be out of status. Under these circumstances, the student 
must apply for reinstatement under the Provisions of paragraph (f)(16) 
of this section.
    (8) School transfer--(i) Eligibility. An F-1 student who is 
maintaining status may transfer to another Service-approved school by 
following the notification procedure prescribed in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) 
of this section. An F-1 student who was not pursuing a full course of 
study at the school he or she was last authorized to attend is 
ineligible for school-transfer and must apply for reinstatement under 
the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section.
    (ii) Transfer procedure. To transfer schools, an F-1 student must 
first notify the school he or she is attending of the intent to 
transfer, then obtain a Form I-20 A-B, issued in accordance with the 
provisions of 8 CFR 214.3(k), from the school to which he or she intends 
to transfer. The transfer will be effected only if the F-1 student 
completes the Student Certification portion of the Form I-20 A-B and 
returns the form to a designated school official on campus within 15 
days of beginning attendance at the new school.
    (iii) Notification. Upon receipt of the student's Form I-20 A-B, the 
DSO must:
    (A) Note ``transfer completed on (date)'' on the student's I-20 ID 
in the space provided for the DSO's remarks, thereby acknowledging the 
student's attendance;
    (B) Return the I-20 ID to the student;
    (C) Submit the I-20 School copy to the Service's Data Processing 
Center within 30 days of receipt from the student; and
    (D) Forward a photocopy of the Form I-20 A-B School Copy to the 
school from which the student transferred.
    (9) Employment--(i) On-campus employment. On-campus employment must 
either be performed on the school's premises, (including on-location 
commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as 
the school bookstore or cafeteria), or at an off-campus location which 
is educationally affiliated with the school. Employment with on-site 
commercial firms, such as a construction company building a school 
building, which do not provide direct student services is not deemed on-
campus employment for the purposes of this paragraph. In the case of 
off-campus locations, the educational affiliation must be associated 
with the school's established curriculum or related to contractually 
funded research projects at the post-graduate level. In any event, the 
employment must be an integral part of the student's educational 
program. Employment authorized under this paragraph must not exceed 20 
hours a week while school is in session, unless the Commissioner 
suspends the applicability of

[[Page 255]]

this limitation due to emergent circumstances, as determined by the 
Commissioner, by means of notice in the Federal Register, the student 
demonstrates to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe 
economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO 
notates the Form I-20 in accordance with the Federal Register document. 
An F-1 student may, however, work on campus full-time when school is not 
in session or during the annual vacation. A student who has been issued 
a Form I-20 A-B to begin a new program in accordance with the provision 
of 8 CFR 214.3(k) and who intends to enroll for the next regular 
academic year, term, or session at the institution which issued the Form 
I-20 A-B may continue on-campus employment incident to status. 
Otherwise, an F-1 student may not engage in on-campus employment after 
completing a course of study, except employment for practical training 
as authorized under paragraph (f)(10) of this section. An F-I student 
may engage in any on-campus employment authorized under this paragraph 
which will not displace United States residents.
    (ii) Off-campus work authorization--(A) General. An F-1 student may 
be authorized to work off-campus on a part-time basis in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(9)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section after having been in F-1 
status for one full academic year provided that the student is in good 
academic standing as determined by the DSO. Part-time off-campus 
employment authorized under this section is limited to no more than 
twenty hours a week when school is in session. A student who is granted 
off-campus employment authorization may work full-time during holidays 
or school vacation. The employment authorization is automatically 
terminated whenever the student fails to maintain status. In emergent 
circumstances as determined by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may 
suspend the applicability of any or all of the requirements of paragraph 
(f)(9)(ii) of this section by notice in the Federal Register.
    (B) Wage-and-labor attestation requirement. Except as provided under 
paragraphs (f)(9)(ii)(C) and (f)(9)(iii) of this section, a student may 
be authorized to accept off-campus employment only if the prospective 
employer has filed a labor-and-wage attestation pursuant to 20 CFR part 
655, subparts J and K (requiring the employer to attest to the fact that 
it has actively recruited domestic labor for at least 60 days for the 
position and will accord the student worker the same wages and working 
conditions as domestic workers similarly employed.)
    (C) Severe economic hardship. If other employment opportunities are 
not available or are otherwise insufficient, an eligible F-1 student may 
request off-campus employment work authorization based upon severe 
economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the 
student's control. These circumstances may include loss of financial aid 
or on-campus employment without fault on the part of the student, 
substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate, 
inordinate increases in tuition and/or living costs, unexpected changes 
in the financial condition of the student's source of support, medical 
bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.
    (D) Procedure for off-campus employment authorization. The student 
must submit the application to the DSO on Form I-538, Certification by 
Designated School Official. The DSO may recommend the student work off-
campus for one year intervals by certifying on the Form I-538 that:
    (1) The student has been in F-1 status for one full academic year;
    (2) The student is in good standing as a student and is carrying a 
full course of study as defined in paragraph (f)(6) of this section;
    (3) The student has demonstrated that acceptance of employment will 
not interfere with the student's carrying a full course of study; and
    (4) Either: (i) The prospective employer has submitted a labor-and-
wage attestation pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(B) of this section, or
    (ii) The student has demonstrated that the employment is necessary 
to avoid severe economic hardship due to unforeseen circumstances beyond 
the student's control pursuant to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(C) of this 
section, and

[[Page 256]]

has demonstrated that employment under paragraph (f)(9)(i) and 
(f)(9)(ii)(B) of this section is unavailable or otherwise insufficient 
to meet the needs that have arisen as a result of the unforeseen 
circumstances.
    (E) Wage-and-Labor attestation application to the DSO. An eligible 
F-1 student may make a request for off-campus employment authorization 
to the DSO on Form I-538 after the employer has filed the labor-and-wage 
attestation. By certifying on Form I-538 that the student is eligible 
for off-campus employment, and endorsing the student's I-20 ID, the DSO 
may authorize off-campus employment in one year intervals for the 
duration of a valid attestation as determined by the Secretary of Labor. 
The endorsement on the student's I-20 ID should read ``part-time 
employment with (name of employer) at (location) authorized from (date) 
to (date).'' Off-campus employment authorized by the DSO under this 
provision is incident to the student's status pursuant to 8 CFR 
274a.12(b)(6)(ii) and employer-specific and, therefore, exempt from the 
EAD requirement. The DSO must notify the Service of each off-campus 
employment authorization by forwarding to the Service data processing 
center the completed Form I-538. The DSO shall return to the student the 
endorsed I-20 ID.
    (F) Severe economic hardship application--(1) The applicant should 
submit to the Service Form I-20 ID, Form I-538, and Form I-765 along 
with the fee required by 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), and any other supporting 
materials such as affidavits which further detail the unforeseen 
circumstances that require the student to seek employment authorization 
and the unavailability or insufficiency of employment under paragraphs 
(f)(9)(i) and (f)(9)(ii)(B) of this section. The requirement with 
respect to paragraph (f)(9)(ii)(B) of this section is satisfied if the 
DSO certifies on Form I-538 that the student and the DSO are not aware 
of available employment in the area through the Pilot Off-Campus 
Employment Program. In areas where there are such Pilot program 
opportunities, this requirement is satisfied if the DSO certifies on 
Form I-538 that employment under the Pilot program is insufficient to 
meet the student's needs. The student must apply for the employment 
authorization on Form I-765 with the Service office having jurisdiction 
over his or her place of residence.
    (2) The Service shall adjudicate the application for work 
authorization based upon severe economic hardship on the basis of Form 
I-20 ID, Form I-538, and Form I-765, and any additional supporting 
materials. If employment is authorized, the adjudicating officer shall 
issue an EAD. The Service director shall notify the student of the 
decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons 
for the denial. No appeal shall lie from a decision to deny a request 
for employment authorization under this section. The employment 
authorization may be granted in one year intervals up to the expected 
date of completion of the student's current course of study. A student 
has permission to engage in off-campus employment only if the student 
receives the EAD endorsed to that effect. Off-campus employment 
authorization may be renewed by the Service only if the student is 
maintaining status and good academic standing. The employment 
authorization is automatically terminated whenever the student fails to 
maintain status.
    (iii) Internship with an international organization. A bona fide F-1 
student who has been offered employment by a recognized international 
organization within the meaning of the International Organization 
Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669) must apply for employment authorization, 
in person, to the Service office having jurisdiction over his or her 
place of residence. A student seeking employment authorization under 
this provision is required to present a written certification from the 
international organization that the proposed employment is within the 
scope of the organization's sponsorship, an I-20 ID endorsed for reentry 
by the DSO within the last 30 days, and a completed Form I-765, 
Application for Employment Authorization, with the fee required in 8 CFR 
103.7(b)(1).
    (10) Practical training. Practical training is available to F-1 
students who have been lawfully enrolled on a full-

[[Page 257]]

time basis in a Service-approved college, university, conservatory, or 
seminary for at least nine consecutive months. Students in English 
language training programs are ineligible for practical training. An 
eligible F-1 student may request employment authorization for practical 
training in a position which is directly related to his or her major 
area of study. There are two types of practical training available:
    (i) Curricular practical training programs. An F-1 student may be 
authorized, by the DSO, to participate in a curricular practical 
training program which is an integral part of an established curriculum. 
Curricular practical training is defined to be alternate work/study, 
internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required 
internship or practicum which is offered by sponsoring employers through 
cooperative agreements with the school. Students who have received one 
year or more of full-time curricular practical training are ineligible 
for post-completion practical training. Exceptions to the nine-month in 
status requirement are provided for students enrolled in graduate 
studies which require immediate participation in curricular practical 
training. A request for authorization for curricular practical training 
must be made to the DSO on Form I-538. Upon approving the request for 
authorization, the DSO shall:
    (A) Certify the Form I-538 and send the form to the Service's data 
processing center;
    (B) Endorse the student's I-20 ID with ``full-time (or part-time) 
curricular practical training authorized for (employer) at (location) 
from (date) to (date)''; and
    (C) Sign and date the I-20 ID before returning it to the student. A 
student may begin curricular practical training only after receiving his 
or her I-20 ID with the DSO endorsement.
    (ii) Optional practical training--(A) General. An F-1 student may 
apply to the Service for authorization for temporary employment for 
practical training directly related to the student's major area of 
study. Temporary employment for practical training may be authorized:
    (1) During the student's annual vacation and at other times when 
school is not in session if the student is currently enrolled and 
eligible, and intends, to register for the next term or session;
    (2) While school is in session, provided that practical training 
does not exceed twenty hours a week while school is in session;
    (3) After completion of all course requirements for the degree 
(excluding thesis or equivalent), if the student is in a bachelor's 
master's, or doctoral degree program; or
    (4) After completion of the course of study. A student must complete 
all practical training within a 14 month period following the completion 
of study.
    (B) Termination of practical training. Authorization to engage in 
practical training employment is automatically terminated when the 
student transfers to another school.
    (C) Request for authorization for practical training. A request for 
authorization to accept practical training must be made to the 
designated school official (DSO) of the school the student is authorized 
to attend on Form I-538, accompanied by his or her current Form I-20 ID.
    (D) Action of the DSO. In making a recommendation for practical 
training, a designated school official must:
    (1) Certify on Form I-538 that the proposed employment is directly 
related to the student's major area of study and commensurate with the 
student's educational level;
    (2) Endorse and date the student's Form I-20 ID to show that 
practical training in the student's major field of study is recommended 
``full-time (or part-time) from (date) to (date)''; and
    (3) Return to the student the Form I-20 ID and send to the Service 
data processing center the school certification on Form I-538.
    (11) Employment authorization. The total periods of authorization 
for optional practical training under paragraph (f)(10) of this section 
shall not exceed a maximum of twelve months. Part-time practical 
training, 20 hours per week or less, shall be deducted from the 
available practical training at one-half the full-time rate. As required 
by the regulations at 8 CFR part 274a,

[[Page 258]]

an F-1 student seeking practical training (excluding curricular 
practical training) under paragraph (f)(10) of this section may not 
accept employment until he or she has been issued an Employment 
Authorization Document (EAD) by the Service. An F-1 student must apply 
to the INS for the EAD by filing the Form 1-765. The application for 
employment authorization must include the following documents:
    (i) A completed Form I-765, with the fee required by 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1); and
    (ii) A DSO's recommendation for practical training on I-20 ID.
    (12) Decision on application for employment authorization. The 
Service shall adjudicate the Form I-765 and issue an EAD on the basis of 
the DSO's recommendation unless the student is found otherwise 
ineligible. The Service shall notify the applicant of the decision and, 
if the application is denied, of the reason or reasons for the denial. 
The applicant may not appeal the decision.
    (13) Temporary absence from the United States of F-1 student granted 
employment authorization. (i) A student returning from a temporary trip 
abroad with an unexpired off-campus employment authorization on his or 
her I-20 ID may resume employment only if the student is readmitted to 
attend the same school which granted the employment authorization.
    (ii) An F-1 student who has an unexpired EAD issued for post-
completion practical training and who is otherwise admissible may return 
to the United States to resume employment after a period of temporary 
absence. The EAD must be used in combination with an I-20 ID endorsed 
for reentry by the DSO within the last six months.
    (14) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Any employment 
authorization, whether or not part of an academic program, is 
automatically suspended upon certification by the Secretary of Labor or 
the Secretary's designee to the Commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service or the Commissioner's designee, that a strike or 
other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress 
in the occupation at the place of employment. As used in this paragraph, 
``place of employment'' means the facility or facilities where a labor 
dispute exists. The employer is prohibited from transferring F-1 
students working at other facilities to the facility where the work 
stoppage is occurring.
    (15) Spouse and children of F-1 student. The F-1 spouse and children 
of an F-1 student may not accept employment.
    (16) Reinstatement to student status--(i) General. The Service may 
consider reinstating an F-1 student who makes a request for 
reinstatement on Form I-539, Application to Extend Time of Temporary 
Stay, accompanied by a properly completed Form I-20 A-B from the school 
the student is attending or intends to attend, if the student:
    (A) Establishes to the satisfaction of the Service that the 
violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student's 
control or that failure to receive reinstatement to lawful F-1 status 
would result in extreme hardship to the student;
    (B) Is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a full course of 
study at the school which issued the Form I-20 A-B;
    (C) Has not engaged in unauthorized employment; and
    (D) Is not deportable on any ground other than section 241(a)(1)(B) 
or (C)(i) of the Act.
    (ii) Decision. If the Service reinstates the student, the Service 
shall endorse the Form I-20 A-B to indicate that the student has been 
reinstated, return the I-20 ID to the student, and forward the school 
copy of the form to the Service's processing center for data entry. If 
the Service does not reinstate the student, the student may not appeal 
that decision.
    (g) Representatives to international organizations--(1) General. The 
determination by a consular officer prior to admission and the 
recognition by the Secretary of State subsequent to admission is 
evidence of the proper classification of a nonimmigrant under section 
101(a)(15)(G) of the Act. An alien who has a nonimmigrant status under 
section 101(a)(15)(G) (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the Act is to be 
admitted for the duration of the period for which the alien continues to 
be recognized by the Secretary of State as being entitled to that 
status. An alien defined in section (101)(a)(15)(G)(v) of the Act is to 
be

[[Page 259]]

admitted for an initial period of not more than three years, and may be 
granted extensions of temporary stay in increments of not more than two 
years. In addition, the application for extension of temporary stay must 
be accompanied by a statement signed by the employing official stating 
that he or she intends to continue to employ the applicant and 
describing the type of work the applicant will perform.
    (2) Definition of G-1, G-3, or G-4 dependent. For purposes of 
employment in the United States, the term dependent of a G-1, G-3, or G-
4 principal alien, as used in Sec. 214.2(g), means any of the following 
immediate members of the family habitually residing in the same 
household as the principal alien who is an officer or employee assigned 
to a mission, to an international organization, or is employed by an 
international organization in the United States:
    (i) Spouse;
    (ii) Unmarried children under the age of 21;
    (iii) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 23 who are in 
full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational 
institutions;
    (iv) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 25 who are in 
full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational 
institutions if a formal bilateral employment agreement permitting their 
employment in the United States was signed prior to November 21, 1988, 
and such bilateral employment agreement does not specify 23 as the 
maximum age for employment of such sons and daughters. The Office of 
Protocol of the Department of State shall maintain a listing of foreign 
states which the United States has such bilateral employment agreements. 
The provisions of this paragraph apply only to G-1 and G-3 dependents 
under certain bilateral agreements and are not applicable to G-4 
dependents; and
    (v) Unmarried sons or daughters who are physically or mentally 
disabled to the extent that they cannot adequately care for themselves 
or cannot establish, maintain, or re-establish their own households. The 
Department of State or the Service may require certification(s) as it 
deems sufficient to document such mental or physical disability.
    (3) Applicability of a formal bilateral agreement or an informal de 
facto arrangement for G-1 and G-3 dependents. The applicability of a 
formal bilateral agreement shall be based on the foreign state which 
employs the principal alien and not on the nationality of the principal 
alien or dependent. The applicability of an informal de facto 
arrangement shall be based on the foreign state which employs the 
principal alien, but under a de facto arrangement the principal alien 
also must be a national of the foreign state which employs him or her in 
the United States.
    (4) Income tax, Social Security liability; non-applicability of 
certain immunities. Dependents who are granted employment authorization 
under this section are responsible for payment of all federal, state and 
local income, employment and related taxes and Social Security 
contributions on any remuneration received. In addition, immunity from 
civil or administrative jurisdiction in accordance with Article 37 of 
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or other international 
agreements does not apply to these dependents with respect to matters 
arising out of their employment.
    (5) G-1 and G-3 dependent employment pursuant to formal bilateral 
employment agreements and informal de facto reciprocal arrangements, and 
G-4 dependent employment. (i) The Office of Protocol shall maintain a 
listing of foreign states which have entered into formal bilateral 
employment agreements. Dependents of a G-1 or G-3 principal alien 
assigned to official duty in the United States may accept or continue in 
unrestricted employment based on such formal bilateral agreements, if 
the applicable agreement includes persons in G-1 or G-3 visa status, 
upon favorable recommendation by the Department of State and issuance of 
employment authorization documentation by the Service in accordance with 
8 CFR part 274a. The application procedures are set forth in paragrpah 
(g)(6) of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this section, an informal de facto reciprocal 
arrangement exists when the Department of State determines that a 
foreign state

[[Page 260]]

allows appropriate employment on the local economy for dependents of 
certain United States officials assigned to duty in that foreign state. 
The Office of Protocol shall maintain a listing of countries with which 
such reciprocity exists. Dependents of a G-1 or G-3 principal alien 
assigned to official duty in the United States may be authorized to 
accept or continue in employment based upon informal de facto 
arrangements, and dependents of a G-4 principal alien assigned to 
official duty in the United States may be authorized to accept or 
continue in employment upon favorable recommendation by the Department 
of State and issuance of employment authorization by the Service in 
accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. Additionally, the procedures set forth 
in paragraph (g)(6) of this section must be complied with, and the 
following conditions must be met:
    (A) Both the principal alien and the dependent desiring employment 
are maintaining G-1, G-3, or G-4 status as appropriate;
    (B) The principal's assignment in the United States is expected to 
last more than six months;
    (C) Employment of a similar nature for dependents of United States 
Government officials assigned to official duty in the foreign state 
employing the principal alien is not prohibited by that foreign 
government. The provisions of this paragraph apply only to G-1 and G-3 
dependents;
    (D) The proposed employment is not in an occupation listed in the 
Department of Labor Schedule B (20 CFR part 656), or otherwise 
determined by the Department of Labor to be one for which there is an 
oversupply of qualified U.S. workers in the area of proposed employment. 
This Schedule B restriction does not apply to a dependent son or 
daughter who is a full-time student if the employment is part-time, 
consisting of not more than 20 hours per week, and/or if it is temporary 
employment of not more than 12 weeks during school holiday periods; and
    (E) The proposed employment is not contrary to the interest of the 
United States. Employment contrary to the interest of the United States 
includes, but is not limited to, the employment of G-1, G-3, or G-4 
dependents: who have criminal records; who have violated United States 
immigration laws or regulations, or visa laws or regulations; who have 
worked illegally in the United States; and/or who cannot establish that 
they have paid taxes and social security on income from current or 
previous United States employment. Additionally, the Department of State 
may determine a G-4 dependent's employment is contrary to the interest 
of the United States when the principal alien's country of nationality 
has one or more components of an international organization or 
international organizations within its borders and does not allow the 
employment of dependents of United States citizens employed by such 
component(s) or organization(s).
    (6) Application procedures. The following procedures are applicable 
to G-1 and G-3 dependent employment applications under bilateral 
agreements and de facto arrangements, as well as to G-4 dependent 
employment applications:
    (i) The dependent must submit a completed Form I-566 to the 
Department of State through the office, mission, or organization which 
employs his or her principal alien. If the principal is assigned to or 
employed by the United Nations, the Form I-566 must be submitted to the 
U.S. Mission to the United Nations. All other applications must be 
submitted to the Office of Protocol of the Department of State. A 
dependent applying under paragraph (g)(2) (iii) or (iv) of this section 
must submit a certified statement from the post-secondary educational 
institution confirming that he or she is pursuing studies on a full-time 
basis. A dependent applying under paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section 
must submit medical certification regarding his or her condition. The 
certification should identify the dependent and the certifying physician 
and give the physician's phone number; identify the condition, describe 
the symptoms and provide a prognosis; certify that the dependent is 
unable to establish, re-establish, and maintain a home or his or her 
own. Additionally, a G-1 or G-3 dependent applying under the terms of a 
de facto arrangement or a G-4 dependent must attach a statement from the 
prospective

[[Page 261]]

employer which includes the dependent's name; a description of the 
position offered and the duties to be performed; the salary offered; and 
verification that the dependent possesses the qualifications for the 
position.
    (ii) The Department of State reviews and verifies the information 
provided, makes its determination, and endorses the Form I-566.
    (iii) If the Department of State's endorsement is favorable, the 
dependent may apply to the Service. A dependent whose principal alien is 
stationed at a post in Washington, DC, or New York City shall apply to 
the District Director, Washington, DC, or New York City, respectively. A 
dependent whose principal alien is stationed elsewhere shall apply to 
the District Director, Washington, DC, unless the Service, through the 
Department of State, directs the dependent to apply to the district 
director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. 
Directors of the regional service centers may have concurrent 
adjudicative authority for applications filed within their respective 
regions. When applying to the Service, the dependent must present his or 
her Form I-566 with a favorable endorsement from the Department of State 
and any additional documentation as may be required by the Attorney 
General.
    (7) Period of time for which employment may be authorized. If 
approved, an application to accept or continue employment under this 
section shall be granted in increments of not more than three years 
each.
    (8) No appeal. There shall be no appeal from a denial of permission 
to accept or continue employment under this section.
    (9) Dependents or family members of principal aliens classified G-2 
or G-5. A dependent or family member of a principal alien classified G-2 
or G-5 may not be employed in the United States under this section.
    (10) Unauthorized employment. An alien classified under section 
101(a)(15)(G) of the Act who is not a principal alien and who engages in 
employment outside the scope of, or in a manner contrary to this 
section, may be considered in violation of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of 
the Act. An alien who is classified under section 101(a)(15)(G) of the 
Act who is a principal alien and who engages in employment outside the 
scope of his/her official position may be considered in violation of 
section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
    (11) Special provision. As of February 16, 1990 no new employment 
authorization will be granted and no pre-existing employment 
authorization will be extended for a G-1 dependent absent an appropriate 
bilateral agreement or de facto arrangement. However, a G-1 dependent 
who has been granted employment authorization by the Department of State 
prior to the effective date of this section and who meets the definition 
of dependent under Sec. 214.2(g)(2) (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) of this part 
but is not covered by the terms of a bilateral agreement or de facto 
arrangement may be allowed to continue in employment until whichever of 
the following occurs first:
    (i) The employment authorization by the Department of State expires; 
or
    (ii) He or she no longer qualifies as a dependent as that term is 
defined in this section; or
    (iii) March 19, 1990.
    (h) Temporary employees--(1) Admission of temporary employees--(i) 
General. Under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act, an alien may be 
authorized to come to the United States temporarily to perform services 
or labor for, or to receive training from, an employer, if petitioned 
for by that employer. Under this nonimmigrant category, the alien may be 
classified as follows: under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of the Act as a 
registered nurse; under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Act as an 
alien who is coming to perform services in a specialty occupation, 
services relating to a Department of Defense (DOD) cooperative research 
and development project or coproduction project, or services as a 
fashion model who is of distinguished merit and ability; under section 
101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Act as an alien who is coming to perform 
agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature; under 
section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Act as an alien coming to perform 
other temporary services or labor; or under section 101(a)(15)(H)(iii) 
of the Act as an alien who is coming as a trainee or as

[[Page 262]]

a participant in a special education exchange visitor program. These 
classifications are called H-1A, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, and H-3, 
respectively. The employer must file a petition with the Service for 
review of the services or training and for determination of the alien's 
eligibility for classification as a temporary employee or trainee, 
before the alien may apply for a visa or seek admission to the United 
States. This paragraph sets forth the standards and procedures 
applicable to these classifications.
    (ii) Description of classifications. (A) An H-1A classification 
applies to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to 
perform services as a registered nurse, meets the requirements of 
section 212(m)(1) of the Act, and will perform services at a facility 
for which the Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the 
Attorney General that an unexpired attestation is on file and in effect 
under section 212(m)(2) of the Act. This classification expired on 
September 1, 1995, but certain aliens previously accorded H-1A 
classification are eligible to obtain and extension of stay until 
September 30, 1997, pursuant to Public Law 104-302.
    (B) An H-1B classification applies to an alien who is coming 
temporarily to the United States:
    (1) To perform services in a specialty occupation (except 
agricultural workers, and aliens described in section 101(a)(15) (O) and 
(P) of the Act) described in section 214(i)(1) of the Act, that meets 
the requirements of section 214(i)(2) of the Act, and for whom the 
Secretary of Labor has determined and certified to the Attorney General 
that the prospective employer has filed a labor condition application 
under section 212(n)(1) of the Act;
    (2) To perform services of an exceptional nature requiring 
exceptional merit and ability relating to a cooperative research and 
development project or a coproduction project provided for under a 
Government-to-Government agreement administered by the Secretary of 
Defense;
    (3) To perform services as a fashion model of distinguished merit 
and ability and for whom the Secretary of Labor has determined and 
certified to the Attorney General that the prospective employer has 
filed a labor condition application under section 212(n)(1) of the Act.
    (C) An H-2A classification applies to an alien who is coming 
temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural work of a 
temporary or seasonal nature.
    (D) An H-2B classification applies to an alien who is coming 
temporarily to the United States to perform nonagricultural work of a 
temporary or seasonal nature, if unemployed persons capable of 
performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country. This 
classification does not apply to graduates of medical schools coming to 
the United States to perform services as members of the medical 
profession. The temporary or permanent nature of the services or labor 
to be performed must be determined by the service. This classification 
requires a temporary labor certification issued by the Secretary of 
Labor or the Governor of Guam, or a notice from one of these individuals 
that such a certification cannot be made, prior to the filing of a 
petition with the Service.
    (E) An H-3 classification applies to an alien who is coming 
temporarily to the United States:
    (1) As a trainee, other than to receive graduate medical education 
or training, or training provided primarily at or by an academic or 
vocational institution, or
    (2) As a participant in a special education exchange visitor program 
which provides for practical training and experience in the education of 
children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.
    (2) Petitions--(i) Filing of petitions--(A) General. A United States 
employer seeking to classify an alien as an H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, or H-3 
temporary employee shall file a petition on Form I-129, Petition for 
Nonimmigrant Worker, only with the Service Center which has jurisdiction 
in the area where the alien will perform services, or receive training, 
even in emergent situations, except as provided in this section. 
Petitions in Guam and the Virgin Islands, and petitions involving 
special filing situations as determined by Service Headquarters, shall 
be filed with the

[[Page 263]]

local Service office or a designated Service office. The petitioner may 
submit a legible photocopy of a document in support of the visa petition 
in lieu of the original document. However, the original document shall 
be submitted if requested by the Service.
    (B) Service or training in more than one location. A petition which 
requires services to be performed or training to be received in more 
than one location must include an itinerary with the dates and locations 
of the services or training and must be filed with the Service office 
which has jurisdiction over I-129H petitions in the area where the 
petitioner is located. The address which the petitioner specifies as its 
location on the I-129H petition shall be where the petitioner is located 
for purposes of this paragraph.
    (C) Services or training for more than one employer. If the 
beneficiary will perform nonagricultural services for, or receive 
training from, more than one employer, each employer must file a 
separate petition with the Service Center that has jurisdiction over the 
area where the alien will perform services or receive training, unless 
an established agent files the petition.
    (D) Change of employers. If the alien is in the United States and 
seeks to change employers, the prospective new employer must file a 
petition on Form I-129 requesting classification and extension of the 
alien's stay in the United States. If the new petition is approved, the 
extension of stay may be granted for the validity of the approved 
petition. The validity of the petition and the alien's extension of stay 
shall conform to the limits on the alien's temporary stay that are 
prescribed in paragraph (h)(13) of this section. The alien is not 
authorized to begin the employment with the new petitioner until the 
petition is approved. An H-1A nonimmigrant alien may not change 
employers.
    (E) Amended or new petition. The petitioner shall file an amended or 
new petition, with fee, with the Service Center where the original 
petition was filed to reflect any material changes in the terms and 
conditions of employment or training or the beneficiary's eligibility as 
specified in the original approved petition. An amended or new H-1A, H-
1B, H-2A, or H-2B petition must be accompanied by a current or new 
Department of Labor determination. In the case of an H-1B petition, this 
requirement includes a new labor condition application.
    (F) Agents as petitioners. A United States agent may file a petition 
in cases involving workers who are traditionally self-employed or 
workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment on their behalf 
with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer 
authorizes the agent to act on its behalf. A United States agent may be: 
the actual employer of the beneficiary, the representative of both the 
employer and the beneficiary, or, a person or entity authorized by the 
employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as it agent. A 
petition filed by a United States agent is subject to the following 
conditions;
    (1) An agent performing the function of an employer must guarantee 
the wages and other terms and conditions of employment by contractual 
agreement with the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the petition. The 
agent/employer must also provide an itinerary of definite employment and 
information on any other services planned for the period of time 
requested.
    (2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the H 
petition involving multiple employers as the representative of both the 
employers and the beneficiary or beneficiaries if the supporting 
documentation includes a complete itinerary of services or engagements. 
The itinerary shall specify the dates of each service or engagement, the 
names and addresses of the actual employers, and the names and addresses 
of the establishment, venues, or locations where the services will be 
performed. In questionable cases, a contract between the employers and 
the beneficiary or beneficiaries may be required. The burden is on the 
agent to explain the terms and conditions of the employment and to 
provide any required documentation.
    (3) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a 
petition for an H nonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with 
all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act and 
8 CFR part 274a.

[[Page 264]]

    (ii) Multiple beneficiaries. More than one beneficiary may be 
included in an H-2A, H-2B, or H-3 petition if the beneficiaries will be 
performing the same service, or receiving the same training, for the 
same period of time, and in the same location.
    (iii) Named beneficiaries. Nonagricultural petitions must include 
the names of beneficiaries and other required information at the time of 
filing. Under the H-2B classification, exceptions may be granted in 
emergent situations involving multiple beneficiaries at the discretion 
of the director, and in special filing situations as determined by the 
Service's Headquarters. If all of the beneficiaries covered by an H-2A 
or H-2B labor certification have not been identified at the time a 
petition is filed, multiple petitions naming subsequent beneficiaries 
may be filed at different times with a copy of the same labor 
certification. Each petition must reference all previously filed 
petitions for that labor certification.
    (iv) Substitution of beneficiaries. Beneficiaries may be substituted 
in and H-2B petitions that are approved for a group, or H-2B petitions 
that are approved for unnamed beneficiaries, or approved H-2B petitions 
where the job offered to the alien(s) does not require any education, 
training, and/or experience. To request a substitution, the petitioner 
shall, by letter and a copy of the petition's approval notice, notify 
the consular office at which the alien will apply for a visa or the port 
of entry where the alien will apply for admission. Where evidence of the 
qualifications of beneficiaries is required in petitions for unnamed 
beneficiaries, the petitioner shall also submit such evidence to the 
consular office or port of entry prior to issuance of a visa or 
admission.
    (v) H-2A Petitions. Special criteria for admission, extension, and 
maintenance of status apply to H-2A petitions and are specified in 
paragraph (h)(5) of this section. The other provisions of Sec. 214.2(h) 
apply to H-2A only to the extent that they do not conflict with the 
special agricultural provisions in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
    (3) Petition for registered nurse (H-1A)--(i) General. (A) For 
purposes of H-1A classification, the term ``registered nurse'' includes 
a foreign nurse who is or will be licensed or authorized by the State 
Board of Nursing to engage in professional nurse practice in the state 
of intended employment.
    (B) A United States employer which provides health care services is 
referred to as a ``facility,'' and may file an H-1A petition for an 
alien nurse to perform the services of a registered nurse. A 
``facility'' must also meet the Department of Labor's requirements as 
defined in 29 CFR part 504.''.
    (C) The position must involve nursing practice and require licensure 
or other authorization to practice as a registered nurse from the State 
Board of Nursing in the state of intended employment.
    (D) A petition, application for change of status, or application for 
extension of stay for an H-1A nurse may be adjudicated only at the 
appropriate INS service center.
    (ii) Definition of registered nurse. For purposes of H-1A 
classification, ``registered nurse'' shall mean a person who is or will 
be authorized by a State Board of Nursing to engage in registered nurse 
practice in a state or U.S. territory or possession, and who is or will 
be practicing at a facility which provides health care services.
    (iii) Beneficiary requirements. An H-1A petition for a nurse shall 
be accompanied by evidence that the nurse:
    (A) Has obtained a full and unrestricted license to practice nursing 
in the country where the alien obtained nursing education, or has 
received nursing education in the United States or Canada;
    (B) Has passed the examination given by the Commission on Graduates 
of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS), or has obtained a full and 
unrestricted (permanent) license to practice as a registered nurse in 
the state of intended employment, or has obtained a full and 
unrestricted (permanent) license in any state or territory of the United 
States and received temporary authorization to practice as a registered 
nurse in the state of intended employment; and

[[Page 265]]

    (C) Is fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such 
temporary or interim licensing requirements which authorize the nurse to 
be employed) governing the place of intended employment to practice as a 
registered nurse immediately upon admission to the United States, and is 
authorized under such laws to be employed by the employer. For purposes 
of this paragraph, the temporary or interim licensing may be obtained 
immediately after the alien enters the United States.
    (iv) Petitioner requirements. The petitioning facility shall submit 
the following with an H-1A petition:
    (A) A current copy of the Department of Labor's (DOL) notice of 
acceptance of the filing of its attestation on Form ETA 9029,

attestation, and any attestations accepted by DOL for the duration of 
the alien's authorized period of stay,
    (C) A statement describing any limitations which the laws of the 
state or jurisdiction of intended employment place on the nurse's 
services,
    (D) A statement that notice of the filing of the petition has been 
provided by the employer to the bargaining representative of the 
registered nurses at the facility or, where there is no such bargaining 
representative, notice of the filing has been provided to registered 
nurses employed at the facility through posting in conspicuous 
locations. A copy of the notice provided shall be submitted with the 
petitions, and
    (v) Licensure requirements. (A) A nurse who is granted H-1A 
classification based on passage of the CGFNS examination must, upon 
admission to the United States, be able to obtain temporary licensure or 
other temporary authorization to practice as a registered nurse from the 
State Board of Nursing in the state of intended employment. A petition 
for such a nurse shall be approved initially for a period not to exceed 
one year.
    (B) After admission to the United States, an H-1A nurse who does not 
hold a permanent state license must take and pass the examination for 
state licensure as a registered nurse within six months from the date of 
his or her initial admission to the United States. After this six-month 
period of time, the nurse must be granted permanent state licensure in 
order to maintain his or her eligibility for H-1A classification in the 
state of employment or any other state or territory of the United 
States.
    (C) A nurse shall automatically lose his or her eligibility for H-1A 
classification if he or she is no longer performing the duties of a 
registered professional nurse. Such a nurse is not authorized to remain 
in employment unless he or she otherwise receives authorization from the 
Service.
    (D) A nurse may be granted H-1A classification based on passage of 
the CGFNS examination only until he or she has been admitted to the 
United States, and has had an opportunity to take the state licensure 
examination for registered nurses.
    (vi) Other requirements. (A) If the Secretary of Labor notifies the 
Service that a facility which employs nurses has failed to meet a 
condition in its attestation, or that there was a misrepresentation of a 
material fact in the attestation, the Service shall not approve 
petitions for or extend the stay of nurses to be employed by the 
facility for a period of one year from the date of receipt of such 
notice.
    (B) If the facility's attestation expires, or is suspended or 
invalidated by DOL, the Service will not suspend or revoke the 
facility's approved petitions for nurses, if the facility has agreed to 
comply with the terms of the attestation under which the nurses were 
admitted or subsequent attestations accepted by DOL for the duration of 
the nurses' authorized stay.
    (4) Petition for alien to perform services in a specialty 
occupation, services relating to a DOD cooperative research and 
development project or coproduction project, or services of 
distinguished merit and ability in the ield of fashion modeling (H-1B)--
(i)(A) Types of H-1B classification. An H-1B classification may be 
granted to an alien who:
    (1) Will perform services in a specialty occupation which requires 
theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized 
knowledge and attainment of a baccalaureate or

[[Page 266]]

higher degree or its equivalent as a minimum requirement for entry into 
the occupation in the United States, and who is qualified to perform 
services in the specialty occupation because he or she has attained a 
baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent in the specialty 
occupation;
    (2) Based on reciprocity, will perform services of an exceptional 
nature requiring exceptional merit and ability relating to a DOD 
cooperative research and development project or a coproduction project 
provided for under a Government-to-Government agreement administered by 
the Secretary of Defense;
    (3) Will perform services in the field of fashion modeling and who 
is of distinguished merit and ability.
    (B) General requirements for petitions involving a specialty 
occupation. (1) Before filing a petition for H-1B classification in a 
specialty occupation, the petitioner shall obtain a certification from 
the Department of Labor that it has filed a labor condition application 
in the occupational specialty in which the alien(s) will be employed.
    (2) Certification by the Department of Labor of a labor condition 
application in an occupational classification does not constitute a 
determination by that agency that the occupation in question is a 
specialty occupation. The director shall determine if the application 
involves a specialty occupation as defined in section 214(i)(1) of the 
Act. The director shall also determine whether the particular alien for 
whom H-1B classification is sought qualifies to perform services in the 
specialty occupation as prescribed in section 214(i)(2) of the Act.
    (3) If all of the beneficiaries covered by an H-1B labor condition 
application have not been identified at the time a petition is filed, 
petitions for newly identified beneficiaries may be filed at any time 
during the validity of the labor condition application using photocopies 
of the same application. Each petition must refer by file number to all 
previously approved petitions for that labor condition application.
    (4) When petitions have been approved for the total number of 
workers specified in the labor condition application, substitution of 
aliens against previously approved openings shall not be made. A new 
labor condition application shall be required.
    (5) If the Secretary of Labor notifies the Service that the 
petitioning employer has failed to meet a condition of paragraph (B) of 
section 212(n)(1) of the Act, has substantially failed to meet a 
condition of paragraphs (C) or (D) of section 212(n)(1) of the Act, has 
willfully failed to meet a condition of paragraph (A) of section 
212(n)(1) of the Act, or has misrepresented any material fact in the 
application, the Service shall not approve petitions filed with respect 
to that employer under section 204 or 214(c) of the Act for a period of 
at least one year from the date of receipt of such notice.
    (6) If the employer's labor condition application is suspended or 
invalidated by the Department of Labor, the Service will not suspend or 
revoke the employer's approved petitions for aliens already employed in 
specialty occupations if the employer has certified to the Department of 
Labor that it will comply with the terms of the labor condition 
application for the duration of the authorized stay of aliens it 
employs.
    (C) General requirements for petitions involving an alien of 
distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling. H-1B 
classification may be granted to an alien who is of distinguished merit 
and ability in the field of fashion modeling. An alien of distinguished 
merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling is one who is 
prominent in the field of fashion modeling. The alien must also be 
coming to the United States to perform services which require a fashion 
model of prominence.
    (ii) Definitions.
    Prominence means a high level of achievement in the field of fashion 
modeling evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially 
above that ordinarily encountered to the extent that a person described 
as prominent is renowned, leading, or well-known in the field of fashion 
modeling.
    Regonized authority means a person or an organization with expertise 
in a particular field, special skills or knowledge in that field, and 
the expertise to render the type of opinion requested. Such an opinion

    (2) The writer's experience giving such opinions, citing specific 
instances where past opinions have been accepted as authoritative and by 
whom;
    (3) How the conclusions were reached; and
    (4) The basis for the conclusions supported by copies or citations 
of any research material used.
    Specialty occupation means an occupation which requires theoretical 
and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in 
fields of human endeavor including, but not limited to, architecture, 
engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine 
and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, 
and the arts, and which requires the attainment of a bachelor's degree 
or higher in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for 
entry into the occupation in the United States.
    United States employer means a person, firm, corporation, 
contractor, or other association, or organization in the United States 
which:
    (1) Engages a person to work within the United States;
    (2) Has an employer-employee relationship with respect to employees 
under this part, as indicated by the fact that it may hire, pay, fire, 
supervise, or otherwise control the work of any such employee; and
    (3) Has an Internal Revenue Service Tax identification number.
    (iii) Criteria for H-1B petitions involving a specialty occupation--
(A) Standards for specialty occupation position. To qualify as a 
specialty occupation, the position must meet one of the following 
criteria:
    (1) A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally 
the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position;
    (2) The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel 
positions among similar organizations or, in the alternative, an 
employer may show that its particular position is so complex or unique 
that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree;
    (3) The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for 
the position; or
    (4) The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex 
that knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with 
the attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree.
    (B) Petitioner requirements. The petitioner shall submit the 
following with an H-1B petition involving a specialty occupation:
    (1) A certification from the Secretary of Labor that the petitioner 
has filed a labor condition application with the Secretary,
    (2) A statement that it will comply with the terms of the labor 
condition application for the duration of the alien's authorized period 
of stay,
    (3) Evidence that the alien qualifies to perform services in the 
specialty occupation as described in paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(A) of this 
section, and
    (C) Beneficiary qualifications. To qualify to perform services in a 
specialty occupation, the alien must meet one of the following criteria:
    (1) Hold a United States baccalaureate or higher degree required by 
the specialty occupation from an accredited college or university;
    (2) Hold a foreign degree determined to be equivalent to a United 
States baccalaureate or higher degree required by the specialty 
occupation from an accredited college or university;

responsible experience that is equivalent to completion of a United 
States baccalaureate or higher degree in the specialty occupation, and 
have recognition of expertise in the specialty through progressively 
responsible positions directly related to the specialty.
    (D) Equivalence to completion of a college degree. For purposes of 
paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(C)(4) of this section, equivalence to completion 
of a United States

[[Page 268]]

baccalaureate or higher degree shall mean achievement of a level of 
knowledge, competence, and practice in the specialty occupation that has 
been determined to be equal to that of an individual who has a 
baccalaureate or higher degree in the specialty and shall be determined 
by one or more of the following:
    (1) An evaluation from an official who has authority to grant 
college-level credit for training and/or experience in the specialty at 
an accredited college or university which has a program for granting 
such credit based on an individual's training and/or work experience;
    (2) The results of recognized college-level equivalency examinations 
or special credit programs, such as the College Level Examination 
Program (CLEP), or Program on Noncollegiate Sponsored Instruction 
(PONSI);
    (3) An evaluation of education by a reliable credentials evaluation 
service which specializes in evaluating foreign educational credentials;
    (4) Evidence of certification or registration from a nationally-
recognized professional association or society for the specialty that is 
known to grant certification or registration to persons in the 
occupational specialty who have achieved a certain level of competence 
in the specialty;
    (5) A determination by the Service that the equivalent of the degree 
required by the specialty occupation has been acquired through a 
combination of education, specialized training, and/or work experience 
in areas related to the specialty and that the alien has achieved 
recognition of expertise in the specialty occupation as a result of such 
training and experience. For purposes of determining equivalency to a 
baccalaureate degree in the specialty, three years of specialized 
training and/or work experience must be demonstrated for each year of 
college-level training the alien lacks. For equivalence to an advanced 
(or Masters) degree, the alien must have a baccalaureate degree followed 
by at least five years of experience in the specialty. If required by a 
specialty, the alien must hold a Doctorate degree or its foreign 
equivalent. It must be clearly demonstrated that the alien's training 
and/or work experience included the theoretical and practical 
application of specialized knowledge required by the specialty 
occupation; that the alien's experience was gained while working with 
peers, supervisors, or subordinates who have a degree or its equivalent 
in the specialty occupation; and that the alien has recognition of 
expertise in the specialty evidenced by at least one type of 
documentation such as:
    (i) Recognition of expertise in the specialty occupation by at least 
two recognized authorities in the same specialty occupation;
    (ii) Membership in a recognized foreign or United States association 
or society in the specialty occupation;
    (iii) Published material by or about the alien in professional 
publications, trade journals, books, or major newspapers;
    (iv) Licensure or registration to practice the specialty occupation 
in a foreign country; or
    (v) Achievements which a recognized authority has determined to be 
significant contributions to the field of the specialty occupation.
    (E) Liability for transportation costs. The employer will be liable 
for the reasonable costs of return transportation of the alien abroad if 
the alien is dismissed from employment by the employer before the end of 
the period of authorized admission pursuant to section 214(c)(5) of the 
Act. If the beneficiary voluntarily terminates his or her employment 
prior to the expiration of the validity of the petition, the alien has 
not been dismissed. If the beneficiary believes that the employer has 
not complied with this provision, the beneficiary shall advise the 
Service Center which adjudicated the petition in writing. The complaint 
will be retained in the file relating to the petition. Within the 
context of this paragraph, the term ``abroad'' refers to the alien's 
last place of foreign residence. This provision applies to any employer 
whose offer of employment became the basis for an alien obtaining or 
continuing H-1B status.
    (iv) General documentary requirements for H-1B classification in a 
specialty occupation. An H-1B petition involving a specialty occupation 
shall be accompanied by:

[[Page 269]]

    (A) Documentation, certifications, affidavits, declarations, 
degrees, diplomas, writings, reviews, or any other required evidence 
sufficient to establish that the beneficiary is qualified to perform 
services in a specialty occupation as described in paragraph (h)(4)(i) 
of this section and that the services the beneficiary is to perform are 
in a specialty occupation. The evidence shall conform to the following:
    (1) School records, diplomas, degrees, affidavits, declarations, 
contracts, and similar documentation submitted must reflect periods of 
attendance, courses of study, and similar pertinent data, be executed by 
the person in charge of the records of the educational or other 
institution, firm, or establishment where education or training was 
acquired.
    (2) Affidavits or declarations made under penalty of perjury 
submitted by present or former employers or recognized authorities 
certifying as to the recognition and expertise of the beneficiary shall 
specifically describe the beneficiary's recognition and ability in 
factual terms and must set forth the expertise of the affiant and the 
manner in which the affiant acquired such information.
    (B) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and 
beneficiary, or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which 
the beneficiary will be employed, if there is no written contract.
    (v) Licensure for H classification--(A) General. If an occupation 
requires a state or local license for an individual to fully perform the 
duties of the occupation, an alien (except an H-1A nurse) seeking H 
classification in that occupation must have that license prior to 
approval of the petition to be found qualified to enter the United 
States and immediately engage in employment in the occupation.
    (B) Temporary licensure. If a temporary license is available and the 
alien is allowed to perform the duties of the occupation without a 
permanent license, the director shall examine the nature of the duties, 
the level at which the duties are performed, the degree of supervision 
received, and any limitations placed on the alien. If an analysis of the 
facts demonstrates that the alien under supervision is authorized to 
fully perform the duties of the occupation, H classification may be 
granted.
    (C) Duties without licensure. In certain occupations which generally 
require licensure, a state may allow an individual to fully practice the 
occupation under the supervision of licensed senior or supervisory 
personnel in that occupation. In such cases, the director shall examine 
the nature of the duties and the level at which they are performed. If 
the facts demonstrate that the alien under supervision could fully 
perform the duties of the occupation, H classification may be granted.
    (D) H-1A nurses. For purposes of licensure, H-1A nurses must provide 
the evidence required in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (E) Limitation on approval of petition. Where licensure is required 
in any occupation, including registered nursing, the H petition may only 
be approved for a period of one year or for the period that the 
temporary license is valid, whichever is longer, unless the alien 
already has a permanent license to practice the occupation. An alien who 
is accorded H classification in an occupation which requires licensure 
may not be granted an extension of stay or accorded a new H 
classification after the one year unless he or she has obtained a 
permanent license in the state of intended employment or continues to 
hold a temporary license valid in the same state for the period of the 
requested extension.
    (vi) Criteria and documentary requirements for H-1B petitions 
involving DOD cooperative research and development projects or 
coproduction projects--(A) General. (1) For purposes of H-1B 
classification, services of an exceptional nature relating to DOD 
cooperative research and development projects or coproduction projects 
shall be those services which require a baccalaureate or higher degree, 
or its equivalent, to perform the duties. The existence of this special 
program does not preclude the DOD from utilizing the regular H-1B 
provisions provided the required guidelines are met.
    (2) The requirements relating to a labor condition application from 
the Department of Labor shall not apply to petitions involving DOD 
cooperative

[[Page 270]]

research and development projects or coproduction projects.
    (B) Petitioner requirements. (1) The petition must be accompanied by 
a verification letter from the DOD project manager for the particular 
project stating that the alien will be working on a cooperative research 
and development project or a coproduction project under a reciprocal 
Government-to-Government agreement administered by DOD. Details about 
the specific project are not required.
    (2) The petitioner shall provide a general description of the 
alien's duties on the particular project and indicate the actual dates 
of the alien's employment on the project.
    (3) The petitioner shall submit a statement indicating the names of 
aliens currently employed on the project in the United States and their 
dates of employment. The petitioner shall also indicate the names of 
aliens whose employment on the project ended within the past year.
    (C) Beneficiary requirement. The petition shall be accompanied by 
evidence that the beneficiary has a baccalaureate or higher degree or 
its equivalent in the occupational field in which he or she will be 
performing services in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(C) and/or 
(h)(4)(iii)(D) of this section.
    (vii) Criteria and documentary requirements for H-1B petitions for 
aliens of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion 
modeling--(A) General. Prominence in the field of fashion modeling may 
be established in the case of an individual fashion model. The work 
which a prominent alien is coming to perform in the United States must 
require the services of a prominent alien. A petition for an H-1B alien 
of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling 
shall be accompanied by:
    (1) Documentation, certifications, affidavits, writings, reviews, or 
any other required evidence sufficient to establish that the beneficiary 
is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability. Affidavits 
submitted by present or former employers or recognized experts 
certifying to the recognition and distinguished ability of the 
beneficiary shall specifically describe the beneficiary's recognition 
and ability in factual terms and must set forth the expertise of the 
affiant and the manner in which the affiant acquired such information.
    (2) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and 
beneficiary, or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which 
the beneficiary will be employed, if there is no written contract.
    (B) Petitioner's requirements. To establish that a position requires 
prominence, the petitioner must establish that the position meets one of 
the following criteria:
    (1) The services to be performed involve events or productions which 
have a distinguished reputation;
    (2) The services are to be performed for an organization or 
establishment that has a distinguished reputation for, or record of, 
employing prominent persons.
    (C) Beneficiary's requirements. A petitioner may establish that a 
beneficiary is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability by the 
submission of two of the following forms of documentation showing that 
the alien:
    (1) Has achieved national or international recognition and acclaim 
for outstanding achievement in his or her field as evidenced by reviews 
in major newspapers, trade journals, magazines, or other published 
material;
    (2) Has performed and will perform services as a fashion model for 
employers with a distinguished reputation;
    (3) Has received recognition for significant achievements from 
organizations, critics, fashion houses, modeling agencies, or other 
recognized experts in the field; or
    (4) Commands a high salary or other substantial remuneration for 
services evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence.
    (viii) Criteria and documentary requirements for H-1B petitions for 
physicians--(A) Beneficiary's requirements. An H-1B petition for a 
physician shall be accompanied by evidence that the physician:
    (1) Has a license or other authorization required by the state of 
intended employment to practice medicine, or is exempt by law therefrom, 
if the physician will perform direct patient care and the state requires 
the license or authorization, and

[[Page 271]]

    (2) Has a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in a 
foreign state or has graduated from a medical school in the United 
States or in a foreign state.
    (B) Petitioner's requirements. The petitioner must establish that 
the alien physician:
    (1) Is coming to the United States primarily to teach or conduct 
research, or both, at or for a public or nonprofit private educational 
or research institution or agency, and that no patient care will be 
performed, except that which is incidental to the physician's teaching 
or research; or
    (2) The alien has passed the Federation Licensing Examination (or an 
equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services) or is a graduate of a United States medical school; and
    (i) Has competency in oral and written English which shall be 
demonstrated by the passage of the English language proficiency test 
given by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates; or
    (ii) Is a graduate of a school of medicine accredited by a body or 
bodies approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Education.
    (C) Exception for physicians of national or international renown. A 
physician who is a graduate of a medical school in a foreign state and 
who is of national or international renown in the field of medicine is 
exempt from the requirements of paragraph (h)(4)(viii)(B) of this 
section.
    (5) Petition for alien to perform agricultural labor or services of 
a temporary or seasonal nature (H-2A)--(i) Filing a petition--(A) 
General. An H-2A petition must be filed on Form I-129. The petition must 
be filed with a single valid temporary agricultural labor certification. 
However, if a certification is denied, domestic labor subsequently fails 
to appear at the worksite, and the Department of Labor denies an appeal 
under section 216(e)(2) of the Act, the written denial of appeal shall 
be considered a certification for this purpose if filed with evidence 
which establishes that qualified domestic labor is unavailable. An H-2A 
petition may be filed by either the employer listed on the 
certification, the employer's agent, or the association of United States 
agricultural producers named as a joint employer on the certification.
    (B) Multiple beneficiaries. The total number of beneficiaries of a 
petition or series of petitions based on the same certification may not 
exceed the number of workers indicated on that document. A single 
petition can include more than one beneficiary if the total number does 
not exceed the number of positions indicated on the relating 
certification, and all beneficiaries will obtain a visa at the same 
consulate or are not required to have a visa and will apply for 
admission at the same port of entry.
    (C) Unnamed beneficiaries. The sole beneficiary of an H-2A petition 
must be named in the petition. In a petition for multiple beneficiaries, 
each must be named unless he or she is not named in the certification 
and is outside the United States. Unnamed beneficiaries must be shown on 
the petition by total number.
    (D) Evidence. An H-2A petitioner must show that the proposed 
employment qualifies as a basis for H-2A status, and that any named 
beneficiary qualifies for that employment. A petition will be 
automatically denied if filed without the certification evidence 
required in paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section and, for each named 
beneficiary, the initial evidence required in paragraph (h)(5)(v) of 
this section.
    (E) Special filing requirements. Where a certification shows joint 
employers, a petition must be filed with an attachment showing that each 
employer has agreed to the conditions of H-2A eligibility. A petition 
filed by an agent must be filed with an attachment in which the employer 
has authorized the agent to act on its behalf, has assumed full 
responsibility for all representations made by the agent on its behalf, 
and has agreed to the conditions of H-2A eligibility.
    (ii) Effect of the labor certification process. The temporary 
agricultural labor certification process determines whether employment 
is as an agricultural worker, whether it is open to U.S. workers, if 
qualified U.S. workers are available, the adverse impact of employment 
of a qualified alien, and

[[Page 272]]

whether employment conditions, including housing, meet applicable 
requirements. In petition proceedings a petitioner must establish that 
the employment and beneficiary meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(5) 
of this section. In a petition filed with a certification denial, the 
petitioner must also overcome the Department of Labor's findings 
regarding the availability of qualified domestic labor.
    (iii) Ability and intent to meet a job offer--(A) Eligibility 
requirements. An H-2A petitioner must establish that each beneficiary 
will be employed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
certification, which includes that the principal duties to be performed 
are those on the certification, with other duties minor and incidental.
    (B) Intent and prior compliance. Requisite intent cannot be 
established for two years after an employer or joint employer, or a 
parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, is found to have violated 
section 274(a) of the Act or to have employed an H-2A worker in a 
position other than that described in the relating petition.
    (C) Initial evidence. Representations required for the purpose of 
labor certification are initial evidence of intent.
    (iv) Temporary and seasonal employment--(A) Eligibility 
requirements. An H-2A petitioner must establish that the employment 
proposed in the certification is of a temporary or seasonal nature. 
Employment is of a seasonal nature where it is tied to a certain time of 
year by an event or pattern, such as a short annual growing cycle or a 
specific aspect of a longer cycle, and requires labor levels far above 
those necessary for ongoing operations. Employment is of a temporary 
nature where the employer's need to fill the position with a temporary 
worker will, except in extraordinary circumstances, last no longer than 
one year.
    (B) Effect of Department of Labor findings. In temporary 
agricultural labor certification proceedings the Department of Labor 
separately tests whether employment qualifies as temporary or seasonal. 
Its finding that employment qualifies is normally sufficient for the 
purpose of an H-2A petition, However, notwithstanding that finding, 
employment will be found not to be temporary or seasonal where an 
application for permanent labor certification has been filed for the 
same alien, or for another alien to be employed in the same position, by 
the same employer or by its parent, subsidiary or affiliate. This can 
only be overcome by the petitioner's demonstration that there will be at 
least a six month interruption of employment in the United States after 
H-2A status ends. Also, eligibility will not be found, notwithstanding 
the issuance of a temporary agricultural labor certification, where 
there is substantial evidence that the employment is not temporary or 
seasonal.
    (v) The beneficiary's qualifications--(A) Eligibility requirements. 
An H-2A petitioner must establish that any named beneficiary met the 
stated minimum requirements and was fully able to perform the stated 
duties when the application for certification was filed. It must be 
established at time of application for an H-2A visa, or for admission if 
a visa is not required, that any unnamed beneficiary either met these 
requirements when the certification was applied for or passed any 
certified aptitude test at any time prior to visa issuance, or prior to 
admission if a visa is not required.
    (B) Initial evidence of employment/job training. A petition must be 
filed with evidence that at the required time the beneficiary met the 
certification's minimum employment and job training requirements. 
Initial evidence must be in the form of the past employer's detailed 
statement or actual employment documents, such as company payroll or tax 
records. Alternately, a petitioner must show that such evidence cannot 
be obtained, and submit affidavits from people who worked with the 
beneficiary that demonstrate the claimed employment.
    (C) Initial evidence of education and other training. A petition 
must be filed with evidence that at the required time each beneficiary 
met the certification's minimum post-secondary education and other 
formal training requirements. Initial evidence must be in the form of 
documents, issued by the relevant institution or organization, that show 
periods of attendance, majors and degrees or certificates accorded.

[[Page 273]]

    (vi) Petition agreements--(A) Consent and liabilities. In filing an 
H-2A petition, a petitioner and each employer consents to allow access 
to the site where the labor is being performed for the purpose of 
determining compliance with H-2A requirements. The petitioner further 
agrees to notify the Service in the manner specified within twenty-four 
hours if an H-2A worker absconds or if the authorized employment ends 
more than five days before the relating certification document expires, 
and to pay liquidated damages of ten dollars for each instance where it 
cannot demonstrate compliance with this notification requirement. The 
petitioner also agrees to pay liquidated damages of two hundred dollars 
for each instance where is cannot demonstrate that its H-2A worker 
either departed the United States or obtained authorized status based on 
another petition during the period of admission or within five days of 
early termination, whichever comes first.
    (B) Process. Where evidence indicates noncompliance under paragraph 
(h)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, the petitioner shall be given written 
notice and given ten days to reply. If it does not demonstrate 
compliance, it shall be given written notice of the assessment of 
liquidated damages.
    (C) Failure to pay liquidated damages. If liquidated damages are not 
paid within ten days of assessment, an H-2A petition may not be 
processed for that petitioner or any joint employer shown on the 
petition until such damages are paid.
    (vii) Validity. An approved H-2A petition is valid through the 
expiration of the relating certification for the purpose of allowing a 
beneficiary to seek issuance of an H-2A nonimmigrant visa, admission or 
an extension of stay for the purpose of engaging in the specific 
certified employment.
    (viii) Admission--(A) Effect of violation of status. An alien may 
not be accorded H-2A status who the Service finds to have violated the 
conditions of H-2A status within the prior five years. H-2A status is 
violated by remaining beyond the specific period of authorized stay or 
by engaging in unauthorized employment.
    (B) Period of admission. Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(13) of this 
section, and except as provided in paragraph (h)(5)(ix)(C) of this 
section, an alien admissible as an H-2A shall be admitted for the period 
of the approved petition plus a period of up to one week before the 
beginning of the approved period for the purpose of travel to the 
worksite, and a period following the expiration of the H-2A petition 
equal to the validity period of the petition, but not more than ten 
days, for the purpose of departure or extension based on a subsequent 
offer of employment. However, this extended admission period does not 
affect the beneficiary's employment authorization. Such authorization 
only applies to the specific employment indicated in the relating 
petition, for the specific period of time indicated.
    (C) Limits on an individual's stay. An alien's stay as an H-2A is 
limited by the term of an approved petition. An alien may remain longer 
to engage in other qualifying temporary agricultural employment by 
obtaining an extension of stay. However, an individual who has held H-2A 
status for a total of three years may not again be granted H-2A status, 
or other nonimmigrant status based on agricultural activities, until 
such time as he or she remains outside the United States for an 
uninterrupted period of six months. An absence can interrupt the 
accumulation of time spent as an H-2A. If the accumulated stay is 
eighteen months or less, an absence is interruptive if it lasts for at 
least three months. If more than eighteen months stay has been 
accumulated, an absence is interruptive if it lasts for at least one-
sixth the accumulated stay. Eligibility under this subparagraph will be 
determined in admission, change of status or extension proceedings. An 
alien found eligible for a shorter period of H-2A status than that 
indicated by the petition due to the application of this subparagraph 
shall only be admitted for that abbreviated period.
    (ix) Substitution of beneficiaries after admission. An H-2A petition 
may be filed to replace H-2A workers whose employment was terminated 
early. The petition must be filed with a copy of the certification 
document, a copy of

[[Page 274]]

the approval notice covering the workers for which replacements are 
sought, and other evidence required by paragraph (h)(5)(i)(D) of this 
section. It must also be filed with a statement giving each terminated 
worker's name, date and country of birth, termination date, and evidence 
the worker has departed the United States. A petition for a replacement 
may not be approved where the requirements of paragraph (h)(5)(vi) of 
this section have not been met. A petition for replacements does not 
constitute the notice that an H-2A worker has absconded or has ended 
authorized employment more than five days before the relating 
certification expires.
    (x) Extensions without labor certification. A single H-2A petition 
may be extended without a certification if it is based on approval of 
the alien's application for extension of stay for a continuation of the 
employment authorized by the approval of a previous H-2A petition filed 
with a certification (but not a certification extension granted under 20 
CFR 655.106(c)(3)), and the proposed continuation of employment will 
last no longer than the previously authorized employment and also will 
not last longer than two weeks.
    (6) Petition for alien to perform temporary nonagricultural services 
or labor (H-2B)--(i) General. An H-2B nonagricultural temporary worker 
is an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform 
temporary services or labor, is not displacing United States workers 
capable of performing such services or labor, and whose employment is 
not adversely affecting the wages and working conditions of United 
States workers.
    (ii) Temporary services or labor--(A) Definition. Temporary services 
or labor under the H-2B classification refers to any job in which the 
petitioner's need for the duties to be performed by the employee(s) is 
temporary, whether or not the underlying job can be described as 
permanent or temporary.
    (B) Nature of petitioner's need. As a general rule, the period of 
the petitioner's need must be a year or less, although there may be 
extraordinary circumstances where the temporary services or labor might 
last longer than one year. The petitioner's need for the services or 
labor shall be a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, a peakload need, 
or an intermittent need:
    (1) One-time occurence. The petitioner must establish that it has 
not employed workers to perform the services or labor in the past and 
that it will not need workers to perform the services or labor in the 
future, or that it has an employment situation that is otherwise 
permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created the need 
for a temporary worker.
    (2) Seasonal need. The petitioner must establish that the services 
or labor is traditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or 
pattern and is of a recurring nature. The petitioner shall specify the 
period(s) of time during each year in which it does not need the 
services or labor. The employment is not seasonal if the period during 
which the services or labor is not needed is unpredictable or subject to 
change or is considered a vacation period for the petitioner's permanent 
employees.
    (3) Peakload need. The petitoner must establish that it regularly 
employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place 
of employment and that it needs to supplement its permanent staff at the 
place of employment on a temporary basis due to a seasonal or short-term 
demand and that the temporary additions to staff will not become a part 
of the petitioner's regular operation.
    (4) Intermittent need. The petitioner must establish that it has not 
employed permanent or full-time workers to perform the services or 
labor, but occasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to 
perform services or labor for short periods.
    (iii) Procedures. (A) Prior to filing a petition with the director 
to classify an alien as an H-2B worker, the petitioner shall apply for a 
temporary labor certification with the Secretary of Labor for all areas 
of the United States, except the Territory of Guam. In the Territory of 
Guam, the petitioning employer shall apply for a temporary labor 
certification with the Governor of Guam. The labor certification shall 
be advice to the director on whether or not United States workers 
capable of performing the temporary services or labor are available

[[Page 275]]

and whether or not the alien's employment will adversely affect the 
wages and working conditions of similarly employed United States 
workers.
    (B) An H-2B petitioner shall be a United States employer, a United 
States agent, or a foreign employer filing through a United States 
agent. For purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, a foreign employer 
is any employer who is not amendable to service of process in the United 
States. A foreign employer may not directly petition for an H-2B 
nonimmigrant but must use the services of a United States agent to file 
a petition for an H-2B nonimmigrant. A United States agent petitioning 
on behalf of a foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, 
and to accept service of process in the United States in proceedings 
under section 274A of the Act, on behalf of the employer. The 
petitioning employer shall consider available United States workers for 
the temporary services or labor, and shall offer terms and conditions of 
employment which are consistent with the nature of the occupation, 
activity, and industry in the United States.
    (C) The petitioner may not file an H-2B petition unless the United 
States petitioner has applied for a labor certification with the 
Secretary of Labor or the Governor of Guam within the time limits 
prescribed or accepted by each, and has obtained a labor certification 
determination as required by paragraph (h)(6)(iv) or (h)(6)(v) of this 
section.
    (D) The Secretary of Labor and the Governor of Guam shall separately 
establish procedures for administering the temporary labor certification 
program under his or her jurisdiction.
    (E) After obtaining a determination from the Secretary of Labor or 
the Governor of Guam, as appropriate, the petitioner shall file a 
petition on I-129, accompanied by the labor certification determination 
and supporting documents, with the director having jurisdiction in the 
area of intended employment.
    (iv) Labor certifications, except Guam--(A) Secretary of Labor's 
determination. An H-2B petition for temporary employment in the United 
States, except for temporary employment on Guam, shall be accompanied by 
a labor certification determination that is either:
    (1) A certification from the Secretary of Labor stating that 
qualified workers in the United States are not available and that the 
alien's employment will not adversely affect wages and working 
conditions of similary employed United States workers; or
    (2) A notice detailing the reasons why such certification cannot be 
made. Such notice shall address the availability of U.S. workers in the 
occupation and the prevailing wages and working conditions of U.S. 
workers in the occupation.
    (B) Validity of the labor certification. The Secretary of Labor may 
issue a temporary labor certification for a period of up to one year.
    (C) U.S. Virgin Islands. Temporary labor certifications filed under 
section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the Act for employment in the United 
States Virgin Islands may be approved only for entertainers and athletes 
and only for periods not to exceed 45 days.
    (D) Attachment to petition. If the petitioner receives a notice from 
the Secretary of Labor that certification cannot be made, a petition 
containing countervailing evidence may be filed with the director. The 
evidence must show that qualified workers in the United States are not 
available, and that the terms and conditions of employment are 
consistent with the nature of the occupation, activity, and industry in 
the United States. All such evidence submitted will be considered in 
adjudicating the petition.
    (E) Countervailing evidence. The countervailing evidence presented 
by the petitioner shall be in writing and shall address availability of 
U.S. workers, the prevailing wage rate for the occupation of the United 
States, and each of the reasons why the Secretary of Labor could not 
grant a labor certification. The petitioner may also submit other 
appropriate information in support of the petition. The director, at his 
or her discretion, may require additional supporting evidence.
    (v) Labor certification for Guam--(A) Governor of Guam's 
determination. An H-2B petition for temporary employment on Guam shall 
be accompanied by a

[[Page 276]]

labor certification determination that is either:
    (1) A certification from the Governor of Guam stating that qualified 
workers in the United States are not available to perform the required 
services, and that the alien's employment will not adversely affect the 
wages and working conditions of United States resident workers who are 
similarly employed on Guam; or
    (2) A notice detailing the reasons why such certification cannot be 
made. Such notice shall address the availability of U.S. workers in the 
occupation and/or the prevailing wages and working conditions of U.S. 
workers in the occupation.
    (B) Validity of labor certification. The Governor of Guam may issue 
a temporary labor certification for a period up to one year.
    (C) Attachments to petition. If the employer receives a notice from 
the Governor of Guam that certification cannot be made, a petition 
containing countervailing evidence may be filed with the director. The 
evidence must show that qualified workers in the United States are not 
available, and that the terms and conditions of employment are 
consistent with the nature of the occupation, activity, and industry in 
the United States. All such evidence submitted will be considered in 
adjudicating the petition.
    (D) Countervailing evidence. The countervailing evidence presented 
by the petitioner shall be in writing and shall address availability of 
United States workers, the prevailing wage rate, and each of the reasons 
why the Governor of Guam could not make the required certification. The 
petitioner may also provide any other appropriate information in support 
of the petition. The director, at his or her discretion, may require 
additional supporting evidence.
    (E) Criteria for Guam labor certifications. The Governor of Guam 
shall, in consultation with the Service, establish systematic methods 
for determining the prevailing wage rates and working conditions for 
individual occupations on Guam and for making determinations as to 
availability of qualified United States residents.
    (1) Prevailing wage and working conditions. The system to determine 
wages and working conditions must provide for consideration of wage 
rates and employment conditions for occupations in both the private and 
public sectors, in Guam and/or in the United States (as defined in 
section 101(a)(38) of the Act), and may not consider wages and working 
conditions outside of the United States. If the system includes 
utilitzation of advisory opinions and consultations, the opinions must 
be provided by officially sanctioned groups which reflect a balance of 
the interests of the private and public sectors, government, unions and 
management.
    (2) Availability of United States workers. The system for 
determining availability of qualified United States workers must require 
the prospective employer to:
    (i) Advertise the availability of the position for a minimum of 
three consecutive days in the newspaper with the largest daily 
circulation on Guam;
    (ii) Place a job offer with an appropriate agency of the Territorial 
Government which operates as a job referral service at least 30 days in 
advance of the need for the services to commence, except that for 
applications from the armed forces of the United States and those in the 
entertainment industry, the 30-day period may be reduced by the Governor 
to 10 days;
    (iii) Conduct appropriate recruitment in other areas of the United 
and its territories if sufficient qualified United States construction 
workers are not available on Guam to fill a job. The Governor of Guam 
may require a job order to be placed more than 30 days in advance of 
need to accommodate such recruitment;
    (iv) Report to the appropriate agency the names of all United States 
resident workers who applied for the position, indicating those hired 
and the job-related reasons for not hiring;
    (v) Offer all special considerations, such as housing and 
transportation expenses, to all United States resident workers who 
applied for the position, indicating those hired and the job-related 
reasons for not hiring;
    (vi) Meet the prevailing wage rates and working conditions 
determined under the wages and working conditions system by the 
Governor; and

[[Page 277]]

    (vii) Agree to meet all Federal and Territorial requirements 
relating to employment, such as nondiscrimination, occupational safety, 
and minimum wage requirements.
    (F) Approval and publication of employment systems on Guam--(1) 
Systems. The Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization must approve 
the system to determine prevailing wages and working conditions and the 
system to determine availability of United States resident workers and 
any future modifications of the systems prior to implementation. If the 
Commissioner, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, finds that 
the systems or modified systems meet the requirements of this section, 
the Commissioner shall publish them as a notice in the Federal Register 
and the Governor shall publish them as a public record in Guam.
    (2) Approval of construction wage rates. The Commissioner must 
approve specific wage data and rates used for construction occupations 
on Guam prior to implementation of new rates. The Governor shall submit 
new wage survey data and proposed rates to the Commissioner for approval 
at least eight weeks before authority to use existing rates expires. 
Surveys shall be conducted at least every two years, unless the 
Commissioner prescribes a lesser period.
    (G) Reporting. The Governor shall provide the Commissioner 
statistical data on temporary labor certification workload and 
determinations. This information shall be submitted quarterly no later 
than 30 days after the quarter ends.
    (H) Invalidation of temporary labor certification issued by the 
Governor of Guam--(1) General. A temporary labor certification issued by 
the Governor of Guam may be invalidated by a director if it is 
determined by the director or a court of law that the certification 
request involved fraud or willful misrepresentation. A temporary labor 
certification may also be invalidated if the director determines that 
the certification involved gross error.
    (2) Notice of intent to invalidate. If the director intends to 
invalidate a temporary labor certification, a notice of intent shall be 
served upon the employer, detailing the reasons for the intended 
invalidation. The employer shall have 30 days in which to file a written 
response in rebuttal to the notice of intent. The director shall 
consider all evidence submitted upon rebuttal in reaching a decision.
    (3) Appeal of invalidation. An employer may appeal the invalidation 
of a temporary labor certification in accordance with part 103 of this 
chapter.
    (vi) Evidence for H-2B petitions. An H-2B petition shall be 
accompanied by:
    (A) Labor certification or notice. A temporary labor certification 
or a notice that certification cannot be made, issued by the Secretary 
of Labor or the Governor of Guam, as appropriate;
    (B) Countervailing evidence. Evidence to rebut the Secretary of 
Labor's or the Governor of Guam's notice that certification cannot be 
made, if appropriate;
    (C) Alien's qualifications. Documentation that the alien qualifies 
for the job offer as specified in the application for labor 
certification, except in petitions where the labor certification 
application requires no education, training, experience, or special 
requirements of the beneficiary; and
    (D) Statement of need. A statement describing in detail the 
temporary situation or conditions which make it necessary to bring the 
alien to the United States and whether the need is a one-time 
occurrence, seasonal, peakload, or intermittent. If the need is 
seasonal, peakload, or intermittent, the statement shall indicate 
whether the situation or conditions are expected to be recurrent.
    (E) Liability for transportation costs. The employer will be liable 
for the reasonable costs of return transportation of the alien abroad, 
if the alien is dismissed from employment for any reason by the employer 
before the end of the period of authorized admission pursuant to section 
214(c)(5) of the Act. If the beneficiary voluntarily terminates his or 
her employment prior to the expiration of the validity of the petition, 
the alien has not been dismissed. If the beneficiary believes that the 
employer has not complied with this provision, the beneficiary shall 
advise the Service Center which adjudicated the petition

[[Page 278]]

in writing. The complaint will be retained in the file relating to the 
petition. Within the context of this paragraph, the term ``abroad'' 
means the alien's last place of foreign residence. This provision 
applies to any employer whose offer of employment became the basis for 
the alien obtaining or continuing H-2B status.
    (vii) Traded professional H-2B athletes. In the case of a 
professional H-2B athlete who is traded from one organization or another 
organization, employment authorization for the player will automatically 
continue for a period of 30 days after the player's acquisition by the 
new organization, within which time the new organization is expected to 
file a new Form I-129 for H-2B nonimmigrant classification. If a new 
Form I-129 is not filed within 30 days, employment authorization will 
cease. If a new Form I-129 is filed within 30 days, the professional 
athlete shall be deemed to be in valid H-2B status, and employment shall 
continue to be authorized, until the petition is adjudicated. If the new 
petition is denied, employment authorization will cease.
    (7) Petition for alien trainee or participant in a special education 
exchange visitor program (H-3)--(i) Alien trainee. The H-3 trainee is a 
nonimmigrant who seeks to enter the United States at the invitation of 
an organization or individual for the purpose of receiving training in 
any field of endeavor, such as agriculture, commerce, communications, 
finance, government, transportation, or the professions, as well as 
training in a purely industrial establishment. This category shall not 
apply to physicians, who are statutorily ineligible to use H-3 
classification in order to receive any type of graduate medical 
education or training.
    (A) Externs. A hospital approved by the American Medical Association 
or the American Osteopathic Association for either an internship or 
residency program may petition to classify as an H-3 trainee a medical 
student attending a medical school abroad, if the alien will engage in 
employment as an extern during his/her medical school vacation.
    (B) Nurses. A petitioner may seek H-3 classification for a nurse who 
is not H-1 if it can be established that there is a genuine need for the 
nurse to receive a brief period of training that is unavailable in the 
alien's native country and such training is designed to benefit the 
nurse and the overseas employer upon the nurse's return to the country 
of origin, if:
    (1) The beneficiary has obtained a full and unrestricted license to 
practice professional nursing in the country where the beneficiary 
obtained a nursing education, or such education was obtained in the 
United States or Canada; and
    (2) The petitioner provides a statement certifying that the 
beneficiary is fully qualified under the laws governing the place where 
the training will be received to engage in such training, and that under 
those laws the petitioner is authorized to give the beneficiary the 
desired training.
    (ii) Evidence required for petition involving alien trainee--(A) 
Conditions. The petitioner is required to demonstrate that:
    (1) The proposed training is not available in the alien's own 
country;
    (2) The beneficiary will not be placed in a position which is in the 
normal operation of the business and in which citizens and resident 
workers are regularly employed;
    (3) The beneficiary will not engage in productive employment unless 
such employment is incidental and necessary to the training; and
    (4) The training will benefit the beneficiary in pursuing a career 
outside the United States.
    (B) Description of training program. Each petition for a trainee 
must include a statement which:
    (1) Describes the type of training and supervision to be given, and 
the structure of the training program;
    (2) Sets forth the proportion of time that will be devoted to 
productive employment;
    (3) Shows the number of hours that will be spent, respectively, in 
classroom instruction and in on-the-job training;
    (4) Describes the career abroad for which the training will prepare 
the alien;
    (5) Indicates the reasons why such training cannot be obtained in 
the alien's country and why it is necessary

[[Page 279]]

for the alien to be trained in the United States; and
    (6) Indicates the source of any remuneration received by the trainee 
and any benefit which will accrue to the petitioner for providing the 
training.
    (iii) Restrictions on training program for alien trainee. A training 
program may not be approved which:
    (A) Deals in generalities with no fixed schedule, objectives, or 
means of evaluation;
    (B) Is incompatible with the nature of the petitioner's business or 
enterprise;
    (C) Is on behalf of a beneficiary who already possesses substantial 
training and expertise in the proposed field of training;
    (D) Is in a field in which it is unlikely that the knowledge or 
skill will be used outside the United States;
    (E) Will result in productive employment beyond that which is 
incidental and necessary to the training;
    (F) Is designed to recruit and train aliens for the ultimate 
staffing of domestic operations in the United States;
    (G) Does not establish that the petitioner has the physical plant 
and sufficiently trained manpower to provide the training specified; or
    (H) Is designed to extend the total allowable period of practical 
training previously authorized a nonimmigrant student.
    (iv) Petition for participant in a special education exchange 
visitor program--(A) General Requirements. (1) The H-3 participant in a 
special education training program must be coming to the United States 
to participate in a structured program which provides for practical 
training and experience in the education of children with physical, 
mental, or emotional disabilities.
    (2) The petition must be filed by a facility which has 
professionally trained staff and a structured program for providing 
education to children with disabilities, and for providing training and 
hands-on experience to participants in the special education exchange 
visitor program.
    (3) The requirements in this section for alien trainees shall not 
apply to petitions for participants in a special education exchange 
visitor program.
    (B) Evidence. An H-3 petition for a participant in a special 
education exchange visitor program shall be accompanied by:
    (1) A description of the training program and the facility's 
professional staff and details of the alien's participation in the 
training program (any custodial care of children must be incidental to 
the training), and
    (2) Evidence that the alien participant is nearing completion of a 
baccalaureate or higher degree in special education, or already holds 
such a degree, or has extensive prior training and experience in 
teaching children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.
    (8) Numerical limits--(i) Limits on affected categories. During each 
fiscal year, the total number of aliens who can be provided nonimmigrant 
classification is limited as follows:
    (A) Aliens classified as H-1B nonimmigrants, excluding those

    (13) Admission--(i) General. (A) A beneficiary shall be admitted to 
the United States for the validity period of the petition, plus a period 
of up to 10 days before the validity period begins and 10 days after the 
validity period ends. The beneficiary may not work except during the 
validity period of the petition.
    (B) When an alien in an H classification has spent the maximum 
allowable period of stay in the United States, a new petition under 
sections 101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act may not be approved unless 
that alien has resided and been physically present outside the United 
States, except for brief trips for business or pleasure, for the time 
limit imposed on the particular H classification. Brief trips to the 
United States for business or pleasure during the required time abroad 
are not interruptive, but do not count towards fulfillment of the

alien's employment, place of residence, and the dates and purposes of 
any trips to the United States during the period that the alien was 
required to spend time abroad.
    (ii) H-1A limitation on admission. An alien who was previously

this subsection, and H-1A alien who has spent 5 years in the United 
States under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act may not change status, or

occupation or an alien of distinguished merit and ability in the field 
of fashion modeling. An H-1B alien in a specialty occupation or an alien 
of distinguished merit and ability who has spent six years in the United 
States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act may not seek 
extension, change status, or be readmitted to the United States under

and been physically present outside the United States, except for brief 
trips for business or pleasure, for the immediate prior year.
    (B) Alien involved in a DOD research and development or coproduction 
project. An H-1B alien involved in a DOD research and development or 
coproduction project who has spent 10 years in the United States under 
section 101(a)(15) (H) and/or (L) of the Act may not seek extension, 
change status, or be readmitted to the United States under section 
101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act to perform services involving a DOD 
research and development project or coproduction project. A new petition 
or change of status under section 101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act may 
not be approved for such an alien unless

[[Page 283]]

the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United 
States, except for brief trips for business or pleasure, for the 
immediate prior year.
    (iv) H-2B and H-3 limitation on admission. An H-2B alien who has 
spent 3 years in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or 
(L) of the Act; an H-3 alien participant in a special education program 
who has spent 18 months in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) 
and/or (L) of the Act; and an H-3 alien trainee who has spent 24 months 
in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act 
may not seek extension, change status, or be readmitted to the United 
States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act unless the 
alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States 
for the immediate prior 6 months.
    (v) Exceptions. The limitations in paragraph (h)(13)(ii) through 
(h)(13)(iv) of this section shall not apply to H-1A, H-1B, H-2B, and H-3 
aliens who did not reside continually in the United States and whose 
employment in the United States was seasonal or intermittent or was for 
an aggregate of six months or less per year. In addition, the 
limitations shall not apply to aliens who reside abroad and regularly 
commute to the United States to engage in part-time employment. To 
qualify for this exception, the petitioner and the alien must provide 
clear and convincing proof that the alien qualifies for such an 
exception. Such proof shall consist of evidence such as arrival and 
departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment 
abroad.
    (14) Extension of visa petition validity. The petitioner shall file 
a request for a petition extension on Form I-129 to extend the validity 
of the original petition under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act. 
Supporting evidence is not required unless requested by the director. A 
request for a petition extension may be filed only if the validity of 
the original petition has not expired.
    (15) Extension of stay--(i) General. The petitioner shall apply for 
extension of an alien's stay in the United States by filing a petition 
extension on Form I-129 accompanied by the documents described for the 
particular classification in paragraph (h)(15)(ii) of this section. The 
petitioner must also request a petition extension. The dates of 
extension shall be the same for the petition and the beneficiary's 
extension of stay. The beneficiary must be physically present in the 
United States at the time of the filing of the extension of stay. Even 
though the requests to extend the petition and the alien's stay are 
combined on the petition, the director shall make a separate 
determination on each. If the alien is required to leave the United 
States for business or personal reasons while the extension requests are 
pending, the petitioner may request the director to cable notification 
of approval of the petition extension to the consular office abroad 
where the alien will apply for a visa. When the total period of stay in 
an H classification has been reached, no further extensions may be 
granted.
    (ii) Extension periods--(A) H-1A extension of stay. An alien who 
previously entered the United States pursuant to an H-1A visa may 
receive an extension of H-1A temporary stay until September 30, 1997, 
provided that the alien was within the United States in valid H-1A 
classification on or after September 1, 1995, regardless of whether the 
alien continued to work as a registered nurse after September 1, 1995; 
that the alien's period of H-1A temporary stay has expired or would 
expire before September 30, 1997; and, if the alien was not in valid H-
1A nonimmigrant status on October 11, 1996, that the alien was within 
the United States on October 11, 1996. An extension of stay may not be 
granted to an H-1A nonimmigrant alien beyond September 30, 1997. An H-1A 
alien granted an extension of stay, and the spouse and child of such 
nonimmigrant, shall be considered to have maintained nonimmigrant status 
through September 30, 1997, for all purposes under the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, as amended. Public Law 104-302 does not apply to an H-
1A alien who otherwise failed to maintain his or her valid H-1A 
nonimmigrant status or has changed from H-1A to another nonimmigrant 
status. A request for an extension of stay for an H-1A nonimmigrant must 
be filed on Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, at

[[Page 284]]

the appropriate Service Center with the following:
    (1) Evidence that the alien was employed as a registered nurse on 
September 1, 1995:
    (2) Evidence that the beneficiary is licensed to practice as a 
registered nurse in the state of intended employment;
    (3) Evidence that the alien was within the United States on or after 
September 1, 1995. For purposes of this provision, an alien will be 
deemed to have been within the United States on September 1, 1995, who, 
although not physically present in the United States on that date, was 
subsequently admitted to the United States in H-1A classification 
pursuant to an unexpired H-1A visa; and
    (4) If the alien was not in valid H-1A nonimmigrant status on 
October 11, 1996, evidence that the alien was within the United States 
on October 11, 1996. For purposes of this provision, an alien will be 
deemed to have been within the United States on October 11, 1996, who, 
although not physically present in the United States on that date, was 
subsequently admitted to the United States in H-1A classification 
pursuant to an unexpired H-1A visa.
    (B) H-1B extension of stay--(1) Alien in a specialty occupation or 
an alien of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion 
modeling. An extension of stay may be authorized for a period of up to 
three years for a beneficiary of an H-1B petition in a specialty 
occupation or an alien of distinguished merit and ability. The alien's 
total period of stay may not exceed six years. The request for extension 
must be accompanied by either a new or a photocopy of the prior 
certification from the Department of Labor that the petitioner continues 
to have on file a labor condition application valid for the period of 
time requested for the occupation.
    (2) Alien in a DOD research and development or coproduction project. 
An extension of stay may be authorized for a period up to five years for 
the beneficiary of an H-1B petition involving a DOD research and 
development project or coproduction project. The total period of stay 
may not exceed 10 years.
    (C) H-2A or H-2B extension of stay. An extension of stay for the 
beneficiary of an H-2A or H-2B petition may be authorized for the 
validity of the labor certification or for a period of up to one year, 
except as provided for in paragraph (h)(5)(x) of this section. The 
alien's total period of stay as an H-2A or H-2B worker may not exceed 
three years, except that in the Virgin Islands, the alien's total period 
of stay may not exceed 45 days.
    (D) H-3 extension of stay. An extension of stay may be authorized 
for the length of the training program for a total period of stay as an 
H-3 trainee not to exceed two years, or for a total period of stay as a 
participant in a special education training program not to exceed 18 
months.
    (16) Effect of approval of a permanent labor certification or filing 
of a preference petition on H classification--(i) H-1A or H-1B 
classification. The approval of a permanent labor certification or the 
filing of a preference petition for an alien shall not be a basis for 
denying an H-1A or H-1B petition or a request to extend such a petition, 
or the alien's admission, change of status, or extension of stay. The 
alien may legitimately come to the United States for a temporary period 
as an H-1A or H-1B nonimmigrant and depart voluntarily at the end of his 
or her authorized stay and, at the same time, lawfully seek to become a 
permanent resident of the United States.
    (ii) H-2A, H-2B, and H-3 classification. The approval of a permanent 
labor certification, or the filing of a preference petition for an alien 
currently employed by or in a training position with the same 
petitioner, shall be a reason, by itself, to deny the alien's extension 
of stay.
    (17) Effect of a strike--(i) If the Secretary of Labor certifies to 
the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation and at the place 
where the beneficiary is to be employed or trained, and that the 
employment of training of the beneficiary would adversely affect the 
wages and working conditions of U.S. citizens and lawful resident 
workers:
    (A) A petition to classify an alien as a nonimmigrant as defined in 
section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act shall be denied.

[[Page 285]]

    (B) If a petition has already been approved, but the alien has not 
yet entered the United States, or has entered the United States but has 
not commenced the employment, the approval of the petition is 
automatically suspended, and the application for admission on the basis 
of the petition shall be denied.
    (ii) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute 
is not certified under paragraph (h)(17)(i), the Commissioner shall not 
deny a petition or suspend an approved petition.
    (iii) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United 
States under an approved petition and is participating in a strike or 
other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not 
such strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Department 
of Labor, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or 
her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation 
in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, 
but is subject to the following terms and conditions:
    (A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act, and regulations promulgated in the 
same manner as all other H nonimmigrants;
    (B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not 
modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in 
a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers; 
and
    (C) Although participation by an H nonimmigrant alien in a strike or 
other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not 
constitute a ground for deportation, any alien who violates his or her 
status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized 
period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.
    (18) Use of approval notice, Form I-797. The Service shall notify 
the petitioner on Form I-797 whenever a visa petition, an extension of a 
visa petition, or an alien's extension of stay is approved under the H 
classification. The beneficiary of an H petition who does not require a 
nonimmigrant visa may present a copy of the approval notice at a port of 
entry to facilitate entry into the United States. A beneficiary who is 
required to present a visa for admission and whose visa will have 
expired before the date of his or her intended return may use a copy of 
Form I-797 to apply for a new or revalidated visa during the validity 
period of the petition. The copy of Form I-797 shall be retained by the 
beneficiary and presented during the validity of the petition when 
reentering the United States to resume the same employment with the same 
petitioner.
    (19) Additional fee for filing certain H-1B petitions--(i) A United 
States employer (other than an exempt employer as defined in paragraph 
(h)(19)(iii) of this section) who files a Form I-129, on or after 
December 1, 1998, and before October 1, 2001, must include the 
additional fee required in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter, if the 
petition is filed for any of the following purposes:
    (A) An initial grant of H-1B status under section 
101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Act;
    (B) An initial extension of stay, as provided in paragraph 
(h)(15)(i) of this section; or
    (C) Authorization for a change in employment, as provided in 
paragraph (h)(2)(i)(D) of this section.
    (ii) The service will accept remittances of the additional fee only 
from the United States employer or its representative of record, as 
defined under 8 CFR part 292 and 8 CFR 103.2(a)(3).
    (iii) The following exempt organizations are not required to pay the 
additional fee:
    (A) An institution of higher education, as defined in section 101(a) 
of the Higher Education Act of 1965;
    (B) An affiliated or related nonprofit entity. A nonprofit entity 
(including but not limited to hospitals and medical or research 
institutions) that is connected or associated with an institution of 
higher education, through shared ownership or control by the same board 
or federation operated by an institution of higher education, or 
attached to an institution of higher education as a member, branch, 
cooperative, or subsidiary;

[[Page 286]]

    (C) A nonprofit research organization or governmental research 
organization. A research organization that is either a nonprofit 
organization or entity that is primarily engaged in basic research and/
or applied research or a United States Government entity whose primary 
mission is the performance or promotion of basic research and/or applied 
research. Basic research is research to gain more comprehensive 
knowledge or understanding of the subject under study, without specific 
applications in mind. Basic research also is research that advances 
scientific knowledge, but does not have specific immediate commercial 
objectives although it may be in fields of present or potential 
commercial interest. Applied research is research to gain knowledge or 
understanding to determine the means by which a specific, recognized 
need may be met. Applied research includes investigations oriented to 
discovering new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial 
objectives with respect to products, processes, or services.
    (iv) For purposes of paragraphs (h)(19)(iii)(B) and (C) of this 
section, a nonprofit organization or entity is one that is qualified as 
a tax exempt organization under section 501(c)(3), (c)(4), or (c)(6) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), (c)(4) or 
(c)(6)) and has received approval as a tax exempt organization from the 
Internal Revenue Service, as it relates to research or educational 
purposes.
    (i) Representatives of information media. The admission of an alien 
of the class defined in section 101(a)(15)(I) of the Act constitutes an 
agreement by the alien not to change the information medium or his or 
her employer until he or she obtains permission to do so from the 
district director having jurisdiction over his or her residence. An 
alien classified as an information media nonimmigrant (I) may be 
authorized admission for the duration of employment.
    (j) Exchange aliens--(1) General. (i) Exchange alien means a 
nonimmigrant admitted under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act or who 
acquired such status, or who acquired exchange-visitor status under the 
United States Information and Education Exchange Act. Any exchange alien 
coming to the United States as a participant in a program designated 
under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act and accompanying spouse and minor 
children shall not be admitted without submitting a completely executed 
Form IAP-66. The spouse and minor children following to join the 
participant shall not be admitted without a copy of current Form IAP-66 
endorsed by the program sponsor indicating the expiration of stay date 
as shown on Form I-94. Any alien seeking to change nonimmigrant status 
to exchange visitor status shall file Form I-506 and attach a valid Form 
IAP-66.
    (ii) Admission. The initial admission of an exchange alien, spouse, 
and children may not exceed the period specified on Form IAP-66, plus a 
period of 30 days for the purpose of travel. Regulations of the United 
States Information Agency published at 22 CFR 514.23 give general 
limitations on the length of stay of the various classes of exchange 
visitors. A spouse or child (J-2) may not be admitted for longer than 
the principal exchange alien (J-1).
    (iii) Readmission. An exchange alien may be readmitted to the United 
States for the remainder of the time authorized on Form I-94, without 
presenting Form IAP-66, if the alien is returning from a visit solely to 
foreign contiguous territory or adjacent islands after an absence of 
less than 30 days and if the original Form I-94 is presented. All other 
exchange aliens must present a valid Form IAP-66. An original Form IAP-
66 or copy three (the pink copy) of a previously issued form presented 
by an exchange alien returning from a temporary absence shall be 
retained by the exchange alien for re-entries during the balance of the 
alien's stay.
    (iv) Extensions of Stay. If an exchange alien requires an extension 
beyond the initial admission period, the alien shall apply by submitting 
a new Form IAP-66 which indicates the date to which the alien's program 
is extended. The extension may not exceed the period specified on Form 
IAP-66, plus a period of 30 days for the purpose of travel. Extensions 
of stay for the alien's spouse and children require, as an attachment to 
Form IAP-66, Form I-94 for each dependent, and a list containing the

[[Page 287]]

names of the applicants, dates and places of birth, passport numbers, 
issuing countries, and expiration dates. An accompanying spouse or child 
may not be granted an extension of stay for longer than the principal 
exchange alien.
    (v) Employment. (A) The accompanying spouse and minor children of a 
J-1 exchange visitor may accept employment only with authorization by 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. A request for employment 
authorization must be made on Form I-765, Application for Employment 
Authorization, with fee, as required by the Service, to the district 
director having jurisdiction over the J-1 exchange visitor's temporary 
residence in the United States. Income from the spouse's or dependent's 
employment may be used to support the family's customary recreational 
and cultural activities and related travel, among other things. 
Employment will not be authorized if this income is needed to support 
the J-1 principal alien.
    (B) J-2 employment may be authorized for the duration of the J-1 
principal alien's authorized stay as indicated on Form I-94 or a period 
of four years, whichever is shorter. The employment authorization is 
valid only if the J-1 is maintaining status. Where a J-2 spouse or 
dependent child has filed a timely application for extension of stay, 
only upon approval of the request for extension of stay may he or she 
apply for a renewal of the employment authorization on a Form I-765 with 
the required fee.
    (2) Special reporting requirement. Each exchange alien participating 
in a program of graduate medical education or training shall file Form 
I-644 (Supplementary Statement for Graduate Medical Trainees) annually 
with the Service attesting to the conditions as specified on the form. 
The exchange alien shall also submit Form I-644 as an attachment to a 
completed Form IAP-66 when applying for an extension of stay.
    (3) Alien in cancelled programs. When the approval of an exchange 
visitor program is withdrawn by the Director of the United States 
Information Agency, the district director shall send a notice of the 
withdrawal to each participant in the program and a copy of each such 
notice shall be sent to the program sponsor. If the exchange visitor is 
currently engaged in activities authorized by the cancelled program, the 
participant is authorized to remain in the United States to engage in 
those activities until expiration of the period of stay previously 
authorized. The district director shall notify participants in cancelled 
programs that permission to remain in the United States as an exchange 
visitor, or extension of stay may be obtained if the participant is 
accepted in another approved program and a Form IAP-66, executed by the 
new program sponsor, is submitted. In this case, a release from the 
sponsor of the cancelled program will not be required.
    (4) Eligibility requirements for section 101(a)(15)(J) 
classification for aliens desiring to participate in programs under 
which they will receive graduate medical education or training--(i) 
Requirements. Any alien coming to the United States as an exchange 
visitor to participate in a program under which the alien will receive 
graduate medical education or training, or any alien seeking to change 
nonimmigrant status to that of an exchange visitor on Form I-506 for 
that purpose, must have passed parts of I and II of the National Board 
of Medical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as 
determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services), and must be 
competent in oral and written English, and shall submit a completely 
executed and valid Form IAP-66.
    (ii) Exemptions. From January 10, 1978 until December 31, 1983, any 
alien who has come to or seeks to come to the United States as an 
exchange visitor to participate in an accredited program of graduate 
medical education or training, or any alien who seeks to change 
nonimmigrant status for that purpose, may be admitted to participate in 
such program without regard to the requirements stated in subparagraphs 
(A) and (B)(ii)(I) of section 212(j)(1) of the Act if a substantial 
disruption in the health services provided by such program would result 
from not permitting the alien to participate in the program: Provided 
that the exemption will not increase the total number of aliens then 
participating in such programs to

[[Page 288]]

a level greater than that participating on January 10, 1978.
    (k) Fiancees and fiances of United States citizens--(1) Petition and 
supporting documents. To be classified as a fiance or fiancee as defined 
in section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act, an alien must be the beneficiary of 
an approved visa petition filed on Form I-129F. The petition with 
supporting documents shall be filed by the petitioner with the director 
having administrative jurisdiction over the place where the petitioner 
is residing in the United States. A copy of a document submitted in 
support of a visa petition filed pursuant to section 214(d) of the Act 
and this paragraph may be accepted, though unaccompanied by the 
original, if the copy bears a certification by an attorney, typed or 
rubber-stamped, in the language set forth in Sec. 204.2(j) of this 
chapter. However, the original document shall be submitted if requested 
by the Service.
    (2) Requirement that petitioner and beneficiary have met. The 
petitioner shall establish to the satisfaction of the director that the 
petitioner and beneficiary have met in person within the two years 
immediately preceding the filing of the petition. As a matter of 
discretion, the director may exempt the petitioner from this requirement 
only if it is established that compliance would result in extreme 
hardship to the petitioner or that compliance would violate strict and 
long-established customs of the beneficiary's foreign culture or social 
practice, as where marriages are traditionally arranged by the parents 
of the contracting parties and the prospective bride and groom are 
prohibited from meeting subsequent to the arrangement and prior to the 
wedding day. In addition to establishing that the required meeting would 
be a violation of custom or practice, the petitioner must also establish 
that any and all other aspects of the traditional arrangements have been 
or will be met in accordance with the custom or practice. Failure to 
establish that the petitioner and beneficiary have met within the 
required period or that compliance with the requirement should be waived 
shall result in the denial of the petition. Such denial shall be without 
prejudice to the filing of a new petition once the petitioner and 
beneficiary have met in person.
    (3) Children of beneficiary. Without the approval of a separate 
petition on his or her behalf, a child of the beneficiary (as defined in 
section 101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of the Act) may be accorded 
the same nonimmigrant classification as the beneficiary if accompanying 
or following to join him or her.
    (4) Notification. The petitioner shall be notified of the decision 
and, if the petition is denied, of the reasons therefor and of the right 
to appeal in accordance with the provisions of part 103 of this chapter.
    (5) Validity. The approval of a petition under this paragraph shall 
be valid for a period of four months. A petition which has expired due 
to the passage of time may be revalidated by a director or a consular 
officer for a period of four months from the date of revalidation upon a 
finding that the petitioner and beneficiary are free to marry and intend 
to marry each other within 90 days of the beneficiary's entry into the 
United States. The approval of any petition is automatically terminated 
when the petitioner dies or files a written withdrawal of the petition 
before the beneficiary arrives in the United States.
    (6) Adjustment of status from nonimmigrant to immigrant--(i) 
Nonimmigrant visa issued prior to November 10, 1986. If the beneficiary 
contracts a valid marriage with the petitioner within 90 days of his or 
her admission to the United States pursuant to a valid K-1 visa issued 
prior to November 10, 1986, and the beneficiary and his or her minor 
children are otherwise admissible, the director shall record their 
lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date of their filing 
of an application for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident 
(Form I-485). Such residence shall be granted under section 214(d) of 
the Act as in effect prior to November 10, 1986 and shall not be subject 
to the conditions of section 216 of the Act.
    (ii) Nonimmigrant visa issued on or after November 10, 1986. Upon 
contracting a valid marriage to the petitioner within 90 days of his or 
her admission as a nonimmigrant pursuant to a valid

[[Page 289]]

K visa issued on or after November 10, 1986, the beneficiary and his or 
her minor children may apply for adjustment of status to lawful 
permanent resident under section 245 of the Act. Upon approval of the 
application the director shall record their lawful admission for 
permanent residence in accordance with that section and subject to the 
conditions prescribed in section 216 of the Act.
    (l) Intracompany transferees--(1) Admission of intracompany 
transferees--(i) General. Under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Act, an 
alien who within the preceding three years has been employed abroad for 
one continuous year by a qualifying organization may be admitted 
temporarily to the United States to be employed by a parent, branch, 
affiliate, or subsidiary of that employer in a managerial or executive 
capacity, or in a position requiring specialized knowledge. An alien 
transferred to the United States under this nonimmigrant classification 
is referred to as an intracompany transferee and the organization which 
seeks the classification of an alien as an intracompany transferee is 
referred to as the petitioner. The Service has responsibility for 
determining whether the alien is eligible for admission and whether the 
petitioner is a qualifying organization. These regulations set forth the 
standards applicable to these classifications. They also set forth 
procedures for admission of intracompany transferees and appeal of 
adverse decisions. Certain petitioners seeking the classification of 
aliens as intracompany transferees may file blanket petitions with the 
Service. Under the blanket petition process, the Service is responsible 
for determining whether the petitioner and its parent, branches, 
affiliates, or subsidiaries specified are qualifying organizations. The 
Department of State or, in certain cases, the Service is responsible for 
determining the classification of the alien.
    (ii) Definitions--(A) Intracompany transferee means an alien who, 
within three years preceding the time of his or her application for 
admission into the United States, has been employed abroad continuously 
for one year by a firm or corporation or other legal entity or parent, 
branch, affiliate, or subsidiary thereof, and who seeks to enter the 
United States temporarily in order to render his or her services to a 
branch of the same employer or a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary 
thereof in a capacity that is managerial, executive, or involves 
specialized knowledge. Periods spent in the United States in lawful 
status for a branch of the same employer or a parent, affiliate, or 
subsidiary thereof and brief trips to the United States for business or 
pleasure shall not be interruptive of the one year of continuous 
employment abroad but such periods shall not be counted toward 
fulfillment of that requirement.
    (B) Managerial capacity means an assignment within an organization 
in which the employee primarily:
    (1) Manages the organization, or a department, subdivision, 
function, or component of the organization;

organizational hierarchy or with respect to the function managed; and
    (4) Exercises discretion over the day-to-day operations of the 
activity or function for which the employee has authority. A first-line 
supervisor is not considered to be acting in a managerial capacity 
merely by virtue of the supervisor's supervisory duties unless the 
employees supervised are professional.
    (C) Executive capacity means an assignment within an organization in 
which the employee primarily:
    (1) Directs the management of the organization or a major component 
or function of the organization;
    (2) Establishes the goals and policies of the organization, 
component, or function;
    (3) Exercises wide latitude in discretionary decision-making; and

individual of the petitioning organization's product, service, research, 
equipment, techniques, management, or other interests and its 
application in international markets, or an advanced level of knowledge 
or expertise in the organization's processes and procedures.
    (E) Specialized knowledge professional means an individual who has 
specialized knowledge as defined in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(D) of this

in the United States through a parent, branch, affiliate, or subsidiary 
for less than one year.
    (G) Qualifying organization means a United States or foreign firm, 
corporation, or other legal entity which:
    (1) Meets exactly one of the qualifying relationships specified in 
the definitions of a parent, branch, affiliate or subsidiary specified 
in paragraph (l)(1)(ii) of this section;
    (2) Is or will be doing business (engaging in international trade is 
not required) as an employer in the United States and in at least one 
other country directly or through a parent, branch, affiliate, or 
subsidiary for the duration of the alien's stay in the United States as 
an intracompany transferee; and
    (3) Otherwise meets the requirements of section 101(a)(15)(L) of the 
Act.
    (H) Doing business means the regular, systematic, and continuous 
provision of goods and/or services by a qualifying organization and does 
not include the mere presence of an agent or office of the qualifying 
organization in the United States and abroad.
    (I) Parent means a firm, corporation, or other legal entity which 
has subsidiaries.
    (J) Branch means an operating division or office of the same 
organization housed in a different location.
    (K) Subsidiary means a firm, corporation, or other legal entity of

entity and controls the entity; or owns, directly or indirectly, half of 
the entity and controls the entity; or owns, directly or indirectly, 50 
percent of a 50-50 joint venture and has equal control and veto power 
over the entity; or owns, directly or indirectly, less than half of the 
entity, but in fact controls the entity.
    (L) Affiliate means (1) One of two subsidiaries both of which are 
owned and controlled by the same parent or individual, or
    (2) One of two legal entities owned and controlled by the same group 
of individuals, each individual owning and controlling approximately the 
same share or proportion of each entity, or
    (3) In the case of a partnership that is organized in the United 
States to provide accounting services along with managerial and/or 
consulting services and that markets its accounting services under an 
internationally recognized name under an agreement with a worldwide 
coordinating organization that is owned and controlled by the member 
accounting firms, a partnership (or similar organization) that is 
organized outside the United States to provide accounting services shall 
be considered to be an affiliate of the United States partnership if it 
markets its accounting services under the same internationally 
recognized name under the agreement with the worldwide coordinating 
organization of which the United States partnership is also a member.
    (M) Director means a Service Center director with delegated 
authority at 8 CFR 103.1.
    (2) Filing of petitions--(i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(l)(2)(ii) and (l)(17) of this section, a petitioner seeking to classify 
an alien as an intracompany transferee shall file a petition on Form I-
129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, only at the Service Center which 
has jurisdiction over the area where the alien will be employed, even in 
emergent situations. The petitioner shall advise the Service whether it 
has filed a petition for the same beneficiary with another office, and 
certify that it will not file a petition for

[[Page 291]]

the same beneficiary with another office, unless the circumstances and 
conditions in the initial petition have changed. Failure to make a full 
disclosure of previous petitions filed may result in a denial of the 
petition.
    (ii) A United States petitioner which meets the requirements of 
paragraph (l)(4) of this section and seeks continuing approval of itself 
and its parent, branches, specified subsidiaries and affiliates as 
qualifying organizations and, later, classification under section 
101(a)(15)(L) of multiple numbers of aliens employed by itself, its 
parent, or those branches, subsidiaries, or affiliates may file a 
blanket petition on Form I-129 with the director having jurisdiction 
over the area where the petitioner is located. The blanket petition 
shall be adjudicated and maintained at the appropriate Service Center. 
Approved blanket petition files shall be maintained indefinitely by that 
Service Center. The petitioner shall be the single representative for 
the qualifying organizations with which the Service will deal regarding 
the blanket petition.
    (3) Evidence for individual petitions. An individual petition filed 
on Form I-129 shall be accompanied by:
    (i) Evidence that the petitioner and the organization which employed 
or will employ the alien are qualifying organizations as defined in 
paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(G) of this section.
    (ii) Evidence that the alien will be employed in an executive, 
managerial, or specialized knowledge capacity, including a detailed

    (iii) Evidence that the alien has at least one continuous year of 
full-time employment abroad with a qualifying organization within the 
three years preceding the filing of the petition.
    (iv) Evidence that the alien's prior year of employment abroad was 
in a position that was managerial, executive, or involved specialized 
knowledge and that the alien's prior education, training, and employment 
qualifies him/her to perform the intended services in the United States; 
however, the work in the United States need not be the same work which 
the alien performed abroad.
    (v) If the petition indicates that the beneficiary is coming to the 
United States as a manager or executive to open or to be employed in a 
new office in the United States, the petitioner shall submit evidence 
that:
    (A) Sufficient physical premises to house the new office have been 
secured;
    (B) The beneficiary has been employed for one continuous year in the 
three year period preceding the filing of the petition in an executive 
or managerial capacity and that the proposed employment involved 
executive or managerial authority over the new operation; and
    (C) The intended United States operation, within one year of the 
approval of the petition, will support an executive or managerial 
position as defined in paragraphs (l)(1)(ii) (B) or (C) of this section, 
supported by information regarding:
    (1) The proposed nature of the office describing the scope of the 
entity, its organizational structure, and its financial goals;
    (2) The size of the United States investment and the financial 
ability of the foreign entity to remunerate the beneficiary and to 
commence doing business in the United States; and
    (3) The organizational structure of the foreign entity.
    (vi) If the petition indicates that the beneficiary is coming to the 
United States in a specialized knowledge capacity to open or to be 
employed in a new office, the petitioner shall submit evidence that:
    (A) Sufficient physical premises to house the new office have been 
secured;
    (B) The business entity in the United States is or will be a 
qualifying organization as defined in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(G) of this 
section; and
    (C) The petitioner has the financial ability to remunerate the 
beneficiary and to commence doing business in the United States.
    (vii) If the beneficiary is an owner or major stockholder of the 
company, the petition must be accompanied by evidence that the 
beneficiary's services are to be used for a temporary period and 
evidence that the beneficiary will be transferred to an assignment 
abroad upon the completion of the temporary services in the United 
States.

[[Page 292]]

    (viii) Such other evidence as the director, in his or her 
discretion, may deem necessary.
    (4) Blanket petitions--(i) A petitioner which meets the following 
requirements may file a blanket petition seeking continuing approval of 
itself and some or all of its parent, branches, subsidiaries, and 
affiliates as qualifying organizations if:
    (A) The petitioner and each of those entities are engaged in 
commercial trade or services;
    (B) The petitioner has an office in the United States that has been 
doing business for one year or more;
    (C) The petitioner has three or more domestic and foreign branches, 
subsidiaries, or affiliates; and
    (D) The petitioner and the other qualifying organizations have 
obtained approval of petitions for at least ten ``L'' managers, 
executives, or specialized knowledge professionals during the previous 
12 months; or have U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual 
sales of at least $25 million; or have a United States work force of at 
least 1,000 employees.
    (ii) Managers, executives, and specialized knowledge professionals 
employed by firms, corporations, or other entities which have been found 
to be qualifying organizations pursuant to an approved blanket petition 
may be classified as intracompany transferees and admitted to the United 
States as provided in paragraphs (l) (5) and (11) of this section.
    (iii) When applying for a blanket petition, the petitioner shall 
include in the blanket petition all of its branches, subsidiaries, and 
affiliates which plan to seek to transfer aliens to the United States 
under the blanket petition. An individual petition may be filed by the 
petitioner or organizations in lieu of using the blanket petition 
procedure. However, the petitioner and other qualifying organizations 
may not seek L classification for the same alien under both procedures, 
unless a consular officer first denies eligibility. Whenever a 
petitioner which has blanket L approval files an individual petition to 
seek L classification for a manager, executive, or specialized knowledge 
professional, the petitioner shall advise the Service that it has 
blanket L approval and certify that the beneficiary has not and will not 
apply to a consular officer for L classification under the approved 
blanket petition.
    (iv) Evidence. A blanket petition filed on Form I-129 shall be 
accompanied by:
    (A) Evidence that the petitioner meets the requirements of paragraph 
(l)(4)(i) of this section.
    (B) Evidence that all entities for which approval is sought are 
qualifying organizations as defined in subparagraph (l)(1)(ii)(G) of 
this section.
    (C) Such other evidence as the director, in his or her discretion, 
deems necessary in a particular case.
    (5) Certification and admission procedures for beneficiaries under 
blanket petition.
    (i) Jurisdiction. United States consular officers shall have 
authority to determine eligibility of individual beneficiaries outside 
the United States seeking L classification under blanket petitions, 
except for visa-exempt nonimmigrants. An application for a visa-exempt 
nonimmigrant seeking L classification under a blanket petition or by an 
alien in the United States applying for change of status to L 
classification under a blanket petition shall be filed with the Service 
office at which the blanket petition was filed.
    (ii) Procedures. (A) When one qualifying organization listed in an 
approved blanket petition wishes to transfer an alien outside the United 
States to a qualifying organization in the United States and the alien 
requires a visa to enter the United States, that organization shall 
complete Form I-129S, Certificate of Eligibility for Intracompany 
Transferee under a Blanket Petition, in an original and three copies. 
The qualifying organization shall retain one copy for its records and 
send the original and two copies to the alien. A copy of the approved 
Form I-797 must be attached to the original and each copy of Form I-
129S.
    (B) After receipt of Form I-797 and Form I-129S, a qualified 
employee who is being transferred to the United States may use these 
documents to apply for visa issuance with the consular officer within 
six months of the date on Form I-129S.
    (C) When the alien is a visa-exempt nonimmigrant seeking L 
classification

[[Page 293]]

under a blanket petition, or when the alien is in the United States and 
is seeking a change of status from another nonimmigrant classification 
to L classification under a blanket petition, the petitioner shall 
submit Form I-129S, Certificate of Eligibility, and a copy of the 
approval notice, Form I-797, to the Service Center with which the 
blanket petition was filed.
    (D) The consular or Service officer shall determine whether the 
position in which the alien will be employed in the United States is 
with an organization named in the approved petition and whether the 
specific job is for a manager, executive, or specialized knowledge 
professional. The consular or Service officer shall determine further 
whether the alien's immediate prior year of continuous employment abroad 
was with an organization named in the petition and was in a position as 
manager, executive, or specialized knowledge professional.
    (E) Consular officers may grant ``L'' classification only in clearly 
approvable applications. If the consular officer determines that the 
alien is eligible for L classification, the consular officer may issue a 
nonimmigrant visa, noting the visa classification ``Blanket L-1'' for 
the principal alien and ``Blanket L-2'' for any accompanying or 
following to join spouse and children. The consular officer shall also 
endorse all copies of the alien's Form I-129S with the blanket L-1 visa 
classification and return the original and one copy to the alien. When 
the alien is inspected for entry into the United States, both copies of 
the Form I-129S shall be stamped to show a validity period not to exceed 
three years and the second copy collected and sent to the appropriate 
Regional Service Center for control purposes. Service officers who 
determine eligibility of aliens for L-1 classification under blanket 
petitions shall endorse both copies of Form I-129S with the blanket L-1 
classification and the validity period not to exceed three years and 
retain the second copy for Service records.
    (F) If the consular officer determines that the alien is ineligible 
for L classification under a blanket petition, the consular officer's 
decision shall be final. The consular officer shall record the reasons 
for the denial on Form I-129S, retain one copy, return the original of 
I-129S to the Service office which approved the blanket petition, and 
provide a copy to the alien. In such a case, an individual petition may 
be filed for the alien with the director having jurisdiction over the 
area of intended employment; the petition shall state the reason the 
alien was denied L classification and specify the consular office which 
made the determination and the date of the determination.
    (G) An alien admitted under an approved blanket petition may be 
reassigned to any organization listed in the approved petition without 
referral to the Service during his/her authorized stay if the alien will 
be performing virtually the same job duties. If the alien will be 
performing different job duties, the petitioner shall complete a new 
Certificate of Eligibility and send it for approval to the director who 
approved the blanket petition.
    (6) Copies of supporting documents. The petitioner may submit a 
legible photocopy of a document in support of the visa petition, in lieu 
of the original document. However, the original document shall be 
submitted if requested by the Service.
    (7) Approval of petition--(i) General. The director shall notify the 
petitioner of the approval of an individual or a blanket petition within 
30 days after the date a completed petition has been filed. If 
additional information is required from the petitioner, the 30 day 
processing period shall begin again upon receipt of the information. 
Only the Director of a Service Center may approve individual and blanket 
L petitions. The original Form I-797 received from the Service with 
respect to an approved individual or blanket petition may be duplicated 
by the petitioner for the beneficiary's use as described in paragraph 
(l)(13) of this section.
    (A) Individual petition--(1) Form I-797 shall include the 
beneficiary's name and classification and the petition's period of 
validity.
    (2) An individual petition approved under this paragraph shall be 
valid for the period of established need for the beneficiary's services, 
not to exceed three years, except where the beneficiary is coming to the 
United States

[[Page 294]]

to open or to be employed in a new office.
    (3) If the beneficiary is coming to the United States to open or be 
employed in a new office, the petition may be approved for a period not 
to exceed one year, after which the petitioner shall demonstrate as 
required by paragraph (l)(14)(ii) of this section that it is doing 
business as defined in paragraph (l) (1)(ii)(H) of this section to 
extend the validity of the petition.
    (B) Blanket petition--(1) Form I-797 shall identify the approved 
organizations included in the petition and the petition's period of 
validity.
    (2) A blanket petition approved under this paragraph shall be valid 
initially for a period of three years and may be extended indefinitely 
thereafter if the qualifying organizations have complied with these 
regulations.
    (3) A blanket petition may be approved in whole or in part and shall 
cover only qualifying organizations.
    (C) Amendments. The petitioner shall file an amended petition, with 
fee, at the Service Center where the original petition was filed to 
reflect changes in approved relationships, additional qualifying 
organizations under a blanket petition, change in capacity of employment 
(i.e., from a specialized knowledge position to a managerial position), 
or any information which would affect the beneficiary's eligibility 
under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Act.
    (ii) Spouse and dependents. The spouse and unmarried minor children 
of the beneficiary are entitled to L nonimmigrant classification, 
subject to the same period of admission and limits as the beneficiary, 
if the spouse and unmarried minor children are accompanying or following 
to join the beneficiary in the United States. Neither the spouse nor any 
child may accept employment unless he or she has been granted employment 
authorization.
    (8) Denial of petition--(i) Notice of intent to deny. When an 
adverse decision is proposed on the basis of evidence not submitted by 
the petitioner, the director shall notify the petitioner of his or her 
intent to deny the petition and the basis for the denial. The petitioner 
may inspect and rebut the evidence and will be granted a period of 30 
days from the date of the notice in which to do so. All relevant 
rebuttal material will be considered in making a final decision.
    (ii) Individual petition. If an individual is denied, the petitioner 
shall be notified within 30 days after the date a completed petition has 
been filed of the denial, the reasons for the denial, and the right to 
appeal the denial.
    (iii) Blanket petition. If a blanket petition is denied in whole or 
in part, the petitioner shall be notified within 30 days after the date 
a completed petition has been filed of the denial, the reasons for the 
denial, and the right to appeal the denial. If the petition is denied in 
part, the Service Center issuing the denial shall forward to the 
petitioner, along with the denial, a Form I-797 listing those 
organizations which were found to quality. If the decision to deny is 
reversed on appeal, a new Form I-797 shall be sent to the petitioner to 
reflect the changes made as a result of the appeal.
    (9) Revocation of approval of individual and blanket petitions--(i) 
General. The director may revoke a petition at any time, even after the 
expiration of the petition.
    (ii) Automatic revocation. The approval of any individual or blanket 
petition is automatically revoked if the petitioner withdraws the 
petition or the petitioner fails to request indefinite validity of a 
blanket petition.
    (iii) Revocation on notice. (A) The director shall send to the 
petitioner a notice of intent to revoke the petition in relevant part if 
he/she finds that:
    (1) One or more entities are no longer qualifying organizations;
    (2) The alien is no longer eligible under section 101(a)(15)(L) of 
the Act;
    (3) A qualifying organization(s) violated requirements of section 
101(a)(15)(L) and these regulations;
    (4) The statement of facts contained in the petition was not true 
and correct; or
    (5) Approval of the petition involved gross error; or
    (6) None of the qualifying organizations in a blanket petition have 
used the blanket petition procedure for three consecutive years.
    (B) The notice of intent to revoke shall contain a detailed 
statement of

[[Page 295]]

the grounds for the revocation and the time period allowed for the 
petitioner's rebuttal. Upon receipt of this notice, the petitioner may 
submit evidence in rebuttal within 30 days of the notice. The director 
shall consider all relevant evidence presented in deciding whether to 
revoke the petition in whole or in part. If a blanket petition is 
revoked in part, the remainder of the petition shall remain approved, 
and a revised Form I-797 shall be sent to the petitioner with the 
revocation notice.
    (iv) Status of beneficiaries. If an individual petition is revoked, 
the beneficiary shall be required to leave the United States, unless the 
beneficiary has obtained other work authorization from the Service. If a 
blanket petition is revoked and the petitioner and beneficiaries already 
in the United States are otherwise eligible for L classification, the 
director shall extend the blanket petition for a period necessary to 
support the stay of those blanket L beneficiaries. The approval notice, 
Form I-171C, shall include only the names of qualifying organizations 
and covered beneficiaries. No new beneficiaries may be classified or 
admitted under this limited extension.
    (10) Appeal of denial or revocation of individual or blanket 
petition--(i) A petition denied in whole or in part may be appealed 
under 8 CFR part 103. Since the determination on the Certificate of 
Eligibility, Form I-129S, is part of the petition process, a denial or 
revocation of approval of an I-129S is appealable in the same manner as 
the petition.
    (ii) A petition that has been revoked on notice in whole or in part 
may be appealed under part 103 of this chapter. Automatic revocations 
may not be appealed.
    (11) Admission. A beneficiary may apply for admission to the United 
States only while the individual or blanket petition is valid. The 
beneficiary of an individual petition shall not be admitted for a date 
past the validity period of the petition. The beneficiary of a blanket 
petition may be admitted for three years even though the initial 
validity period of the blanket petition may expire before the end of the 
three-year period. If the blanket petition will expire while the alien 
is in the United States, the burden is on the petitioner to file for 
indefinite validity of the blanket petition or to file an individual 
petition in the alien's behalf to support the alien's status in the 
United States. The admission period for any alien under section 
101(a)(15)(L) shall not exceed three years unless an extension of stay 
is granted pursuant to paragraph (l)(15) of this section.
    (12) L-1 limitation on period of stay--(i) Limits. An alien who has 
spent five years in the United States in a specialized knowledge 
capacity or seven years in the United States in a managerial or 
executive capacity under section 101(a)(15) (L) and/or (H) of the Act 
may not be readmitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15) (L) 
or (H) of the Act unless the alien has resided and been physically 
present outside the United States, except for brief visits for business 
or pleasure, for the immediate prior year. Such visits do not interrupt 
the one year abroad, but do not count towards fulfillment of that 
requirement. In view of this restriction, a new individual petition may 
not be approved for an alien who has spent the maximum time period in 
the United States under section 101(a)(15) (L) and/or (H) of the Act, 
unless the alien has resided and been physically present outside the 
United States, except for brief visits for business or pleasure, for the 
immediate prior year. The petitioner shall provide information about the 
alien's employment, place of residence, and the dates and purpose of any 
trips to the United States for the previous year. A consular or Service 
officer may not grant L classification under a blanket petition to an 
alien who has spent five years in the United States as a professional 
with specialized knowledge or seven years in the United States as a 
manager or executive, unless the alien has met the requirements 
contained in this paragraph.
    (ii) Exceptions. The limitations of paragraph (l)(12)(i) of this 
section shall not apply to aliens who do not reside continually in the 
United States and whose employment in the United States is seasonal, 
intermittent, or consists of an aggregate of six months or less per 
year. In addition, the limitations will not apply to aliens who reside 
abroad and regularly commute to

[[Page 296]]

the United States to engage in part-time employment. The petitioner and 
the alien must provide clear and convincing proof that the alien 
qualifies for an exception. Clear and convincing proof shall consist of 
evidence such as arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, 
and records of employment abroad.
    (13) Beneficiary's use of Form I-797 and Form I-129S--(i) 
Beneficiary of an individual petition. The beneficiary of an individual 
petition who does not require a nonimmigrant visa may present a copy of 
Form I-797 at a port of entry to facilitate entry into the United 
States. The copy of Form I-797 shall be retained by the beneficiary and 
presented during the validity of the petition (provided that the 
beneficiary is entering or reentering the United States) for entry and 
reentry to resume the same employment with the same petitioner (within 
the validity period of the petition) and to apply for an extension of 
stay. A beneficiary who is required to present a visa for admission and 
whose visa will have expired before the date of his or her intended 
return may use an original Form I-797 to apply for a new or revalidated 
visa during the validity period of the petition and to apply for an 
extension of stay.
    (ii) Beneficiary of a blanket petition. Each alien seeking L 
classification and admission under a blanket petition shall present a 
copy of Form I-797 and a Form I-129S from the petitioner which 
identifies the position and organization from which the employee is 
transferring, the new organization and position to which the employee is 
destined, a description of the employee's actual duties for both the new 
and former positions, and the positions, dates, and locations of 
previous L stays in the United States. A current copy of Form I-797 and 
Form I-129S should be retained by the beneficiary and used for leaving 
and reentering the United States to resume employment with a qualifying 
organization during his/her authorized period of stay, for applying for 
a new or revalidated visa, and for applying for readmission at a port of 
entry. The alien may be readmitted even though reassigned to a different 
organization named on the Form I-797 than the one shown on Form I-129S 
if the job duties are virtually the same.
    (14) Extension of visa petition validity--(i) Individual petition. 
The petitioner shall file a petition extension on Form I-129 to extend 
an individual petition under section 101(a)(15)(L) of the Act. Except in 
those petitions involving new offices, supporting documentation is not 
required, unless requested by the director. A petition extension may be 
filed only if the validity of the original petition has not expired.
    (ii) New offices. A visa petition under section 101(a)(15)(L) which 
involved the opening of a new office may be extended by filing a new 
Form I-129, accompanied by the following:
    (A) Evidence that the United States and foreign entities are still 
qualifying organizations as defined in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(G) of this 
section;
    (B) Evidence that the United States entity has been doing business 
as defined in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(H) of this section for the previous 
year;
    (C) A statement of the duties performed by the beneficiary for the 
previous year and the duties the beneficiary will perform under the 
extended petition;
    (D) A statement describing the staffing of the new operation, 
including the number of employees and types of positions held 
accompanied by evidence of wages paid to employees when the beneficiary 
will be employed in a managerial or executive capacity; and
    (E) Evidence of the financial status of the United States operation.
    (iii) Blanket petitions--(A) Extension procedure. A blanket petition 
may only be extended indefinitely by filing a new Form I-129 with a copy 
of the previous approval notice and a report of admissions during the 
preceding three years. The report of admissions shall include a list of 
the aliens admitted under the blanket petition during the preceding 
three years, including positions held during that period, the employing 
entity, and the dates of initial admission and final departure of each 
alien. The petitioner shall state whether it still meets the criteria 
for filing a blanket petition and shall document any changes in approved 
relationships and additional qualifying organizations.

[[Page 297]]

    (B) Other conditions. If the petitioner in an approved blanket 
petition fails to request indefinite validity or if indefinite validity 
is denied, the petitioner and its other qualifying organizations shall 
seek L classification by filing individual petitions until another three 
years have expired; after which the petitioner may seek approval of a 
new blanket petition.
    (15) Extension of stay. (i) In individual petitions, the petitioner 
must apply for the petition extension and the alien's extension of stay 
concurrently on Form     I-129. When the alien is a beneficiary under a 
blanket petition, a new certificate of eligibility, accompanied by a 
copy of the previous approved certificate of eligibility, shall be filed 
by the petitioner to request an extension of the alien's stay. The 
petitioner must also request a petition extension. The dates of 
extension shall be the same for the petition and the beneficiary's 
extension of stay. The beneficiary must be physically present in the 
United States at the time the extension of stay is filed. Even though 
the requests to extend the visa petition and the alien's stay are 
combined on the petition, the director shall make a separate 
determination on each. If the alien is required to leave the United 
States for business or personal reasons while the extension requests are 
pending, the petitioner may request the director to cable notification 
of approval of the petition extension to the consular office abroad 
where the alien will apply for a visa.
    (ii) An extension of stay may be authorized in increments of up to 
two years for beneficiaries of individual and blanket petitions. The 
total period of stay may not exceed five years for aliens employed in a 
specialized knowledge capacity. The total period of stay for an alien 
employed in a managerial or executive capacity may not exceed seven 
years. No further extensions may be granted. When an alien was initially 
admitted to the United States in a specialized knowledge capacity and is 
later promoted to a managerial or executive position, he or she must 
have been employed in the managerial or executive position for at least 
six months to be eligible for the total period of stay of seven years. 
The change to managerial or executive capacity must have been approved 
by the Service in an amended, new, or extended petition at the time that 
the change occurred.
    (16) Effect of approval of a permanent labor certification or filing 
of a preference petition on L-1 classification. The approval of a 
permanent labor certification or the filing of a preference petition for 
an alien shall not be a basis for denying an L petition, a request to 
extend an L petition, or the alien's application for admission, change 
of status, or extension of stay. The alien may legitimately come to the 
United States as a nonimmigrant under the L classification and depart 
voluntarily at the end of his or her authorized stay, and at the same 
time, lawfully seek to become a permanent resident of the United States.
    (17) Filing of individual petitions and certifications under blanket 
petitions for citizens of Canada under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA). (i) Individual petitions. Except as provided in 
paragraph (1)(2)(ii) of this section (filing of blanket petitions), a 
United States or foreign employer seeking to classify a citizen of 
Canada as an intracompany transferee may file an individual petition in 
duplicate on Form I-129 in conjunction with an application for admission 
of the citizen of Canada. Such filing may be made with an immigration 
officer at a Class A port of entry located on the United States-Canada 
land border or at a United States pre-clearance/pre-flight station in 
Canada. The petitioning employer need not appear, but Form I-129 must 
bear the authorized signature of the petitioner.
    (ii) Certification of eligibility for intracompany transferree under 
the blanket petition. An immigration officer at a location identified in 
paragraph (1)(17)(i) of this section may determine eligibility of 
individual citizens of Canada seeking L classification under approved 
blanket petitions. At these locations, such citizens of Canada shall 
present the original and two copies of Form I-129S, Intracompany 
Transferee Certificate of Eligibility, prepared by the approved 
organization, as well as three copies of Form I-797, Notice of Approval 
of Nonimmigrant Visa Petition.

[[Page 298]]

    (iii) Nothing in this section shall preclude or discourage the 
advance filing of petitions and certificates of eligibility in 
accordance with paragraph (l)(2) of this section.
    (iv) Deficient or deniable petitions or certificates of eligibility. 
If a petition or certificate of eligibility submitted concurrently with 
an application for admission is lacking necessary supporting 
documentation or is otherwise deficient, the inspecting immigration 
officer shall return it to the applicant for admission in order to 
obtain the necessary documentation from the petitioner or for the 
deficiency to be overcome. The fee to file the petition will be remitted 
at such time as the documentary or other deficiency is overcome. If the 
petition or certificate of eligibility is clearly deniable, the 
immigration officer will accept the petition (with fee) and the 
petitioner shall be notified of the denial, the reasons for denial, and 
the right of appeal. If a formal denial order cannot be issued by the 
port of entry, the petition with a recommendation for denial shall be 
forwarded to the appropriate Service Center for final action. For the 
purposes of this provision, the appropriate Service Center will be the 
one within the same Service region as the location where the application 
for admission is made.
    (v) Spouse and dependent minor children accompanying or following to 
join. (A) The Canadian citizen spouse and Canadian citizen unmarried 
minor children of a Canadian citizen admitted under this paragraph shall 
be entitled to the same nonimmigrant classification and same length of 
stay subject to the same limits as the principal alien. They shall not 
be required to present visas, and they shall be admitted under the 
classification symbol L-2.
    (B) A non-Canadian citizen spouse or non-Canadian citizen unmarried 
minor child shall be entitled to the same nonimmigrant classification 
and the same length of stay subject to the same limits as the principal, 
but shall be required to present a visa upon application for admission 
as an L-2 unless otherwise exempt under Sec. 212.1 of this chapter.
    (C) The spouse and dependent minor children shall not accept 
employment in the United States unless otherwise authorized under the 
Act.
    (18) Denial of intracompany transferee status to citizens of Canada 
or Mexico in the case of certain labor disputes. (i) If the Secretary of 
Labor certifies to or otherwise informs the Commissioner that a strike 
or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers is in 
progress where the beneficiary is to be employed, and the temporary 
entry of the beneficiary may affect adversely the settlement of such 
labor dispute or the employment of any person who is involved in such 
dispute, a petition to classify a citizen of Mexico or Canada as an L-1 
intracompany transferee may be denied. If a petition has already been 
approved, but the alien has not yet entered the United States, or has 
entered the United States but not yet commenced employment, the approval 
of the petition may be suspended, and an application for admission on 
the basis of the petition may be denied.
    (ii) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute 
is not certified under paragraph (l)(18)(i) of this section, or the 
Service has not otherwise been informed by the Secretary that such a 
strike or labor dispute is in progress, the Commissioner shall not deny 
a petition or suspend an approved petition.
    (iii) If the alien has already commended employment in the United 
States under an approved petition and is participating in a strike or 
other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not 
such strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Department 
of Labor, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or 
her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation 
in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, 
but is subject to the following terms and conditions.
    (A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act, and regulations promulgated in the 
same manner as all other L nonimmigrants;
    (B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not 
modified or extended in any way by virtue of his

[[Page 299]]

or her participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving work 
stoppage of workers; and
    (C) Although participation by an L nonimmigrant alien in a strike or 
other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not 
constitute a ground for deportation, any alien who violates his or her 
status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized 
period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.
    (m) Students in established vocational or other recognized 
nonacademic institutions, other than in language training programs--(1) 
Admission of student--(i) Eligibility for admission. Except as provided 
in paragraph (m)(4) of this section, an alien seeking admission to the 
United States under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act (as an M-1 
student) and the student's accompanying M-2 spouse and minor children, 
if applicable, are not eligible for admission unless--
    (A) The student presents a Certificate of Eligibility for 
Nonimmigrant (M-1) Student Status, Form I-20M-N, properly and completely 
filled out by the student and by the designated official of the school 
to which the student is destined and the documentary evidence of the 
student's financial ability required by that form; and
    (B) It is established that the student is destined to and intends to 
attend the school specified in the student's visa unless the student is 
exempt from the requirement for presentation of a visa.
    (ii) Disposition of Form I-20M-N. When a student is admitted to the 
United States, the inspecting officer shall forward Form I-20M-N to the 
Service's processing center. The processing center shall forward Form I-
20N to the school which issued the form to notify the school of the 
student's admission.
    (2) Form I-20 ID copy. The first time an M-1 student comes into 
contact with the Service for any reason, the student must present to the 
Service a Form I-20M-N properly and completely filled out by the student 
and by the designated official of the school the student is attending or 
intends to attend. The student will be issued a Form I-20 ID copy with 
his or her admission number. The student must have the Form I-20 ID copy 
with him or her at all times. If the student loses the Form I-20 ID 
copy, the student must request a new Form I-20 ID copy on Form I-102 
from the Service office having jurisdiction over the school the student 
was last authorized to attend.
    (3) Spouse and minor children following to join student. The M-2 
spouse and minor children following to join an M-1 student are not 
eligible for admission to the United States unless they present, as 
evidence that the student is or will, within sixty days, be enrolled in 
a full course of study or is engaged in approved practical training, 
either--
    (i) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no 
substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form 
I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
    (ii) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in 
the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form 
was initially issued.
    (4) Temporary absence--(i) General. An M-1 student returning to the 
United States from a temporary absence to attend the school which the 
student was previously authorized to attend must present either--
    (A) A properly endorsed page 4 of Form I-20M-N if there has been no 
substantive change in the information on the student's most recent Form 
I-20M since the form was initially issued; or
    (B) A new Form I-20M-N if there has been any substantive change in 
the information on the student's most recent Form I-20M since the form 
was initially issued.
    (ii) Student who transferred between schools. If an M-1 student has 
been authorized to transfer between schools and is returning to the 
United States from a temporary absence in order to attend the school to 
which transfer was authorized as indicated on the student's Form I-20 ID 
copy, the name of the school to which the student is destined does not 
need to be specified in the student's visa.
    (5) Period of stay. An alien admitted to the United States as an M-1 
student is to be admitted for the period of time necessary to complete 
the course of study indicated on Form I-20M plus thirty days within 
which to depart from the United States or for one year,

[[Page 300]]

whichever is less. An alien granted a change of nonimmigrant 
classification to that of an M-1 student is to be given an extension of 
stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study 
indicated on Form I-20M plus thirty days within which to depart from the 
United States or for one year, whichever is less.
    (6) Conversion to M-1 status of students in established vocational 
or other recognized nonacademic institutions, other than in language 
training programs, who were F-1 students prior to June 1, 1982. A 
student in an established vocational or other recognized nonacademic 
institution, other than in a language training program, who is in status 
as an F-1 student under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act in effect 
prior to June 1, 1982 and the student's F-2 spouse and children, if 
applicable, are--
    (i) Automatically converted to M-1 and M-2 status respectively; and
    (ii) Limited to the authorized period of stay shown on their Forms 
I-94 plus thirty days within which to depart from the United States or 
to an authorized period of stay which expires one year from August 1, 
1983, whichever is less.
    (7) Period of stay of student already in M-1 status. A student in an 
established vocational or other recognized nonacademic institution, 
other than in a language training program, who is already in M-1 status 
and the student's M-2 spouse and children, if applicable, are limited to 
the authorized period of stay shown on their Forms I-94 plus thirty days 
within which to depart from the United States or to an authorized period 
of stay which expires one year from August 1, 1983, whichever is less.
    (8) Issuance of new I-94. A nonimmigrant whose status is affected by 
paragraph (m)(6) or (m)(7) of this section need not present Form I-94 to 
the Service. Either paragraph constitutes official notification to a 
student whose status is affected by it of that status. The Service will 
issue a new Form I-94 to an alien whose status is affected by either 
paragraph when that alien comes into contact with the Service.
    (9) Full course of study. Successful completion of the course of 
study must lead to the attainment of a specific educational or 
vocational objective. A ``full course of study'' as required by section 
101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act means--
    (i) Study at a community college or junior college, certified by a 
school official to consist of at least twelve semester or quarter hours 
of instruction per academic term in those institutions using standard 
semester, trimester, or quarter-hour systems, where all students 
enrolled for a minimum of twelve semester or quarter hours are charged 
full-time tuition or considered full-time for other administrative 
purposes, or its equivalent (as determined by the district director) 
except when the student needs a lesser course load to complete the 
course of study during the current term;
    (ii) Study at a postsecondary vocational or business school, other 
than in a language training program except as provided in 
Sec. 214.3(a)(2)(iv), which confers upon its graduates recognized 
associate or other degrees or has established that its credits have been 
and are accepted unconditionally by at least three institutions of 
higher learning which are either: (1) A school (or school system) owned 
and operated as a public educational institution by the United States or 
a State or political subdivision thereof; or (2) a school accredited by 
a nationally recognized accrediting body; and which has been certified 
by a designated school official to consist of at least twelve hours of 
instruction a week, or its equivalent as determined by the district 
director;
    (iii) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic curriculum, other 
than in a language training program except as provided in 
Sec. 214.3(a)(2)(iv), certified by a designated school official to 
consist of at least eighteen clock hours of attendance a week if the 
dominant part of the course of study consists of classroom instruction, 
or at least twenty-two clock hours a week if the dominant part of the 
course of study consists of shop or laboratory work; or
    (iv) Study in a vocational or other nonacademic high school 
curriculum, certified by a designated school official to consist of 
class attendance for not less than the minimum number of hours a week 
prescribed by the school for normal progress towards graduation.

[[Page 301]]

    (10) Extension of stay--(i) Eligibility. An M-1 student may be 
granted an extension of stay if it is established that the student--
    (A) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant currently maintaining student 
status; and
    (B) Is able to, and in good faith intends to, continue to maintain 
that status for the period for which the extension is granted.
    (ii) Application. An M-1 student must apply for an extension of stay 
on Form I-538. A student's M-2 spouse and children desiring an extension 
of stay must be included in the application. A student's M-2 spouse or 
children are not eligible for an extension of stay unless the student is 
granted an extension of stay. The student must submit the application to 
the Service office having jurisdiction over the school the student was 
last authorized to attend at least fifteen days but not more than sixty 
days before the expiration of the student's currently authorized stay. 
The application must also be accompanied by the student's Form I-20 ID 
copy and the Forms I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if 
applicable.
    (iii) Period of stay. If an application for extension of stay is 
granted, the student and the student's spouse and children, if 
applicable, are to be given an extension of stay for the period of time 
necessary to complete the course of study plus thirty days within which 
to depart from the United States or for one year, whichever is less. An 
M-1 student who has been compelled by illness to interrupt or reduce a 
course of study may be granted an extension of stay without being 
required to change nonimmigrant classification provided that it is 
established that the student will pursue a full course of study upon 
recovery from the illness.
    (11) School transfer--(i) Eligibility. An M-1 student may not 
transfer to another school after six months from the date the student is 
first admitted as, or changes nonimmigrant classification to that of, an 
M-1 student unless the student is unable to remain at the school to 
which the student was initially admitted due to circumstances beyond the 
student's control. An M-1 student may be otherwise eligible to transfer 
to another school if the student--
    (A) Is a bona fide nonimmigrant;
    (B) Has been pursuing a full course of study at the school the 
student was last authorized to attend;
    (C) Intends to pursue a full course of study at the school to which 
the student intends to transfer; and
    (D) Is financially able to attend the school to which the student 
intends to transfer.
    (ii) Procedure. An M-1 student must apply for permission to transfer 
between schools on Form I-538 accompanied by the student's Form I-20 ID 
copy and the Forms I-94 of the student's spouse and children, if 
applicable. The Form I-538 must also be accompanied by Form I-20M-N 
properly and completely filled out by the student and by the designated 
official of the school which the student wishes to attend. The student 
must submit the application for school transfer to the Service office 
having jurisdiction over the school the student was last authorized to 
attend. Sixty days after having filed an application for school 
transfer, an M-1 student may effect the transfer subject to approval or 
denial of the application. An M-1 student who transfers without 
complying with this regulation or whose application is denied after 
transfer pursuant to this regulation is considered to be out of status. 
If the application is approved, the approval of the transfer will be 
retroactive to the date of filing the application, and the student will 
be granted an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to 
complete the course of study indicated on Form I-20M plus thirty days 
within which to depart from the United States or for one year, whichever 
is less. The adjudicating officer must endorse the name of the school to 
which transfer is authorized on the student's Form I-20 ID copy. The 
officer must also endorse Form I-20N to indicate that a school transfer 
has been authorized and forward it with Form I-20M to the Service's 
processing center for file updating. The processing center shall forward 
Form I-20N to the school to which the transfer has been authorized to 
notify the school of the action taken.
    (iii) Student who has not been pursuing a full course of study. If 
an M-1 student who has not been pursuing a full course

[[Page 302]]

of study at the school the student was last authorized to attend desires 
to attend a different school, the student must apply for reinstatement 
to student status under paragraph (m)(16) of this section.
    (12) Change in educational objective. An M-1 student may not change 
educational objective.
    (13) Employment. Except as provided in paragraph (m)(14) of this 
section, M-1 students may not accept employment. A student already in M-
1 status on August 1, 1983 or a student converted to M-1 status under 
paragraph (m)(6) of this section who was authorized off-campus 
employment under the regulations previously in effect, however, may 
continue to work until the date of expiration of the previously 
authorized period of employment. The M-2 spouse and children of an M-1 
student may not accept employment.
    (14) Practical training--(i) When practical training may be 
authorized. Temporary employment for practical training may be 
authorized only after completion of the student's course of study.
    (ii) Application. An M-1 student must apply for permission to accept 
employment for practical training on Form I-765, with the fee required 
by 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), accompanied by his or her I-20 ID endorsed for 
practical training by the DSO. The application must be submitted prior 
to the expiration of the student's authorized period of stay and not 
more than sixty days before nor more than thirty days after completion 
of the course of study. The designated school official must certify on 
Form I-538 that--
    (A) The proposed employment is recommended for the purpose of 
practical training;
    (B) The proposed employment is related to the student's course of 
study; and
    (C) Upon the designated school official's information and belief, 
employment comparable to the proposed employment is not available to the 
student in the country of the student's foreign residence.
    (iii) Duration of practical training. When the student is authorized 
to engage in employment for practical training, he or she will be issued 
an employment authorization document. The M-1 student may not begin 
employment until he or she has been issued an employment authorization 
document by the Service. One month of employment authorization will be 
granted for each four months of full-time study that the M-1 student has 
completed. However, an M-1 student may not engage in more than six 
months of practical training in the aggregate. The student will not be 
granted employment authorization if he or she cannot complete the 
requested practical training within six months.
    (iv) Temporary absence of M-1 student granted practical training. An 
M-1 student who has been granted permission to accept employment for 
practical training and who temporarily departs from the United States, 
may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period indicated 
on the student's Form I-20 ID copy. The student must be returning to the 
United States to perform the authorized practical training. A student 
may not be readmitted to begin practical training which was not 
authorized prior to the student's departure from the United States.
    (v) Effect of strike or other labor dispute. Authorization for all 
employment for practical training is automatically suspended upon 
certification by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee to 
the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or the Commissioner's 
designee that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage 
of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place of employment. 
As used in this paragraph, ``place of employment'' means wherever the 
employer or joint employer does business.
    (15) Decision on application for extension, permission to transfer 
to another school, or permission to accept employment for practical 
training. The Service shall notify the applicant of the decision and, if 
the application is denied, of the reason(s) for the denial. The 
applicant may not appeal the decision.
    (16) Reinstatement to student status--(i) General. A district 
director may consider reinstating to M-1 student status an alien who was 
admitted to the United States as, or whose status was

[[Page 303]]

changed to that of, an M-1 student and who has overstayed the authorized 
period of stay or who has otherwise violated the conditions of his or 
her status only if--
    (A) The student establishes to the satisfaction of the district 
director that the violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond 
the student's control or that failure to receive reinstatement to lawful 
M-1 status would result in extreme hardship to the student;
    (B) The student makes a written request for reinstatement 
accompanied by a properly completed Form I-20M-N from the school the 
student is attending or intends to attend and the student's Form I-20 ID 
copy;
    (C) The student is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue, a 
full course of study at the school which issued the Form I-20M-N;
    (D) The student has not been employed without authorization; and
    (E) The student is not deportable on any ground other than section 
241(a)(1) (B), (C), or (D) of the Act.
    (ii) Decision. If the district director reinstates the student, the 
district director shall endorse Form I-20N and the student's Form I-20 
ID copy to indicate that the student has been reinstated, return the 
Form I-20 ID copy to the student, and forward Form I-20N with Form I-20M 
to the Service's processing center for file updating. The processing 
center shall forward Form I-20N to the school which the student is 
attending or intends to attend to notify the school of the student's 
reinstatement. If the district director does not reinstate the student, 
the student may not appeal that decision.
    (17) School code suffix on Form I-20M-N. Each school system, other 
than a secondary school system approved prior to August 1, 1983 for 
attendance by M-1 students must assign permanent consecutive numbers to 
all schools within its system. The number of the school within the 
system which an M-1 student is attending or intends to attend must be 
added as a three-digit suffix following a decimal point after the school 
file number on Form I-20M-N (e.g. .001). If an M-1 student is attending 
or intends to attend a secondary school in a school system or a school 
which is not part of a school system, a suffix consisting of a decimal 
point followed by three zeros must be added after the school file number 
on Form I-20M-N. The Service will assign school code suffixes to those 
schools it approves beginning August 1, 1983. No Form I-20M-N will be 
accepted after August 1, 1983 without the appropriate three-digit 
suffix.
    (n) Certain parents and children of section 101(a)(27)(I) special 
immigrants--(1) Parent of special immigrant. Upon application, a parent 
of a child accorded special immigrant status under section 
101(a)(27)(I)(i) of the Act may be granted status under section 
101(a)(15)(N)(i) of the Act as long as the permanent resident child 
through whom eligibility is derived remains a child as defined in 
section 101(b)(1) of the Act.
    (2) Child of section 101(a)(27)(I) special immigrants and section 
101(a)(15)(N)(i) nonimmigrants. Children of parents granted nonimmigrant 
status under section 101(a)(15)(N)(i) of the Act, or of parents who have 
been granted special immigrant status under section 101(a)(27)(I) (ii), 
(iii) or (iv) of the Act may be granted status under section 
101(a)(15)(N)(ii) of the Act for such time as each remains a child as 
defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act.
    (3) Admission and extension of stay. A nonimmigrant granted (N) 
status shall be admitted for not to exceed three years with extensions 
in increments up to but not to exceed three years. Status as an (N) 
nonimmigrant shall terminate on the date the child described in 
paragraph (n)(1) or (n)(2) of this section no longer qualifies as a 
child as defined in section 101(b)(1) of the Act.
    (4) Employment. A nonimmigrant admitted in or granted (N) status is 
authorized employment incident to (N) status without restrictions as to 
location or type of employment.
    (o) Aliens of extraordinary ability or achievement--(1) 
Classifications--(i) General. Under section 101(a)(15)(O) of the Act, a 
qualified alien may be authorized to come to the United States to 
perform services relating to an event or events if petitioned for by an 
employer. Under this nonimmigrant category, the alien may be classified 
under section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Act

[[Page 304]]

as an alien who has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, 
education, business, or athletics, or who has a demonstrated record of 
extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry. 
Under section 101(a)(15)(O)(ii) of the Act, an alien having a residence 
in a foreign country which he or she has no intention of abandoning may 
be classified as an accompanying alien who is coming to assist in the 
artistic or athletic performance of an alien admitted under section 
101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Act. The spouse or child of an alien described 
in section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) or (ii) of the Act who is accompanying or 
following to join the alien is entitled to classification pursuant to 
section 101(a)(15)(O)(iii) of the Act. These classifications are called 
the O-1, O-2, and O-3 categories, respectively. The petitioner must file 
a petition with the Service for a determination of the alien's 
eligibility for O-1 or O-2 classification before the alien may apply for 
a visa or seek admission to the United States. This paragraph sets forth 
the standards and procedures applicable to these classifications.
    (ii) Description of classifications. (A) An O-1 classification 
applies to:
    (1) An individual alien who has extraordinary ability in the 
sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics which has been 
demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and who is 
coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of 
extraordinary ability; or
    (2) An alien who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary 
achievement in motion picture and/or television productions and who is 
coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of 
extraordinary achievement.
    (B) An O-2 classification applies to an accompanying alien who is 
coming temporarily to the United States solely to assist in the artistic 
or athletic performance by an O-1. The O-2 alien must:
    (1) Be an integral part of the actual performances or events and 
posses critical skills and experience with the O-1 alien that are not of 
a general nature and which are not possessed by others; or
    (2) In the case of a motion picture or television production, have 
skills and experience with the O-1 alien which are not of a general 
nature and which are critical, either based on a pre-existing and 
longstanding working relationship or, if in connection with a specific 
production only, because significant production (including pre- and 
post-production) will take place both inside and outside the United 
States and the continuing participation of the alien is essential to the 
successful completion of the production.
    (2) Filing of petitions--(i) General. Except as provided for in 
paragraph (o)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, a petitioner seeking to 
classify an alien as an O-1 or O-2 nonimmigrant shall file a petition on 
Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with the Service Center 
which has jurisdiction in the area where the alien will work. The 
petition may not be filed more than 6 months before the actual need for 
the alien's services. An O-1 or O-2 petition shall be adjudicated at the 
appropriate Service Center, even in emergency situations. Only one 
beneficiary may be included on an O-1 petition. O-2 aliens must be filed 
for on a separate petition from the O-1 alien. An O-1 or O-2 petition 
may only be filed by a United States employer, a United States agent, or 
a foreign employer through a United States agent. For purposes of 
paragraph (o) of this section, a foreign employer is any employer who is 
not amenable to service of process in the United States. A foreign 
employer may not directly petition for an O nonimmigrant alien but 
instead must use the services of a United States agent to file a 
petition for an O nonimmigrant alien. A United States agent petitioning 
on behalf of a foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, 
and to accept services of process in the United States in proceedings 
under section 274A of the Act, on behalf of the foreign employer. An O 
alien may not petition for himself or herself.
    (ii) Evidence required to accompany a petition. Petitions for O 
aliens shall be accompanied by the following:
    (A) The evidence specified in the particular section for the 
classification;
    (B) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the 
alien

[[Page 305]]

beneficiary or, if there is no written contract, a summary of the terms 
of the oral agreement under which the alien will be employed;
    (C) An explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the 
beginning and ending dates for the events or activities, and a copy of 
any itinerary for the events or activities; and
    (D) A written advisory opinion(s) from the appropriate consulting 
entity or entities.
    (iii) Form of documentation. The evidence submitted with an O 
petition shall conform to the following:
    (A) Affidavits, contracts, awards, and similar documentation must 
reflect the nature of the alien's achievement and be executed by an 
officer or responsible person employed by the institution, firm, 
establishment, or organization where the work was performed.
    (B) Affidavits written by present or former employers or recognized 
experts certifying to the recognition and extraordinary ability, or in 
the case of a motion picture or television production, the extraordinary 
achievement of the alien, shall specifically describe the alien's 
recognition and ability or achievement in factual terms and set forth 
the expertise of the affiant and the manner in which the affiant 
acquired such information.
    (C) A legible photocopy of a document in support of the petition may 
be submitted in lieu of the original. However, the original document 
shall be submitted if requested by the Director.
    (iv) Other filing situations--(A) Services in more than one 
location. A petition which requires the alien to work in more than one 
location must include an itinerary with the dates and locations of work 
and must be filed with the Service Center which has jurisdiction in the 
area where the petitioner is located. The address which the petitioner 
specifies as its location on the petition shall be where the petitioner 
is located for purposes of this paragraph.
    (B) Services for more than one employer. If the beneficiary will 
work concurrently for more than one employer within the same time 
period, each employer must file a separate petition with the Service 
Center that has jurisdiction over the area where the alien will perform 
services, unless an established agent files the petition.
    (C) Change of employer. If an O-1 or O-2 alien in the United States 
seeks to change employers, the new employer must file a petition and a 
request to extend the alien's stay with the Service Center having 
jurisdiction over the new place of employment. An O-2 alien may change 
employers only in conjunction with a change of employers by the 
principal O-1 alien. If the O-1 or O-2 petition was filed by an agent, 
an amended petition must be filed with evidence relating to the new 
employer and a request for an extension of stay.
    (D) Amended petition. The petitioner shall file an amended petition 
on Form I-129, with fee, with the Service Center where the original 
petition was filed to reflect any material changes in the terms and 
conditions of employment or the beneficiary's eligibility as specified 
in the original approved petition. In the case of a petition filed for 
an artist or entertainer, a petitioner may add additional performances 
or engagements during the validity period of the petition without filing 
an amended petition, provided the additional performances or engagements 
require an alien of O-1 caliber.
    (E) Agents as petitioners. A United States agent may file a petition 
in cases involving workers who are traditionally self-employed or 
workers who use agents to arrange short-term employment on their behalf 
with numerous employers, and in cases where a foreign employer 
authorizes the agent to act in its behalf. A United States agent may be: 
The actual employer of the beneficiary, the representative of both the 
employer and the beneficiary; or, a person or entity authorized by the 
employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent. A 
petition filed by an agent is subject to the following conditions:
    (1) An agent performing the function of an employer must provide the 
contractual agreement between the agent and the beneficiary which 
specifies the wage offered and the other terms and conditions of 
employment of the beneficiary.

[[Page 306]]

    (2) A person or company in business as an agent may file the 
petition involving multiple employers as the representative of both the 
employers and the beneficiary, if the supporting documentation includes 
a complete itinerary of the event or events. The itinerary must specify 
the dates of each service or engagement, the names and addresses of the 
actual employers, and the names and addresses of the establishments, 
venues, or locations where the services will be performed. A contract 
between the employers and the beneficiary is required. The burden is on 
the agent to explain the terms and conditions of the employment and to 
provide any required documentation.
    (3) A foreign employer who, through a United States agent, files a 
petition for an O nonimmigrant alien is responsible for complying with 
all of the employer sanctions provisions of section 274A of the Act and 
8 CFR part 274a.
    (F) Multiple beneficiaries. More than one O-2 accompanying alien may 
be included on a petition if they are assisting the same O-1 alien for 
the same events or performances, during the same period of time, and in 
the same location.
    (G) Traded professional O-1 athletes. In the case of a professional 
O-1 athlete who is traded from one organization to another organization, 
employment authorization for the player will automatically continue for 
a period of 30 days after acquisition by the new organization, within 
which time the new organization is expected to file a new Form I-129. If 
a new Form I-129 is not filed within 30 days, employment authorization 
will cease. If a new Form I-129 is filed within 30 days, the 
professional athlete shall be deemed to be in valid O-1 status, and 
employment shall continue to be authorized, until the petition is 
adjudicated. If the new petition is denied, employment authorization 
will cease.
    (3) Petition for alien of extraordinary ability or achievement (O-
1)--(i) General. Extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, 
business, or athletics, or extraordinary achievement in the case of an 
alien in the motion picture or television industry, must be established 
for an individual alien. An O-1 petition must be accompanied by evidence 
that the work which the alien is coming to the United States to continue 
is in the area of extraordinary ability, and that the alien meets the 
criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section.
    (ii) Definitions. As used in this paragraph, the term:
    Arts includes any field of creative activity or endeavor such as, 
but not limited to, fine arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and 
performing arts. Aliens engaged in the field of arts include not only 
the principal creators and performers but other essential persons such 
as, but not limited to, directors, set designers, lighting designers, 
sound designers, choreographers, choreologists, conductors, 
orchestrators, coaches, arrangers, musical supervisors, costume 
designers, makeup artists, flight masters, stage technicians, and animal 
trainers.
    Event means an activity such as, but not limited to, a scientific 
project, conference, convention, lecture series, tour, exhibit, business 
project, academic year, or engagement. Such activity may include short 
vacations, promotional appearances, and stopovers which are incidental 
and/or related to the event. A group of related activities may also be 
considered to be an event. In the case of an O-1 athlete, the event 
could be the alien's contract.
    Extraordinary ability in the field of arts means distinction. 
Distinction means a high level of achievement in the field of arts 
evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above that 
ordinarily encountered to the extent that a person described as 
prominent is renowned, leading, or well-known in the field of arts.
    Extraordinary ability in the field of science, education, business, 
or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that the person is 
one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the field 
of endeavor.
    Extraordinary achievement with respect to motion picture and 
television productions, as commonly defined in the industry, means a 
very high level of accomplishment in the motion picture or television 
industry evidenced

[[Page 307]]

by a degree of skill and recognition significantly above that ordinarily 
encountered to the extent that the person is recognized as outstanding, 
notable, or leading in the motion picture or television field.
    Peer group means a group or organization which is comprised of 
practitioners of the alien's occupation. If there is a collective 
bargaining representative of an employer's employees in the occupational 
classification for which the alien is being sought, such a 
representative may be considered the appropriate peer group for purposes 
of consultation.
    (iii) Evidentiary criteria for an O-1 alien of extraordinary ability 
in the fields of science, education, business, or athletics. An alien of 
extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business, or 
athletics must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim 
and recognition for achievements in the field of expertise by providing 
evidence of:
    (A) Receipt of a major, internationally recognized award, such as 
the Nobel Prize; or
    (B) At least three of the following forms of documentation:
    (1) Documentation of the alien's receipt of nationally or 
internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field 
of endeavor;
    (2) Documentation of the alien's membership in associations in the 
field for which classification is sought, which require outstanding 
achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or 
international experts in their disciplines or fields;
    (3) Published material in professional or major trade publications 
or major media about the alien, relating to the alien's work in the 
field for which classification is sought, which shall include the title,

essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a 
distinguished reputation;
    (8) Evidence that the alien has either commanded a high salary or 
will command a high salary or other remuneration for services, evidenced 
by contracts or other reliable evidence.
    (C) If the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(iii) of this section do not 
readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit 
comparable evidence in order to establish the beneficiary's eligibility.
    (iv) Evidentiary criteria for an O-1 alien of extraordinary ability 
in the arts. To qualify as an alien of extraordinary ability in the 
field of arts, the alien must be recognized as being prominent in his or

or other reliable evidence; or
    (C) If the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(iv) of this section do not 
readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit 
comparable evidence in order to establish the beneficiary's eligibility.
    (v) Evidentiary criteria for an alien of extraordinary achievement

rating, standing in the field, box office receipts, motion picture or 
television ratings, and other occupational achievements reported in 
trade journals, major newspapers, or other publications;
    (5) Evidence that the alien has received significant recognition for 
achievements from organizations, critics, government agencies, or other 
recognized experts in the field in which the alien is engaged. Such 
testimonials must be in a form which clearly indicates the author's 
authority, expertise, and knowledge of the alien's achievements; or
    (6) Evidence that the alien has either commanded a high salary or 
will command a high salary or other substantial remuneration for 
services in relation to other in the field, as evidenced by contracts or 
other reliable evidence.
    (4) Petition for an O-2 accompanying alien--(i) General. An O-2 
accompanying alien provides essential support to an O-1 artist or 
athlete. Such aliens may not accompany O-1 aliens in the fields of 
science, business, or education. Although the O-2 alien must obtain his 
or her own classification, this classification does not entitle him or 
her to work separate and apart from the O-1 alien to whom he or she 
provides support. An O-2 alien must be petitioned for in conjunction 
with the services of the O-1 alien.
    (ii) Evidentiary criteria for qualifying as an O-2 accompanying 
alien--(A) Alien accompanying an O-1 artist or athlete of extraordinary 
ability. To qualify as an O-2 accompanying alien, the alien

[[Page 309]]

must be coming to the United States to assist in the performance of the 
O-1 alien, be an integral part of the actual performance, and have 
critical skills and experience with the O-1 alien which are not of a 
general nature and which are not possessed by a U.S. worker.
    (B) Alien accompanying an O-1 alien of extraordinary achievement. To 
qualify as an O-2 alien accompanying and O-1 alien involved in a motion 
picture or television production, the alien must have skills and 
experience with the O-1 alien which are not of a general nature and 
which are critical based on a pre-existing longstanding working 
relationship or, with respect to the specific production, because 
significant production (including pre- and post-production work) will 
take place both inside and outside the United States and the continuing 
participation of the alien is essential to the successful completion of 
the production.
    (C) The evidence shall establish the current essentiality, critical 
skills, and experience of the O-2 alien with the O-1 alien and that the 
alien has substantial experience performing the critical skills and 
essential support services for the O-1 alien. In the case of a specific 
motion picture or television production, the evidence shall establish 
that significant production has taken place outside the United States, 
and will take place inside the United States, and that the continuing 
participation of the alien is essential to the successful completion of 
the production.
    (5) Consultation--(i) General. (A) Consultation with an appropriate 
U.S. peer group (which could include a person or persons with expertise 
in the field), labor and/or management organization regarding the nature 
of the work to be done and the alien's qualifications is mandatory 
before a petition for an O-1 or O-2 classification can be approved.
    (B) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) of this section, 
evidence of consultation shall be in the form of a written advisory 
opinion from a peer group (which could include a person or persons with 
expertise in the field), labor and/or management organization with 
expertise in the specific field involved.
    (C) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) of this section, 
the petitioner shall obtain a written advisory opinion from a peer group 
(which could include a person or persons with expertise in the field), 
labor, and/or management organization with expertise in the specific 
field involved. The advisory opinion shall be submitted along with the 
petition when the petition is filed. If the advisory opinion is not 
favorable to the petitioner, the advisory opinion must set forth a 
specific statement of facts which supports the conclusion reached in the 
opinion. Advisory opinions must be submitted in writing and must be 
signed by an authorized official of the group or organization.
    (D) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5)(i)(E) and (G) of this 
section, written evidence of consultation shall be included in the 
record in every approved O petition. Consultations are advisory and are 
not binding on the Service.
    (E) In a case where the alien will be employed in the field of arts, 
entertainment, or athletics, and the Service has determined that a 
petition merits expeditious handling, the Service shall contact the 
appropriate labor and/or management organization and request an advisory 
opinion if one is not submitted by the petitioner. The labor and/or 
management organization shall have 24 hours to respond to the Service's 
request. The Service shall adjudicate the petition after receipt of the 
response from the consulting organization. The labor and/or management 
organization shall then furnish the Service with a written advisory 
opinion within 5 days of the initiating request. If the labor and/or 
management organization fails to respond within 24 hours, the Service 
shall render a decision on the petition without the advisory opinion.
    (F) In a routine processing case where the petition is accompanied 
by a written opinion from a peer group, but the peer group is not a 
labor organization, the Director will forward a copy of the petition and 
all supporting documentation to the national office of the appropriate 
labor organization within 5 days of receipt of the petition. If there

[[Page 310]]

is a collective bargaining representative of an employer's employees in 
the occupational classification for which the alien is being sought, 
that representative shall be the appropriate labor organization for 
purposes of this section. The labor organization will then have 15 days 
from receipt of the petition and supporting documents to submit to the 
Service a written advisory opinion, comment, or letter of no objection. 
Once the 15-day period has expired, the Director shall adjudicate the 
petition in no more than 14 days. The Director may shorten this time in 
his or her discretion for emergency reasons, if no unreasonable burden 
would be imposed on any participant in the process. If the labor 
organization does not respond within 15 days, the Director will render a 
decision on the record without the advisory opinion.
    (G) In those cases where it is established by the petitioner that an 
appropriate peer group, including a labor organization, does not exist, 
the Service shall render a decision on the evidence of record.
    (ii) Consultation requirements for an O-1 alien for extraordinary 
ability--(A) Content. Consultation with a peer group in the area of the 
alien's ability (which may include a labor organization), or a person or 
persons with expertise in the area of the alien's ability, is required 
in an O-1 petition for an alien of extraordinary ability. If the 
advisory opinion is not favorable to the petitioner, the advisory 
opinion must set forth a specific statement of facts which supports the 
conclusion reached in the opinion. If the advisory opinion is favorable 
to the petitioner, it should describe the alien's ability and 
achievements in the field of endeavor, describe the nature of the duties 
to be performed, and state whether the position requires the services of 
an alien of extraordinary ability. A consulting organization may also 
submit a letter of no objection in lieu of the above if it has no 
objection to the approval of the petition.
    (B) Waiver of consultation of certain aliens of extraordinary 
ability in the field of arts. Consultation for an alien of extraordinary 
ability in the field of arts shall be waived by the Director in those 
instances where the alien seeks readmission to the United States to 
perform similar services within 2 years of the date of a previous 
consultation. The director shall, within 5 days of granting the waiver, 
forward a copy of the petition and supporting documentation to the 
national office of an appropriate labor organization. Petitioners 
desiring to avail themselves of the waiver should submit a copy of the 
prior consultation with the petition and advise the Director of the 
waiver request.
    (iii) Consultation requirements for an O-1 alien of extraordinary 
achievement. In the case of an alien of extraordinary achievement who 
will be working on a motion picture or television production, 
consultation shall be made with the appropriate union representing the 
alien's occupational peers and a management organization in the area of 
the alien's ability. If an advisory opinion is not favorable to the 
petitioner, the advisory opinion must set forth a specific statement of 
facts which supports the conclusion reached in the opinion. If the 
advisory opinion is favorable to the petitioner, the written advisory 
opinion from the labor and management organizations should describe the 
alien's achievements in the motion picture or television field and state 
whether the position requires the services of an alien of extraordinary 
achievement. If a consulting organization has no objection to the 
approval of the petition, the organization may submit a letter of no 
objection in lieu of the above.
    (iv) Consultation requirements for an O-2 accompanying alien. 
Consultation with a labor organization with expertise in the skill area 
involved is required for an O-2 alien accompanying an O-1 alien of 
extraordinary ability. In the case of an O-2 alien seeking entry for a 
motion picture or television production, consultation with a labor 
organization and a management organization in the area of the alien's 
ability is required. If an advisory opinion is not favorable to the 
petitioner, the advisory opinion must set forth a specific statement of 
facts which supports the conclusion reached in the opinion. If the 
advisory opinion is favorable to the petitioner, the opinion provided by

[[Page 311]]

the labor and/or management organization should describe the alien's 
essentiality to, and working relationship with, the O-1 artist or 
athlete and state whether there are available U.S. workers who can 
perform the support services. If the alien will accompany an O-1 alien 
involved in a motion picture or television production, the advisory 
opinion should address the alien's skills and experience wit the O-1 
alien and whether the alien has a pre-existing longstanding working 
relationship with the O-1 alien, or whether significant production will 
take place in the United States and abroad and if the continuing 
participation of the alien is essential to the successful completion of 
the production. A consulting organization may also submit a letter of no 
objection in lieu of the above if it has no objection to the approval of 
the petition.
    (v) Organizations agreeing to provide advisory opinions. The Service 
will list in its Operations Instructions for O classification those peer 
groups, labor organizations, and/or management organizations which have 
agreed to provide advisory opinions to the Service and/or petitioners. 
The list will not be an exclusive or exhaustive list. The Service and 
petitioners may use other sources, such as publications, to identify 
appropriate peer groups, labor organizations, and management 
organizations. Additionally, the Service will list in its Operations 
Instructions those occupations or fields of endeavor where the 
nonexistence of an appropriate consulting entity has been verified.
    (6) Approval and validity of petition--(1) Approval. The Director 
shall consider all of the evidence submitted and such other evidence as 
may be independently required to assist in the adjudication. The 
Director shall notify the petitioner of the approval of the petition on 
Form I-797, Notice of Action. The approval notice shall include the 
alien beneficiary name, the classification, and the petition's period of 
validity.
    (ii) Recording the validity of petitions. Procedures for recording 
the validity period of petitions are as follows;
    (A) If a new O petition is approved before the date the petitioner 
indicates the services will begin, the approved petition and approval 
notice shall show the actual dates requested by the petitioner, not to 
exceed the limit specified by paragraph (o)(6)(iii) of this section or 
other Service policy.
    (B) If a new 0 petition is approved after the date the petitioner 
indicates the services will begin, the approved petition and approval 
notice shall generally show a validity period commencing with the date 
of approval and ending with the date requested by the petitioner, not to 
exceed the limit specified by paragraph (o)(6)(iii) of this section or 
other Service policy.
    (C) If the period of services requested by the petitioner exceeds 
the limit specified in paragraph (o)(6)(iii) of this section, the 
petition shall be approved only up to the limit specified in that 
paragraph.
    (iii) Validity--(A) O-1 petition. An approved petition for an alien 
classified under section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Act shall be valid for 
a period of time determined by the Director to be necessary to 
accomplish the event or activity, not to exceed 3 years.
    (B) O-2 petition. An approved petition for an alien classified under 
section 101(a)(15)(O)(ii) of the Act shall be valid for a period of time 
determined to be necessary to assist the O-1 alien to accomplish the 
event or activity, not to exceed 3 years.
    (iv) Spouse and dependents. The spouse and unmarried minor children 
of the O-1 or O-2 alien beneficiary are entitled to O-3 nonimmigrant 
classification, subject to the same period of admission and limitations 
as the alien beneficiary, if they are accompanying or following to join 
the alien beneficiary in the United States. Neither the spouse nor a 
child of the alien beneficiary may accept employment unless he or she 
has been granted employment authorization.
    (7) Denial of petition--(i) Notice of intent to deny. When an 
adverse decision is proposed on the basis of derogatory information of 
which the petitioner is unaware, the Director shall notify the 
petitioner of the intent to deny the petition and the basis for the 
denial. The petitioner may inspect and rebut the evidence and will be 
granted a period of 30 days from the date of the notice in

[[Page 312]]

which to do so. All relevant rebuttal material will be considered in 
making a final decision.
    (ii) Notice of denial. The petitioner shall be notified of the 
decision, the reasons for the denial, and the right to appeal the denial 
under 8 CFR part 103.
    (8) Revocation of approval of petition--(i) General. (A) The 
petitioner shall immediately notify the Service of any changes in the 
terms and conditions of employment of a beneficiary which may affect 
eligibility under section 101(a)(15)(O) of the Act and paragraph (o) of 
this section. An amended petition should be filed when the petitioner 
continues to employ the beneficiary. If the petitioner no longer employs 
the beneficiary, the petitioner shall send a letter explaining the 
change(s) to the Director who approved the petition.
    (B) The Director may revoke a petition at any time, even after the 
validity of the petition has expired.
    (ii) Automatic revocation. The approval of an unexpired petition is 
automatically revoked if the petitioner, or the named employer in a 
petition filed by an agent, goes out of business, files a written 
withdrawal of the petition, or notifies the Service that the beneficiary 
is no longer employed by the petitioner.
    (iii) Revocation on notice--(A) Grounds for revocation. The Director 
shall send to the petitioner a notice of intent to revoke the petition 
in relevant part if is determined that:
    (1) The beneficiary is no longer employed by the petitioner in the 
capacity specified in the petition;
    (2) The statement of facts contained in the petition was not true 
and correct;
    (3) The petitioner violated the terms or conditions of the approved 
petition;
    (4) The petitioner violated the requirements of section 
101(a)(15)(O) of the Act or paragraph (o) of this section; or
    (5) The approval of the petition violated paragraph (o) of this 
section or involved gross error.
    (B) Notice and decision. The notice of intent to revoke shall 
contain a detailed statement of the grounds for the revocation and the 
time period allowed for the petitioner's rebuttal. The petitioner may 
submit evidence in rebuttal within 30 days of the date of the notice. 
The Director shall consider all relevant evidence presented in deciding 
whether to revoke the petition.
    (9) Appeal of a denial or a revocation of a petition--(i) Denial. A 
denied petition may be appealed under 8 CFR part 103.
    (ii) Revocation. A petition that has been revoked on notice may be 
appealed under 8 CFR part 103. Automatic revocations may not be 
appealed.
    (10) Admission. A beneficiary may be admitted to the United States 
for the validity period of the petition, plus a period of up to 10 days 
before the validity period begins and 10 days after the validity period 
ends. The beneficiary may only engage in employment during the validity 
period of the petition.
    (11) Extention of visa petition validity. The petitioner shall file 
a request to extend the validity of the original petition under section 
101(a)(15)(O) of the Act on Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant 
Worker, in order to continue or complete the same activities or events 
specified in the original petition. Supporting documents are not 
required unless requested by the Director. A petition extension may be 
filed only if the validity of the original petition has not expired.
    (12) Extension of stay--(i) Extension procedure. The petitioner 
shall request extension of the alien's stay to continue or complete the 
same event or activity by filing Form I-129, accompanied by a statement 
explaining the reasons for the extension. The petitioner must also 
request a petition extension. The dates of extension shall be the same 
for the petition and the beneficiary's extension of stay. The alien 
beneficiary must be physically present in the United States at the time 
of filing of the extension of stay. Even though the request to extend 
the petition and the alien's stay are combined on the petition, the 
Director shall make a separate determination on each. If the alien 
leaves the United States for business or personal reasons while the 
extension requests are pending, the petitioner may request the Director 
to cable notification of approval of the petition extension to the 
consular office abroad where the alien will apply for a visa.

[[Page 313]]

    (ii) Extension period. An extension of stay may be authorized in 
increments of up to 1 year for an O-1 or O-2 beneficiary to continue or 
complete the same event or activity for which he or she was admitted 
plus an additional 10 days to allow the beneficiary to get his or her 
personal affairs in order.
    (iii) Denial of an extension of stay. The denial of the request for 
the alien's extension of temporary stay may not be appealed.
    (13) Effect of approval of a permanent labor certification or filing 
of a preference petition on O classification. The approval of a 
permanent labor certification or the filing of a preference petition for 
an alien shall not be a basis for denying an O-1 petition, a request to 
extend such a petition, or the alien's application for admission, change 
of status, or extension of stay. The alien may legitimately come to the 
United States for a temporary period as an O-1 nonimmigrant and depart 
voluntarily at the end of his or her authorized stay and, at the same 
time, lawfully seek to become a permanent resident of the United States.
    (14) Effect of a strike. (i) If the Secretary of Labor certifies to 
the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place where 
the beneficiary is to be employed, and that the employment of the 
beneficiary would adversely affect the wages and working conditions of 
U.S. citizens and lawful resident workers:
    (A) A petition to classify an alien as a nonimmigrant as defined in 
section 101(a)(15)(O) of the Act shall be denied; or
    (B) If a petition has been approved, but the alien has not yet 
entered the United States, or has entered the United States but has not 
commenced employment, the approval of the petition is automatically 
suspended, and the application for admission on the basis of the 
petition shall be denied.
    (ii) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute 
is not certified under paragraph (o)(14)(i) of this section, the 
Commissioner shall not deny a petition or suspend an approved petition.
    (iii) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United 
States under an approved petition and is participating in a strike or 
labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such 
strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Secretary of 
Labor, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or 
her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation 
in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers 
but is subject to the following terms and conditions:
    (A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act and regulations promulgated 
thereunder in the same manner as are all other O nonimmigrants;
    (B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not 
modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in 
a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers; 
and
    (C) Although participation by an O nonimmigrant alien in a strike or 
other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not 
constitute a ground for deportation, and alien who violates his or her 
status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized 
period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.
    (15) Use of approval notice, Form I-797. The Service shall notify 
the petitioner of Form I-797 whenever a visa petition or an extension of 
a visa petition is approved under the O classification. The beneficiary 
of an O petition who does not require a nonimmigrant visa may present a 
copy of the approval notice at a Port-of-Entry to facilitate entry into 
the United States. A beneficiary who is required to present a visa for 
admission, and who visa will have expired before the date of his or her 
intended return, may use Form I-797 to apply for a new or revalidated 
visa during the validity period of the petition. A copy of Form I-797 
shall be retained by the beneficiary and presented during the validity 
of the petition when reentering the United States to resume the

[[Page 314]]

same employment with the same petitioner.
    (16) Return transportation requirement. In the case of an alien who 
enters the United States under section 101(a)(15(O) of the Act and whose 
employment terminates for reasons other than voluntary resignation, the 
employer whose offer of employment formed the basis of such nonimmigrant 
status and the petitioner are jointly and severally liable for the 
reasonable cost of return transportation of the alien abroad. For the 
purposes of this paragraph, the term ``abroad'' means the alien's last 
place of residence prior to his or her entry into the United States.
    (p) Artists, athletes, and entertainers--(1) Classifications--(i) 
General. Under section 101(a)(15)(P) of the Act, an alien having a 
residence in a foreign country which he or she has not intention or 
abandoning may be authorized to come to the United States temporarily to 
perform services for an employer or a sponsor. Under the nonimmigrant 
category, the alien may be classified under section 101(a)(15)(P)(i) of 
the Act as an alien who is coming to the United States to perform 
services as an internationally recognized athlete, individually or as 
part of a group or team, or member of an internationally recognized 
entertainment group; under section 101(a)(15)(P)(ii) of the Act, who is 
coming to perform as an artist or entertainer under a reciprocal 
exchange program; under section 101(a)(15)(P)(iii) of the Act, as an 
alien who is coming solely to perform, teach, or coach under a program 
that is culturally unique; or under section 101(a)(15)(P)(iv) of the 
Act, as the spouse or child of an alien described in section 
101(a)(15)(P) (i), (ii), or (iii) of the Act who is accompanying or 
following to join the alien. These classifications are called P-1, P-2, 
P-3, and P-4 respectively. The employer or sponsor must file a petition 
with the Service for review of the services to be performed and for 
determination of the alien's eligibility for P-1, P-2, or P-3 
classification before the alien may apply for a visa or seek admission 
to the United States. This paragraph sets forth the standards and 
procedures applicable to these classifications.
    (ii) Description of classification--(A) A P-1 classification applies 
to an alien who is coming temporarily to the United States:
    (1) To perform at specific athletic competition as an athlete, 
individually or as part of a group or team, at an internationally 
recognized level or performance, or
    (2) To perform with, or as an integral and essential part of the 
performance of, and entertainment group that has been recognized 
internationally as being outstanding in the discipline for a sustained 
and substantial period of time, and who has had a sustained and 
substantial relationship with the group (ordinarily for at least 1 year) 
and provides functions integral to the performance of the group.
    (B) A P-2 classification applies to an alien who is coming 
temporarily to the United States to perform as an artist or entertainer, 
individually or as part of a group, or to perform as an integral part of 
the performance of such a group, and who seeks to perform under a 
reciprocal exchange program which is between an organization or 
organizations in the United States and an organization or organizations 
in one or more foreign states, and which provides for the temporary 
exchange of artists and entertainers, or groups of artists and 
entertainers.
    (C) A P-3 classification applies to an alien artist or entertainer 
who is coming temporarily to the United States, either individually or 
as part of a group, or as an integral part of the performance of the 
group, to perform, teach, or coach under a commercial or noncommercial 
program that is culturally unique.
    (2) Filing of petitions--(i) General. A P-1 petition for an athlete 
or entertainment group shall be filed by a United States employer, a 
United States sponsoring organization, a United States agent, or a 
foreign employer through a United States agent. For purposes of 
paragraph (p) of this section, a foreign employer is any employer who is 
not amenable to service of process in the United States. Foreign 
employers seeking to employ a P-1 alien may not directly petition for 
the alien but must use a United States agent. A United States agent 
petitioning on behalf of a

[[Page 315]]

foreign employer must be authorized to file the petition, and to accept 
service of process in the United States in proceedings under section 
274A of the Act, on behalf of the foreign employer. A P-2 petition for 
an artist or entertainer in a reciprocal exchange program shall be filed 
by the United States labor organization which negotiated the reciprocal 
exchange agreement, the sponsoring organization, or a United States 
employer. A P-3 petition for an artist or entertainer in a culturally 
unique program shall be filed by the sponsoring organization or a United 
States employer. Essential support personnel may not be included on the 
petition filed for the principal alien(s). These aliens require a 
separate petition. Except as provided for in paragraph (p)(2)(iv)(A) of 
this section, the petitioner shall file a P petition on Form I-129, 
Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, with the Service Center which has 
jurisdiction in the area where the alien will work. The petition may not 
be filed more than 6 months before the actual need for the alien's 
services. A P-1, P-2, or P-3 petition shall be adjudicated at the 
appropriate Service Center, even in emergency situations.
    (ii) Evidence required to accompany a petition for a P nonimmigrant. 
Petitions for P nonimmigrant aliens shall be accompanied by the 
following:
    (A) The evidence specified in the specific section of this part for 
the classification;
    (B) Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the 
alien beneficiary or, if there is no written contract, a summary of the 
terms of the oral agreement under which the alien(s) will be employed;
    (C) An explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the 
beginning and ending dates for the events or activities, and a copy of 
any itinerary for the events or activities; and
    (D) A written consultation from a labor organization.
    (iii) Form of documentation. The evidence submitted with an P 
petition should conform to the following:
    (A) Affidavits, contracts, awards, and similar documentation must 
reflect the nature of the alien's achievement and be executed by an 
officer or responsible person employed by the institution, 
establishment, or organization where the work has performed.
    (B) Affidavits written by present or former employers or recognized 
experts certifying to the recognition and extraordinary ability, or, in 
the case of a motion picture or television production, the extraordinary 
achievement of the alien, which shall specifically describe the alien's 
recognition and ability or achievement in factual terms. The affidavit 
must also set forth the expertise of the affiant and the manner in which 
the affiant acquired such information.
    (C) A legible copy of a document in support of the petition may be 
submitted in lieu of the original. However, the original document shall 
be submitted if requested by the Director.
    (iv) Other filing situations--(A) Services in more than one 
location. A petition which requires the alien to work in more than one 
location (e.g., a tour) must include an itinerary with the dates and 
locations of the performances and must be filed with the Service Center 
which has jurisdiction in the area where the petitioner is located. The 
address which the petitioner specifies as its location on the petition 
shall be where the petitioner is located for purposes of this paragraph.
    (B) Services for more than one employer. If the beneficiary or 
beneficiaries will work for more than one employer within the same time 
period, each employer must file a separate petition with the Service 
Center that has jurisdiction over the area where the alien will perform 
the services, unless an agent files the petition pursuant to paragraph 
(p)(2)(iv)(E) of this section.
    (C) Change of employer--(1) General. If a P-1, P-2, or P-3 alien in 
the United States seeks to change employers or sponsors, the new 
employer or sponsor must file both a petition and a request to extend 
the alien's stay in the United States. The alien may not commence 
employment with the new employer or sponsor until the petition and 
request for extension have been approved.
    (2) Traded professional P-1 athletes. In the case of a professional 
P-1 athlete who is traded from one organization to another organization, 
employment authorization for the player will automatically continue for 
a period of 30

[[Page 316]]

days after acquisition by the new organization, within which time the 
new organization is expected to file a new Form I-129 for P-1 
nonimmigrant classification. If a new Form I-129 is not filed within 30 
days, employment authorization will cease. If a new Form I-129 is filed

capacity specified in the petition;
    (2) The statement of facts contained in the petition were not true 
and correct;
    (3) The petitioner violated the terms or conditions of the approved 
petition;
    (4) The petitioner violated requirements of section 101(a)(15)(P) of 
the Act or paragraph (p) of this section; or
    (5) The approval of the petition violated paragraph (p) of this 
section or involved gross error.
    (B) Notice and decision. The notice of intent to revoke shall 
contain a detailed statement of the grounds for the revocation and the 
time period allowed for the petitioner's rebuttal. The petitioner may 
submit evidence in rebuttal within 30 days of the date of the notice. 
The Director shall consider all relevant

[[Page 324]]

evidence presented in deciding whether to revoke the petition.
    (11) Appeal of a denial or a revocation of a petition--(i) Denial. A 
denied petition may be appealed under 8 CFR part 103.
    (ii) Revocation. A petition that has been revoked on notice may be 
appealed under 8 CFR part 103. Automatic revocations may not be 
appealed.
    (12) Admission. A beneficiary may be admitted to the United States 
for the validity period of the petition, plus a period of up to 10 days 
before the validity period begins and 10 days after the validity period 
ends. The beneficiary may not work except during the validity period of 
the petition.
    (13) Extension of visa petition validity. The petitioner shall file 
a request to extend the validity of the original petition under section 
101(a)(15)(P) of the Act on Form I-129 in order to continue or complete 
the same activity or event specified in the original petition. 
Supporting documents are not required unless requested by the Director. 
A petition extension may be filed only if the validity of the original 
petition has not expired.
    (14) Extension of stay--(i) Extension procedure. The petitioner 
shall request extension of the alien's stay to continue or complete the 
same event or activity by filing Form I-129, accompanied by a statement 
explaining the reasons for the extension. The petitioner must also 
request a petition extension. The extension dates shall be the same for 
the petition and the beneficiary's stay. The beneficiary must be 
physically present in the United States at the time the extension of 
stay is filed. Even though the requests to extend the petition and the 
alien's stay are combined on the petition, the Director shall make a 
separate determination on each. If the alien leaves the United States 
for business or personal reasons while the extension requests are 
pending, the petitioner may request the Director to cable notification 
of approval of the petition extension to the consular office abroad 
where the alien will apply for a visa.
    (ii) Extension periods--(A) P-1 individual athlete. An extension of 
stay for a P-1 individual athlete and his or her essential support 
personnel may be authorized for a period up to 5 years for a total 
period of stay not to exceed 10 years.
    (B) Other P-1, P-2, and P-3 aliens. An extension of stay may be 
authorized in increments of 1 year for P-1 athletic teams, entertainment 
groups, aliens in reciprocal exchange programs, aliens in culturally 
unique programs, and their essential support personnel to continue or 
complete the same event or activity for which they were admitted.
    (15) Effect of approval of a permanent labor certification or filing 
of a preference petition on P classification. The approval of a 
permanent labor certification or the filing of a preference petition for 
an alien shall not be a basis for denying a P petition, a request to 
extend such a petition, or the alien's admission, change of status, or 
extension of stay. The alien may legitimately come to the United States 
for a temporary period as a P nonimmigrant and depart voluntarily at the 
end of his or her authorized stay and, at the same time, lawfully seek 
to become a permanent resident of the United States. This provision does 
not include essential support personnel.
    (16) Effect of a strike--(i) If the Secretary of Labor certifies to 
the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers is in progress in the occupation at the place where 
the beneficiary is to be employed, and that the employment of the 
beneficiary would adversely affect the wages and working conditions of 
U.S. citizens and lawful resident workers:
    (A) A petition to classify an alien as a nonimmigrant as defined in 
section 101(a)(15)(P) of the Act shall be denied; or
    (B) If a petition has been approved, but the alien has not yet 
entered the United States, or has entered the United States but has not 
commenced employment, the approval of the petition is automatically 
suspended, and the application for admission of the basis of the 
petition shall be denied.
    (ii) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute 
is not certified under paragraph (p)(16)(i) of this section, the 
Commissioner shall not deny

[[Page 325]]

a petition or suspend an approved petition.
    (iii) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United 
States under an approved petition and is participating in a strike or 
labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such 
strike or other labor dispute has been certified by the Secretary of 
Labor, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain his or 
her status solely on account of past, present, or future participation 
in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers 
but is subject to the following terms and conditions:
    (A) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act and regulations promulgated 
thereunder in the same manner as all other P nonimmigrant aliens;
    (B) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is not 
modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her participation in 
a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers; 
and
    (C) Although participation by a P nonimmigrant alien in a strike or 
other labor dispute involving a work stoppages of workers will not 
constitute a ground for deportation, an alien who violates his or her 
status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized 
period of stay has expired, will be subject to deportation.
    (17) Use of approval of notice, Form I-797. The Service has notify 
the petitioner on Form I-797 whenever a visa petition or an extension of 
a visa petition is approved under the P classification. The beneficiary 
of a P petition who does not require a nonimmigrant visa may present a 
copy of the approved notice at a Port-of-Entry to facilitate entry into 
the United States. A beneficiary who is required to present a visa for 
admission, and whose visa expired before the date of his or her intended 
return, may use Form I-797 to apply for a new or revalidated visa during 
the validity period of the petition. The copy of Form I-797 shall be 
retained by the beneficiary and present during the validity of the 
petition when reentering the United States to resume the same employment 
with the same petitioner.
    (18) Return transportation requirement. In the case of an alien who 
enters the United States under section 101(a)(15)(P) of the Act and 
whose employment terminates for reasons other than voluntary 
resignation, the employer whose offer of employment formed the basis of 
suh nonimmigrant status and the petitioner are jointly and severally 
liable for the reasonable cost of return transporation of the alien 
abroad. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ``abroad'' means 
the alien's last place of residence prior to his or her entry into the 
United States.
    (q) International cultural exchange visitor--(1) Definitions. As 
used in this section:
    Country of nationality means the country of which the participant 
was a national at the time of the petition seeking international 
cultural exchange visitor status for him or her.
    Doing business means the regular, systematic, and continuous 
provision of goods and/or services (including lectures, seminars and 
other types of cultural programs) by a qualified employer which has 
employees, and does not include the mere presence of an agent or office 
of the qualifying employer.
    Duration of program means the time in which a qualified employer is 
conducting an approved cultural exchange program in the manner as 
established by the employer's petition for program approval, provided 
that the period of time does not exceed 15 months.
    International cultural exchange visitor or cultural visitor means an 
alien who has a residence in a foreign country which he or she has no 
intention of abandoning, and who is coming temporarily to the United 
States to take part in an international cultural exchange program 
approved by the Attorney General.
    Petitioner means the employer or its designated agent who has been 
employed by the qualified employer on a permanent basis in an executive 
or managerial capacity. The designated agent must be a United States 
citizen, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an alien 
provided

[[Page 326]]

temporary residence status under sections 210 or 245A of the Act.
    Qualified employer means a United States or foreign firm, 
corporation, non-profit organization, or other legal entity (including 
its U.S. branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, and franchises) which 
administers an international cultural exchange program designated by the 
Attorney General in accordance with the provisions of section 
101(a)(15)(Q) of the Act.
    (2) Admission of cultural visitor--(i) General. A nonimmigrant alien 
may be authorized to enter the United States as a participant in an 
international cultural exchange program approved by the Attorney General 
for the purpose of providing practical training, employment, and the 
sharing of the history, culture, and traditions of the country of the 
alien's nationality. The period of admission is the duration of the 
approved international cultural exchange program or fifteen (15) months, 
whichever is shorter. A nonimmigrant alien admitted under this provision 
is classifiable as a cultural visitor in Q status.
    (ii) Limitation on admission. Any alien who has been admitted into 
the United States as a cultural visitor under section 101(a)(15)(Q) of 
the Act shall not be readmittted in Q status unless the alien has 
resided and been physically present outside the United States for the 
immediate prior year. Brief trips to the United States for pleasure or 
business during the immediate prior year do not break the continuity of 
the one-year foreign residency.
    (3) International cultural exchange program--(i) General. A United 
States employer shall petition the Attorney General on Form I-129, 
Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, for approval of an international 
cultural exchange program which is designed to provide an opportunity 
for the American public to learn about foreign cultures. The United 
States employer must simultaneously petition on the same Form I-129 for 
the authorization for one or more individually identified nonimmigrant 
aliens to be admitted in Q status. These aliens are to be admitted to 
engage in employment or training of which the essential element is the 
sharing with the American public, or a segment of the public sharing a 
common cultural interest, of the culture of the alien's country of 
nationality. The cultural visitor's eligibility for admission will be 
considered only if the international cultural exchange program is 
approved.
    (ii) Program validity. Each petition for an international cultural 
exchange program will be approved for the duration of the program, which 
may not exceed 15 months, plus 30 days to allow time for the 
participants to make travel arrangements. Subsequent to the approval of 
the initial petition, a new petition must be filed each time the 
qualified employer wishes to bring in additional cultural visitors. A 
qualified employer may replace or substitute a participant named on a 
previously approved petition for the remainder of the program in 
accordance with paragraph (q)(6) of this section. The replacement or 
substituting alien may be admitted in Q status until the expiration date 
of the approved petition.
    (iii) Requirements for program approval. An international cultural 
exchange program must meet all of the following requirements:
    (A) Accessibility to the public. The international cultural exchange 
program must take place in a school, museum, business or other 
establishment where the American public, or a segment of the public 
sharing a common cultural interest, is exposed to aspects of a foreign 
culture as part of a structured program. Activities that take place in a 
private home or an isolated business setting to which the American 
public, or a segment of the public sharing a common cultural interest, 
does not have direct access do not qualify.
    (B) Cultural component. The international cultural exchange program 
must have a cultural component which is an essential and integral part 
of the cultural visitor's employment or training. The cultural component 
must be designed, on the whole, to exhibit or explain the attitude, 
customs, history, heritage, philosophy, or traditions of the cultural 
visitor's country of nationality. A cultural component may include 
structured instructional activities such as seminars, courses, lecture 
series, or language camps.

[[Page 327]]

    (C) Work component. The cultural visitor's employment or training in 
the United States may not be independent of the cultural component of 
the international cultural exchange program. The work component must 
serve as the vehicle to achieve the objectives of the cultural 
component. The sharing of the culture of the cultural visitor's country 
of nationality must result from his or her employment or training with 
the qualified employer in the United States.
    (iv) Requirements for cultural visitors. To be eligible for cultural 
visitor status, an alien must be a bona fide nonimmigrant who:
    (A) Is at least 18 years of age at the time the petition is filed;
    (B) Is qualified to perform the service or labor or receive the type 
of training stated in the petition;
    (C) Has the ability to communicate effectively about the cultural 
attributes of his or her country of nationality to the American public; 
and
    (D) Has resided and been physically present outside of the United 
States for the immediate prior year, if he or she was previously 
admitted as a cultural visitor.
    (4) Supporting documentation--(i) Documentation by the employer. To 
establish eligibility as a qualified employer, the petitioner must 
submit with the completed Form I-129 appropriate evidence that the 
employer:
    (A) Maintains an established international cultural exchange program 
in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraph (q)(3) of 
this section;
    (B) Has designated a qualified employee as a representative who will 
be responsible for administering the international cultural exchange 
program and who will serve as liaison with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service;
    (C) Is actively doing business in the United States;
    (D) Will offer the alien(s) wages and working conditions comparable 
to those accorded local domestic workers similarly employed; and
    (E) Has the financial ability to remunerate the participant(s).
    (ii) Certification by petitioner. (A) The petitioner must give the 
date of birth, country of nationality, level of education, position 
title, and a brief job description for each cultural visitor included in 
the petition. The petitioner must verify and certify that the 
prospective participants are qualified to perform the service or labor, 
or receive the type of training, described in the petition.
    (B) The petitioner must report the cultural visitors' wages and 
certify that such cultural exchange visitors are offered wages and 
working conditions comparable to those accorded to local domestic 
workers similarly employed.
    (iii) Supporting documentation as prescribed in paragraphs (q)(4)(i) 
and (q)(4)(ii) of this section must accompany a petition filed on Form 
I-129 in all cases except where the employer files multiple petitions in 
the same calendar year. When petitioning to repeat a previously approved 
cultural exchange program, a copy of the initial program approval notice 
may be submitted in lieu of the documentation required under paragraph 
(q)(4)(i) of this section. The Service will request additional 
documentation only when clarification is needed.
    (5) Filing of petitions--(i) General. A United States employer 
seeking to bring in cultural visitors must file a petition on Form I-
129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, with the applicable fee, along 
with appropriate documentation. The petition and accompanying 
documentation should be filed with either the service center having 
jurisdiction over the employer's headquarters or the service center 
having jurisdiction over the area where the cultural visitors will 
perform services or labor or will receive training. A new petition on 
Form I-129, with the applicable fee, must be filed with the appropriate 
service center each time a qualified employer wants to bring in 
additional cultural visitors. Each person named on an approved petition 
will be admitted only for the duration of the approved program. 
Replacement or substitution may be made for any person named on an 
approved petition as provided in paragraph (q)(6) of this section, but 
only for the remainder of the approved program.
    (ii) Petition for multiple participants. The petitioner may include 
more than

[[Page 328]]

one participant on the petition. The petitioner shall include the name, 
date of birth, nationality, and other identifying information required 
on the petition for each participant. The petitioner must also indicate 
the United States consulate at which each participant will apply for a Q 
visa. For participants who are visa-exempt under 8 CFR 212.1(a), the 
petitioner must indicate the port of entry at which each participant 
will apply for admission to the United States.
    (iii) Service, labor, or training in more than one location. A 
petition which requires the cultural visitor to engage in employment or 
training (with the same employer) in more than one location must include 
an itinerary with the dates and locations of the services, labor, or 
training.
    (iv) Services, labor, or training for more than one employer. If the 
cultural visitor will perform services or labor for, or receive training 
from, more than one employer, each employer must file a separate 
petition with the service center having jurisdiction over the area where 
the alien will perform services or labor, or receive training. The 
cultural visitor may work part-time for multiple employers provided that 
each employer has an approved petition for the alien.
    (v) Change of employers. If a cultural visitor is in the United 
States under section 101(a)(15)(Q) of the Act and decides to change 
employers, the new employer must file a petition. However, the total 
period of time the cultural visitor may stay in the United States 
remains limited to fifteen (15) months.
    (6) Substitution or replacement of participants. The petitioner may 
substitute for or replace a person named on a previously approved 
petition for the remainder of the program without filing a new Form I-
129. The substituting cultural visitor must meet the qualification 
requirements prescribed in paragraph (q)(3)(iv) of this section. To 
request substitution or replacement, the petitioner shall, by letter, 
notify the consular office at which the alien will apply for a visa or, 
in the case of visa-exempt aliens, the Service office at the port of 
entry where the alien will apply for admission. A copy of the petition's 
approval notice must be included with the letter. The petitioner must 
state the date of birth, country of nationality, level of education, and 
position title of each prospective cultural visitor and must certify 
that each is qualified to perform the service or labor or receive the 
type of training described in the approved petition. The petitioner must 
also indicate each cultural visitor's wages and certify that the 
cultural visitor is offered wages and working conditions comparable to 
those accorded to local domestic workers in accordance with paragraph 
(q)(11)(ii) of this section.
    (7) Approval of petition--(i) The director shall consider all the 
evidence submitted and request other evidence as he or she may deem 
necessary.
    (ii) The director shall notify the petitioner and the appropriate 
United States consulate(s) of the approval of a petition. For 
participants who are visa-exempt under 8 CFR 212.1(a), the director 
shall give notice of the approval to the director of the port of entry 
at which each such participant will apply for admission to the United 
States. The notice of approval shall include the name of the cultural 
visitors, their classification, and the petition's period of validity.
    (iii) An approved petition for an alien classified under section 
101(a)(15)(Q) of the Act is valid for the length of the approved program 
or fifteen (15) months, whichever is shorter.
    (iv) A petition shall not be approved for an alien who has an 
aggregate of fifteen (15) months in the United States under section 
101(a)(15)(Q) of the Act, unless the alien has resided and been 
physically present outside the United States for the immediate prior 
year.
    (8) Denial of the petition--(i) Notice of denial. The petitioner 
shall be notified of the denial of a petition, the reasons for the 
denial, and the right to appeal the denial under part 103 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) Multiple participants. A petition for multiple cultural 
visitors may be denied in whole or in part.
    (9) Revocation of approval of petition--(i) General. The petitioner 
shall immediately notify the appropriate Service

[[Page 329]]

center of any changes in the employment of a participant which would 
affect eligibility under paragraph (q) of this section.
    (ii) Automatic revocation. The approval of any petition is 
automatically revoked if the qualifying employer goes out of business, 
files a written withdrawal of the petition, or terminates the approved 
international cultural exchange program prior to its expiration date.
    (iii) Revocation on notice. The director shall send the petitioner a 
notice of intent to revoke the petition in whole or in part if he or she 
finds that:
    (A) The cultural visitor is no longer employed by the petitioner in 
the capacity specified in the petition, or if the cultural visitor is no 
longer receiving training as specified in the petition;
    (B) The statement of facts contained in the petition was not true 
and correct;
    (C) The petitioner violated the terms and conditions of the approved 
petition; or
    (D) The Service approved the petition in error.
    (iv) Notice and decision. The notice of intent to revoke shall 
contain a detailed statement of the grounds for the revocation and the 
period of time allowed for the petitioner's rebuttal. The petitioner may 
submit evidence in rebuttal within 30 days of receipt of the notice. The 
director shall consider all relevant evidence presented in deciding 
whether to revoke the petition in whole or in part. If the petition is 
revoked in part, the remainder of the petition shall remain approved and 
a revised approval notice shall be sent to the petitioner with the 
revocation notice.
    (v) Appeal of a revocation of a petition. Revocation with notice of 
a petition in whole or in part may be appealed to the Associate 
Commissioner for Examinations under part 103 of this chapter. Automatic 
revocation may not be appealed.
    (10) Extension of stay. An alien's total period of stay in the 
United States under section 101(a)(15)(Q) of the Act cannot exceed 
fifteen (15) months. The authorized stay of a cultural visitor may be 
extended within the 15-month limit if he or she is the beneficiary of a 
new petition filed in accordance with paragraph (q)(3) of this section. 
The new petition, if filed by the same employer, should include a copy 
of the previous petition's approval notice and a letter from the 
petitioner indicating any terms and conditions of the previous petition 
that have changed.
    (11) Employment provisions--(i) General. An alien classified under 
section 101(a)(15)(Q) of the Act may be employed only by the qualified 
employer through which the alien attained Q nonimmigrant status. An 
alien in this class is not required to apply for an employment 
authorization document. Employment outside the specific program violates 
the terms of the alien's Q nonimmigrant status within the meaning of 
section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
    (ii) Wages and working conditions. The wages and working conditions 
of a cultural visitor must be comparable to those accorded to domestic 
workers similarly employed in the geographical area of the alien's 
employment. The employer must certify on the petition that such 
conditions are met as in accordance with paragraph (q)(4)(iii)(B) of 
this section.
    (r) Religious workers--(1) General. Under section 101(a)(15)(R) of 
the Act, an alien who, for at least the two (2) years immediately 
preceding the time of application for admission, has been a member of a 
religious denomination having a bona fide nonprofit religious 
organization in the United States, may be admitted temporarily to the 
United States to carry on the activities of a religious worker for a 
period not to exceed five (5) years. The alien must be coming to the 
United States for one of the following purposes: solely to carry on the 
vocation of a minister of the religious denomination; to work for the 
religious organization at the request of the organization in a 
professional capacity; or to work for the organization, or a bona fide 
organization which is affiliated with the religious denomination, at the 
request of the organization in a religious vocation or occupation.
    (2) Definitions. As used in this section:

[[Page 330]]

    Bona fide nonprofit religious organization in the United States 
means an organization exempt from taxation as described in section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as it relates to 
religious organizations, or one that has never sought such exemption but 
establishes to the satisfaction of the Service that it would be eligible 
therefor if it had applied for tax exempt status.
    Bona fide organization which is affiliated with the religious 
denomination means an organization which is both closely associated with 
the religious denomination and exempt from taxation as described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as it relates to 
religious organizations.
    Minister means an individual duly authorized by a recognized 
religious denomination to conduct religious worship and to perform other 
duties usually performed by authorized members of the clergy of that 
religion. In all cases, there must be a reasonable connection between 
the activities performed and the religious calling of the minister. The 
term does not include a lay preacher not authorized to perform such 
duties.
    Professional capacity means an activity in a religious vocation or 
occupation for which the minimum of a United States baccalaureate degree 
or a foreign equivalent degree is required.
    Religious denomination means a religious group or community of 
believers having some form of ecclesiastical government, a creed or 
statement of faith, some form of worship, a formal or informal code of 
doctrine and discipline, religious services and ceremonies, established 
places of religious worship, and religious congregations, or comparable 
indicia of a bona fide religious denomination. For the purposes of this 
definition, an interdenominational religious organization which is 
exempt from taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 will be treated as a religious denomination.
    Religious occupation means an activity which relates to a 
traditional religious function. Examples of persons in religious 
occupations include, but are not limited to, liturgical workers, 
religious instructors, religious conselors, cantors, catechists, workers 
in religious hospitals or religious health care facilities, 
missionaries, religious translators, or religious broadcasters. This 
group does not include janitors, maintenance workers, clerks, fund 
raisers, or persons involved solely in the solicitation of donations.
    Religious vocation means a calling to religious life evidenced by 
the demonstration of commitment practiced in the religious denomination, 
such as the taking of vows. Examples of persons with a religious 
vocation include, but are not limited to, nuns, monks, and religious 
brothers and sisters.
    (3) Initial evidence. An alien seeking classification as a 
nonimmigrant religious worker shall present to a United States consular 
officer, or, if visa exempt, to an immigration officer at a United 
States port of entry, documentation which establishes to the 
satisfaction of the consular or immigration officer that the alien will 
be providing services to a bona fide nonprofit religious organization in 
the United States or to an affiliated religious organization as defined 
in paragraph (r)(2) of this section, and that the alien meets the 
criteria to perform such services. If the alien is in the United States 
in another valid nonimmigrant classification and desires to change 
nonimmigrant status to classification as a nonimmigrant religious 
worker, this documentation should be presented with an application for 
change of status (Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker). The 
documentation shall consist of:
    (i) Evidence that the organization qualifies as a non-profit 
organization, in the form of either:
    (A) Documentation showing that it is exempt from taxation in 
accordance with section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
as it relates to religious organizations (in appropriate cases, evidence 
of the organization's assets and methods of operation and the 
organization's papers of incorporation under applicable State law may be 
requested); or
    (B) Such documentation as is required by the Internal Revenue 
Service to establish eligibility for exemption under section 501(c)(3) 
of the Internal

[[Page 331]]

Revenue Code of 1986 as it relates to religious organizations; and
    (ii) A letter from an authorized official of the specific 
organizational unit of the religious organization which will be 
employing the alien or engaging the alien's services in the United 
States. If the alien is to be employed, this letter should come from the 
organizational unit that will maintain the alien's Form I-9, Employment 
Eligibility Verification, that is, the organizational unit that is 
either paying the alien a salary or otherwise remunerating the alien in 
exchange for services rendered. This letter must establish:
    (A) That, if the alien's religious membership was maintained, in 
whole or in part, outside the United States, the foreign and United 
States religious organizations belong to the same religious 
denomination;
    (B) That, immediately prior to the application for the nonimmigrant 
visa or application for admission to the United States, the alien has 
the required two (2) years of membership in the religious denomination;
    (C) As appropriate:
    (1) That, if the alien is a minister, he or she is authorized to 
conduct religious worship for that denomination and to perform other 
duties usually performed by authorized members of the clergy of that 
denomination, including a detailed description of those duties;
    (2) That, if the alien is a religious professional, he or she has at 
least a United States baccalaureate degree or its foreign equivalent and 
that at least such a degree is required for entry into the religious 
profession; or
    (3) That, if the alien is to work in another religious vocation or 
occupation, he or she is qualified in the religious vocation or 
occupation. Evidence of such qualifications may include, but need not be 
limited to, evidence establishing that the alien is a monk, nun, or 
religious brother or that the type of work to be done relates to a 
traditional religious function;
    (D) The arrangements made, if any, for remuneration for services to 
be rendered by the alien, including the amount and source of any salary, 
a description of any other types of remuneration to be received 
(including housing, food, clothing, and any other benefits to which a 
monetary value may be affixed), and a statement whether such 
remuneration shall be in exchange for services rendered;
    (E) The name and location of the specific organizational unit of the 
religious organization for which the alien will be providing services 
within the United States; and
    (F) If the alien is to work in a non-ministerial and nonprofessional 
capacity for a bona fide organization which is affiliated with a 
religious denomination, the existence of the affiliation; and
    (iii) Any appropriate additional evidence which the examining 
officer may request relating to the religious organization, the alien, 
or the affiliated organization. Such additional documentation may 
include, but need not be limited to, diplomas, degrees, financial 
statements, or certificates of ordination. No prior petition, labor 
certification, or prior approval shall be required.
    (4) Initial admission. The initial admission of a religious worker, 
spouse, and unmarried children under twenty-one years of age shall not 
exceed three (3) years. A Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, shall be 
provided to every alien who qualifies for admission as an R 
nonimmigrant. The Form I-94 for the religious worker shall be endorsed 
with the name and location of the specific organizational unit of the 
religious organization for which the alien will be providing services 
within the United States. The admission symbol for the religious worker 
shall be R-1; the admission symbol for the worker's spouse and childen 
shall be R-2.
    (5) Extension of stay. The organizational unit of the religious 
organization employing the nonimmigrant religious worker admitted under 
this section shall use Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, 
along with the appropriate fee, to extend the stay of the worker. The 
petition shall be filed at the Service Center having jurisdiction over 
the place of employment. An extension may be authorized for a period of 
up to two (2) years. The worker's total period of stay may not exceed 
five (5) years. The petition must

[[Page 332]]

be accompanied by a letter from an authorized official of the 
organizational unit confirming the worker's continuing eligibility for 
classification as an R-1 nonimmigrant.
    (6) Change of employers. A different or additional organizational 
unit of the religious denomination seeking to employ or engage the 
services of a religious worker admitted under this section shall file 
Form I-129 with the appropriate fee. The petition shall be filed with 
the Service Center having jurisdiction over the place of employment. The 
petition must be accompanied by evidence establishing that the alien 
will continue to qualify as a religious worker under this section. Any 
unauthorized change to a new religious organizational unit will 
constitute a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 
241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
    (7) Limitation on stay. An alien who has spent five (5) years in the 
United States under section 101(a)(15)(R) of the Act may not be 
readmitted to the United States under the R visa classification unless 
the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United 
States for the immediate prior year, except for brief visits for 
business or pleasure. Such visits do not end the period during which an 
alien is considered to have resided and been physically present outside 
the United States, but time spent during such visits does not count 
toward the requirement of this paragraph.
    (8) Spouse and children. The religious worker's spouse and unmarried 
children under twenty-one years of age are entitled to the same 
nonimmigrant classification and length of stay as the religious worker, 
if the religious worker will be employed and residing primarily in the 
United States, and if the spouse and unmarried minor children are 
accompanying or following to join the religious worker in the United 
States. Neither the spouse nor any child may accept employment while in 
the United States in R-2 nonimmigrant status.
    (s) NATO nonimmigrant aliens--(1) General--(i) Background. The North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is constituted of nations signatory 
to the North Atlantic Treaty. The Agreement Between the Parties to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their Forces, signed in 
London, June 1951 (NATO Status of Forces Agreement), is the agreement 
between those nations that defines the terms of the status of their 
armed forces while serving abroad.
    (A) Nonimmigrant aliens classified as NATO-1 through NATO-5 are 
officials, employees, or persons associated with NATO, and members of 
their immediate families, who may enter the United States in accordance 
with the NATO Status of Forces Agreement or the Protocol on the Status 
of International Military Headquarters set up pursuant to the North 
Atlantic Treaty (Paris Protocol). The following specific classifications 
shall be assigned to such NATO nonimmigrants:
    (1) NATO-1--A principal permanent representative of a Member State 
to NATO (including any of its subsidiary bodies) resident in the United 
States and resident members of permanent representative's official 
staff; Secretary General, Deputy Secretary General, Assistant 
Secretaries General and Executive Secretary of NATO; other permanent 
NATO officials of similar rank; and the members of the immediate family 
of such persons.
    (2) NATO-2--Other representatives of Member States to NATO 
(including any of its subsidiary bodies) including representatives, 
advisers and technical experts of delegations, and the members of the 
immediate family of such persons; dependents of members of a force 
entering in accordance with the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces 
Agreement or in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Protocol; 
members of such a force, if issued visas.
    (3) NATO-3--Official clerical staff accompanying a representative of 
a Member State to NATO (including any of its subsidiary bodies) and the 
members of the immediate family of such persons.
    (4) NATO-4--Officials of NATO (other than those classifiable under 
NATO-1) and the members of their immediate family
    (5) NATO-5--Experts, other than NATO officials classifiable under 
NATO-4, employed on missions on behalf of NATO and their dependents.

[[Page 333]]

    (B) Nonimmigrant aliens classified as NATO-6 are civilians, and 
members of their immediate families, who may enter the United States as 
employees of a force entering in accordance with the NATO Status of 
Forces Agreement, or as members of a civilian component attached to or 
employed by NATO Headquarters, Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic 
(SACLANT), set up pursuant to the Paris Protocol.
    (C) Nonimmigrant aliens classified as NATO-7 are attendants, 
servants, or personal employees of nonimmigrant aliens classified as 
NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, and NATO-6, who are authorized 
to work only for the NATO-1 through NATO-6 nonimmigrant from whom they 
derive status, and members of their immediate families.
    (ii) Admission and extension of stay. NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-
4, and NATO-5 aliens are normally exempt from inspection under 8 CFR 
235.1(c). NATO-6 aliens may be authorized admission for duration of 
status. NATO-7 aliens may be admitted for not more than 3 years and may 
be granted extensions of temporary stay in increments of not more than 2 
years. In addition, an application for extension of temporary stay for a 
NATO-7 alien must be accompanied by a statement signed by the employing 
official stating that he or she intends to continue to employ the NATO-7 
applicant, describing the work the applicant will perform, and 
acknowledging that this is, and will be, the sole employment of the 
NATO-7 applicant.
    (2) Definition of a dependent of a NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, 
NATO-5, or NATO-6. For purposes of employment in the United States, the 
term dependent of a NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 
principal alien, as used in this section, means any of the following 
immediate members of the family habitually residing in the same 
household as the NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 
principal alien assigned to official duty in the United States:
    (i) Spouse;
    (ii) Unmarried children under the age of 21;
    (iii) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 23 who are in 
full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational 
institutions;
    (iv) Unmarried sons or daughters under the age of 25 who are in 
full-time attendance as students at post-secondary educational 
institutions if a formal bilateral employment agreement permitting their 
employment in the United States was signed prior to November 21, 1988, 
and such bilateral employment agreements do not specify under the age of 
23 as the maximum age for employment of such sons and daughters;
    (v) Unmarried sons or daughters who are physically or mentally 
disabled to the extent that they cannot adequately care for themselves 
or cannot establish, maintain, or re-establish their own households. The 
Service may require medical certification(s) as it deems necessary to 
document such mental or physical disability.
    (3) Dependent employment requirements based on formal bilateral 
employment agreements and informal de facto reciprocal arrangements--(i) 
Formal bilateral employment agreements. The Department of State's Family 
Liaison office (FLO) shall maintain all listing of NATO Member States 
which have entered into formal bilateral employment agreements that 
include NATO personnel. A dependent of a NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, 
NATO-5, or NATO-6 principal alien assigned to official duty in the 
United States may accept, or continue in, unrestricted employment based 
on such formal bilateral agreement upon favorable recommendation by 
SACLANT, pursuant to paragraph (s)(5) of this section, and issuance of 
employment authorization documentation by the Service in accordance with 
8 CFR part 274a. The application procedures are set forth in paragraph 
(s)(5) of this section.
    (ii) Informal de facto reciprocal arrangements. For purposes of this 
section, an informal de facto reciprocal arrangement exists when the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense, Foreign Military Rights Affairs 
(OSD/FMRA), certifies, with State Department concurrence, that a NATO 
Member State allows appropriate employment in the

[[Page 334]]

local economy for dependents of members of the force and members of the 
civilian component of the United States assigned to duty in the NATO 
Member State. OSD/FMRA and State's FLO shall maintain a listing of 
countries with which such reciprocity exists. Dependents of a NATO-1, 
NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 principal alien assigned to 
official duty in the United States may be authorized to accept, or 
continue in, employment based upon informal de facto arrangements upon 
favorable recommendation by SACLANT, pursuant to paragraph (s)(5) of 
this section, and issuance of employment authorization by the Service in 
accordance with 8 CFR part 274a. Additionally, the application 
procedures set forth in paragraph (s)(5) of this section must be 
complied with, and the following conditions must be met:
    (A) Both the principal alien and the dependent requesting employment 
are maintaining NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 
status, as appropriate;
    (B) The principal alien's total length of assignment in the United 
States is expected to last more than 6 months;
    (C) Employment of a similar nature for dependents of members of the 
force and members of the civilian component of the United States 
assigned to official duty in the NATO Member State employing the 
principal alien is not prohibited by the NATO Member State;
    (D) The proposed employment is not in an occupation listed in the 
Department of Labor's Schedule B (20 CFR part 656), or otherwise 
determined by the Department of Labor to be one for which there is an 
oversupply of qualified United States workers in the area of proposed 
employment. This Schedule B restriction does not apply to a dependent 
son or daughter who is a full-time student if the employment is part-
time, consisting of not more than 20 hours per week, of if it is 
temporary employment of not more than 12 weeks during school holiday 
periods; and
    (E) The proposed employment is not contrary to the interest of the 
United States. Employment contrary to the interest of the United States 
includes, but is not limited to, the employment of NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-
3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 dependents who have criminal records; who 
have violated United States immigration laws or regulations, or visa 
laws or regulations; who have worked illegally in the United States; or 
who cannot establish that they have paid taxes and social security on 
income from current or previous United States employment.
    (iii) State's FLO shall inform the Service, by contacting 
Headquarters, Adjudications, Attention: Chief, Business and Trade 
Services Branch, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536, of any 
additions or changes to the formal bilateral employment agreements and 
informal de facto reciprocal arrangements.
    (4) Applicability of a formal bilateral agreement or an informal de 
facto arrangement for NATO-1, NATO-2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, or NATO-6 
dependents. The applicability of a formal bilateral agreement shall be 
based on the NATO Member State which employs the principal alien and not 
on the nationality of the principal alien or dependent. The 
applicability of an informal de facto arrangement shall be based on the 
NATO Member State which employs the principal alien, and the principal 
alien also must be a national of the NATO Member State which employs him 
or her in the United States. Dependents of SACLANT employees receive 
bilateral agreement or de facto arrangement employment privileges as 
appropriate based upon the nationality of the SACLANT employee 
(principal alien).
    (5) Application procedures. The following procedures are required 
for dependent employment applications under bilateral agreements and de 
facto arrangements:
    (i) The dependent of a NATO alien shall submit a complete 
application for employment authorization, including Form I-765 and Form 
I-566, completed in accordance with the instructions on, or attached to, 
those forms. The complete application shall be submitted to SACLANT for 
certification of the Form I-566 and forwarding to the Service.
    (ii) In a case where a bilateral dependent employment agreement 
containing a numerical limitation on the number of dependents authorized 
to

[[Page 335]]

work is applicable, the certifying officer of SACLANT shall not forward 
the application for employment authorization to the Service unless, 
following consultation with State's Office of Protocol, the certifying 
officer has confirmed that this numerical limitation has not been 
reached. The countries with such limitations are indicated on the 
bilateral/de facto dependent employment listing issued by State's FLO.
    (iii) SACLANT shall keep copies of each application and certified 
Form I-566 for 3 years from the date of the certification.
    (iv) A dependent applying under the terms of a de facto arrangement 
must also attach a statement from the prospective employer which 
includes the dependent's name, a description of the position offered, 
the duties to be performed, the hours to be worked, the salary offered, 
and verification that the dependent possesses the qualifications for the 
position.
    (v) A dependent applying under paragraph (s)(2) (iii) or (iv) of 
this section must also submit a certified statement from the post-
secondary educational institution confirming that he or she is pursuing 
studies on a full-time basis.
    (vi) A dependent applying under paragraph (s)(2)(v) of this section 
must also submit medical certification regarding his or her condition. 
The certification should identify both the dependent and the certifying 
physician, give the physician's phone number, identify the condition, 
describe the symptoms, provide a clear prognosis, and certify that the 
dependent is unable to maintain a home of his or her own.
    (vii) The Service may require additional supporting documentation, 
but only after consultation with SACLANT.
    (6) Period of time for which employment may be authorized. If 
approved, an application to accept or continue employment under this 
paragraph shall be granted in increments of not more than 3 years.
    (7) Income tax and Social Security liability. Dependents who are 
granted employment authorization under this paragraph are responsible 
for payment of all Federal, state, and local income taxes, employment 
and related taxes and Social Security contributions on any remuneration 
received.
    (8) No appeal. There shall be no appeal from a denial of permission 
to accept or continue employment under this paragraph.
    (9) Unauthorized employment. An alien classified as a NATO-1, NATO-
2, NATO-3, NATO-4, NATO-5, NATO-6, or NATO-7 who is not a NATO principal 
alien and who engages in employment outside the scope of, or in a manner 
contrary to, this paragraph may be considered in violation of status 
pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act. A NATO principal alien 
in those classifications who engages in employment outside the scope of 
his or her official position may be considered in violation of status 
pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.
    (t) Alien witnesses and informants--(1) Alien witness or informant 
in criminal matter. An alien may be classified as an S-5 alien witness 
or informant under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(S)(i) of the Act 
if, in the exercise of discretion pursuant to an application on Form I-
854 by an interested federal or state law enforcement authority 
(``LEA''), it is determined by the Commissioner that the alien:
    (i) Possesses critical reliable information concerning a criminal 
organization or enterprise;
    (ii) Is willing to supply, or has supplied, such information to 
federal or state LEA; and
    (iii) Is essential to the success of an authorized criminal 
investigation or the successful prosecution of an individual involved in 
the criminal organization or enterprise.
    (2) Alien witness or informant in counterterrorism matter. An alien 
may be classified as an S-6 alien counterterrorism witness or informant 
under the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(S)(ii) of the Act if it is 
determined by the Secretary of State and the Commissioner acting 
jointly, in the exercise of their discretion, pursuant to an application 
on Form I-854 by an interested federal LEA, that the alien:
    (i) Possesses critical reliable information concerning a terrorist 
organization, enterprise, or operation;

[[Page 336]]

    (ii) Is willing to supply or has supplied such information to a 
federal LEA;
    (iii) Is in danger or has been placed in danger as a result of 
providing such information; and
    (iv) Is eligible to receive a reward under section 36(a) of the 
State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, 22 U.S.C. 2708(a).
    (3) Spouse, married and unmarried sons and daughters, and parents of 
alien witness or informant in criminal or counterterrorism matter. An 
alien spouse, married or unmarried son or daughter, or parent of an 
alien witness or informant may be granted derivative S classification 
(S-7) when accompanying, or following to join, the alien witness or 
informant if, in the exercise of discretion by, with respect to 
paragraph (t)(1) of this section, the Commissioner, or, with respect to 
paragraph (t)(2) of this section, the Secretary of State and the 
Commissioner acting jointly, consider it to be appropriate. A 
nonimmigrant in such derivative S-7 classification shall be subject to 
the same period of admission, limitations, and restrictions as the alien 
witness or informant and must be identified by the requesting LEA on the 
application Form I-854 in order to qualify for S nonimmigrant 
classification. Family members not identified on the Form I-854 
application will not be eligible for S nonimmigrant classification.
    (4) Request for S nonimmigrant classification. An application on 
Form I-854, requesting S nonimmigrant classification for a witness or 
informant, may only be filed by a federal or state LEA (which shall 
include a federal or state court or a United States Attorney's Office) 
directly in need of the information to be provided by the alien witness 
or informant. The completed application is filed with the Assistant 
Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice, who will 
forward only properly certified applications that fall within the 
numerical limitation to the Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, for approval, pursuant to the following process.
    (i) Filing request. For an alien to qualify for status as an S 
nonimmigrant, S nonimmigrant classification must be requested by an LEA. 
The LEA shall recommend an alien for S nonimmigrant classification by: 
Completing Form I-854, with all necessary endorsements and attachments, 
in accordance with the instructions on, or attached to, that form, and 
agreeing, as a condition of status, that no promises may be, have been, 
or will be made by the LEA that the alien will or may remain in the 
United States in S or any other nonimmigrant classification or parole, 
adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident, or otherwise attempt 
to remain beyond a 3-year period other than by the means authorized by 
section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act. The alien, including any derivative 
beneficiary who is 18 years or older, shall sign a statement, that is 
part of or affixed to Form I-854, acknowledging awareness that he or she 
is restricted by the terms of S nonimmigrant classification to the 
specific terms of section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act as the exclusive 
means by which he or she may remain permanently in the United States.
    (A) District director referral. Any district director or Service 
officer who receives a request by an alien, an eligible LEA, or other 
entity seeking S nonimmigrant classification shall advise the requestor 
of the process and the requirements for applying for S nonimmigrant 
classification. Eligible LEAs seeking S nonimmigrant classification 
shall be referred to the Commissioner.
    (B) United States Attorney certification. The United States Attorney 
with jurisdiction over a prosecution or investigation that forms the 
basis for a request for S nonimmigrant classification must certify and 
endorse the application on Form I-854 and agree that no promises may be, 
have been, or will be made that the alien will or may remain in the 
United States in S or any other nonimmigrant classification or parole, 
adjust status to lawful permanent resident, or attempt to remain beyond 
the authorized period of admission.
    (C) LEA certification. LEA certifications on Form I-854 must be made 
at the seat-of-government level, if federal, or the highest level of the 
state LEA involved in the matter. With respect to the alien for whom S 
nonimmigrant

[[Page 337]]

classification is sought, the LEA shall provide evidence in the form of 
attachments establishing the nature of the alien's cooperation with the 
government, the need for the alien's presence in the United States, all 
conduct or conditions which may constitute a ground or grounds of 
excludability, and all factors and considerations warranting a favorable 
exercise of discretionary waiver authority by the Attorney General on 
the alien's behalf. The attachments submitted with a request for S 
nonimmigrant classification may be in the form of affidavits, 
statements, memoranda, or similar documentation. The LEA shall review 
Form I-854 for accuracy and ensure the alien understands the 
certifications made on Form I-854.
    (D) Filing procedure. Upon completion of Form I-854, the LEA shall 
forward the form and all required attachments to the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, at the 
address listed on the form.
    (ii) Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division review--(A) 
Review of information. Upon receipt of a complete application for S 
nonimmigrant classification on Form I-854, with all required 
attachments, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall 
ensure that all information relating to the basis of the application, 
the need for the witness or informant, and grounds of excludability 
under section 212 of the Act has been provided to the Service on Form I-
854, and shall consider the negative and favorable factors warranting an 
exercise of discretion on the alien's behalf. No application may be 
acted on by the Assistant Attorney General unless the eligible LEA 
making the request has proceeded in accordance with the instructions on, 
or attached to, Form I-854 and agreed to all provisions therein.
    (B) Advisory panel. Where necessary according to procedures 
established by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, an 
advisory panel, composed of representatives of the Service, Marshals 
Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Criminal Division, and the Department of State, and 
those representatives of other LEAs, including state and federal courts 
designated by the Attorney General, will review the completed 
application and submit a recommendation to the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, regarding requests for S nonimmigrant 
classification. The function of this advisory panel is to prioritize 
cases in light of the numerical limitation in order to determine which 
cases will be forwarded to the Commissioner.
    (C) Assistant Attorney General certification. The certification of 
the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, to the Commissioner 
recommending approval of the application for S nonimmigrant 
classification shall contain the following:

inadmissible;
    (3) The reasons that waiver(s) of inadmissibility are considered to 
be justifiable and in the national interest;
    (4) A detailed statement that the alien is eligible for S 
nonimmigrant classification, explaining the nature of the alien's 
cooperation with the government and the government's need for the 
alien's presence in the United States;
    (5) The intended date of arrival;
    (6) The length of the proposed stay in the United States;
    (7) The purpose of the proposed stay; and
    (8) A statement that the application falls within the statutorily 
specified numerical limitation.
    (D) Submission of certified requests for S nonimmigrant 
classification to Service. (1) The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, shall forward to the Commissioner only qualified applications 
for S-5 nonimmigrant classification that have been certified in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and that fall within 
the annual numerical limitation.
    (2) The Assistant Attorney General Criminal Division, shall forward 
to the Commissioner applications for S-6 nonimmigrant classification 
that have been certified in accordance with the provisions of this 
paragraph, certified by the Secretary of State or eligibility

[[Page 338]]

for S-6 classification, and that fall within the annual numerical 
limitation.
    (5) Decision on application. (i) The Attorney General's authority to 
waive grounds of excludability pursuant to section 212 of the Act is 
delegated to the Commissioner and shall be exercised with regard to S 
nonimmigrant classification only upon the certification of the Assistant 
Attorney General, Criminal Division. Such certification is nonreviewable 
as to the matter's significance, importance, and/or worthwhileness to 
law enforcement. The Commissioner shall make the final decision to 
approve or deny a request for S nonimmigrant classification certified by 
the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division.
    (ii) Decision to approve application. Upon approval of the 
application on Form I-854, the Commissioner shall notify the Assistant 
Attorney General, Criminal Division, the Secretary of State, and Service 
officers as appropriate. Admission shall be authorized for a period not 
to exceed 3 years.
    (iii) Decision to deny application. In the event the Commissioner 
decides to deny an application for S nonimmigrant classification on Form 
I-854, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the 
relevant LEA shall be notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant 
Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that 
decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, 
objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in 
the decision. In the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to 
the Deputy Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances 
shall the alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any 
decision to deny.
    (6) Submission of requests for S nonimmigrant visa classification to 
Secretary of State. No request for S nonimmigrant visa classification 
may be presented to the Secretary of State unless it is approved and 
forwarded by the Commissioner.
    (7) Conditions of status. An alien witness or informant is 
responsible for certifying and fulfilling the terms and conditions 
specified on Form I-854 as a condition of status. The LEA that assumes 
responsibility for the S nonimmigrant must:

an alien in S nonimmigrant classification with the Commissioner as to 
the date, time, place, and manner of the alien's arrival.
    (10) Employment. An alien classified under section 101(a)(15)(S) of 
the Act may apply for employment authorization by filing Form I-765, 
Application for Employment Authorization, with fee, in accordance with

Sec. 274a.12(c)(21) of this chapter.
    (11) Failure to maintain status. An alien classified under section 
101(a)(15)(S) of the Act shall abide by all the terms and conditions of 
his or her S nonimmigrant classification imposed by the Attorney 
General. If the terms and conditions of S nonimmigrant classification 
will not be or have not been met, or have been violated, the alien is 
convicted of any criminal offense punishable by a term of imprisonment 
of 1 year or more, is otherwise rendered deportable, or it is otherwise 
appropriate or in the public interest to do so, the Commissioner shall 
proceed to deport an alien pursuant to the terms of 8 CFR 242.26. In the 
event the Commissioner decides to deport an alien witness or informant 
in S nonimmigrant classification, the Assistant Attorney General, 
Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA shall be notified in writing to 
that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall 
concur in or object to that decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he or she shall be 
deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event of an objection 
by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the matter will be 
expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General for a final 
resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the relevant LEA have 
a right of appeal from any decision to deport.

Sec. 214.3  Petitions for approval of schools.

    (a) Filing petition--(1) General. A school or school system seeking 
approval for attendance by nonimmigrant students under sections 
101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101 (a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act, or both, shall file a 
petition on Form I-17 with the district director having jurisdiction 
over the place in which the school or school system is located. Separate 
petitions are required for different schools in the same school system 
located within the jurisdiction of different district directors. A 
petition by a school system must specifically identify by name and 
address those schools included in the petition. The petition must also 
state whether the school or school system is seeking approval for 
attendance of nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 
101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act or both.
    (2) Approval for F-1 or M-1 classification, or both--(i) F-1 
classification. The following schools may be approved for attendance by 
nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act:
    (A) A college or university, i.e., an institution of higher learning 
which awards recognized bachelor's, master's doctor's or professional 
degrees.
    (B) A community college or junior college which provides instruction

[[Page 340]]

and which awards recognized associate degrees.
    (C) A seminary.
    (D) A conservatory.
    (E) An academic high school.
    (F) An elementary school.
    (G) An institution which provides language training, instruction in 
the liberal arts or fine arts, instruction in the professions, or 
instruction or training in more than one of these disciplines.
    (ii) M-1 classification. The following schools are considered to be 
vocational or nonacademic institutions and may be approved for 
attendance by nonimmigrant students under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of 
the Act:
    (A) A community college or junior college which provides vocational 
or technical training and which awards recognized associate degrees.
    (B) A vocational high school.
    (C) A school which provides vocational or nonacademic training other 
than language training.
    (iii) Both F-1 and M-1 classification. A school may be approved for 
attendance by nonimmigrant students under both sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) 
and 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act if it has both instruction in the 
liberal arts, fine arts, language, religion, or the professions and 
vocational or technical training. In that case, a student whose primary 
intent is to pursue studies in liberal arts, fine arts, language, 
religion, or the professions at the school is classified as a 
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act. A student whose 
primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training at the 
school is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of 
the Act.
    (iv) English language training for a vocational student. A student 
whose primary intent is to pursue vocational or technical training who 
takes English language training at the same school solely for the 
purpose of being able to understand the vocational or technical course 
of study is classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) 
of the Act.
    (b) Supporting documents. Pursuant to sections 101(a)(15) (F) and 
(M) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Service has consulted 
with the Department of Education and determined that petitioning 
institutions must submit certain supporting documents as follows. A 
petitioning school or school system owned and operated as a public 
educational institution or system by the United States or a State or a 
political subdivision thereof shall submit a certification to that 
effect signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that 
he or she is authorized to do so. A petitioning private or parochial 
elementary or secondary school system shall submit a certification 
signed by the appropriate public official who shall certify that he or 
she is authorized to do so to the effect that it meets the requirements 
of the State or local public educational system. Any other petitioning 
school shall submit a certification by the appropriate licensing, 
approving, or accrediting official who shall certify that he or she is 
authorized to do so to the effect that it is licensed, approved, or 
accredited. In lieu of such certification a school which offers courses 
recognized by a State-approving agency as appropriate for study for 
veterans under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3675 and 3676 may submit a 
statement of recognition signed by the appropriate official of the State 
approving agency who shall certify that he or she is authorized to do 
so. A charter shall not be considered a license, approval, or 
accreditation. A school catalogue, if one is issued, shall also be 
submitted with each petition. If not included in the catalogue, or if a 
catalogue is not issued, the school shall furnish a written statement 
containing information concerning the size of its physical plant, nature 
of its facilities for study and training, educational, vocational or 
professional qualifications of the teaching staff, salaries of the 
teachers, attendance and scholastic grading policy, amount and character 
of supervisory and consultative services available to students and 
trainees, and finances (including a certified copy of the accountant's 
last statement of school's net worth, income, and expenses). Neither a 
catalogue nor such a written statement need be included with a petition 
submitted by:
    (1) A school or school system owned and operated as a public 
educational

[[Page 341]]

institution or system by the United States or a State or a political 
subdivision thereof;
    (2) A school accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body; 
or
    (3) A secondary school operated by or as part of a school so 
accredited.
    (c) Other evidence. The Service has also consulted with the 
Department of Education regarding the following types of institutions 
and determined that they must submit additional evidence. If the 
petitioner is a vocational, business, or language school, or American 
institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, it 
must submit evidence that its courses of study are accepted as 
fulfilling the requirements for the attainment of an educational, 
professional, or vocational objective, and are not avocational or 
recreational in character. If the petitioner is an institution of higher 
education and is not within the category described in paragraph (b) (1) 
or (2) of this section, it must submit evidence that it confers upon its 
graduates recognized bachelor, master, doctor, professional, or divinity 
degrees, or if it does not confer such degrees that its credits have 
been and are accepted unconditionally by at least three such 
institutions of higher learning. If the petitioner is an elementary or 
secondary school and is not within the category described in paragraph 
(b) (1) or (3) of this section, it must submit evidence that attendance 
at the petitioning institution satisfies the compulsory attendance 
requirements of the State in which it is located and that the 
petitioning school qualifies graduates for acceptance by schools of a 
higher educational level within the category described in paragraph (b) 
(1), (2), or (3) of this section.
    (d) Interview of petitioner. An authorized representative of the 
petitioner shall appear in person before an immigration officer prior to 
the adjudication of the petition to be interviewed under oath concerning 
the eligibility of the school for approval. An interview may be waived 
at the discretion of the district director.
    (e) Approval of petition--(1) Eligibility. To be eligible for 
approval, the petitioner must establish that--
    (i) It is a bona fide school;
    (ii) It is an established institution of learning or other 
recognized place of study;
    (iii) It possesses the necessary facilities, personnel, and finances 
to conduct instruction in recognized courses; and
    (iv) It is, in fact, engaged in in-struction in those courses.
    (2) General. Upon approval of a petition, the district director 
shall notify the petitioner. An approved school is required to report 
immediately to the district director having jurisdication over the 
school any material modification to its name, address or curriculum for 
a determination of continued eligibility for approval. The approval of a 
school is valid as long as the school operates in the manner represented 
in the petition. The approval is valid only for the type of program and 
student specified in the approval notice. The approval may be withdrawn 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 214.4.
    (f) Denial of petition. If the petition is denied, the petitioner 
shall be notified of the reasons therefor and of his right to appeal in 
accordance with the provisions of part 103 of this chapter.
    (g) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements--(1) Recordkeeping 
requirements. An approved school must keep records containing certain 
specific information and documents relating to each F-1 or M-1 student 
to whom it has issued a Form I-20A or I-20M while the student is 
attenidng the school and until the school notifies the Service, in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, 
that the student is not pursuing a full course of study. The school must 
keep a record of having complied with the reporting requirements for at 
least one year. If a student who is out of status is restored to status, 
the school the student is attending is responsible for maintaining these 
records following receipt of notification from the Service that the 
student has been restored to status. The designated school official must 
make the information and documents required by this paragraph available 
to and furnish them to any Service officer upon request. The information 
and documents which the school must keep on each student are as follows:
    (i) Name.

[[Page 342]]

    (ii) Date and place of birth.
    (iii) Country of citizenship.
    (iv) Address.
    (v) Status, i.e., full-time or part-time.
    (vi) Date of commencement of studies.
    (vii) Degree program and field of study.
    (viii) Whether the student has been certified for practical 
training, and the beginning and end dates of certification.
    (ix) Termination date and reason, if known.
    (x) The documents referred to in paragraph (k) of this section.
    (xi) The number of credits completed each semester.
    (xii) A photocopy of the student's I-20 ID Copy.

A Service officer may request any or all of the above data on any 
individual student or class of students upon notice. This notice will be 
in writing if requested by the school. The school will have three work 
days to respond to any request for information concerning an individual 
student, and ten work days to respond to any request for information 
concerning a class of students. If the Service requests information on a 
student who is being held in custody, the school will respond orally on 
the same day the request for information is made, and the Service will 
provide a written notification that the request was made after the fact, 
if the school so desires. The Service will first attempt to gain 
information concerning a class of students from the Service's record 
system.
    (2) Reporting requirements. At intervals specified by the Service 
but not more frequently than once a term or session, the Service's 
processing center shall send each school (to the address given on Form 
I-17 as that to which the list should be sent) a list of all F-1 and M-1 
students who, according to Service records, are attending that school. A 
designated school official at the school must note on the list whether 
or not each student on the list is pursuing a full course of study and 
give, in addition to the above information, the names and current 
addresses of all F-1 or M-1 students, or both, not listed, attending the 
school and other information specified by the Service as necessary to 
identify the students and to determine their immigration status. The 
designated school official must comply with the request, sign the list, 
state his or her title, and return the list to the Service's processing 
center within sixty days of the date of the request.
    (h) Review of school approvals. The district director may 
periodically review the approval of a school in his or her jurisdiction 
for compliance with the reporting requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section and for continued eligibility for approval pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section. The district director shall also, upon 
receipt of notification, evaluate any changes made to the name, address, 
or curriculum of an approved school to determine if the changes have 
affected the school's eligibility for approval. The district director 
may require the school under review to furnish a currently executed Form 
I-17 without fee, along with supporting documents, as a petition for 
continuation of school approval when there is a question about whether 
the school still meets the eligibility requirements. If upon completion 
of the review, the district director finds that the approval should not 
be continued, he or she shall institute withdrawal proceedings in 
accordance with Sec. 214.4(b).
    (i) Administration of student regulations by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. District directors in the field shall be 
responsible for conducting periodic reviews on the campuses under the 
jurisdiction of their offices to determine whether students are 
complying with Service regulations including keeping their passports 
valid for a period of six months at all times when required. Service 
officers shall take appropriate action regarding violations of the 
regulations.
    (j) Advertising. In any advertisement, catalogue, brochure, 
pamphlet, literature, or other material hereafter printed or reprinted 
by or for an approved school, any statement which may appear in such 
material concerning approval for attendance by nonimmigrant students 
shall be limited solely to the following: This school is

[[Page 343]]

authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students.
    (k) Issuance of Certificate of Eligibility. A designated official of 
a school that has been approved for attendance by nonimmigrant students 
must certify Form I-20A or I-20M, but only after page 1 has been 
completed in full. A Form I-20A-B or I-20M-N issued by an approved 
school system must state which school within the system the student will 
attend. The form must be issued in the United States. Only a designated 
official shall issue a Certificate of Eligibility, Form I-20A-B or I-
20M-N, to a prospective student and only after the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The prospective student has made a written application to the 
school.
    (2) The written application, the student's transcripts or other 
records of courses taken, proof of financial responsibility for the 
student, and other supporting documents have been received, reviewed, 
and evaluated at the school's location in the United States.
    (3) The appropriate school authority has determined that the 
prospective student's qualifications meet all standards for admission.
    (4) The official responsible for admission at the school has 
accepted the prospective student for enrollment in a full course of 
study.
    (l) Designated official--(1) Meaning of term ``designated 
official''. As used in Secs. 214.1(b), 214.2(f), 214.2(m), 214.4 and 
this section, a ``designated official'' or ``designated school 
official'' means a regularly employed member of the school 
administration whose office is located at the school and whose 
compensation does not come from commissions for recruitment of foreign 
students. An individual whose principal obligation to the school is to 
recruit foreign students for compensation does not qualify as a 
designated official. The president, owner, or head of a school or school 
system must designate a designated official. The designated official may 
not delegate this designation to any other person. Each school or 
institution may have up to five designated officials at any one time. In 
a multi-campus institution, each campus may have up to five designated 
officials at any one time. In an elementary or secondary school system, 
however, the entire school system is limited to five designated 
officials at any one time.
    (2) Name, title, and sample signature. Petitions for school approval 
must include the names, titles, and sample signatures of designated 
officials. An approved school must report to the Service office having 
jurisdiction over it any changes in designated officials and furnish the 
name, title, and sample signature of the new designated official within 
thirty days of each change.
    (3) Statement of designated official. A petition for school approval 
must include a statement by each designated official certifying that the 
official has read the Service regulations relating to nonimmigrant 
students, namely Secs. 214.1(b), 214.2(f), and 214.2(m); the Service 
regulations relating to change of nonimmigrant classification for 
students, namely Secs. 248.1(c), 248.1(d), 248.3(b), and 248.3(d); the 
Service regulations relating to school approval, namely this section and 
the regulations relating to withdrawal of school approval namely, 
Sec. 214.4; and affirming the official's intent to comply with these 
regulations. An approved school must also submit to the Service office 
having jurisdiction over it such a statement from any new designated 
official within thirty days of each change in designated official.

Sec. 214.4  Withdrawal of school approval.

    (a) General--(1) Withdrawal on notice. If a school's approval is 
withdrawn on notice as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), 
(g), (h), (i) (j), and (k) of this section, the school is not eligible 
to file another petition for school approval until at least one year 
after the effective date of the withdrawal. The approval by the Service, 
pursuant to sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) or both, of 
the Act, of a petition by a school or school system for the attendance 
of nonimmigrant students will be withdrawn on notice if the school or 
school system is no longer entitled to the approval for any

[[Page 344]]

valid and substantive reason including, but not limited to, the 
following:
    (i) Failure to comply with Sec. 214.3(g)(1) without a subpoena.
    (ii) Failure to comply with Sec. 214.3(g)(2).
    (iii) Failure of a designated school official to notify the Service 
of the attendance of an F-1 transfer student as required by 
Sec. 214.2(f)(8)(ii).
    (iv) Willful issuance by a designated official of a false statement 
or certification in connection with a school transfer or an application 
for employment or practical training.
    (v) Any conduct on the part of a designated official which does not 
comply with the regulations.
    (vi) The designation as a designated official of an individual who 
does not meet the requirements of Sec. 214.3(l)(1).
    (vii) Failure to provide the Service with the names, titles, and 
sample signatures of designated officials as required by 
Sec. 214.3(l)(2).
    (viii) Failure to submit statements of designated officials as 
required by Sec. 214.3(l)(3).
    (ix) Issuance of Forms I-20A or I-20M to students without receipt of 
proof that the students have met scholastic, language or financial 
requirements.
    (x) Issuance of Forms I-20A or I-20M to aliens who will not be 
enrolled in or carry full courses of study as defined in 
Secs. 214.2(f)(6) or 214.2(m)(9).
    (xi) Failure to operate as a bona fide institution of learning.
    (xii) Failure to employ qualified professional personnel.

1-20A or 1-20M as set forth in Sec. 214.3(k).
    (xviii) Failure of a designated school official to notify the 
Service of material changes to the school's name, address, or curriculum 
as required by Sec. 214.3(e)(2).
    (2) Automatic withdrawal. If an approved school terminates its 
operations, approval will be automatically withdrawn as of the date of 
termination of the operations. If an approved school changes ownership, 
approval will be automatically withdrawn sixty days after the change of 
ownership unless the school files a new petition for school approval 
within sixty days of that change of ownership. The district director 
must review the petition to determine whether the school still meets the 
eligibility requirements of Sec. 214.3(e). If, upon completion of the 
review, the district director finds that the approval should not be 
continued, the district director shall institute withdrawal proceedings 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Automatic withdrawal 
of a school's approval is without prejudice to consideration of a new 
petition for school approval.
    (b) Notice. Whenever a district director has reason to believe that 
an approved school or school system in his/ her district is no longer 
entitled to approval, a proceeding shall be commenced by service upon 
its designated official a notice of intention to withdraw the approval. 
The notice shall inform the designated official of the school or school 
system of the grounds upon which it is intended to withdraw its 
approval. The notice shall also inform the school or school system that 
it may, within 30 days of the date of service of the notice, submit 
written representations under oath supported by documentary evidence 
setting forth reasons why the approval should not be withdrawn and that 
the school or school system may, at the time of filing the answer, 
request in writing an interview before the district director in support 
of the written answer.
    (c) Assistance of counsel. The school or school system shall also be 
informed in the notice of intent to withdraw approval that it may be 
assisted or represented by counsel of its choice qualified under part 
292 of this chapter, at no expense to the Government, in preparation of 
its answer or in connection with the interview.

[[Page 345]]

    (d) Allegations admitted or no answer filed. If the school or school 
system admits all of the allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw 
approval, or if the school or school system fails to file an answer 
within the 30-day period, the district director shall withdraw the 
approval previously granted and he/she shall notify the designated 
school official of the decision. No appeal shall lie from the district 
director's decision if all allegations are admitted or no answer is 
filed within the 30-day period.
    (e) Allegations denied. If the school or school system denies the 
allegations in the notice of intent to withdraw approval, then the 
school or school system shall, in its answer, provide all information or 
evidence on which the answer is based.
    (f) Interview requested. (1) If in its answer to the notice of 
intent to withdraw approval the school or school system requests an 
interview, the school or school system shall be given notice of the date 
set for the interview.

of a business or practice in the United States in which the professional 
will be, in substance, self-employed. A professional will be deemed to 
be self-employed if he or she will be rendering services to a 
corporation or entity of which the professional is the sole or 
controlling shareholder or owner.
    Temporary entry, as defined in the NAFTA, means entry without the 
intent to establish permanent residence. The alien must satisfy the 
inspecting immigration officer that the proposed stay is temporary. A 
temporary period has a reasonable, finite end that does not equate to 
permanent residence. In order to establish that the alien's entry will 
be temporary, the alien must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
inspecting immigration officer that his or her work assignment in the 
United States will end at a predictable time and that he or she will 
depart upon completion of the assignment.

    (d) Classification of citizens of Mexico as TN professionals under 
the NAFTA--(1) General. A United States employer seeking to classify a 
citizen of Mexico as a TN professional temporary employee shall file a 
petition on Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, with the 
Northern Service Center, even in emergent circumstances. The petitioner 
may submit a legible photocopy of a document in support of the visa 
petition in lieu of the original document. The original document shall 
be submitted if requested by the Service.
    (2) Supporting documents. A petition in behalf of a citizen of 
Mexico seeking classification as a TN professional shall be accompanied 
by:
    (i) A certification from the Secretary of Labor that the petitioner 
has filed the appropriate documentation with the Secretary in accordance 
with section (D)(5)(b) of Annex 1603 of the NAFTA.
    (ii) Evidence that the beneficiary meets the minimum education 
requirements or alternative credentials requirements of Appendix 
1603.D.1 of Annex 1603 of the NAFTA as set forth in Sec. 214.6(c). This 
documentation may consist of licenses, degrees, diplomas, certificates, 
or evidence of membership in professional organizations. Degrees, 
diplomas, or certificates received by the beneficiary from an 
educational institution not located within Mexico, Canada, or the United 
States must be accompanied by an evaluation by a reliable credentials 
evaluation service which specializes in evaluating foreign educational 
credentials. Evidence of experience should consist of letters from 
former employers or, if formerly self-employed, business records 
attesting to such self-employment; and
    (iii) A statement from the prospective employer in the United States 
specifically stating the Appendix 1603.D.1 profession in which the 
beneficiary will be engaging and a full description of the nature of the 
duties which the beneficiary will be performing. The statement must set 
forth licensure requirements for the state or locality of intended 
employment or, if no license is required, the non-existence of such 
requirements for the professional activity to be engaged in.
    (iv) Licensure for TN classification--(A) General. If the profession 
requires a state or local license for an individual to fully perform the 
duties of that profession, the beneficiary for whom TN classification is 
sought must have that license prior to approval of the petition and 
evidence of such licensing must accompany the petition.
    (B) Temporary licensure. If a temporary license is available and the 
beneficiary would be allowed to perform the duties of the profession 
without a permanent license, the director shall examine the nature of 
the duties, the level at which the duties are performed, the degree of 
supervision received, and any limitations which would be placed upon the 
beneficiary. If an analysis of the facts demonstrates that the 
beneficiary, although under supervision, would be fully authorized to 
perform the duties of the profession, TN classification may be granted.
    (C) Duties without licensure. In certain professions which generally 
require licensure, a state may allow an individual to fully practice a 
profession under the supervision of licensed senior or supervisory 
personnel in that profession. In such cases, the director shall examine 
the nature of the duties and the level at which they are to be 
performed. If the facts demonstrate that the beneficiary, although under 
supervision, would fully perform the duties of the profession, TN 
classification may be granted.
    (D) Registered nurses. The prospective employer must submit evidence 
that the beneficiary has been granted a permanent state license, a 
temporary state license or other temporary authorization issued by a 
State Board of Nursing authorizing the beneficiary to work as a 
registered or graduate nurse

[[Page 349]]

in the state of intended employment in the United States.
    (3) Approval and validity of petition-- (i) Approval. The director 
shall notify the petitioner of the approval of the petition on Form I-
797, Notice of Action. The approval notice shall include the 
beneficiary's name, classification, Appendix 1603.D.1 profession, and 
the petition's period of validity.
    (ii) Recording the validity of petitions. Procedures for recording 
the validity period of petitions are:
    (A) If the petition is approved before the date the petitioner 
indicates that employment will begin, the approved petition and approval 
notice shall show the actual dates requested by the petitioner as the 
validity period, not to exceed the limits specified by paragraph 
(d)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (B) If the petition is approved after the date the petitioner 
indicates employment will begin, the approved petition and approval 
notice shall show a validity period commencing with the date of approval 
and ending with the date requested by the petitioner, as long as that 
date does not exceed the limits specified by paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of 
this section.
    (C) If the period of employment requested by the petitioner exceeds 
the limit specified in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, the 
petition shall be approved only up to the limit specified in that 
paragraph.
    (iii) Validity. An approved petition classifying a citizen of Mexico 
as a TN nonimmigrant shall be valid for a period of up to one year.
    (4) Denial of petition--(i) Notice of intent to deny. When an 
adverse decision is proposed on the basis of derogatory information of 
which the petitioner is unaware, the director shall notify the 
petitioner of the intent to deny the petition and the basis for the 
denial. The petitioner may inspect and rebut the evidence and will be 
granted a period of thirty days in which to do so. All relevant rebuttal 
material will be considered in making a final decision.
    (ii) Notice of denial. The petitioner shall be notified of the 
decision, the reasons for the denial, and the right to appeal the denial 
under part 103 of this chapter.
    (5) Revocation of approval of petition--(i) General. (A) The 
petitioner shall immediately notify the Service of any changes in the 
terms and conditions of employment of a beneficiary which may effect 
eligibility under section 214(e) of the Act or Sec. 214.6. An amended 
petition should be filed when the petitioner continues to employ the 
beneficiary. If the petitioner no longer employs the beneficiary, the 
petitioner shall send a letter explaining the change(s) to the director 
who approved the petition.
    (B) The director may revoke a petition at any time, even after the 
validity of the petition has expired.
    (ii) Automatic revocation. The approval of an unexpired petition is 
automatically revoked if the petitioner goes out of business, files a 
written withdrawal of the petition, or notifies the Service that the 
beneficiary is no longer employed by the petitioner.
    (iii) Revocation on notice--(A) Grounds for revocation. The director 
shall send to the petitioner a notice of intent to revoke the petition 
in relevant part if he or she finds that:
    (1) The beneficiary is no longer employed by the petitioner in the 
capacity specified in the petition;
    (2) The statement of facts contained in the petition were not true 
and correct;
    (3) The petitioner violated the terms or conditions of the approved 
petition;
    (4) The petitioner violated requirements of section 214(e) of the 
Act or Sec. 214.6; or
    (5) The approval of the petition violated Sec. 214.6 or involved 
gross error.
    (B) Notice and decision. The notice of intent to revoke shall 
contain a detailed statement of the grounds for the revocation and the 
time period allowed for the petitioner's rebuttal. The petitioner may 
submit evidence in rebuttal within thirty days of the date of the 
notice. The director shall consider all relevant evidence presented in 
deciding whether to revoke the petition.
    (6) Appeal of a denial or revocation of a petition--(i) Denial. A 
denied petition may be appealed under part 103 of this chapter.
    (ii) Revocation. A petition that has been revoked on notice may be 
appealed under part 103 of this chapter.

[[Page 350]]

Automatic revocations may not be appealed.
    (7) Numerical limit--(i) Limit on number of petitions to be approved 
in behalf of citizens of Mexico. Beginning on the date of entry into 
force of the NAFTA, not more than 5,500 citizens of Mexico can be 
classified as TN nonimmigrants annually.
    (ii) Procedures. (A) Each citizen of Mexico issued a visa or 
otherwise provided TN nonimmigrant status under section 214(e) of the 
Act shall be counted for purposes of the numerical limit. Requests for 
petition extension or extension of the alien's stay and submissions of 
amended petitions shall not be counted for purposes of the numerical 
limit. The spouse and children of principal aliens classified as TD 
nonimmigrants shall not be counted against the numerical limit.
    (B) Numbers will be assigned temporarily to each Mexican citizen in 
whose behalf a petition for TN classification has been filed. If a 
petition is denied, the number originally assigned to the petition shall 
be returned to the system which maintains and assigns numbers.
    (C) When an approved petition is not used because the beneficiary 
does not apply for admission to the United States, the petitioner shall 
notify the service center director who approved the petition that the 
number has not been used. The petition shall be revoked pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section and the unused number shall be 
returned to the system which maintains and assigns numbers.
    (D) If the total annual limit has been reached prior to the end of 
the year, new petitions and the accompanying fee shall be rejected and 
returned with a notice stating that numbers are unavailable for Mexican 
citizen TN nonimmigrants and the date when numbers will again become 
available.
    (e) Classification of citizens of Canada as TN professionals under 
the NAFTA--(1) General. Under section 214(e) of the Act, a citizen of 
Canada who seeks temporary entry as a business person to engage in 
business activities at a professional level may be admitted to the 
United States in accordance with the NAFTA.
    (2) Application for admission. A citizen of Canada seeking admission 
under this section shall make application for admission with an 
immigration officer at a United States Class A port of entry, at a 
United States airport handling international traffic, or at a United 
States pre-clearance/pre-flight station. No prior petition, labor 
certification, or prior approval shall be required.
    (3) Evidence. A visa shall not be required of a Canadian citizen 
seeking admission as a TN nonimmigrant under section 214(e) of the Act. 
Upon application for admission at a United States port of entry, an 
applicant under this section shall present the following:
    (i) Proof of Canadian citizenship. Unless travelling from outside 
the Western hemisphere, no passport shall be required; however, an 
applicant for admission must establish Canadian citizenship.
    (ii) Documentation demonstrating engagement in business activities 
at a professional level and demonstrating professional qualifications. 
The applicant must present documentation sufficient to satisfy the 
immigration officer at the time of application for admission, that the 
applicant is seeking entry to the United States to engage in business 
activities for a United States employer(s) or entity(ies) at a 
professional level, and that the applicant meets the criteria to perform 
at such a professional level. This documentation may be in the form of a 
letter from the prospective employer(s) in the United States or from the 
foreign employer, in the case of a Canadian citizen seeking entry to 
provide prearranged services to a United States entity, and may be 
required to be supported by licenses, diplomas, degrees, certificates, 
or membership in a professional organization. Degrees, diplomas, or 
certificates received by the applicant from an educational institution 
not located within Canada, Mexico, or the United States must be 
accompanied by an evaluation by a reliable credentials evaluation 
service which specializes in evaluating foreign educational credentials. 
The documentation shall fully affirm:
    (A) The Appendix 1603.D.1 profession of the applicant;
    (B) A description of the professional activities, including a brief 
summary

[[Page 351]]

of daily job duties, if appropriate, which the applicant will engage in

    (C) The anticipated length of stay;
    (D) The educational qualifications or appropriate credentials which 
demonstrate that the Canadian citizen has professional level status;
    (E) The arrangements for remuneration for services to be rendered; 
and
    (F) If required by state or local law, that the Canadian citizen 
complies with all applicable laws and/or licensing requirements for the 
professional activity in which they will be engaged.
    (f) Procedures for admission--(1) Canadian citizens. A Canadian 
citizen who qualifies for admission under this section shall be provided 
confirming documentation (Service Form I-94) and shall be admitted under 
the classification symbol TN for a period not to exceed one year. Form 
I-94 shall bear the legend ``multiple entry''. The fee prescribed under 
Sec. 103.7(b) of this chapter shall be remitted upon admission to the 
United States pursuant to the terms and conditions of the NAFTA. Upon 
remittance of the prescribed fee, the Canadian citizen applicant shall 
be provided a Service receipt (Form G-211, Form G-711, or Form I-797).
    (2) Mexican citizens. The Mexican citizen beneficiary of an approved 
Form I-129 granting classification as a TN professional shall be 
admitted to the United States for the validity period of the approved 
petition upon presentation of a valid TN visa issued by a United States 
consular officer and a copy of the United States employer's statement as 
described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. The Mexican citizen 
shall be provided Form I-94 bearing the legend ``multiple entry''.
    (g) Readmission--(1) Canadian citizens. A Canadian citizen in this 
classification may be readmitted to the United States for the remainder 
of the period authorized on Form I-94, without presentation of the 
letter or supporting documentation described in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, and without remittance of the prescribed fee, provided that the 
original intended professional activities and employer(s) have not 
changed. If the Canadian citizen seeking readmission to the United 
States is no longer in possession of a valid, unexpired Form I-94, and 
the period of initial admission has not lapsed, he or she shall present 
alternate evidence in order to be readmitted in TN status. This 
alternate evidence may include, but is not limited to, a Service fee 
receipt for admission as a TN or a previously issued admission stamp as 
TN in a passport, and a confirming letter from the United States 
employer(s). A new Form I-94 shall be issued at the time of readmission 
bearing the legend ``multiple entry''.
    (2) Mexican citizens. A Mexican citizen in this classification may 
be readmitted for the remainder of the period of time authorized on Form 
I-94 provided that the original intended professional activities and 
employer(s) have not changed. If the Mexican citizen seeking readmission 
to the United States is no longer in possession of a valid, unexpired 
Form I-94, he or she may be readmitted upon presentation of a valid TN 
visa and evidence of a previous admission. A new Form I-94 shall be 
issued at the time of readmission bearing the legend ``multiple entry''.
    (h) Extension of stay--(1) Mexican citizen. The United States 
employer shall apply for extension of the Mexican citizen's stay in the 
United States by filing Form I-129 with the Northern Service Center. The 
applicant must also request a petition extension. The request for 
extension must be accompanied by either a new or a photocopy of the 
prior certification on Form ETA 9029, in the case of a registered nurse, 
or Form ETA 9035, in all other cases, that the petitioner continues to 
have on file with the Department of Labor for the period of time 
requested. The dates of extension shall be the same for the petition and 
the beneficiary's extension of stay. The beneficiary must be physically 
present in the United States at the time of the filing of the extension 
of stay. Even though the requests to extend the petition and the alien's 
stay are combined on the petition, the director shall make a separate 
determination on each. If the citizen of Mexico is required to leave the 
United States for business or personal reasons during the pendency of 
the extension request, the petitioner may request the director to cable 
notification of the approval of the petition to the consular

[[Page 352]]

office abroad where the beneficiary will apply for a visa. An extension 
of stay may be authorized for up to one year. There is no specific limit 
on the total period of time a citizen of Mexico may remain in TN status.
    (2) Canadian citizen--(i) Filing at the service center. The United 
States employer of a Canadian citizen in TN status or United States 
entity, in the case of a Canadian citizen in TN status who has a foreign 
employer, may request an extension of stay by filing Form I-129 with the 
prescribed fee, with the Northern Service Center. The beneficiary must 
be physically present in the United States at the time of the filing of 
the extension of stay. If the alien is required to leave the United 
States for business or personal reasons while the extension request is 
pending, the petitioner may request the director to cable notification 
of approval of the application to the port of entry where the Canadian 
citizen will apply for admission to the United States. An extension of 
stay may be authorized for up to one year. There is no specific limit on 
the total period of time a citizen of Canada may remain in TN status.
    (ii) Readmission at the border. Nothing in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of 
this section shall preclude a citizen of Canada who has previously been 
in the United States in TN status from applying for admission for a 
period of time which extends beyond the date of his or her original term 
of admission at any United States port of entry. The application for 
admission shall be supported by a new letter from the United States 
employer or the foreign employer, in the case of a Canadian citizen who 
is providing prearranged services to a United States entity, which meets 
the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. The fee 
prescribed under Sec. 103.7(b) of this chapter shall be remitted upon 
admission to the United States pursuant to the terms and conditions of 
the NAFTA.
    (i) Request for change or addition of United States employer(s)--(1) 
Mexican citizen. A citizen of Mexico admitted under this paragraph who 
seeks to change or add a United States employer must have the new 
employer file a Form I-129 petition with appropriate supporting 
documentation, including a letter from the new employer describing the 
services to be performed, the time needed to render such services, and 
the terms for remuneration for services and evidence of required filing 
with the Secretary of Labor. Employment with a different or with an 
additional employer is not authorized prior to Service approval of the 
petition.
    (2) Canadian citizen--(i) Filing at the service center. A citizen of 
Canada admitted under this paragraph who seeks to change or add a United 
States employer during this period of admission must have the new 
employer file a Form I-129 petition with appropriate supporting 
documentation, including a letter from the new employer describing the 
services to be performed, the time needed to render such services, and 
the terms for remuneration for services. Employment with a different or 
with an additional employer is not authorized prior to Service approval 
of the petition.
    (ii) Readmission at the border. Nothing in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of 
this section precludes a citizen of Canada from applying for readmission 
to the United States for the purpose of presenting documentation from a 
different or additional United States or foreign employer. Such 
documentation shall meet the requirements prescribed in paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section. The fee prescribed under Sec. 103.7(b) of 
this chapter shall be remitted upon admission to the United States 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the NAFTA.
    (3) No action shall be required on the part of a Canadian or Mexican 
citizen who is transferred to another location by the United States 
employer to perform the same services. Such an acceptable transfer would 
be to a branch or office of the employer. In the case of a transfer to a 
separately incorporated subsidiary or affiliate, the requirements of 
paragraphs (i) (1) and (2) of this section would apply.
    (j) Spouse and unmarried minor children accompanying or following to 
join. (1) The spouse of unmarried minor child of a citizen of Canada or 
Mexico admitted in TN nonimmigrant status shall be required to present a 
valid, unexpired nonimmigrant TD visa unless

[[Page 353]]

otherwise exempt under Sec. 212.1 of this chapter.
    (2) The spouse and dependent minor children shall be issued 
confirming documentation (Form I-94) bearing the legend ``multiple 
entry''. There shall be no fee required for admission of the spouse and 
dependent minor children.
    (3) The spouse and dependent minor children shall not accept 
employment in the United States unless otherwise authorized under the 
Act.
    (k) Effect of a strike. If the Secretary of Labor certifies to or 
otherwise informs the Commissioner that a strike or other labor dispute 
involving a work stoppage of workers is in progress, and the temporary 
entry of a citizen of Mexico or Canada in TN nonimmigrant status may 
affect adversely the settlement of any labor dispute or the employment 
of any person who is involved in such dispute:
    (1) The United States may refuse to issue an immigration document 
authorizing entry or employment to such alien.
    (2) A Form I-129 seeking to classify a citizen of Mexico as a TN 
nonimmigrant may be denied. If a petition has already been approved, but 
the alien has not yet entered the United States, or has entered the 
United States but not yet commenced employment, the approval of the 
petition may be suspended.
    (3) If the alien has already commenced employment in the United 
States and is participating in a strike or other labor dispute involving 
a work stoppage of workers, whether or not such strike or other labor 
dispute has been certified by the Department of Labor, or whether the 
Service has been otherwise informed that such a strike or labor dispute 
is in progress, the alien shall not be deemed to be failing to maintain 
his or her status solely on account of past, present, or future 
participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers, but is subject to the following terms and 
conditions:
    (i) The alien shall remain subject to all applicable provisions of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act and regulations promulgated in the 
same manner as all other TN nonimmigrants;
    (ii) The status and authorized period of stay of such an alien is 
not modified or extended in any way by virtue of his or her 
participation in a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers; and
    (iii) Although participation by a TN nonimmigrant alien in a strike 
or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of workers will not 
constitute a ground for deportation, any alien who violates his or her 
status or who remains in the United States after his or her authorized 
period of stay has expired will be subject to deportation.
    (4) If there is a strike or other labor dispute involving a work 
stoppage of workers in progress, but such strike or other labor dispute 
is not certified under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, or the Service 
has not otherwise been informed by the Secretary that such a strike or 
labor dispute is in progress, the Commissioner shall not deny a 
petition, suspend an approved petition, or deny entry to an applicant 
for TN status.
    (l) Transition for Canadian Citizen Professionals in TC 
classification and their B-2 spouses and/or unmarried minor children--
(1) Canadian citizen professionals in TC Classification--(i) General. 
Canadian citizen professionals in TC classification as of the effective 
date of the NAFTA Implementation Act (January 1, 1994) will 
automatically be deemed to be in valid TN classification. Such persons 
may be readmitted to the United States in TN classification for the 
remainder of the period authorized on their Form I-94, without 
presentation of the letter or supporting documentation described in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, and without remittance of the 
prescribed fee, provided that the original intended professional 
activities and employer(s) have not changed. Properly filed applications 
for extension of stay in TC classification which are pending on January 
1, 1994 will be deemed to be, and adjudicated as if they were 
applications for extension to stay in TN classification.
    (ii) Procedure for Canadian citizens admitted in TC classification 
in possession of Form I-94 indicating admission in TC classification. At 
the time of readmission, such professionals shall be required to 
surrender their old Form I-94

[[Page 354]]

indicating admission in TC classification. Upon surrender of the old 
Form I-94, such professional will be issued a new Form I-94 bearing the 
legend ``multiple entry'' and indicating that he or she has been 
readmitted in TN classification.
    (iii) Procedure for Canadian citizen admitted in TC classification 
who are no longer in possession of Form I-94 indicating admission in TC 
classification. If the Canadian citizen seeking readmission to the 
United States is no longer in possession of an unexpired Form I-94, and 
the period of initial admission has not lapsed, he or she shall present 
alternate evidence described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section in 
order to be readmitted in TN status. A Canadian professional seeking to 
extend his or her stay beyond the period indicated on the new Form I-94 
shall be required to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section, including remittance of the fee prescribed under 
Sec. 103.7 of this chapter.
    (iv) Nonapplicability of this section to self-employed professionals 
in TC nonimmigrant classification. The provisions in paragraphs (l)(1) 
(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section shall not apply to professionals in 
TC nonimmigrant classification who are self-employed in this country on 
January 1, 1994. Effective January 1, 1994, such professionals are not 
authorized to engage in self-employment in this country, and may not be 
admitted in TN or readmitted in TC classification.
    (2) Spouses and/or unmarried minor children of Canadian citizen 
professionals in TC classification--(i) General. Effective January 1, 
1994, the nonimmigrant classification of a spouse and/or unmarried minor 
child of a Canadian citizen professional in TC classification will 
automatically be converted from B-2 to TD nonimmigrant classification. 
Effective January 1, 1994, the spouse and/or unmarried minor child of a 
Canadian citizen professional whose TC status has been automatically 
converted to TN, or the spouse and/or unmarried minor child of such 
professional whose status has been changed to TN pursuant to paragraph 
(1) of this section, who is seeking admission or readmission to this 
country, may be readmitted in TD classification for the remainder of the 
period authorized on their Form I-94, without presentation of the letter 
or supporting documentation described in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, and without remittance of the prescribed fee, provided that the 
original intended professional activities and employer(s) of the 
Canadian citizen professional have not changed. Properly filed 
applications for extension of stay in B-2 classification as the spouse 
and/or unmarried minor children of a Canadian citizen professional in TC 
classification which are pending on January 1, 1994 will be deemed to 
be, and adjudicated as if they were applications for extension of stay 
in TD classification.
    (ii) Procedure for spouses and/or unmarried minor children of 
Canadian citizens admitted in TC classification who are in possession of 
Form I-94 indicating admission in B-2 classification. Upon surrender of 
the Form I-94 indicating that the alien has been admitted as the B-2 
spouse or unmarried minor child of a TC alien valid for ``multiple 
entry,'' such alien shall be issued a new Form I-94 indicating that the 
alien has been readmitted in TD classification. The new Form I-94 shall 
bear the legend ``multiple entry.''
    (iii) Procedure for spouses and/or unmarried minor children of 
Canadian citizens admitted in TC classification who are no longer in 
possession of Form I-94 indicating admission in B-2 classification. If 
the Canadian citizen seeking readmission to the United States is no 
longer in possession of an unexpired Form I-94, and the period of 
initial admission has not lapsed, he or she shall present alternate 
evidence described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section in order to be 
admitted in TN status. Spouses and/or children of Canadian citizen 
professionals seeking to extend their stay beyond the period indicated 
on the new Form I-94 shall be required to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, including remittance of the fee 
prescribed under Sec. 103.7 of this chapter.
    (iv) Nonapplicability of this section to spouses and/or unmarried 
minor children of self-employed professionals admitted in TC 
nonimmigrant classification. Paragraphs (l)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii) of 
this section shall not apply to the spouses

[[Page 355]]

and/or unmarried minor children of Canadian citizen professionals in TC 
nonimmigrant classification who are self-employed in this country on 
January 1, 1994. Effective January 1, 1994, such persons are not 
eligible for TD classification.

[[Page 357]]

against the United States or its allies, or of destroying, or depriving

measures adopted by the United States for its defense, or for the 
defense of any other country allied with the United States.

United States or of any nation cooperating with the United States in the

seeking to depart from the United States voluntarily except an alien who 
is departing or seeking to depart subject to an order issued in 
extradition, exclusion, or deportation proceedings.

his own choice, (3) to have the opportunity to be heard and to present 
evidence, (4) to cross-examine the witnesses who appear at the hearing, 
except that if, in the course of the examination, it appears that 
further examination may divulge information of a confidential or 
security nature, the special inquiry officer may, in his discretion, 
preclude further examination of the witness with respect to such 
matters, (5) to examine any evidence in possession of the Government 
which is to be considered in the disposition of the case, provided that 
such evidence is not of a confidential or security nature the disclosure 
of which would be prejudicial to the interests of the United

[[Page 358]]

States, (6) to have the time and opportunity to produce evidence and 
witnesses on his own behalf, and (7) to reasonable continuances, upon 
request, for good cause shown.

Sec. 215.5  Hearing procedure before special inquiry officer.

    (a) The hearing before the special inquiry officer shall be 
conducted in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) The special inquiry officer shall advise the alien of the rights 
and privileges accorded him under the provisions of Sec. 215.4.
    (2) The special inquiry officer shall enter of record: (i) A copy of 
the order served upon the alien temporarily preventing his departure 
from the United States, and (ii) a copy of the notice of hearing 
furnished the alien.
    (3) The alien shall be interrogated by the special inquiry officer 
as to the matters considered pertinent to the proceeding, with 
opportunity reserved to the alien to testify thereafter in his own 
behalf, if he so chooses.
    (4) The special inquiry officer shall present on behalf of the 
Government such evidence, including the testimony of witnesses and the 
certificates or written statements of Government officials or other 
persons, as may be necessary and available. In the event such 
certificates or statements are received in evidence, the alien may 
request and, in the discretion of the special inquiry officer, be given 
an opportunity to interrogate such officials or persons, by deposition 
or otherwise, at a time and place and in a manner fixed by the special 
inquiry officer: Provided, That when in the judgment of the special 
inquiry officer any evidence relative to the disposition of the case is 
of a confidential or security nature the disclosure of which would be 
prejudicial to the interests of the United States, such evidence shall 
not be presented at the hearing but shall be taken into consideration in 
arriving at a decision in the case.
    (5) The alien may present such additional evidence, including the 
testimony of witnesses, as is pertinent and available.
    (b) A complete verbatim transcript of the hearing, except statements 
made off the record shall be recorded. The alien shall be entitled, upon 
request, to the loan of a copy of the transcript, without cost, subject 
to reasonable conditions governing its use.
    (c) Following the completion of the hearing, the special inquiry 
officer shall make and render a recommended decision in the case, which 
shall be governed by and based upon the evidence presented at the 
hearing and any evidence of a confidential or security nature which the 
Government may have in its possession. The decision of the special 
inquiry officer shall recommend: (1) That the temporary order preventing 
the departure of the alien from the United States be made final, or (2) 
that the temporary order preventing the departure of the alien from the 
United States be revoked. This recommended decision of the special 
inquiry officer shall be made in writing and shall set forth the 
officer's reasons for such decision. The alien concerned shall at his 
request be furnished a copy of the recommended decision of the special 
inquiry officer, and shall be allowed a reasonable time, not to exceed 
10 days, in which to submit representations with respect thereto in 
writing.
    (d) As soon as practicable after the completion of the hearing and 
the rendering of a decision by the special inquiry officer, the district 
director shall forward the entire record of the case, including the 
recommended decision of the special inquiry officer and any written 
representations submitted by the alien, to the regional commissioner 
having jurisdiction over his district. After reviewing the record, the 
regional commissioner shall render a decision in the case, which shall 
be based

[[Page 359]]

upon the evidence in the record and on any evidence or information of a 
confidential or security nature which he deems pertinent. Whenever any 
decision is based in whole or in part on confidential or security 
information not included in the record, the decision shall state that 
such information was considered. A copy of the regional commissioner's 
decision shall be furnished the alien, or his attorney or 
representative. No administrative appeal shall lie from the regional 
commissioner's decision.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the 
Administrator of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs referred to 
in section 104(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or such other 
officers of the Department of State as he may designate, after 
consultation with the Commissioner, or such other officers of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service as he may designate, may at any 
time permit the departure of an individual alien or of a group of aliens 
from the United States if he determines that such action would be in the 
national interest. If the Administrator specifically requests the 
Commissioner to prevent the departure of a particular alien or of a 
group of aliens, the Commissioner shall not permit the departure of such 
alien or aliens until he has consulted with the Administrator.
    (f) In any case arising under Secs. 215.1 to 215.7, the 
Administrator shall, at his request, be kept advised, in as much detail 
as he may indicate is necessary, of the facts and of any action taken or 
proposed.


<R05>

as may be imposed by regulations prescribed, with the concurrence of the 
Administrator of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs and the 
Commissioner, by the Governor of the Canal Zone, the High Commissioner 
of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or by the governor of an 
outlying possession of the United States, respectively. No alien shall 
be prevented from departing from such zone, territory, or possession 
without first being accorded a hearing as provided in Secs. 215.4 and 
215.5.
    (b) The Governor of the Canal Zone, the High Commissioner of the 
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the governor of any outlying 
possession of the United States shall have the authority to designate 
any employee or class of employees of the United States as hearing 
officers for the purpose of conducting the hearing referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The hearing officer so designated shall 
exercise the same powers, duties, and functions as are conferred upon 
special inquiry officers under the provisions of this part. The chief 
executive officer of such zone, territory, or possession shall, in lieu 
of the regional commissioner, review the recommended decision of the 
hearing officer, and shall render a decision in any case referred to 
him, basing it on evidence in the record and on any evidence or 
information of a confidential or a security nature which he deems 
pertinent.


<R05>
Sec. 215.7  Instructions from the Administrator required in certain cases.

    In the absence of appropriate instructions from the Administrator of 
the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, departure-control officers 
shall not exercise the authority conferred by Sec. 215.2 in the case of 
any alien who seeks to depart from the United States in the status of a 
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15) (A) or (G) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, or in the status of a nonimmigrant under section 11(3), 
11(4), or 11(5) of the Agreement between the United Nations and the 
United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United 
Nations (61 Stat. 756): Provided, That in cases of extreme urgency, 
where the national security so requires, a departure-control officer may 
preliminarily exercise the authority conferred by Sec. 215.2 pending the 
outcome of consultation with

[[Page 360]]

the Administrator, which shall be undertaken immediately. In all cases 
arising under this section, the decision of the Administrator shall be 
controlling: Provided, That any decision to prevent the departure of an 
alien shall be based upon a hearing and record as prescribed in this 
part.

Sec. 216.1  Definition of conditional permanent resident.

    A conditional permanent resident is an alien who has been lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence within the meaning of section 
101(a)(20) of the Act, except that a conditional permanent resident is 
also subject to the conditions and responsibilities set forth in section 
216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable, and part 216 of this 
chapter. Unless otherwise specified, the rights, privileges, 
responsibilities and duties which apply to all other lawful permanent 
residents apply equally to conditional permanent residents, including 
but not limited to the right to apply for naturalization (if otherwise 
eligible), the right to file petitions on behalf of qualifying 
relatives, the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as 
an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not 
having changed; the duty to register with the Selective Service System, 
when required; and the responsibility for complying with all laws and 
regulations of the United States. All references within this chapter to 
lawful permanent residents apply equally to conditional permanent 
residents, unless otherwise specified. The conditions of section 216 of 
the Act shall not apply to lawful permanent resident status based on a 
self-petitioning relationship under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii), 
204(a)(1)(A)(iv), 204(a)(1)(b)(ii), or 204(a)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act or 
based on eligibility as the derivative child of a self-petitioning 
spouse under section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 204(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, 
regardless of the date on which the marriage to the abusive citizen or 
lawful permanent resident occurred.

Sec. 216.2  Notification requirements.

    (a) When alien acquires status of conditional permanent resident. At 
the time an alien acquires conditional permanent residence through 
admission to the United States with an immigrant visa or adjustment of 
status under section 245 of the Act, the Service shall notify the alien 
of the conditional basis of the alien's status, of the requirement that 
the alien apply for removal of the conditions within the ninety days 
immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's having been 
granted such status, and that failure to apply for removal of the 
conditions will result in automatic termination of the alien's lawful 
status in the United States.
    (b) When alien is required to apply for removal of the conditional 
basis of lawful permanent resident status. Approximately 90 days before 
the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained 
conditional permanent residence, the Service should notify the alien a 
second time of the requirement that the alien and the petitioning spouse 
or alien entrepreneur must file a petition to remove the conditional 
basis of the alien's lawful permanent residence. Such notification shall 
be mailed to the alien's last known address.

[[Page 361]]

    (c) Effect of failure to provide notification. Failure of the 
Service to provide notification as required by either paragraph (a) or 
(b) of this section does not relieve the alien and the petitioning 
spouse, or alien entrepreneur of the requirement to file a petition to 
remove conditions within the 90 days immediately preceding the second 
anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained permanent residence.

Sec. 216.3  Termination of conditional resident status.

    (a) During the two-year conditional period. The director shall send 
a formal written notice to the conditional permanent resident of the 
termination of the alien's conditional permanent resident status if the 
director determines that any of the conditions set forth in section 
216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true, 
or it becomes known to the government that an alien entrepreneur who was 
admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her 
investment capital through other than legal means (such as through the 
sale of illegal drugs). If the Service issues a notice of intent to 
terminate an alien's conditional resident status, the director shall not 
adjudicate Form I-751 or Form I-829 until it has been determined that 
the alien's status will not be terminated. During this time, the alien 
shall continue to be a lawful conditional permanent resident with all 
the rights, privileges, and responsibilities provided to persons 
possessing such status. Prior to issuing the notice of termination, the 
director shall provide the alien with an opportunity to review and rebut 
the evidence upon which the decision is to be based, in accordance with 
Sec. 103.2(b)(2) of this chapter. The termination of status, and all of 
the rights and privileges concomitant thereto (including authorization 
to accept or continue in employment in this country), shall take effect 
as of the date of such determination by the director, although the alien 
may request a review of such determination in removal proceedings. In 
addition to the notice of termination, the director shall issue a notice 
to appear in accordance with 8 CFR part 239. During the ensuing removal 
proceedings, the alien may submit evidence to rebut the determination of 
the director. The burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish, 
by a preponderance of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions 
in section 216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, 
are true, or that an alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to 
section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her investment capital 
through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal 
drugs).
    (b) Determination of fraud after two years. If, subsequent to the 
removal of the conditional basis of an alien's permanent resident 
status, the director determines that an alien spouse obtained permanent 
resident status through a marriage which was entered into for the 
purpose of evading the immigration laws or an alien entrepreneur 
obtained permanent resident status through a commercial enterprise which 
was improper under section 216A(b)(1) of the Act, the director may 
institute rescission proceedings pursuant to section 246 of the Act (if 
otherwise appropriate) or removal proceedings under section 240 of the 
Act.

<R05>
Sec. 216.4  Joint petition to remove conditional basis of lawful permanent resident status for alien spouse.

    (a) Filing the petition--(1) General procedures. Within the 90-day 
period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the date on which 
the alien obtained permanent residence, the alien and the alien's spouse 
who filed the original immigrant visa petition or fiance/fiancee 
petition through which the alien obtained permanent residence must file 
a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) with the 
Service. The petition shall be filed within this time period regardless 
of the amount of physical presence which the alien has accumulated in 
the United States. Before Form I-751 may be considered as properly 
filed, it must be accompanied by the fee required under Sec. 103.7(b) of 
this chapter and by documentation as described in paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section, and it must be properly signed by the alien and the

[[Page 362]]

alien's spouse. If the joint petition cannot be filed due to the 
termination of the marriage through annulment, divorce, or the death of 
the petitioning spouse, or if the petitioning spouse refuses to join in 
the filing of the petition, the conditional permanent resident may apply 
for a waiver of the requirement to file the joint petition in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 216.5 of this part. Upon receipt of a 
properly filed Form I-751, the alien's conditional permanent resident 
status shall be extended automatically, if necessary, until such time as 
the director has adjudicated the petition.
    (2) Dependent children. Dependent children of a conditional 
permanent resident who acquired conditional permanent resident status 
concurrently with the parent may be included in the joint petition filed 
by the parent and the parent's petitioning spouse. A child shall be 
deemed to have acquired conditional residence status concurrently with 
the parent if the child's residence was acquired on the same date or 
within 90 days thereafter. Children who cannot be included in a joint 
petition filed by the parent and parent's petitioning spouse due to the 
child's not having acquired conditional resident status concurrently 
with the parent, the death of the parent, or other reasons may file a 
separate Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence (Form I-751).
    (3) Jurisdiction. Form I-751 shall be filed with the director of the 
regional service center having jurisdiction over the alien's place of 
residence.
    (4) Physical presence at time of filing. A petition may be filed 
regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United 
States. However, if the alien is outside the United States at the time 
of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her 
spouse and dependent children, to comply with the interview requirements 
contained in the Act. Furthermore, if the documentation submitted in 
support of the petition includes affidavits of third parties having 
knowledge of the bona fides of the marital relationship, the petitioner 
must arrange for the affiants to be present at the interview, at no 
expense to the government. Once the petition has been properly filed, 
the alien may travel outside the United States and return if in 
possession of documentation as set forth in Sec. 211.1(b)(1) of this 
chapter, provided the alien and the petitioning spouse comply with the 
interview requirements described in Sec. 216.4(b). An alien who is not 
physically present in the United States during the filing period but 
subsequently applies for admission to the United States shall be 
processed in accordance with Sec. 235.11 of this chapter.
    (5) Documentation. Form I-751 shall be accompanied by evidence that 
the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading the 
immigration laws of the United States. Such evidence may include:
    (i) Documentation showing joint ownership of property;
    (ii) Lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;
    (iii) Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;
    (iv) Birth certificates of children born to the marriage;
    (v) Affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides 
of the marital relationship, or
    (vi) Other documentation establishing that the marriage was not 
entered into in order to evade the immigration laws of the United 
States.
    (6) Termination of status for failure to file petition. Failure to 
properly file Form I-751 within the 90-day period immediately preceding 
the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained lawful 
permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic 
termination of the alien's permanent residence status and the initiation 
of proceedings to remove the alien from the United States. In such 
proceedings the burden shall be on the alien to establish that he or she 
complied with the requirement to file the joint petition within the 
designated period. Form I-751 may be filed after the expiration of the 
90-day period only if the alien establishes to the satisfaction of the 
director, in writing, that there was good cause for the failure to file 
Form I-751 within the required time period. If the joint petition is 
filed prior to the jurisdiction vesting with the immigration judge in 
removal proceedings and the director excuses

[[Page 363]]

the late filing and approves the petition, he or she shall restore the 
alien's permanent residence status, remove the conditional basis of such 
status and cancel any outstanding notice to appear in accordance with 
Sec. 239.2 of this chapter. If the joint petition is not filed until 
after jurisdiction vests with the immigration judge, the immigration 
judge may terminate the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the 
Service.
    (b) Interview--(1) Authority to waive interview. The director of the 
regional service center shall review the Form I-751 filed by the alien 
and the alien's spouse to determine whether to waive the interview 
required by the Act. If satisfied that the marriage was not for the 
purpose of evading the immigration laws, the regional service center 
director may waive the interview and approve the petition. If not so 
satisfied, then the regional service center director shall forward the 
petition to the district director having jurisdiction over the place of 
the alien's residence so that an interview of both the alien and the 
alien's spouse may be conducted. The director must either waive the 
requirement for an interview and adjudicate the petition or arrange for 
an interview within 90 days of the date on which the petition was 
properly filed.
    (2) Location of interview. Unless waived, an interview on the Form 
I-751 shall be conducted by an immigration examiner or other officer so 
designated by the district director at the district office, files 
control office or suboffice having jurisdiction over the residence of 
the joint petitioners.
    (3) Termination of status for failure to appear for interview. If 
the conditional resident alien and/or the petitioning spouse fail to 
appear for an interview in connection with the joint petition required 
by section 216(c) of the Act, the alien's permanent residence status 
will be automatically terminated as of the second anniversary of the 
date on which the alien obtained permanent residence. The alien shall be 
provided with written notification of the termination and the reasons 
therefor, and a notice to appear shall be issued placing the alien under 
removal proceedings. The alien may seek review of the decision to 
terminate his or her status in such proceedings, but the burden shall be 
on the alien to establish compliance with the interview requirements. If 
the alien submits a written request that the interview be rescheduled or 
that the interview be waived, and the director determines that there is 
good cause for granting the request, the interview may be rescheduled or 
waived, as appropriate. If the interview is rescheduled at the request 
of the petitioners, the Service shall not be required to conduct the 
interview within the 90-day period following the filing of the petition.
    (c) Adjudication of petition. The director shall adjudicate the 
petition within 90 days of the date of the interview, unless the 
interview is waived in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
In adjudicating the petition the director shall determine whether--
    (1) The qualifying marriage was entered into in accordance with the 
laws of the place where the marriage took place;
    (2) The qualifying marriage has been judicially annulled or 
terminated, other than through the death of a spouse;
    (3) The qualifying marriage was entered into for the purpose of 
procuring permanent residence status for the alien; or
    (4) A fee or other consideration was given (other than a fee or 
other consideration to an attorney for assistance in preparation of a 
lawful petition) in connection with the filing of the petition through 
which the alien obtained conditional permanent residence. If derogatory 
information is determined regarding any of these issues, the director 
shall offer the petitioners the opportunity to rebut such information. 
If the petitioners fail to overcome such derogatory information the 
director may deny the joint petition, terminate the alien's permanent 
residence, and issue a notice to appear to initiate removal proceedings. 
If derogatory information not relating to any of these issues is 
determined during the course of the interview, such information shall be 
forwarded to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no 
unresolved derogatory information is determined relating to these 
issues, the

[[Page 364]]

petition shall be approved and the conditional basis of the alien's 
permanent residence status removed, regardless of any action taken or 
contemplated regarding other possible grounds for removal.
    (d) Decision--(1) Approval. If the director approves the joint 
petition he or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the 
alien and shall require the alien to report to the appropriate office of 
the Service for processing for a new Permanent Resident Card (if 
necessary), at which time the alien shall surrender any Permanent 
Resident Card previously issued.
    (2) Denial. If the director denies the joint petition, he or she 
shall provide written notice to the alien of the decision and the 
reason(s) therefor and shall issue a notice to appear under section 239 
of the Act and 8 CFR part 239. The alien's lawful permanent resident 
status shall be terminated as of the date of the director's written 
decision. The alien shall also be instructed to surrender any Permanent 
Resident Card previously issued by the Service. No appeal shall lie from 
the decision of the director; however, the alien may seek review of the 
decision in removal proceedings. In such proceedings the burden of proof 
shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that the facts and information set forth by the petitioners 
are not true or that the petition was properly denied.

and in the third sentence of paragraph (d)(2), effective Jan. 20, 1999.


<R05>
Sec. 216.5  Waiver of requirement to file joint petition to remove conditions by alien spouse.

    (a) General. (1) A conditional resident alien who is unable to meet 
the requirements under section 216 of the Act for a joint petition for 
removal of the conditional basis of his or her permanent resident status 
may file Form I-751, Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence, if 
the alien requests a waiver, was not at fault in failing to meet the 
filing requirement, and the conditional resident alien is able to 
establish that:
    (i) Deportation or removal from the United States would result in 
extreme hardship;
    (ii) The marriage upon which his or her status was based was entered 
into in good faith by the conditional resident alien, but the marriage 
was terminated other than by death, and the conditional resident was not 
at fault in failing to file a timely petition; or
    (iii) The qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the 
conditional resident but during the marriage the alien spouse or child 
was battered by or subjected to extreme cruelty committed by the citizen 
or permanent resident spouse or parent.
    (2) A conditional resident who is in exclusion, deportation, or 
removal proceedings may apply for the waiver only until such time as 
there is a final order of exclusion, deportation or removal.
    (b) Fee. Form I-751 shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee 
required under Sec. 103.7(b) of this Chapter.
    (c) Jurisdiction. Form I-751 shall be filed with the regional 
service center director having jurisdiction over the alien's place of 
residence.
    (d) Interview. The service center director may refer the application 
to the appropriate local office and require that the alien appear for an 
interview in connection with the application for a waiver. The director 
shall deny the application and initiate removal proceedings if the alien 
fails to appear for the interview as required, unless the alien 
establishes good cause for such failure and the interview is 
rescheduled.
    (e) Adjudication of waiver application--(1) Application based on 
claim of hardship. In considering an application for a waiver based upon 
an alien's claim that extreme hardship would result from the alien's 
removal from the United States, the director shall take into account 
only those factors that arose subsequent to the alien's entry as a 
conditional permanent resident. The director shall bear in mind that any 
removal from the United States is likely

[[Page 365]]

to result in a certain degree of hardship, and that only in those cases 
where the hardship is extreme should the application for a waiver be 
granted. The burden of establishing that extreme hardship exists rests 
solely with the applicant.
    (2) Application for waiver based upon the alien's claim that the 
marriage was entered into in good faith. In considering whether an alien 
entered into a qualifying marriage in good faith, the director shall 
consider evidence relating to the amount of commitment by both parties 
to the marital relationship. Such evidence may include--
    (i) Documentation relating to the degree to which the financial 
assets and liabilities of the parties were combined;
    (ii) Documentation concerning the length of time during which the 
parties cohabited after the marriage and after the alien obtained 
permanent residence;
    (iii) Birth certificates of children born to the marriage; and
    (iv) Other evidence deemed pertinent by the director.
    (3) Application for waiver based on alien's claim of having been 
battered or subjected to extreme mental cruelty. A conditional resident 
who entered into the qualifying marriage in good faith, and who was 
battered or was the subject of extreme cruelty or whose child was 
battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by the 
United States citizen or permanent resident spouse during the marriage, 
may request a waiver of the joint filing requirement. The conditional 
resident parent of a battered or abused child may apply for the waiver 
regardless of the child's citizenship or immigration status.
    (i) For the purpose of this chapter the phrase ``was battered by or 
was the subject of extreme cruelty'' includes, but is not limited to, 
being the victim of any act or threatened act of violence, including any 
forceful detention, which results or threatens to result in physical or 
mental injury. Psychological or sexual abuse or exploitation, including 
rape, molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor) or forced 
prostitution shall be considered acts of violence.
    (ii) A conditional resident or former conditional resident who has 
not departed the United States after termination of resident status may 
apply for the waiver. The conditional resident may apply for the waiver 
regardless of his or her present marital status. The conditional 
resident may still be residing with the citizen or permanent resident 
spouse, or may be divorced or separated.
    (iii) Evidence of physical abuse may include, but is not limited to, 
expert testimony in the form of reports and affidavits from police, 
judges, medical personnel, school officials and social service agency 
personnel. The Service must be satisfied with the credibility of the 
sources of documentation submitted in support of the application.
    (iv) The Service is not in a position to evaluate testimony 
regarding a claim of extreme mental cruelty provided by unlicensed or 
untrained individuals. Therefore, all waiver applications based upon 
claims of extreme mental cruelty must be supported by the evaluation of 
a professional recognized by the Service as an expert in the field. An 
evaluation which was obtained in the course of the divorce proceedings 
may be submitted if it was provided by a professional recognized by the 
Service as an expert in the field.
    (v) The evaluation must contain the professional's full name, 
professional address and license number. It must also identify the 
licensing, certifying, or registering authority. The Service retains the 
right to verify the professional's license.
    (vi) The Service's decision on extreme mental cruelty waivers will 
be based upon the evaluation of the recognized professional. The Service 
reserves the right to request additional evaluations from expert 
witnesses chosen by the Service. Requests for additional evaluations 
must be authorized by the Assistant Regional Commissioner for 
Adjudications.
    (vii) Licensed clinical social workers, psychologists, and 
psychiatrists are professionals recognized by the Service for the 
purpose of this section. A clinical social worker who is not licensed 
only because the state in which he or she practices does not provide for 
licensing will be considered a licensed

[[Page 366]]

professional recognized by the Service if he or she is included in the 
Register of Clinical Social Workers published by the National 
Association of Social Workers or is certified by the American Board of 
Examiners in Clinical Social Work.
    (viii) As directed by the statute, the information contained in the 
application and supporting documents shall not be released without a 
court order or the written consent of the applicant; or, in the case of 
a child, the written consent of the parent or legal guardian who filed 
the waiver application on the child's behalf. Information may be 
released only to the applicant, his or her authorized representative, an 
officer of the Department of Justice, or any federal or State law 
enforcement agency. Any information provided under this part may be used 
for the purposes of enforcement of the Act or in any criminal 
proceeding.
    (f) Decision. The director shall provide the alien with written 
notice of the decision on the application for waiver. If the decision is 
adverse, the director shall advise the alien of the reasons therefor, 
notify the alien of the termination of his or her permanent residence 
status, instruct the alien to surrender any Permanent Resident Card 
issued by the Service and issue a notice to appear placing the alien in 
removal proceedings. No appeal shall lie from the decision of the 
director; however, the alien may seek review of such decision in removal 
proceedings.

<R05>
Sec. 216.6  Petition by entrepreneur to remove conditional basis of lawful permanent resident status.

    (a) Filing the petition--(1) General procedures. A petition to 
remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status of an 
alien accorded conditional permanent residence pursuant to section 
203(b)(5) of the Act must be filed by the alien entrepreneur on Form I-
829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions. The alien 
entrepreneur must file Form I-829 within the 90-day period preceding the 
second anniversary of his or her admission to the United States as a 
conditional permanent resident. Before Form I-829 may be considered as 
properly filed, it must be accompanied by the fee required under 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter, and by documentation as described in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and it must be properly signed by the 
alien. Upon receipt of a properly filed Form I-829, the alien's 
conditional permanent resident status shall be extended automatically, 
if necessary, until such time as the director has adjudicated the 
petition. The entrepreneur's spouse and children should be included in 
the petition to remove conditions. Children who have reached the age of 
twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional 
permanent residence and the former spouse of an entrepreneur, who was 
divorced from the entrepreneur during the period of conditional 
permanent residence, may be included in the alien entrepreneur's 
petition or may file a separate petition.
    (2) Jurisdiction. Form I-829 must be filed with the regional service 
center having jurisdiction over the location of the alien entrepreneur's 
commercial enterprise in the United States.
    (3) Physical presence at time of filing. A petition may be filed 
regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United 
States. However, if the alien is outside the United States at the time 
of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her 
spouse and children, if necessary, to comply with the interview 
requirements contained in the Act. Once the petition has been properly 
filed, the alien may travel outside the United States and return if in 
possession of documentation as set forth in Sec. 211.1(b)(1) of this 
chapter, provided the alien complies with the interview requirements 
described in paragraph (b) of this section. An alien who is not 
physically present in the United States during the filing period but 
subsequently applies for admission to the United States shall be 
processed in accordance with Sec. 235.11 of this chapter.

[[Page 367]]

    (4) Documentation. The petition for removal of conditions must be 
accompanied by the following evidence:
    (i) Evidence that a commercial enterprise was established by the 
alien. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, Federal income 
tax returns;
    (ii) Evidence that the alien invested or was actively in the process 
of investing the requisite capital. Such evidence may include, but is 
not limited to, an audited financial statement or other probative 
evidence; and
    (iii) Evidence that the alien sustained the actions described in 
paragraph (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section throughout the period 
of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be 
considered to have sustained the actions required for removal of 
conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the 
capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously 
maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of 
conditional residence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, 
bank statements, invoices, receipts, contracts, business licenses, 
Federal or State income tax returns, and Federal or State quarterly tax 
statements.
    (iv) Evidence that the alien created or can be expected to create 
within a reasonable time ten full-time jobs for qualifying employees. In 
the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), 
the alien entrepreneur must submit evidence that the commercial 
enterprise maintained the number of existing employees at no less than 
the pre-investment level for the period following his or her admission 
as a conditional permanent resident. Such evidence may include payroll 
records, relevant tax documents, and Forms I-9.
    (5) Termination of status for failure to file petition. Failure to 
properly file Form I-829 within the 90-day period immediately preceding 
the second anniversary of the date on which the alien obtained lawful 
permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic 
termination of the alien's permanent resident status and the initiation 
of deportation proceedings. The director shall send a written notice of 
termination and an order to show cause to an alien entrepreneur who 
fails to timely file a petition for removal of conditions. No appeal 
shall lie from this decision; however, the alien may request a review of 
the determination during deportation proceedings. In deportation 
proceedings, the burden of proof shall rest with the alien to show by a 
preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the 
requirement to file the petition within the designated period. The 
director may deem the petition to have been filed prior to the second 
anniversary of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent resident 
status and accept and consider a late petition if the alien demonstrates 
to the director's satisfaction that failure to file a timely petition 
was for good cause and due to extenuating circumstances. If the late 
petition is filed prior to jurisdiction vesting with the immigration 
judge in deportation proceedings and the director excuses the late 
filing and approves the petition, he or she shall restore the alien's 
permanent resident status, remove the conditional basis of such status, 
and cancel any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with 
Sec. 242.7 of this chapter. If the petition is not filed until after 
jurisdiction vests with the immigration judge, the immigration judge may 
terminate the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the Service.
    (6) Death of entrepreneur and effect on spouse and children. If an 
entrepreneur dies during the prescribed two-year period of conditional 
permanent residence, the spouse and children of the entrepreneur will be 
eligible for removal of conditions if it can be demonstrated that the 
conditions set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section have been met.
    (b) Petition review--(1) Authority to waive interview. The director 
of the service center shall review the Form I-829 and the supporting 
documents to determine whether to waive the interview required by the 
Act. If satisfied that the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section have been met, the service center director may waive the 
interview and approve the petition. If not so satisfied, then

[[Page 368]]

the service center director shall forward the petition to the district 
director having jurisdiction over the location of the alien 
entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States so that an 
interview of the alien entrepreneur may be conducted. The director must 
either waive the requirement for an interview and adjudicate the 
petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date on which 
the petition was properly filed.
    (2) Location of interview. Unless waived, an interview relating to 
the Form I-829 shall be conducted by an immigration examiner or other 
officer so designated by the district director at the district office 
that has jurisdiction over the location of the alien entrepreneur's 
commercial enterprise in the United States.
    (3) Termination of status for failure to appear for interview. If 
the alien fails to appear for an interview in connection with the 
petition when requested by the Service, the alien's permanent resident 
status will be automatically terminated as of the second anniversary of 
the date on which the alien obtained permanent residence. The alien will 
be provided with written notification of the termination and the reasons 
therefore, and an order to show cause shall be issued placing the alien 
under deportation proceedings. The alien may seek review of the decision 
to terminate his or her status in such proceedings, but the burden shall 
be on the alien to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he 
or she complied with the interview requirements. If the alien has failed 
to appear for a scheduled interview, he or she may submit a written 
request to the district director asking that the interview be 
rescheduled or that the interview be waived. That request should explain 
his or her failure to appear for the scheduled interview, and if a 
request for waiver of the interview, the reasons such waiver should be 
granted. If the district director determines that there is good cause 
for granting the request, the interview may be rescheduled or waived, as 
appropriate. If the district director waives the interview, he or she 
shall restore the alien's conditional permanent resident status, cancel 
any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with Sec. 242.7 of 
this chapter, and proceed to adjudicate the alien's petition. If the 
district director reschedules that alien's interview, he or she shall 
restore the alien's conditional permanent resident status, and cancel 
any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with Sec. 242.7 of 
this chapter. If the interview is rescheduled at the request of the 
alien, the Service shall not be required to conduct the interview within 
the 90-day period following the filing of the petition.
    (c) Adjudication of petition. (1) The decision on the petition shall 
be made within 90 days of the date of filing or within 90 days of the 
interview, whichever is later. In adjudicating the petition, the 
director shall determine whether:
    (i) A commercial enterprise was established by the alien;
    (ii) The alien invested or was actively in the process of investing 
the requisite capital; and
    (iii) The alien sustained the actions described in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section throughout the period of the 
alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to 
have sustained the actions required for removal of conditions if he or 
she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment 
requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her 
capital investment over the two years of conditional residence.
    (iv) The alien created or can be expected to create within a 
reasonable period of time ten full-time jobs to qualifying employees. In 
the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), 
the alien maintained the number of existing employees at no less than 
the pre-investment level for the previous two years.
    (2) If derogatory information is determined regarding any of these 
issues or it becomes known to the government that the entrepreneur 
obtained his or her investment funds through other than legal means 
(such as through the sale of illegal drugs), the director shall offer 
the alien entrepreneur the opportunity to rebut such information. If the 
alien entrepreneur fails to overcome such derogatory information or

[[Page 369]]

evidence the investment funds were obtained through other than legal 
means, the director may deny the petition, terminate the alien's 
permanent resident status, and issue an order to show cause. If 
derogatory information not relating to any of these issues is determined 
during the course of the interview, such information shall be forwarded 
to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no unresolved 
derogatory information is determined relating to these issues, the 
petition shall be approved and the conditional basis of the alien's 
permanent resident status removed, regardless of any action taken or 
contemplated regarding other possible grounds for deportation.
    (d) Decision--(1) Approval. If, after initial review or after the 
interview, the director approves the petition, he or she will remove the 
conditional basis of the alien's permanent resident status as of the 
second anniversary of the alien's entry as a conditional permanent 
resident. He or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the 
alien and shall require the alien to report to the appropriate district 
office for processing for a new Permanent Resident Card, Form I-551, at 
which time the alien shall surrender any Permanent Resident Card 
previously issued.
    (2) Denial. If, after initial review or after the interview, the 
director denies the petition, he or she shall provide written notice to 
the alien of the decision and the reason(s) therefor, and shall issue an 
order to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United 
States. The alien's lawful permanent resident status and that of his or 
her spouse and any children shall be terminated as of the date of the 
director's written decision. The alien shall also be instructed to 
surrender any Permanent Resident Card previously issued by the Service. 
No appeal shall lie from this decision; however, the alien may seek 
review of the decision in deportation proceedings. In deportation 
proceedings, the burden shall rest with the Service to establish by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information in the 
alien's petition for removal of conditions are not true and that the 
petition was properly denied.

Sec. 217.1  Scope.

    The Visa Waiver Pilot Program (VWPP) described in this section is 
established pursuant to the provisions of section 217 of the Act.

[62 FR 10351, Mar. 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 217.2  Eligibility.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this part, the term:
    Carrier refers to the owner, charterer, lessee, or authorized agent 
of any commercial vessel or commercial aircraft engaged in transporting 
passengers to the United States from a foreign place.
    Designated country refers to Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Brunei, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, 
Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, San Marino, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and 
the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom refers only to British citizens 
who have the unrestricted right of permanent abode in the United Kingdom 
(England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the 
Isle of Man); it does not refer to British overseas citizens, British 
dependent

[[Page 370]]

territories' citizens, or citizens of British Commonwealth countries.
    Round trip ticket means any return trip transportation ticket in the 
name of an arriving Visa Waiver Pilot Program applicant on a 
participating carrier valid for at least 1 year, electronic ticket 
record, airline employee passes indicating return passage, individual 
vouchers for return passage, group vouchers for return passage for 
charter flights, and military travel orders which include military 
dependents for return to duty stations outside the United States on U.S. 
military flights. A period of validity of 1 year need not be reflected 
on the ticket itself, provided that the carrier agrees that it will 
honor the return portion of the ticket at any time, as provided in Form 
I-775, Visa Waiver Pilot Program Agreement.
    (b) Special program requirements--(1) General. In addition to 
meeting all of the requirements for the Visa Waiver Pilot Program 
specified in section 217 of the Act, each applicant must possess a 
valid, unexpired passport issued by a designated country and present a 
completed, signed Form I-94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure 
Form.
    (2) Persons previously removed as deportable aliens. Aliens who have 
been deported or removed from the United States, after having been 
determined deportable, require the consent of the Attorney General to 
apply for admission to the United States pursuant to section 
212(a)(9)(A)(iii) of the Act. Such persons may not be admitted to the 
United States under the provisions of this part notwithstanding the fact 
that the required consent of the Attorney General may have been secured. 
Such aliens must secure a visa in order to be admitted to the United 
States as nonimmigrants, unless otherwise exempt.
    (c) Restrictions on manner of arrival--(1) Applicants arriving by 
air and sea. Applicants must arrive on a carrier that is signatory to a 
Visa Waiver Pilot Program Agreement and at the time of arrival must have 
a round trip ticket that will transport the traveler out of the United 
States to any other foreign port or place as long as the trip does not 
terminate in contiguous territory or an adjacent island; except that the 
round trip ticket may transport the traveler to contiguous territory or 
an adjacent island, if the traveler is a resident of the country of 
destination.
    (2) Applicants arriving at land border ports-of-entry. Any Visa 
Waiver Pilot Program applicant arriving at a land border port-of-entry 
must provide evidence to the immigration officer of financial solvency 
and a domicile abroad to which the applicant intends to return. An 
applicant arriving at a land-border port-of-entry will be charged a fee 
as prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter for issuance of Form 
I-94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure Form. A round-trip 
transportation ticket is not required of applicants at land border 
ports-of-entry.
    (d) Aliens in transit. An alien who is in transit through the United 
States is eligible to apply for admission under the Visa Waiver Pilot 
Program, provided the applicant meets all other program requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 217.3  Maintenance of status.

    (a) Satisfactory departure. If an emergency prevents an alien 
admitted under this part from departing from the United States within 
his or her period of authorized stay, the district director having 
jurisdiction over the place of the alien's temporary stay may, in his or 
her discretion, grant a period of satisfactory departure not to exceed 
30 days. If departure is accomplished during that period, the alien is 
to be regarded as having satisfactorily accomplished the visit without 
overstaying the allotted time.
    (b) Readmission after departure to contiguous territory or adjacent 
island. An alien admitted to the United States under this part may be 
readmitted to the United States after a departure to foreign contiguous 
territory or adjacent island for the balance of his or her original Visa 
Waiver Pilot Program admission period if he or she is otherwise 
admissible and meets all the conditions of this part with the exception 
of arrival on a signatory carrier.

<R05>
Sec. 217.4  Inadmissibility and deportability.

    (a) Determinations of inadmissibility. (1) An alien who applies for 
admission under the provisions of section 217 of the Act, who is 
determined by an immigration officer not to be eligible for admission 
under that section or to be inadmissible to the United States under one 
or more of the grounds of inadmissibility listed in section 212 of the 
Act (other than for lack of a visa), or who is in possession of and 
presents fraudulent or counterfeit travel documents, will be refused 
admission into the United States and removed. Such refusal and removal 
shall be made at the level of the port director or officer-in-charge, or 
an officer acting in that capacity, and shall be effected without 
referral of the alien to an immigration judge for further inquiry, 
examination, or hearing, except that an alien who presents himself or 
herself as an applicant for admission under section 217 of the Act, who 
applies for asylum in the United States must be issued a Form I-863, 
Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, for a proceeding in accordance 
with Sec. 208.2(b)(1) and (2) of this chapter.
    (2) The removal of an alien under this section may be deferred if 
the alien is paroled into the custody of a Federal, State, or local law 
enforcement agency for criminal prosecution or punishment. This section 
in no way diminishes the discretionary authority of the Attorney General 
enumerated in section 212(d) of the Act.
    (3) Refusal of admission under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
shall not constitute removal for purposes of the Act.
    (b) Determination of deportability. (1) An alien who has been 
admitted to the United States under the provisions of section 217 of the 
Act and of this part who is determined by an immigration officer to be 
deportable from the United States under one or more of the grounds of 
deportability listed in section 237 of the Act shall be removed from the 
United States to his or her country of nationality or last residence. 
Such removal shall be determined by the district director who has 
jurisdiction over the place where the alien is found, and shall be 
effected without referral of the alien to an immigration judge for a 
determination of deportability, except that an alien admitted as a Visa 
Waiver Pilot Program visitor who applies for asylum in the United States 
must be issued a Form I-863 for a proceeding in accordance with 
Sec. 208.2(b)(1) and (2) of this chapter.
    (2) Removal by the district director under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is equivalent in all respects and has the same consequences as 
removal after proceedings conducted under section 240 of the Act.
    (c)(1) Removal of inadmissible aliens who arrived by air or sea. 
Removal of an alien from the United States under this section may be 
effected using the return portion of the round trip passage presented by 
the alien at the time of entry to the United States as required by 
section 217(a)(7) of the Act. Such removal shall be on the first 
available means of transportation to the alien's point of embarkation to 
the United States. Nothing in this part absolves the carrier of the 
responsibility to remove any inadmissible or deportable alien at carrier 
expense, as provided in the carrier agreement.
    (2) Removal of inadmissible and deportable aliens who arrived at 
land border ports-of-entry. Removal under this section will be by the 
first available means of transportation deemed appropriate by the 
district director.

Sec. 217.6  Carrier agreements.

    (a) General. The carrier agreements referred to in section 217(e) of 
the Act shall be made by the Commissioner on behalf of the Attorney 
General and shall be on Form I-775, Visa Waiver Pilot Program Agreement.
    (b) Termination of agreements. The Commissioner, on behalf of the 
Attorney General, may terminate any carrier agreement under this part, 
with 5 days notice to a carrier, for the carrier's failure to meet the 
terms of such agreement. As a matter of discretion, the Commissioner may 
notify a carrier of the existence of a basis for termination of a 
carrier agreement under this part and allow the carrier a period

[[Page 372]]

not to exceed 15 days within which the carrier may bring itself into 
compliance with the terms of the carrier agreement. The agreement shall 
be subject to cancellation by either party for any reason upon 15 days' 
written notice to the other party.

officer or upon presentation by an interested person of a notification 
from the consular officer requiring such a bond; such a bond also may be 
accepted by the district director with jurisdiction over the port of 
entry or preinspection station where inspection of the alien takes 
place. Upon acceptance of such a bond, the district director shall 
notify the United States consular officer who requested the bond, giving 
the date and place of acceptance and amount of the bond. All bonds given 
as a condition of admission of an alien under section 221(g) of the Act 
shall be executed on Form I-352. For procedures relating to bond riders, 
acceptable sureties, cancellation, or breaching of bonds, see Sec. 103.6

Sec. 223.1  Purpose of documents.

    (a) Reentry permit. A reentry permit allows a permanent resident to 
apply for admission to the United States upon return from abroad during 
the period of the permit's validity without the necessity of obtaining a 
returning resident visa.
    (b) Refugee travel document. A refugee travel document is issued 
pursuant to this part and article 28 of the United Nations Convention of 
July 29, 1951, for the purpose of travel. Except as provided in 
Sec. 223.3(d)(2)(i), a person who holds refugee status pursuant to 
section 207 of the Act, or asylum status pursuant to section 208 of the 
Act, must have a refugee travel document to return to the United States 
after temporary travel abroad unless he or she is in possession of a 
valid advance parole document.

[59 FR 1464, Jan. 11, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 10352, Mar. 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 223.2  Processing.

    (a) General. An application for a reentry permit, refugee travel 
document, or advance parole document must be filed on Form I-131, with 
the fee required in Sec. 103.7 of this chapter and with the initial 
evidence required on the application form.
    (b) Eligibility--(1) Reentry permit. Except as otherwise provided in 
this section, an application may be approved if filed by a person who is 
in the United States at the time of application and is a lawful 
permanent resident or conditional permanent resident.
    (2) Refugee travel document--(i) General. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section, an application may be approved if filed by a 
person who is in the United States at the time of application, and 
either holds valid refugee status under section 207 of the Act, valid 
asylum status under section 208 of the Act, or is a permanent resident 
and received such status as a direct result of his or her asylum or 
refugee status.
    (ii) Discretionary authority to adjudicate an application from an 
alien not within the United States. As a matter of discretion, a 
district director having jurisdiction over a port-of-entry or a

[[Page 373]]

preinspection station where an alien is an applicant for admission, or 
an overseas district director having jurisdiction over the place where 
an alien is physically present, may accept and adjudicate an application 
for a refugee travel document from an alien who previously had been 
admitted to the United States as a refugee, or who previously had been 
granted asylum status in the United States, and who had departed from 
the United States without having applied for such refugee travel 
document, provided:
    (A) The alien submits a Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, 
with the fee required under Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter;
    (B) The district director is satisfied that the alien did not intend 
to abandon his or her refugee status at the time of departure from the 
United States;
    (C) The alien did not engage in any activities while outside the 
United States that would be inconsistent with continued refugee or 
asylee status; and
    (D) The alien has been outside the United States for less than 1 
year since his or her last departure.
    (c) Ineligibility--(1) Prior document still valid. An application 
for a reentry permit or refugee travel document shall be denied if the 
applicant was previously issued a reentry permit or refugee travel 
document which is still valid, unless it was returned to the Service or 
it is demonstrated that it was lost.
    (2) Extended absences. A reentry permit issued to a person who, 
since becoming a permanent resident, or during the last 5 years, 
whichever is less, has been outside the United States for more than 4 
years in the aggregate, shall be limited to a validity of one year, 
except that a permit with a validity of two years may be issued to:
    (i) A permanent resident as defined in 8 CFR 211.1(b)(1)(ii) or 
211.1(b)(4);
    (ii) A permanent resident employed by a public international 
organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or 
statute, and his or her permanent resident spouse and children; or
    (iii) A permanent resident who is a professional athlete who 
regularly competes in the United States and worldwide.
    (3) Permanent resident entitled to nonimmigrant diplomatic or treaty 
status. A permanent resident entitled to nonimmigrant status under 
section 101(a)(15) (A), (E), or (G) of the Act because of occupational 
status may only be issued a reentry permit if the applicant executes and 
submits with the application, or has previously executed and submitted, 
a written waiver on Form I-508 required by section 247(b) of the Act and 
part 247 of this chapter and, if applicable, Form I-508F (election as to 
tax exemption under the Convention between the United States and the 
French Republic) required by part 247 of this chapter.
    (d) Effect of travel before a decision is made. Departure from the 
United States before a decision is made on an application for a reentry 
permit or refugee travel document shall not affect the application.
    (e) Processing. Approval of an application is solely at the 
discretion of the Service. If the application is approved, the requested 
document shall be issued as provided in this part.
    (f) Issuance. A reentry permit or refugee travel document may be 
sent in care of a United States Consulate or an overseas office of the 
Service if the applicant so requests at the time of filing. Issuance of 
a reentry permit or refugee travel document to a person in exclusion or 
deportation proceedings shall not affect those proceedings.
    (g) Appeal. Denial of an application for a reentry permit or refugee 
travel document may be appealed to the Service's Administrative Appeals 
Unit.

<R05>
Sec. 223.3  Validity and effect on admissibility.

    (a) Validity--(1) Reentry permit. Except as provided in 
Sec. 223.2(c)(2), a reentry permit issued to a permanent resident shall 
be valid for 2 years from the date of issuance. A reentry permit issued 
to a conditional permanent resident shall be valid for 2 years from the 
date of issuance, or to the date the conditional permanent resident must 
apply for removal of the conditions on

[[Page 374]]

his or her status, whichever comes first.
    (2) Refugee travel document. A refugee travel document shall be 
valid for 1 year, or to the date the refugee or asylee status expires, 
whichever comes first.
    (b) Invalidation. A document issued under this part is invalid if 
obtained through material false representation or concealment, or if the 
person is ordered excluded or deported. A refugee travel document is 
also invalid if the United Nations Convention of July 28, 1951, ceases 
to apply or does not apply to the person as provided in Article 1C, D, 
E, or F of the convention.
    (c) Extension. A reentry permit or refugee travel document may not 
be extended.
    (d) Effect on admissibility--(1) Reentry permit. A permanent 
resident or conditional permanent resident in possession of a valid 
reentry permit who is otherwise admissible shall not be deemed to have 
abandoned status based solely on the duration of an absence or absences 
while the permit is valid.
    (2) Refugee travel document--(i) Inspection and immigration status. 
Upon arrival in the United States, an alien who presents a valid 
unexpired refugee travel document, or who has been allowed to file an 
application for a refugee travel document and this application has been 
approved under the procedure set forth in Sec. 223.2(b)(2)(ii), shall be 
examined as to his or her admissibility under the Act. An alien shall be 
accorded the immigration status endorsed in his or her refugee travel 
document, or (in the case of an alien discussed in Sec. 223.2(b)(2)(ii)) 
which will be endorsed in such document, unless he or she is no longer 
eligible for that status, or he or she applies for and is found eligible

Sec. 231.1  Arrival manifest for passengers.

    (a) Requirement for manifest. The master, captain, or agent of every 
vessel or aircraft arriving in the United States from a foreign place or 
outlying possession of the United States shall present an arrival 
manifest to the immigration officer at the port of entry. The manifest 
must be in the form of a separate Arrival/Departure Record, Form I-94, 
prepared on board for each passenger except: United States citizens, 
lawful permanent resident aliens of the United States, and immigrants to 
the United States. In addition, a properly completed Aircraft/Vessel 
Report, Form I- 92, must be submitted for each arriving aircraft or 
vessel which is transporting passengers. Manifests are not required by 
vessels or aircraft arriving directly from Canada on a trip originating 
in that country or arriving in the Virgin Islands of the United States 
directly from a trip originating in the British Virgin Islands.
    (b) In-Transit Passengers. An Arrival/Departure Record, Form I-94, 
is not required for an arriving, through-flight passenger at a United 
States port provided:
    (1) The passenger will depart directly to a foreign place or 
outlying possession of the United States on the same flight;
    (2) The number of through-flight passengers is noted on the 
Aircraft/Vessel Report, Form I-92, for the flight;
    (3) The flight is inspected at a port of entry designated in

[[Page 375]]

    (5) All through-flight passengers remain on board the aircraft or in 
a separate area under the direction and control of the Service during 
the ground time.
    (c) Progressive Clearance. Inspection of arriving passengers may be 
deferred at the request of the carrier to an onward port of debarkation. 
Authorization for this progressive clearance may be granted by the 
Regional Commissioner when both the initial port of entry and the onward 
port are within the same regional jurisdiction, but when the initial 
port of entry and onward port are located within different regions, 
requests for progressive clearance must be authorized by the Assistant 
Commissioner for Inspections. When progressive clearance is requested, 
the carrier shall present Form I-92 in duplicate at the initial port of 
entry. The original Form I-92 will be processed at the initial port of 
entry, and the duplicate noted and returned to the carrier for 
presentation at the onward port of debarkation.
    (d) Preparation of Arrival/Departure Record, Form I-94. Air and sea 
carriers shall be responsible to ensure that a properly completed Form 
I-94 is presented to the immigration inspector at the port of entry for 
each arriving passenger except those passengers who do not require a 
Form I-94 under paragraph (a) of this section. The following classes of 
aliens are not required to complete the departure portion of the Form I-
94 if they are entering the U.S. for business or pleasure under section 
101(a)(15)(B) of the Act, and intend to remain in the United States for

<R05>
Sec. 231.2  Departure manifest for passengers.

    The master, captain, or agent of every vessel or aircraft departing 
from the United States for a foreign place or outlying possession of the 
United States shall present a departure manifest to the immigration 
officer at the port of departure. The manifest must be in the form of a 
properly completed departure portion of Form I-94, Arrival/Departure 
Record, for each person on board except for United States citizens, and 
lawful permanent resident aliens of the United States. No manifest is 
required for a vessel or aircraft departing on a trip directly for and 
terminating in Canada, or departing from the United States Virgin 
Islands driectly to the British Virgin Islands on a trip terminating in 
the British Virgin Islands. Whenever possible, the departure Form I-94 
used shall be the same form given the alien at the time of arrival in 
the United States. Carriers shall endorse the Form I-94 with the 
departure information on the reverse of the form. Additionally, a 
properly completed Aircraft/Vessel Report, Form I-92, must be completed 
for each departing aircraft and each departing vessel which is 
transporting passengers. Submission of Forms I-94 and I-92 to the 
immigration officer shall normally be accomplished within 48 hours of 
the departure, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. 
Failure to submit departure manifests within this time period shall be 
regarded as failure to comply with section 231(d) of the Act, unless 
prior authorization for delayed delivery of the departure manifest is 
obtained from the district director. A nonimmigrant alien departing on 
an aircraft proceeding directly to Canada on a flight terminating in 
that country should surrender any Form I-94 in his/her possession to the 
airline agent at the port of departure. Aircraft manifests should not 
include I-94 forms for in-transit passengers referred to in paragraph 
(b) of Sec. 231.1.

<R05>
Sec. 232.2  Examination in the United States of alien applicants for benefits under the immigration laws and other aliens.

    (a) General. When a medical examination is required of an alien who 
files an application for status as a permanent resident under section 
245 of the Act or part 245 of this chapter, it shall be made by a 
selected civil surgeon. Such examination shall be performed in 
accordance with 42 CFR part 34 and any additional instructions and 
guidelines as may be considered necessary by the U.S. Public Health 
Service. In any other case in which the Service requests a medical 
examination of an alien, the examination shall be made by a medical 
officer of the U.S. Public Health Service, or by a civil surgeon if a 
medical officer of the U.S. Public Health Service is not located within 
a reasonable distance or is otherwise not available.
    (b) Selection of civil surgeons. When a civil surgeon is to perform 
the examination, he shall be selected by the district director having 
jurisdiction over the area of the alien's residence. The district 
director shall select as many civil surgeons, including clinics and 
local, county and state health departments employing qualified civil 
surgeons, as he determines to be necessary to serve the needs of the 
Service in a locality under his jurisdiction. Each civil surgeon 
selected shall be a licensed physician with no less than 4 years' 
professional experience. Under usual circumstances physicians will be 
required to meet the 4 year professional experience criteria. However, 
at the district director's discretion other physicians with less 
experience can be designated to address unusual or unforeseen situations 
as the need arises. Officers of local health departments and medical 
societies may be consulted to obtain the names of competent surgeons and 
clinics willing to make the examinations. An understanding shall be 
reached with respect to the fee which the surgeon or clinic will charge 
for the examination. The alien shall pay the fee agreed upon directly to 
the surgeon making the examination.
    (c) Civil surgeon reports--(1) Applicants for status of permanent 
resident.
    (i) When an applicant for status as a permanent resident is found 
upon examination to be free of any defect, disease, or disability listed 
in section 212(a) of the Act, the civil surgeon shall endorse Form I-
486A, Medical Examination and Immigration Interview, and forward it with 
the X-ray and other pertinent laboratory reports to the immigration 
office from which the alien was referred, The immigration office may 
return the X-ray and laboratory reports to the alien. If the applicant 
is found to be afflicted with a defect, disease or disability listed 
under section 212(a) of the Act, the civil surgeon shall complete Form 
OF-157 in duplicate, and forward it with Form I-486A, X-ray, and other 
pertinent laboratory reports to the immigration office from which the 
alien was referred.
    (ii) If the applicant is found to be afflicted with active 
tuberculosis and a waiver is granted under section 212(g) of the Act, 
the immigration office will forward a copy of the completed Form I-601 
(Application for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability) and a copy of the 
Form OF-157 to the Director, Division of Quarantine, Center for 
Prevention Sevices, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333.
    (iii) If an alien who if found to be mentally retarded or to have 
had one or more previous attacks of insanity, applies for a waiver of 
excludability under section 212(g) of the Act, the immigration office 
will submit to the Director, Division of Quarantine, Center

[[Page 377]]

for Prevention Services, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333, 
the completed Form I-601, including a copy of the medical report 
specified in the instructions attached to that form, and a copy of Form 
OF-157. This official shall review the medical report and advise the 
Service whether it is acceptable, in accordance with 
Sec. 212.7(b)(4)(ii) of this chapter.
    (iv) In any other case where the applicant has been found to be 
afflicted with active or inactive tuberculosis or an infectious or 
noninfectious leprosy condition, the immigration office will forward a 
copy of Form OF-157 with the applicant's address endorsed on the reverse 
to the Director, Division of Quarantine, Center for Prevention Services, 
Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333.
    (2) Other aliens. The results of the examination of an alien who is 
not an applicant for status as a permanent resident shall be entered on 
Form I-141, Medical Certificate, in duplicate. This form shall be 
returned to the Service office by which the alien was referred.
    (d) U.S. Public Health Service hospital and outpatient clinic 
reports. When an applicant for a benefit under the immigration laws, 
other than an applicant for status as a permanent resident, is examined 
by a medical officer of the U.S. Public Health Service, the results of 
the examination shall be entered on Form I-141, Medical Certificate, in 
duplicate. The form shall be returned to the Service office by which the 
alien was referred.

    When a district director has reasonable grounds for believing that 
persons arriving in the United States should be detained for reasons 
specified in section 232 of the Act, he or she shall, after consultation 
with the United States Public Health Service at the port-of-entry, 
notify the master or agent of the arriving vessel or aircraft of his or 
her intention to effect such detention by serving on the master or agent 
Form I-259 in accordance with Sec. 235.3(a) of this chapter.

Sec. 234.2  Landing requirements.

    (a) Place of landing. Aircraft carrying passengers or crew required 
to be inspected under the Act shall land at the international air ports

furnish notice of the intended flight to the immigration officer at or 
nearest the intended place of landing, or shall furnish similar notice 
to the district director of Customs or other Customs officer in charge

passengers or crew required to be inspected under the Immigration and 
Nationality Act make a forced landing in the United States, the 
commanding officer or person in command shall not allow any passenger or 
crewman thereon to depart from the landing place without permission of 
an immigration officer, unless such departure is necessary for purposes

of the aircraft, shall communicate with the nearest immigration officer 
and make a full report of the circumstances of the flight and of the

<R05>
Sec. 235.1  Scope of examination.

    (a) General. Application to lawfully enter the United States shall 
be made in person to an immigration officer at a U.S. port-of-entry when 
the port is open for inspection, or as otherwise designated in this 
section.
    (b) U.S. citizens. A person claiming U.S. citizenship must establish 
that fact to the examining officer's satisfaction and must present a 
U.S. passport if such passport is required under the provisions of 22 
CFR part 53. If such applicant for admission fails to satisfy the 
examining immigration officer that he or she is a U.S. citizen, he or 
she shall thereafter be inspected as an alien.
    (c) Alien members of United States Armed Forces and members of a 
force of a NATO country. Any alien member of the United States Armed 
Forces who is in the uniform of, or bears documents identifying him or 
her as a member of, such Armed Forces, and who is coming to or departing 
from the United States under official orders or permit of such Armed 
Forces is not subject to the removal provisions of the Act. A member of 
the force of a NATO country signatory to Article III of the Status of 
Forces Agreement seeking to enter the United States under official 
orders is exempt from the control provision of the Act. Any alien who is 
a member of either of the foregoing classes may, upon request, be 
inspected and his or her entry as an alien may be recorded. If the alien 
does not appear to the examining immigration officer to be clearly and 
beyond a doubt entitled to enter the United States under the provisions 
of the Act, the alien shall be so informed and his or her entry shall 
not be recorded.
    (d) Alien applicants for admission. (1) Each alien seeking admission 
at a United States port-of-entry shall present whatever documents are 
required and shall establish to the satisfaction of the immigration 
officer that he or she is not subject to removal under the immigration 
laws, Executive Orders, or Presidential Proclamations and is entitled 
under all of the applicable provisions of the immigration laws and this 
chapter to enter the United States. A person claiming to have been 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence must establish that fact to 
the satisfaction of the inspecting immigration officer and must present 
proper documents in accordance with Sec. 211.1 of this chapter.

[[Page 381]]

    (2) An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted 
or paroled or an alien who seeks entry at other than an open, designated 
port-of-entry, except as otherwise permitted in this section, is subject 
to the provisions of section 212(a) of the Act and to removal under 
section 235(b) or 240 of the Act.
    (3) An alien who is brought to the United States, whether or not to 
a designated port-of-entry and regardless of the means of 
transportation, after having been interdicted in international or United 
States waters, is considered an applicant for admission and shall be 
examined under section 235(b) of the Act.
    (4) An alien stowaway is not an applicant for admission and may not 
be admitted to the United States. A stowaway shall be removed from the 
United States under section 235(a)(2) of the Act. The provisions of 
section 240 of the Act are not applicable to stowaways, nor is the 
stowaway entitled to further hearing or review of the removal, except 
that an alien stowaway who indicates an intention to apply for asylum 
shall be referred to an asylum officer for a determination of credible 
fear of persecution in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B) of the Act 
and Sec. 208.30 of this chapter. An alien stowaway who is determined to 
have a credible fear of persecution shall have his or her asylum 
application adjudicated in accordance with Sec. 208.2(b)(2) of this 
chapter. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require expedited 
removal proceedings in accordance with section 235(b)(1) of the Act. A 
stowaway who absconds either prior to inspection by an immigration 
officer or after being ordered removed as a stowaway pursuant to section 
235(a)(2) of the Act is not entitled to removal proceedings under 
section 240 of the Act and shall be removed under section 235(a)(2) of 
the Act as if encountered upon arrival. A stowaway who has been removed 
pursuant to section 235(a)(2) of the Act and this section shall be 
considered to have been formally removed from the United States for all 
purposes under the Act.
    (e) U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents of the United States, 
and other aliens, entering the United States along the northern border, 
other than at a Port-of-Entry. A citizen or lawful permanent resident of 
the United States, a Canadian national or landed immigrant of Canada 
having a common nationality with nationals of Canada, or a landed 
immigrant of Canada who is a national of a country listed in 
Sec. 217.2(a), may, if in possession of a valid, unexpired, Canadian 
Border Boat Landing Permit (Form I-68) or evidence of enrollment in any 
other Service Alternaitve Inspections program (e.g., the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS) or 
the Port Passenger Accelerated Service System (PORTPASS)), enter the 
United States by means of a pleasure craft along the northern border of 
the United States from time-to-time without further inspection. No 
persons other than those described in this paragraph may participate in 
this program. Landed immigrants of Canada who do not share a common 
nationality with nationals of Canada but whose country of nationality is 
listed in Sec. 217.2(a) must also be in possession of a valid, 
unexpired, passport issued by their country of nationality, a valid, 
unexpired, United States visa, and a valid, unexpired Form I-94 marked 
for multiple entries to the Untied States. When an entry to the United 
States is made by a person who is a Canadian citizen or a landed 
immigrant of Canada, entry may be made under this program only for a 
purpose as described in section 101(a)(15)(B)(ii) of the Act. Persons 
seeking to enter the United States for any other purpose must do so at a 
staffed Port-of-Entry. Persons aboard a vessel which has crossed the 
international boundary between the United States and Canada and who do 
not intend to land in the United States, other than at a staffed Port-
of-Entry, are not required to be in possession of Form I-68 or evidence 
of enrollment in an Alternative Inspections program merely because they 
have crossed the international boundary. However, the Service retains 
the right to conduct inspections or examinations of all persons applying 
for admission or readmission to or seeking transit through the United 
States in accordance with the Act.
    (1) Application. An eligible applicant may apply for a Canadian 
Border Boat Landing Permit by completing the

[[Page 382]]

Form I-68 in triplicate. Application forms will be made readily 
available through the Internet, from a Service office, or by mail. A 
family may apply on a single application. For the purposes of this 
paragraph, a family is defined as a husband, wife, unmarried children 
under the age of 21, and the parents of either husband or wife, who 
reside at the same address. In order for the I-68 application to be 
considered complete, it must be accompanied by the following:
    (i) For each person included on the application, evidence of 
citizenship, and, if not a citizen of the Untied States or Canada, 
evidence of legal permanent resident status in either the United States 
or Canada. Evidence of residency must be submitted by all applicants. It 
is not required that all persons on the application be of the same 
nationality; however, they must all be individually eligible to 
participate in this program.
    (ii) If multiple members of a family, as defined in paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section, are included on a single application, evidence of the 
familial relationship.
    (iii) A fee as prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.
    (iv) A copy of any previously approved Form I-68.
    (v) A landed immigrant of Canada who does not have a common 
nationality with nationals of Canada must also present a valid, 
unexpired, Form I-94 endorsed for multiple entries to the United States, 
his or her passport, and United States visa.
    (2) Submission of Form I-68. Except as indicated in this paragraph, 
Form I-68 shall be properly completed and submitted in person, along 
with the documentary evidence and the required fee as specified in 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter, to a United States immigration officer 
at a Canadian border Port-of-Entry located within the district having 
jurisdiction over the applicant's residence or intended place of 
landing. Persons previously granted Form I-68 approval may apply by mail 
to the issuing Service office for renewal if a copy of the previous Form 
I-68 is included in the application. At the discretion of the district 
director concerned, any applicant for renewal of Form I-68 may be 
required to appear for an interview in person if the applicant does not 
appear to be clearly eligible for renewal.
    (3) Denial of Form I-68. If the applicant has committed a violation 
of any immigration or customs regulation or, in the case of an alien, is 
inadmissible to the United States, approval of the Form I-68 shall be 
denied. However, if, in the exercise of discretion, the district 
director waives under section 212(d)(3) of the Act all applicable 
grounds of inadmissibility, the I-68 application may be approved for 
such non-citizens. If the Form I-68 application is denied, the applicant 
shall be given written notice of and the reasons for the denial by 
letter from the district director. There is no appeal from the denial of 
the Form I-68 application, but the denial is without prejudice to a 
subsequent application for this program or any other Service benefit, 
except that the applicant may not submit a subsequent Form I-68 
application for 90 days after the date of the last denial.
    (4) Validity. Form I-68 shall be valid for 1 year from the date of 
issuance, or until revoked or voided by the Service, except that in the 
case of a Form I-68 issued to a landed immigrant of Canada who does not 
have a common nationality with nationals of Canada, such Form I-68 shall 
not be valid for longer than the validity of the applicant's Form I-94.
    (5) Conditions for participation in the I-68 program. Upon being 
inspected and positively identified by an immigration officer and found 
admissible and eligible for participation in the I-68 program, a 
participant must agree to abide by the following conditions:
    (i) Form I-68 may be used only when entering the United States by 
means of a vessel exclusively used for pleasure, including chartered 
vessels when such vessel has been chartered by an approved Form I-68 
holder. When used by a person who is a not a citizen or a lawful 
permanent resident of the United States, admission shall be for a period 
not to exceed 72 hours to visit within 25 miles of the shore line along 
the northern border of the United States, including the shore line of 
Lake Michigan and Puget Sound.

[[Page 383]]

    (ii) Participants must be in possession of any authorization 
documents issued for participation in this program or another Service 
Alternative Inspections program (INSPASS or PORTPASS). Participants over 
the age of 15 years and who are not in possession of an INSPASS or 
PORTPASS enrollment card must also be in possession of a photographic 
identification document issued by a governmental agency. Participants 
who are landed immigrants of Canada and do not have a common nationality 
with nationals of Canada must also be in possession of a valid, 
unexpired, Form I-94 endorsed for multiple entries to the United States, 
a valid passport, and United States visa.
    (iii) Participants may not import merchandise or transport 
controlled or restricted items while entering the United States under 
this program. The entry of any merchandise or goods must be in 
accordance with the laws and regulations of all Federal Inspection 
Services.
    (iv) Participants must agree to random checks or inspections that 
may be conducted by the Service, at any time and at any location, to 
ensure compliance.
    (v) Participants must abide by all Federal, state, and local laws 
regarding the importation of alcohol or agricultural products or the 
importation or possession of controlled substances as defined in section 
101 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802).
    (vi) Participants acknowledge that all devices, decals, cards, or 
other Federal Government supplied identification or technology used to 
identify or inspect persons or vessels seeking entry via this program 
remain the property of the United States Government at all times, and 
must be surrendered upon request by a Border Patrol Agent or any other 
officer of a Federal Inspection Service.
    (vii) The captain, charterer, master, or owner (if aboard) of each 
vessel bringing persons into the United States is responsible for 
determining that all persons aboard the vessel are in possession of a 
valid, unexpired Form I-68 or other evidence of participation in a 
Service Alternative Inspections program (INSPASS or PORTPASS) prior to 
entry into the territorial waters of the United States. If any person on 
board is not in possession of such evidence, the captain, charterer, 
master, or owner must transport such person to a staffed United States 
Port-of-Entry for an in-person immigration inspection.
    (6) Revocation. The district director, the chief patrol agent, or 
their designated representatives may revoke the designation of any 
participant who violates any condition of this program, as contained in 
paragraph (e)(5) of this section, or who has violated any immigration 
law or regulation, or a law or regulation of the United States Customs 
Service or other Federal Inspection Service, has abandoned his or her 
residence in the United States or Canada, is inadmissible to the United 
States, or who is otherwise determined by an immigration officer to be 
ineligible for continued participation in this program. Such persons may 
be subject to other applicable sanctions, such as criminal and/or 
administrative prosecution or deportation, as well as possible seizure 
of goods and/or vessels. If permission to participate is revoked, a 
written request to the district director for restoration of permission 
to participate may be made. The district director will notify the person 
of his or her decision and the reasons therefore in writing.
    (7) Compliance checking. Participation in this program does not 
relieve the holder from responsibility to comply with all other aspects 
of United States Immigration, Customs, or other Federal inspection 
service laws or regulations. To prevent abuse, the United States 
Immigration and Naturalization Service retains the right to conduct 
inspections or examinations of all persons applying for admission or 
readmission to or seeking transit through the United States in 
accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act.
    (f) Form I-94, Arrival Departure Record. (1) Unless otherwise 
exempted, each arriving nonimmigrant who is admitted to the United 
States shall be issued, upon payment of a fee prescribed in 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter for land border admissions, a Form I-94 
as evidence of the terms of admission. A Form I-94 issued at a land 
border port-of-entry

[[Page 384]]

shall be considered issued for multiple entries unless specifically 
annotated for a limited number of entries. A Form I-94 issued at other 
than a land border port-of-entry, unless issued for multiple entries, 
must be surrendered upon departure from the United States in accordance 
with the instructions on the form. Form I-94 is not required by:
    (i) Any nonimmigrant alien described in Sec. 212.1(a) of this 
chapter and 22 CFR 41.33 who is admitted as a visitor for business or 
pleasure or admitted to proceed in direct transit through the United 
States;
    (ii) Any nonimmigrant alien residing in the British Virgin Islands 
who was admitted only to the U.S. Virgin Islands as a visitor for 
business or pleasure under Sec. 212.1(b) of this chapter;
    (iii) Any Mexican national in possession of a valid nonresident 
alien Mexican border crossing card, or a valid Mexican passport and a 
multiple-entry nonimmigrant visa issued under section 101(a)(15)(B) of 
the Act, who is admitted as a nonimmigrant visitor at a Mexican border 
port of entry for a period not to exceed 72 hours to visit within 25 
miles of the border;
    (iv) Bearers of Mexican diplomatic or official passports described 
in Sec. 212.1(c-1) of this chapter.
    (2) Paroled aliens. Any alien paroled into the United States under 
section 212(d)(5) of the Act, including any alien crewmember, shall be 
issued a completely executed Form I-94, endorsed with the parole stamp.

<R05>
Sec. 235.2  Parole for deferred inspection.

    (a) A district director may, in his or her discretion, defer the 
inspection of any vessel or aircraft, or of any alien, to another 
Service office or port-of-entry. Any alien coming to a United States 
port from a foreign port, from an outlying possession of the United 
States, from Guam, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United 
States, or from another port of the United States at which examination 
under this part was deferred, shall be regarded as an applicant for 
admission at that onward port.
    (b) An examining immigration officer may defer further examination 
and refer the alien's case to the district director having jurisdiction 
over the place where the alien is seeking admission, or over the place 
of the alien's residence or destination in the United States, if the 
examining immigration officer has reason to believe that the alien can 
overcome a finding of inadmissibility by:
    (1) Posting a bond under section 213 of the Act;
    (2) Seeking and obtaining a waiver under section 211 or 212(d)(3) or 
(4) of the Act; or
    (3) Presenting additional evidence of admissibility not available at 
the time and place of the initial examination.
    (c) Such deferral shall be accomplished pursuant to the provisions 
of section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the period of time necessary to 
complete the deferred inspection.
    (d) Refusal of a district director to authorize admission under 
section 213 of the Act, or to grant an application for the benefits of 
section 211 or section 212(d) (3) or (4) of the Act, shall be without 
prejudice to the renewal of such application or the authorizing of such 
admission by the immigration judge without additional fee.
    (e) Whenever an alien on arrival is found or believed to be 
suffering from a disability that renders it impractical to proceed with 
the examination under the Act, the examination of such alien, members of 
his or her family concerning whose admissibility it is necessary to have 
such alien testify, and any accompanying aliens whose protection or 
guardianship will be required should such alien be found inadmissible 
shall be deferred for such time and under such conditions as the 
district director in whose district the port is located imposes.

[62 FR 10355, Mar. 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 235.3  Inadmissible aliens and expedited removal.

    (a) Detention prior to inspection. All persons arriving at a port-
of-entry in the United States by vessel or aircraft shall be detained 
aboard the vessel or at the airport of arrival by the owner, agent, 
master, commanding officer, person in charge, purser, or consignee of 
such vessel or aircraft until admitted or otherwise permitted to land by

[[Page 385]]

an officer of the Service. Notice or order to detain shall not be 
required. The owner, agent, master, commanding officer, person in 
charge, purser, or consignee of such vessel or aircraft shall deliver 
every alien requiring examination to an immigration officer for 
inspection or to a medical officer for examination. The Service will not 
be liable for any expenses related to such detention or presentation or 
for any expenses of a passenger who has not been presented for 
inspection and for whom a determination has not been made concerning 
admissibility by a Service officer.
    (b) Expedited removal--(1) Applicability. The expedited removal 
provisions shall apply to the following classes of aliens who are 
determined to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or (7) of the 
Act:
    (i) Arriving aliens, as defined in Sec. 1.1(q) of this chapter, 
except for citizens of Cuba arriving at a United States port-of-entry by 
aircraft;
    (ii) As specifically designated by the Commissioner, aliens who 
arrive in, attempt to enter, or have entered the United States without 
having been admitted or paroled following inspection by an immigration 
officer at a designated port-of-entry, and who have not established to 
the satisfaction of the immigration officer that they have been 
physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year 
period immediately prior to the date of determination of 
inadmissibility. The Commissioner shall have the sole discretion to 
apply the provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act, at any time, to 
any class of aliens described in this section. The Commissioner's 
designation shall become effective upon publication of a notice in the 
Federal Register. However, if the Commissioner determines, in the 
exercise of discretion, that the delay caused by publication would 
adversely affect the interests of the United States or the effective 
enforcement of the immigration laws, the Commissioner's designation 
shall become effective immediately upon issuance, and shall be published 
in the Federal Register as soon as practicable thereafter. When these 
provisions are in effect for aliens who enter without inspection, the 
burden of proof rests with the alien to affirmatively show that he or 
she has the required continuous physical presence in the United States. 
Any absence from the United States shall serve to break the period of 
continuous physical presence. An alien who was not inspected and 
admitted or paroled into the United States but who establishes that he 
or she has been continuously physically present in the United States for 
the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of determination of 
inadmissibility shall be detained in accordance with section 235(b)(2) 
of the Act for a proceeding under section 240 of the Act.
    (2) Determination of inadmissibility--(i) Record of proceeding. An 
alien who is arriving in the United States, or other alien as designated 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, who is determined to 
be inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act 
(except an alien for whom documentary requirements are waived under 
Sec. 211.1(b)(3) or Sec. 212.1 of this chapter), shall be ordered 
removed from the United States in accordance with section 235(b)(1) of 
the Act. In every case in which the expedited removal provisions will be 
applied and before removing an alien from the United States pursuant to 
this section, the examining immigration officer shall create a record of 
the facts of the case and statements made by the alien. This shall be 
accomplished by means of a sworn statement using Form I-867AB, Record of 
Sworn Statement in Proceedings under Section 235(b)(1) of the Act. The 
examining immigration officer shall read (or have read) to the alien all 
information contained on Form I-867A. Following questioning and 
recording of the alien's statement regarding identity, alienage, and 
inadmissibility, the examining immigration officer shall record the 
alien's response to the questions contained on Form I-867B, and have the 
alien read (or have read to him or her) the statement, and the alien 
shall sign and initial each page of the statement and each correction. 
The examining immigration officer shall advise the alien of the charges 
against him or her on Form I-860, Notice and Order of Expedited Removal, 
and the alien shall be given an opportunity to respond to

[[Page 386]]

those charges in the sworn statement. After obtaining supervisory 
concurrence in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the 
examining immigration official shall serve the alien with Form I-860 and 
the alien shall sign the reverse of the form acknowledging receipt. 
Interpretative assistance shall be used if necessary to communicate with 
the alien.
    (ii) No entitlement to hearings and appeals. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section, such alien is not entitled to a hearing before 
an immigration judge in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 240 of 
the Act, or to an appeal of the expedited removal order to the Board of 
Immigration Appeals.
    (iii) Detention and parole of alien in expedited removal. An alien 
whose inadmissibility is being considered under this section or who has 
been ordered removed pursuant to this section shall be detained pending 
determination and removal, except that parole of such alien, in 
accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act, may be permitted only when 
the Attorney General determines, in the exercise of discretion, that 
parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a 
legitimate law enforcement objective.
    (3) Additional charges of inadmissibility. In the expedited removal 
process, the Service may not charge an alien with any additional grounds 
of inadmissibility other than section 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the 
Act. If an alien appears to be inadmissible under other grounds 
contained in section 212(a) of the Act, and if the Service wishes to 
pursue such additional grounds of inadmissibility, the alien shall be 
detained and referred for a removal hearing before an immigration judge 
pursuant to sections 235(b)(2) and 240 of the Act for inquiry into all 
charges. Once the alien is in removal proceedings under section 240 of 
the Act, the Service is not precluded from lodging additional charges 
against the alien. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Service 
from pursuing such additional grounds of inadmissibility against the 
alien in any subsequent attempt to reenter the United States, provided 
the additional grounds of inadmissibility still exist.
    (4) Claim of asylum or fear of persecution. If an alien subject to 
the expedited removal provisions indicates an intention to apply for 
asylum, a fear of persecution, or a fear of return to his or her 
country, the inspecting officer shall not proceed further with removal 
of the alien until the alien has been referred for an interview by an 
asylum officer in accordance with Sec. 208.30 of this chapter to 
determine if the alien has a credible fear of persecution. The examining 
immigration officer shall record sufficient information in the sworn 
statement to establish and record that the alien has indicated such 
intention, fear, or concern, and to establish the alien's 
inadmissibility.
    (i) Referral. The referring officer shall provide the alien with a 
written disclosure on Form M-444, Information About Credible Fear 
Interview, describing:
    (A) The purpose of the referral and description of the credible fear 
interview process;
    (B) The right to consult with other persons prior to the interview 
and any review thereof at no expense to the United States Government;
    (C) The right to request a review by an immigration judge of the 
asylum officer's credible fear determination; and
    (D) The consequences of failure to establish a credible fear of 
persecution.
    (ii) Detention pending credible fear interview. Pending the credible 
fear determination by an asylum officer and any review of that 
determination by an immigration judge, the alien shall be detained. 
Parole of such alien in accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act may 
be permitted only when the Attorney General determines, in the exercise 
of discretion, that parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is 
necessary for a legitimate law enforcement objective. Prior to the 
interview, the alien shall be given time to contact and consult with any 
person or persons of his or her choosing. Such consultation shall be 
made available in accordance with the policies and procedures of the 
detention facility where the alien is detained, shall be at no expense 
to the government, and shall not unreasonably delay the process.

[[Page 387]]

    (5) Claim to lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status or 
U.S. citizenship--(i) Verification of status. If an applicant for 
admission who is subject to expedited removal pursuant to section 
235(b)(1) of the Act claims to have been lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence, admitted as a refugee under section 207 of the Act, granted 
asylum under section 208 of the Act, or claims to be a U.S. citizen, the 
immigration officer shall attempt to verify the alien's claim. Such 
verification shall include a check of all available Service data systems 
and any other means available to the officer. An alien whose claim to 
lawful permanent resident, refugee, asylee status, or U.S. citizen 
status cannot be verified will be advised of the penalties for perjury, 
and will be placed under oath or allowed to make a declaration as 
permitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746, concerning his or her lawful admission 
for permanent residence, admission as a refugee under section 207 of the 
Act, grant of asylum status under section 208 of the Act, or claim to 
U.S. citizenship. A written statement shall be taken from the alien in 
the alien's own language and handwriting, stating that he or she 
declares, certifies, verifies, or states that the claim is true and 
correct. The immigration officer shall issue an expedited order of 
removal under section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act and refer the alien to 
the immigration judge for review of the order in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section and Sec. 235.6(a)(2)(ii). The 
person shall be detained pending review of the expedited removal order 
under this section. Parole of such person, in accordance with section 
212(d)(5) of the Act, may be permitted only when the Attorney General 
determines, in the exercise of discretion, that parole is required to 
meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a legitimate law 
enforcement objective.
    (ii) Verified lawful permanent residents. If the claim to lawful 
permanent resident status is verified, and such status has not been 
terminated in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, the 
examining immigration officer shall not order the alien removed pursuant 
to section 235(b)(1) of the Act. The examining immigration officer will 
determine in accordance with section 101(a)(13)(C) of the Act whether 
the alien is considered to be making an application for admission. If 
the alien is determined to be seeking admission and the alien is 
otherwise admissible, except that he or she is not in possession of the 
required documentation, a discretionary waiver of documentary 
requirements may be considered in accordance with section 211(b) of the 
Act and Sec. 211.1(b)(3) of this chapter or the alien's inspection may 
be deferred to an onward office for presentation of the required 
documents. If the alien appears to be inadmissible, the immigration 
officer may initiate removal proceedings against the alien under section 
240 of the Act.
    (iii) Verified refugees and asylees. If a check of Service records 
or other means indicates that the alien has been granted refugee status 
or asylee status, and such status has not been terminated in 
deportation, exclusion, or removal proceedings, the immigration officer 
shall not order the alien removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the 
Act. If the alien is not in possession of a valid, unexpired refugee 
travel document, the examining immigration officer may accept an 
application for a refugee travel document in accordance with 
Sec. 223.2(b)(2)(ii) of this chapter. If accepted, the immigration 
officer shall readmit the refugee or asylee in accordance with 
Sec. 223.3(d)(2)(i) of this chapter. If the alien is determined not to 
be eligible to file an application for a refugee travel document the 
immigration officer may initiate removal proceedings against the alien 
under section 240 of the Act.
    (iv) Review of order for claimed lawful permanent residents, 
refugees, asylees, or U.S. citizens. A person whose claim to U.S. 
citizenship has been verified may not be ordered removed. When an alien 
whose status has not been verified but who is claiming under oath or 
under penalty of perjury to be a lawful permanent resident, refugee, 
asylee, or U.S. citizen is ordered removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1) 
of the Act, the case will be referred to an immigration judge for review 
of the expedited removal order under section 235(b)(1)(C) of the Act and 
Sec. 235.6(a)(2)(ii). If the immigration judge determines that the

[[Page 388]]

alien has never been admitted as a lawful permanent resident or as a 
refugee, granted asylum status, or is not a U.S. citizen, the order 
issued by the immigration officer will be affirmed and the Service will 
remove the alien. There is no appeal from the decision of the 
immigration judge. If the immigration judge determines that the alien 
was once so admitted as a lawful permanent resident or as a refugee, or 
was granted asylum status, or is a U.S. citizen, and such status has not 
been terminated by final administrative action, the immigration judge 
will terminate proceedings and vacate the expedited removal order. The 
Service may initiate removal proceedings against such an alien, but not 
against a person determined to be a U.S. citizen, in proceedings under 
section 240 of the Act. During removal proceedings, the immigration 
judge may consider any waivers, exceptions, or requests for relief for 
which the alien is eligible.
    (6) Opportunity for alien to establish that he or she was admitted 
or paroled into the United States. If the Commissioner determines that 
the expedited removal provisions of section 235(b)(1) of the Act shall 
apply to any or all aliens described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section, such alien will be given a reasonable opportunity to establish 
to the satisfaction of the examining immigration officer that he or she 
was admitted or paroled into the United States following inspection at a 
port-of-entry. The alien will be allowed to present evidence or provide 
sufficient information to support the claim. Such evidence may consist 
of documentation in the possession of the alien, the Service, or a third 
party. The examining immigration officer will consider all such evidence 
and information, make further inquiry if necessary, and will attempt to 
verify the alien's status through a check of all available Service data 
systems. The burden rests with the alien to satisfy the examining 
immigration officer of the claim of lawful admission or parole. If the 
alien establishes that he or she was lawfully admitted or paroled, the 
case will be examined to determine if grounds of deportability under 
section 237(a) of the Act are applicable, or if paroled, whether such 
parole has been, or should be, terminated, and whether the alien is 
inadmissible under section 212(a) of the Act. An alien who cannot 
satisfy the examining officer that he or she was lawfully admitted or 
paroled will be ordered removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the 
Act.
    (7) Review of expedited removal orders. Any removal order entered by 
an examining immigration officer pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the 
Act must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate supervisor before 
the order is considered final. Such supervisory review shall not be 
delegated below the level of the second line supervisor, or a person 
acting in that capacity. The supervisory review shall include a review 
of the sworn statement and any answers and statements made by the alien 
regarding a fear of removal or return. The supervisory review and 
approval of an expedited removal order for an alien described in section 
235(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act must include a review of any claim of 
lawful admission or parole and any evidence or information presented to 
support such a claim, prior to approval of the order. In such cases, the 
supervisor may request additional information from any source and may 
require further interview of the alien.
    (8) Removal procedures relating to expedited removal. An alien 
ordered removed pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the Act shall be 
removed from the United States in accordance with section 241(c) of the 
Act and 8 CFR part 241.
    (9) Waivers of documentary requirements. Nothing in this section 
limits the discretionary authority of the Attorney General, including 
authority under sections 211(b) or 212(d) of the Act, to waive the 
documentary requirements for arriving aliens.
    (10) Applicant for admission under section 217 of the Act. The 
provisions of Sec. 235.3(b) do not apply to an applicant for admission 
under section 217 of the Act.
    (c) Arriving aliens placed in proceedings under section 240 of the 
Act. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any arriving alien 
who appears to the inspecting officer to be inadmissible, and who is 
placed in removal proceedings pursuant to section 240 of the Act shall 
be detained in accordance with section

[[Page 389]]

235(b) of the Act. Parole of such alien shall only be considered in 
accordance with Sec. 212.5(a) of this chapter. This paragraph shall also 
apply to any alien who arrived before April 1, 1997, and who was placed 
in exclusion proceedings.
    (d) Service custody. The Service will assume custody of any alien 
subject to detention under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. In its 
discretion, the Service may require any alien who appears inadmissible 
and who arrives at a land border port-of-entry from Canada or Mexico, to 
remain in that country while awaiting a removal hearing. Such alien 
shall be considered detained for a proceeding within the meaning of 
section 235(b) of the Act and may be ordered removed in absentia by an 
immigration judge if the alien fails to appear for the hearing.
    (e) Detention in non-Service facility. Whenever an alien is taken 
into Service custody and detained at a facility other than at a Service 
Processing Center, the public or private entities contracted to perform 
such service shall have been approved for such use by the Service's Jail 
Inspection Program or shall be performing such service under contract in 
compliance with the Standard Statement of Work for Contract Detention 
Facilities. Both programs are administered by the Detention and 
Deportation section having jurisdiction over the alien's place of 
detention. Under no circumstances shall an alien be detained in 
facilities not meeting the four mandatory criteria for usage. These are:
    (1) 24-Hour supervision,
    (2) Conformance with safety and emergency codes,
    (3) Food service, and
    (4) Availability of emergency medical care.
    (f) Privilege of communication. The mandatory notification 
requirements of consular and diplomatic officers pursuant to 
Sec. 236.1(e) of this chapter apply when an inadmissible alien is 
detained for removal proceedings, including for purpose of conducting 
the credible fear determination.

Sec. 235.4  Withdrawal of application for admission.

    The Attorney General may, in his or her discretion, permit any alien 
applicant for admission to withdraw his or her application for admission 
in lieu of removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act or expedited 
removal under section 235(b)(1) of the Act. The alien's decision to 
withdraw his or her application for admission must be made voluntarily, 
but nothing in this section shall be construed as to give an alien the 
right to withdraw his or her application for admission. Permission to 
withdraw an application for admission should not normally be granted 
unless the alien intends and is able to depart the United States 
immediately. An alien permitted to withdraw his or her application for 
admission shall normally remain in carrier or Service custody pending 
departure, unless the district director determines that parole of the 
alien is warranted in accordance with Sec. 212.5(a) of this chapter.

Sec. 235.5  Preinspection.

    (a) In United States territories and possessions. In the case of any 
aircraft proceeding from Guam, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin 
Islands destined directly and without touching at a foreign port or 
place, to any other of such places, or to one of the States of the 
United States or the District of Columbia, the examination of the 
passengers and crew required by the Act may be made prior to the 
departure of the aircraft, and in such event, final determination of 
admissibility shall be made immediately prior to such departure. The 
examination shall be conducted in accordance with sections 232, 235, and 
240 of the Act and 8 CFR parts 235 and 240. If it appears to the 
examining immigration officer that any person in the United States being 
examined under this section is prima facie removable from the United 
States, further action with respect to his or her examination shall be 
deferred and further proceedings regarding removability conducted as 
provided in section 240 of the Act and 8 CFR part 240. When the 
foregoing inspection procedure is

[[Page 390]]

applied to any aircraft, persons examined and found admissible shall be 
placed aboard the aircraft, or kept at the airport separate and apart 
from the general public until they are permitted to board the aircraft. 
No other person shall be permitted to depart on such aircraft until and 
unless he or she is found to be admissible as provided in this section.
    (b) In foreign territory. In the case of any aircraft, vessel, or 
train proceeding directly, without stopping, from a port or place in 
foreign territory to a port-of-entry in the United States, the 
examination and inspection of passengers and crew required by the Act 
and final determination of admissibility may be made immediately prior 
to such departure at the port or place in the foreign territory and 
shall have the same effect under the Act as though made at the destined 
port-of-entry in the United States.

Sec. 235.6  Referral to immigration judge.

    (a) Notice--(1) Referral by Form I-862, Notice to Appear. An 
immigration officer or asylum officer will sign and deliver a Form I-862 
to an alien in the following cases:
    (i) If, in accordance with the provisions of section 235(b)(2)(A) of 
the Act, the examining immigration officer detains an alien for a 
proceeding before an immigration judge under section 240 of the Act; or
    (ii) If, in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act, an 
asylum officer determines that an alien in expedited removal proceedings 
has a credible fear of persecution and refers the case to the 
immigration judge for consideration of the application for asylum.
    (iii) If, in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) of the 
Act, the immigration judge determines that an alien in expedited removal 
proceedings has a credible fear of persecution and vacates the expedited 
removal order issued by the asylum officer pursuant to section 
235(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act.
    (iv) If an immigration officer verifies that an alien subject to 
expedited removal under section 235(b)(1) of the Act has been admitted 
as a lawful permanent resident refugee, or asylee, or upon review 
pursuant to Sec. 235.3(b)(5)(iv) an immigration judge determines that 
the alien was once so admitted, provided that such status has not been 
terminated by final administrative action, and the Service initiates 
removal proceedings against the alien under section 240 of the Act.
    (2) Referral by Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge. 
An immigration officer will sign and deliver a Form I-863 to an alien in 
the following cases:
    (i) If, in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) of the 
Act, an asylum officer determines that an alien does not have a credible 
fear of persecution, and the alien requests a review of that 
determination by an immigration judge; or
    (ii) If, in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(C) of the Act, an 
immigration officer refers an expedited removal order entered on an 
alien claiming to be a lawful permanent resident, refugee, asylee, or 
U.S. citizen for whom the officer could not verify such status to an 
immigration judge for review of the order.
    (iii) If an immigration officer refers an applicant described in 
Sec. 208.2(b)(1) of this chapter to an immigration judge for an asylum 
hearing under Sec. 208.2(b)(2) of this chapter.
    (b) Certification for mental condition; medical appeal. An alien 
certified under sections 212(a)(1) and 232(b) of the Act shall be 
advised by the examining immigration officer that he or she may appeal 
to a board of medical examiners of the United States Public Health 
Service pursuant to section 232 of the Act. If such appeal is taken, the 
district director shall arrange for the convening of the medical board.

Sec. 235.7  Automated inspection services.

    (a) PORTPASS Program--(1) Definitions--(i) Port Passenger 
Accelerated Service System (PORTPASS). A system in which certain ports-
of-entry (POEs) are identified and designated by the Service as 
providing access to the United States for a group of identified, low-
risk, border crossers. Alien participants in the PORTPASS program are 
personally inspected, identified, and screened in advance of approval 
for

[[Page 391]]

participation in the program by an immigration officer, and may apply to 
enter the United States through a dedicated commuter lane (DCL) or 
through an automated permit port (APP). Such advance inspection and 
identification, when the enrolled participant satisfies the conditions 
and requirements set fourth in this section, satisfies the reporting 
requirements of Sec. 235.1(a). Each successful use of PORTPASS 
constitutes a separate and completed inspection and application for 
entry by the alien program participants on the date PORTPASS is used. 
United States citizens who meet the eligibility requirements for 
participation are subject to all rules, procedures, and conditions for 
use set forth in this section.
    (ii) Automated Permit Port (APP). A POE designated by the Service to 
provide access to the United States by an identified, low-risk, border 
crosser through the use of automation when the POE is not staffed. An 
APP has limited hours of operation and is located at a remote location 
on a land border. This program is limited to the northern border of the 
United States.
    (iii) Dedicated Commuter Lane (DCL). A special lane set apart from 
the normal flow of traffic at a land border POE which allows an 
accelerated inspection for identified, low-risk travelers. This program 
is limited to the northern border of the United States and the 
California-Mexico border.
    (iv) DCL system costs fee. A fee charged to a participant to cover 
the cost of the implementation and operation of the PORTPASS system. If 
a participant wishes to enroll more than one vehicle for use in the 
PORTPASS system, he or she will be assessed an additional vehicle fee 
for each additional vehicle enrolled. Regardless of when the additional 
vehicle is enrolled, the expiration date for use of that vehicle in the 
DCL will be the same date that the respective participant's authorized 
use of the lane expires, or is otherwise revoked.
    (2) Designation of POEs for PORTPASS access. The following criteria 
shall be used by the Service in the selection of a POE when classifying 
the POE as having PORTPASS access:
    (i) The location has an identifiable group of low-risk border 
crossers;
    (ii) The institution of PORTPASS access will not significantly 
inhibit normal traffic flow;
    (iii) The POE selected for access via a DCL has a sufficient number 
of Service personnel to perform primary and secondary inspection 
functions.
    (3) General eligibility requirements for PORTPASS program 
applicants. Applicants to PORTPASS must be citizens or lawful permanent 
residents of the United States, or nonimmigrants determined to be 
eligible by the Commissioner of the Service. Non-United States citizens 
must meet all applicable documentary and entry eligibility requirements 
of the Act. Applicants must agree to furnish all information requested 
on the application, and must agree to terms set forth for use of the 
PORTPASS program. Use of the PORTPASS program constitutes application 
for entry into the United States. Criminal justice information databases 
will be checked to assist in determining the applicant's eligibility for 
the PORTPASS program at the time the Form I-823, Application--
Alternative Inspection Services, is submitted. Criminal justice 
information on PORTPASS participants will be updated regularly, and the 
results will be checked electronically at the time of each approved 
participant's use of PORTPASS. Notwithstanding the provisions of 8 CFR 
part 264, fingerprints on Form FD-258 or in the manner prescribed by the 
Service may be required.
    (4) Application. (i) Application for PORTPASS access shall be made 
on Form I-823, Application--Alternative Inspection Services. 
Applications may be submitted during regular working hours at the 
principal Port-of-Entry having jurisdiction over the Port-of-Entry for 
which the applicant requests access. Applications may also be submitted 
by mail.
    (ii) Each person seeking PORTPASS access must file a separate 
application.
    (iii) The number of persons and vehicles which can use a DCL is 
limited numerically by the technology of the system. For this reason, 
distribution of applications at each POE may be limited.
    (iv) Applications must be supported by evidence of citizenship, and, 
in the case of lawful permanent residents of

[[Page 392]]

the United States, evidence of lawful permanent resident status in the 
United States. Alien applicants required to possess a valid visa must 
present documentation establishing such possession and any other 
documentation as required by the Act at the time of the application, and 
must be in possession of such documentation at the time of each entry, 
and at all times while present in the United States. Evidence of 
residency must be submitted by all applicants. Evidence of employment 
may be required to be furnished by the applicant. A current valid 
driver's license, and evidence of vehicle registration and insurance for 
the vehicle which will be occupied by the applicant as a driver or 
passenger when he or she uses the DCL or APP must be presented to the 
Service prior to approval of the application.
    (v) A completed Form I-823 must be accompanied by the fee as 
prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter. Each PORTPASS applicant 
14 years-of-age or older must complete the application and pay the 
application fee. Applicants under the age of 14 will be required to 
complete the application, but will not be required to pay the 
application fee. An application for a replacement PORTPASS card must be 
made on the Form I-823, and filed with the fee prescribed in 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1). The district director having jurisdiction over the POE 
where the applicant requests access may, in his or her discretion, waive 
the application or replacement fee.
    (vi) If fingerprints are required to assist in a determination of 
eligibility at that POE, the applicant will be so advised by the Service 
prior to submitting his or her application. The applicant shall also be 
informed at that time of the current Federal Bureau of Investigation fee 
for conducting a fingerprint check. This fee must be paid by the 
applicant to the Service before any processing of the application shall 
occur. The fingerprint fee may be not be waived.
    (vii) Each applicant must present himself or herself for an 
inspection and/or positive identification at a time designated by the 
Service prior to approval of the application.
    (viii) Each vehicle that a PORTPASS participant desires to register 
in PORTPASS must be inspected and approved by the Service prior to use 
in the PORTPASS system. Evidence of valid, current registration and 
vehicle insurance must be presented to the Service at the time the 
vehicle is inspected. If the vehicle is not owned by the participant, 
the participant may be required to present written permission from the 
registered owner authorizing use of the vehicle in the PORTPASS program 
throughout the PORTPASS registration period.
    (ix) An applicant, whether an occupant or driver, may apply to use 
more than one vehicle in the DCL. The first vehicle listed on the Form 
I-823 will be designated as the applicant's primary vehicle. The second 
vehicle, if not designated by another applicant as his or her primary 
vehicle, is subject to the additional vehicle charge as prescribed by 
the Service.
    (x) An application may be denied in the discretion of the district 
director having jurisdiction over the POE where the applicant requests 
access. Notice of such denial shall be given to the applicant. There is 
no appeal from the denial, but denial is without prejudice to reapplying 
for this or any other Service benefit. Re-applications, or applications 
following revocation of permission to use the lane, will not be 
considered by the Service until 90 days have passed following the date 
of denial or revocation. Criteria which will be considered in the 
decision to approve or deny the application include the following: 
admissibility to the United States and documentation so evidencing, 
criminal history and/or evidence of criminality, purpose of travel, 
employment, residency, prior immigration history, possession of current 
driver's license, vehicle insurance and registration, and vehicle 
inspection.
    (xi) Applications approved by the Service will entitle the applicant 
to seek entry via a designated PORTPASS Program POE for a period of 1 
year from the date of approval of the application unless approval is 
otherwise withdrawn. An application for a replacement card will not 
extend the initial period of approval.

[[Page 393]]

    (5) By applying for and participating in the PORTPASS program, each 
approved participant acknowledges and agrees to all of the following:
    (i) The installation and/or use of, in the vehicle approved for use 
in the PORTPASS program, any and all decals, devices, technology or 
other methodology deemed necessary by the Service to ensure inspection 
of the person(s) seeking entry through a DCL, in addition to any fee 
and/or monetary deposit assessed by the Service pending return of any 
and all such decals, devices, technology, and other methodology in 
undamaged condition.
    (ii) That all devices, decals, or other equipment, methodology, or 
technology used to identify or inspect persons or vehicles seeking entry 
via any PORTPASS program remains the property of the United States 
Government at all times, and must be surrendered upon request by the 
Service. Each participant agrees to abide by the terms set forth by the 
Service for use of any device, decal, or other equipment, method or 
technology.
    (iii) The payment of a system costs fee as determined by the Service 
to be necessary to cover the costs of implementing, maintaining, and 
operating the PORTPASS program.
    (iv) That each occupant of a vehicle applying for entry through 
PORTPASS must have current approval from the Service to apply for entry 
through the PORTPASS program in that vehicle.
    (v) That a participant must be in possession of any authorization 
document(s) issued for PORTPASS access and any other entry document(s) 
as required by the Act or by regulation at the time of each entry to the 
United States.
    (vi) That a participant must positively identify himself or herself 
in the manner prescribed by the Service at the time of each application 
for entry via the PORTPASS.
    (vii) That each use of PORTPASS constitutes a separate application 
for entry to the United States by the alien participant.
    (viii) That each participant agrees to be responsible for all 
contents of the vehicle that he or she occupies when using PORTPASS.
    (ix) That a participant may not import merchandise or transport 
controlled or restricted items using PORTPASS. The entry of any 
merchandise or goods must be in accordance with the laws and regulations 
of all other Federal inspection agencies.
    (x) That a participant must abide by all Federal, state and local 
laws regarding the importation of alcohol or agricultural products or 
the importation or possession of controlled substances as defined in 
section 101 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 802).
    (xi) That a participant will be subject to random checks or 
inspections that may be conducted by the Service at any time and at any 
location, to ensure compliance.
    (xii) That current vehicle registration and, if applicable, current 
permission to use the vehicle in PORTPASS, and evidence of current 
vehicle insurance, shall be in the vehicle at all times during use of 
PORTPASS.
    (xiii) Participant agrees to notify the Service if a vehicle 
approved for use in a PORTPASS program is sold, stolen, damaged, or 
disposed of otherwise. If a vehicle is sold, it is the responsibility of 
the participant to remove or obliterate any identifying device or other 
authorization for participation in the program or at the time of sale 
unless otherwise notified by the Service. If any license plates are 
replaced on an enrolled vehicle, the participant must submit a properly 
executed Form I-823, without fee, prior to use of the vehicle in the 
PORTPASS program.
    (xiv) That APP-approved participants who wish to enter the United 
States through a POE other than one designated as an APP through which 
they may pass must present themselves for inspection or examination by 
an immigration officer during normal business hours. Entry to the United 
States during hours when a Port of Entry is not staffed may be made only 
through a POE designated as an APP.
    (b) Violation of condition of the PORTPASS program. A PORTPASS 
program participant who violates any condition of the PORTPASS program, 
or who has violated any immigration law or regulation, or a law or 
regulation of the United States Customs Service or

[[Page 394]]

other Federal Inspection Service, or who is otherwise determined by an 
immigration officer to be inadmissible to the United States or 
ineligible to participate in PORTPASS, may have the PORTPASS access 
revoked at the discretion of the district director or the chief patrol 
agent and may be subject to other applicable sanctions, such as criminal 
and/or administrative prosecution or deportation, as well as possible 
seizure of goods and/or vehicles.
    (c) Judicial review. Nothing in this section is intended to create 
any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable in law or 
equity by a party against the Department of Justice, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, their officers or any employees of the 
Department of Justice.

Sec. 235.8  Inadmissibility on security and related grounds.

    (a) Report. When an immigration officer or an immigration judge 
suspects that an arriving alien appears to be inadmissible under section 
212(a)(3)(A) (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of the Act, the 
immigration officer or immigration judge shall order the alien removed 
and report the action promptly to the district director who has 
administrative jurisdiction over the place where the alien has arrived 
or where the hearing is being held. The immigration officer shall, if 
possible, take a brief sworn question-and-answer statement from the 
alien, and the alien shall be notified by personal service of Form I-
147, Notice of Temporary Inadmissibility, of the action taken and the 
right to submit a written statement and additional information for 
consideration by the Attorney General. The district director shall 
forward the report to the regional director for further action as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Action by regional director. (1) In accordance with section 
235(c)(2)(B) of the Act, the regional director may deny any further 
inquiry or hearing by an immigration judge and order the alien removed 
by personal service of Form I-148, Notice of Permanent Inadmissibility, 
or issue any other order disposing of the case that the regional 
director considers appropriate.
    (2) If the regional director concludes that the case does not meet 
the criteria contained in section 235(c)(2)(B) of the Act, the regional 
director may direct that:
    (i) An immigration officer shall conduct a further examination of 
the alien, concerning the alien's admissibility; or,
    (ii) The alien's case be referred to an immigration judge for a 
hearing, or for the continuation of any prior hearing.
    (3) The regional director's decision shall be in writing and shall 
be signed by the regional director. Unless the written decision contains 
confidential information, the disclosure of which would be prejudicial 
to the public interest, safety, or security of the United States, the 
written decision shall be served on the alien. If the written decision 
contains such confidential information, the alien shall be served with a 
separate written order showing the disposition of the case, but with the 
confidential information deleted.
    (c) Finality of decision. The regional director's decision under 
this section is final when it is served upon the alien in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. There is no administrative appeal 
from the regional director's decision.
    (d) Hearing by immigration judge. If the regional director directs 
that an alien subject to removal under this section be given a hearing 
or further hearing before an immigration judge, the hearing and all 
further proceedings in the matter shall be conducted in accordance with 
the provisions of section 240 of the Act and other applicable sections 
of the Act to the same extent as though the alien had been referred to 
an immigration judge by the examining immigration officer. In a case 
where the immigration judge ordered the alien removed pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Service shall refer the case back to 
the immigration judge and proceedings shall be automatically reopened 
upon receipt of the notice of referral. If confidential information, not 
previously considered in the matter, is presented supporting the 
inadmissibility of the alien under section 212(a)(3)(A) (other than 
clause

[[Page 395]]

(ii)), (B) or (C) of the Act, the disclosure of which, in the discretion 
of the immigration judge, may be prejudicial to the public interest, 
safety, or security, the immigration judge may again order the alien 
removed under the authority of section 235(c) of the Act and further 
action shall be taken as provided in this section.
    (e) Nonapplicability. The provisions of this section shall apply 
only to arriving aliens, as defined in Sec. 1.1(q) of this chapter. 
Aliens present in the United States who have not been admitted or 
paroled may be subject to proceedings under Title V of the Act.

Sec. 235.9  Northern Marianas identification card.

    During the two-year period that ended July 1, 1990, the Service 
issued Northern Marianas Identification Cards to aliens who acquired 
United States citizenship when the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United 
States entered into force on November 3, 1986. These cards remain valid 
as evidence of United States citizenship. Although the Service no longer 
issues these cards, a United States citizen to whom a card was issued 
may file Form I-777, Application for Issuance or Replacement of Northern 
Marianas Card, to obtain replacement of a lost, stolen, or mutilated 
Northern Marianas Identification Card.

<R05>
Sec. 235.10  U.S. Citizen Identification Card.

    (a) General. Form I-197, U.S. Citizen Identification Card, is no 
longer issued by the Service but valid existing cards will continue to 
be acceptable documentation of U.S. citizenship. Possession of the 
identification card is not mandatory for any purpose. A U.S. Citizen 
Identification Card remains the property of the United States. Because 
the identification card is no longer issued, there are no provisions for 
replacement cards.
    (b) Surrender and voidance--(1) Institution of proceeding under 
section 240 or 342 of the Act. A U.S. Citizen Identification Card must 
be surrendered provisionally to a Service office upon notification by 
the district director that a proceeding under section 240 or 342 of the 
Act is being instituted against the person to whom the card was issued. 
The card shall be returned to the person if the final order in the 
proceeding does not result in voiding the card under this paragraph. A 
U.S. Citizen Identification Card is automatically void if the person to 
whom it was issued is determined to be an alien in a proceeding 
conducted under section 240 of the Act, or if a certificate, document, 
or record relating to that person is canceled under section 342 of the 
Act.
    (2) Investigation of validity of identification card. A U.S. Citizen 
Identification Card must be surrendered provisionally upon notification 
by a district director that the validity of the card is being 
investigated. The card shall be returned to the person who surrendered 
it if the investigation does not result in a determination adverse to 
his or her claim to be a United States citizen. When an investigation 
results in a tentative determination adverse to the applicant's claim to 
be a United States citizen, the applicant shall be notified by certified 
mail directed to his or her last known address. The notification shall 
inform the applicant of the basis for the determination and of the 
intention of the district director to declare the card void unless 
within 30 days the applicant objects and demands an opportunity to see 
and rebut the adverse evidence. Any rebuttal, explanation, or evidence 
presented by the applicant must be included in the record of proceeding. 
The determination whether the applicant is a United States citizen must 
be based on the entire record and the applicant shall be notified of the 
determination. If it is determined that the applicant is not a United 
States citizen, the applicant shall be notified of the reasons, and the 
card deemed void. There is no appeal from the district director's 
decision.
    (3) Admission of alienage. A U.S. Citizen Identification Card is 
void if the person to whom it was issued admits in a statement signed 
before an immigration officer that he or she is an alien and consents to 
the voidance of the card. Upon signing the statement the

[[Page 396]]

card must be surrendered to the immigration officer.
    (4) Surrender of void card. A void U.S. Citizen Identification Card 
which has not been returned to the Service must be surrendered without 
delay to an immigration officer or to the issuing office of the Service.
    (c) U.S. Citizen Identification Card previously issued on Form I-
179. A valid Form I-179, U.S. Citizen Identification Card, continues to 
be valid subject to the provisions of this section.

Sec. 235.11  Admission of conditional permanent residents.

    (a) General--(1) Conditional residence based on family relationship. 
An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa 
as the spouse or son or daughter of a United States citizen or lawful 
permanent resident shall be examined to determine whether the conditions 
of section 216 of the Act apply. If so, the alien shall be admitted 
conditionally for a period of 2 years. At the time of admission, the 
alien shall be notified that the alien and his or her petitioning spouse 
must file a Form I-751, Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence, 
within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of 
the alien's admission for permanent residence.
    (2) Conditional residence based on entrepreneurship. An alien 
seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as an 
alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act) or the 
spouse or unmarried minor child of an alien entrepreneur shall be 
admitted conditionally for a period of 2 years. At the time of 
admission, the alien shall be notified that the principal alien 
(entrepreneur) must file a Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to 
Remove Conditions, within the 90-day period immediately preceding the 
second anniversary of the alien's admission for permanent residence.
    (b) Correction of endorsement on immigrant visa. If the alien is 
subject to the provisions of section 216 of the Act, but the 
classification endorsed on the immigrant visa does not so indicate, the 
endorsement shall be corrected and the alien shall be admitted as a 
lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis, if otherwise 
admissible. Conversely, if the alien is not subject to the provisions of 
section 216 of the Act, but the visa classification endorsed on the 
immigrant visa indicates that the alien is subject thereto (e.g., if the 
second anniversary of the marriage upon which the immigrant visa is 
based occurred after the issuance of the visa and prior to the alien's 
application for admission) the endorsement on the visa shall be 
corrected and the alien shall be admitted as a lawful permanent resident 
without conditions, if otherwise admissible.
    (c) Expired conditional permanent resident status. The lawful 
permanent resident alien status of a conditional resident automatically 
terminates if the conditional basis of such status is not removed by the 
Service through approval of a Form I-751, Petition to Remove the 
Conditions on Residence or, in the case of an alien entrepreneur (as 
defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), Form I-829, Petition by 
Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions. Therefore, an alien who is seeking 
admission as a returning resident subsequent to the second anniversary 
of the date on which conditional residence was obtained (except as 
provided in Sec. 211.1(b)(1) of this chapter) and whose conditional 
basis of such residence has not been removed pursuant to section 216(c) 
or 216A(c) of the Act, whichever is applicable, shall be placed under 
removal proceedings. However, in a case where conditional residence was 
based on a marriage, removal proceedings may be terminated and the alien 
may be admitted as a returning resident if the required Form I-751 is 
filed jointly, or by the alien alone (if appropriate), and approved by 
the Service. In the case of an alien entrepreneur, removal proceedings 
may be terminated and the alien admitted as a returning resident if the 
required Form I-829 is filed by the alien entrepreneur and approved by 
the Service.

<R04>
        Subpart A--Detention of Aliens Prior to Order of Removal


<R05>
Sec. 236.1  Apprehension, custody, and detention.

    (a) Detainers. The issuance of a detainer under this section shall 
be governed by the provisions of Sec. 287.7 of this chapter.
    (b) Warrant of arrest--(1) In general. At the time of issuance of 
the notice to appear, or at any time thereafter and up to the time 
removal proceedings are completed, the respondent may be arrested and 
taken into custody under the authority of Form I-200, Warrant of Arrest. 
A warrant of arrest may be issued only by those immigration officers 
listed in Sec. 287.5(e)(2) of this chapter and may be served only by 
those immigration officers listed in Sec. 287.5(e)(3) of this chapter.
    (2) If, after the issuance of a warrant of arrest, a determination 
is made not to serve it, any officer authorized to issue such warrant 
may authorize its cancellation.
    (c) Custody issues and release procedures--(1) In general. (i) After 
the expiration of the Transition Period Custody Rules (TPCR) set forth 
in section 303(b)(3) of Div. C of Pub. L. 104-208, no alien described in 
section 236(c)(1) of the Act may be released from custody during removal 
proceedings except pursuant to section 236(c)(2) of the Act.
    (ii) Paragraph (c)(2) through (c)(8) of this section shall govern 
custody determinations for aliens subject to the TPCR while they remain 
in effect. For purposes of this section, an alien ``subject to the 
TPCR'' is an alien described in section 303(b)(3)(A) of Div. C of Pub. 
L. 104-208 who is in deportation proceedings, subject to a final order 
of deportation, or in removal proceedings. The TPCR do not apply to 
aliens in exclusion proceedings under former section 236 of the Act, 
aliens in expedited removal proceedings under section 235(b)(1) of the 
Act, or aliens subject to a final order of removal.
    (2) Aliens not lawfully admitted. Subject to paragraph (c)(6)(i) of 
this section, but notwithstanding any other provision within this 
section, an alien subject to the TPCR who is not lawfully admitted is 
not eligible to be considered for release from custody.
    (i) An alien who remains in status as an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence, conditionally admitted for permanent residence, or 
lawfully admitted for temporary residence is ``lawfully admitted'' for 
purposes of this section.
    (ii) An alien in removal proceedings, in deportation proceedings, or 
subject to a final order of deportation, and not described in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, is not ``lawfully admitted'' for purposes of 
this section unless the alien last entered the United States lawfully 
and is not presently an applicant for admission to the United States.
    (3) Criminal aliens eligible to be considered for release. Except as 
provided in this section, or otherwise provided by law, an alien subject 
to the TPCR may be considered for release from custody

[[Page 398]]

if lawfully admitted. Such an alien must first demonstrate, by clear and 
convincing evidence, that release would not pose a danger to the safety 
of other persons or of property. If an alien meets this burden, the 
alien must further demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that 
the alien is likely to appear for any scheduled proceeding (including 
any appearance required by the Service or EOIR) in order to be 
considered for release in the exercise of discretion.
    (4) Criminal aliens ineligible to be considered for release except 
in certain special circumstances. An alien, other than an alien lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence, subject to section 303(b)(3)(A) (ii) 
or (iii) of Div. C. of Pub. L. 104-208 is ineligible to be considered 
for release if the alien:
    (i) Is described in section 241(a)(2)(C) of the Act (as in effect 
prior to April 1, 1997), or has been convicted of a crime described in 
section 101(a)(43)(B), (E)(ii) or (F) of the Act (as in effect on April 
1, 1997);
    (ii) Has been convicted of a crime described in section 
101(a)(43)(G) of the Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997) or a crime or 
crimes involving moral turpitude related to property, and sentenced 
therefor (including in the aggregate) to at least 3 years' imprisonment;
    (iii) Has failed to appear for an immigration proceeding without 
reasonable cause or has been subject to a bench warrant or similar legal 
process (unless quashed, withdrawn, or cancelled as improvidently 
issued);
    (iv) Has been convicted of a crime described in section 
101(a)(43)(Q) or (T) of the Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997);
    (v) Has been convicted in a criminal proceeding of a violation of 
section 273, 274, 274C, 276, or 277 of the Act, or has admitted the 
factual elements of such a violation;
    (vi) Has overstayed a period granted for voluntary departure;
    (vii) Has failed to surrender or report for removal pursuant to an 
order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;
    (viii) Does not wish to pursue, or is statutorily ineligible for, 
any form of relief from exclusion, deportation, or removal under this 
chapter or the Act; or
    (ix) Is described in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this 
section but has not been sentenced, including in the aggregate but not 
including any portions suspended, to at least 2 years' imprisonment, 
unless the alien was lawfully admitted and has not, since the 
commencement of proceedings and within the 10 years prior thereto, been 
convicted of a crime, failed to comply with an order to surrender or a 
period of voluntary departure, or been subject to a bench warrant or 
similar legal process (unless quashed, withdrawn, or cancelled as 
improvidently issued). An alien eligible to be considered for release 
under this paragraph must meet the burdens described in paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section in order to be released from custody in the exercise of 
discretion.
    (5) Criminal aliens ineligible to be considered for release. (i) A 
criminal alien subject to section 303(b)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii) of Div. C of 
Pub. L. 104-208 is ineligible to be considered for release if the alien 
has been sentenced, including in the aggregate but not including any 
portions suspended, to at least 2 years' imprisonment, and the alien
    (A) Is described in section 237(a)(2)(D)(i) or (ii) of the Act (as 
in effect on April 1, 1997), or has been convicted of a crime described 
in section 101(a)(43)(A), (C), (E)(i), (H), (I), (K)(iii), or (L) of the 
Act (as in effect on April 1, 1997);
    (B) Is described in section 237(a)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act; or
    (C) Has escaped or attempted to escape from the lawful custody of a 
local, State, or Federal prison, agency, or officer within the United 
States.
    (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, a 
permanent resident alien who has not, since the commencement of 
proceedings and within the 15 years prior thereto, been convicted of a 
crime, failed to comply with an order to surrender or a period of 
voluntary departure, or been subject to a bench warrant or similar legal 
process (unless quashed, withdrawn, or cancelled as improvidently 
issued), may be considered for release under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (6) Unremovable aliens and certain long-term detainees. (i) If the 
district director determines that an alien subject

[[Page 399]]

to section 303(b)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii) of Div. C of Pub. L. 104-208 cannot 
be removed from the United States because the designated country of 
removal or deportation will not accept the alien's return, the district 
director may, in the exercise of discretion, consider release of the 
alien from custody upon such terms and conditions as the district 
director may prescribe, without regard to paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(4), and 
(c)(5) of this section.
    (ii) The district director may also, notwithstanding paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section, consider release from custody, upon such terms 
and conditions as the district director may prescribe, of any alien 
described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section who has been in the 
Service's custody for six months pursuant to a final order of 
deportation terminating the alien's status as a lawful permanent 
resident.
    (iii) The district director may release an alien from custody under 
this paragraph only in accordance with the standards set forth in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section and any other applicable provisions of 
law.
    (iv) The district director's custody decision under this paragraph 
shall not be subject to redetermination by an immigration judge, but, in 
the case of a custody decision under paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this 
section, may be appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (7) Construction. A reference in this section to a provision in 
section 241 of the Act as in effect prior to April 1, 1997, shall be 
deemed to include a reference to the corresponding provision in section 
237 of the Act as in effect on April 1, 1997. A reference in this 
section to a ``crime'' shall be considered to include a reference to a 
conspiracy or attempt to commit such a crime. In calculating the 10-year 
period specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and the 15-year 
period specified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, no period during 
which the alien was detained or incarcerated shall count toward the 
total. References in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section to the 
``district director'' shall be deemed to include a reference to any 
official designated by the Commissioner to exercise custody authority 
over aliens covered by that paragraph. Nothing in this part shall be 
construed as prohibiting an alien from seeking reconsideration of the 
Service's determination that the alien is within a category barred from 
release under this part.
    (8) Any officer authorized to issue a warrant of arrest may, in the 
officer's discretion, release an alien not described in section 
236(c)(1) of the Act, under the conditions at section 236(a)(2) and (3) 
of the Act; provided that the alien must demonstrate to the satisfaction 
of the officer that such release would not pose a danger to property or 
persons, and that the alien is likely to appear for any future 
proceeding. Such an officer may also, in the exercise of discretion, 
release an alien in deportation proceedings pursuant to the authority in 
section 242 of the Act (as designated prior to April 1, 1997), except as 
otherwise provided by law.
    (9) When an alien who, having been arrested and taken into custody, 
has been released, such release may be revoked at any time in the 
discretion of the district director, acting district director, deputy 
district director, assistant district director for investigations, 
assistant district director for detention and deportation, or officer in 
charge (except foreign), in which event the alien may be taken into 
physical custody and detained. If detained, unless a breach has 
occurred, any outstanding bond shall be revoked and canceled.
    (10) The provisions of Sec. 103.6 of this chapter shall apply to any 
bonds authorized. Subject to the provisions of this section, the 
provisions of Sec. 3.19 of this chapter shall govern availability to the 
respondent of recourse to other administrative authority for release 
from custody.
    (11) An immigration judge may not exercise the authority provided in 
this section, and the review process described in paragraph (d) of this 
section shall not apply, with respect to any alien beyond the custody 
jurisdiction of the immigration judge as provided in Sec. 3.19(h) of 
this chapter.
    (d) Appeals from custody decisions--(1) Application to immigration 
judge. After an initial custody determination by the district director, 
including the setting of a bond, the respondent may, at

[[Page 400]]

any time before an order under 8 CFR part 240 becomes final, request 
amelioration of the conditions under which he or she may be released. 
Prior to such final order, and except as otherwise provided in this 
chapter, the immigration judge is authorized to exercise the authority 
in section 236 of the Act (or section 242(a)(1) of the Act as designated 
prior to April 1, 1997 in the case of an alien in deportation 
proceedings) to detain the alien in custody, release the alien, and 
determine the amount of bond, if any, under which the respondent may be 
released, as provided in Sec. 3.19 of this chapter. If the alien has 
been released from custody, an application for amelioration of the terms 
of release must be filed within 7 days of release. Once a removal order 
becomes administratively final, determinations regarding custody and 
bond are made by the district director.
    (2) Application to the district director. (i) After expiration of 
the 7-day period in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the respondent may 
request review by the district director of the conditions of his or her 
release.
    (ii) After an order becomes administratively final, the respondent 
may request review by the district director of the conditions of his or 
her release.
    (3) Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. An appeal relating 
to bond and custody determinations may be filed to the Board of 
Immigration Appeals in the following circumstances:
    (i) In accordance with Sec. 3.38 of this chapter, the alien or the 
Service may appeal the decision of an immigration judge pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) The alien, within 10 days, may appeal from the district 
director's decision under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
    (iii) The alien, within 10 days, may appeal from the district 
director's decision under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, except 
that no appeal shall be allowed when the Service notifies the alien that 
it is ready to execute an order of removal and takes the alien into 
custody for that purpose.
    (4) Effect of filing an appeal. The filing of an appeal from a 
determination of an immigration judge or district director under this 
paragraph shall not operate to delay compliance with the order (except 
as provided in Sec. 3.19(i)), nor stay the administrative proceedings or 
removal.
    (e) Privilege of communication. Every detained alien shall be 
notified that he or she may communicate with the consular or diplomatic 
officers of the country of his or her nationality in the United States. 
Existing treaties with the following countries require immediate 
communication with appropriate consular or diplomatic officers whenever 
nationals of the following countries are detained in removal 
proceedings, whether or not requested by the alien and even if the alien 
requests that no communication be undertaken in his or her behalf. When 
notifying consular or diplomatic officials, Service officers shall not 
reveal the fact that any detained alien has applied for asylum or 
withholding of removal.

    (f) Notification to Executive Office for Immigration Review of 
change in custody status. The Service shall notify the Immigration Court 
having administrative control over the Record of Proceeding of any 
change in custody location or of release from, or subsequent taking 
into, Service custody of a respondent/applicant pursuant to Sec. 3.19(g) 
of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 236.2  Confined aliens, incompetents, and minors.

    (a) Service. If the respondent is confined, or if he or she is an 
incompetent, or a minor under the age of 14, the notice to appear, and 
the warrant of arrest, if issued, shall be served in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 239.1 of this chapter upon the person or persons 
specified by Sec. 103.5a(c) of this chapter.
    (b) Service custody and cost of maintenance. An alien confined 
because of physical or mental disability in an institution or hospital 
shall not be accepted into physical custody by the Service until an 
order of removal has been entered and the Service is ready to remove the 
alien. When such an alien is an inmate of a public or private 
institution at the time of the commencement of the removal proceedings, 
expenses for the maintenance of the alien shall not be incurred by the 
Government until he or she is taken into physical custody by the 
Service.


<R05>
Sec. 236.3  Detention and release of juveniles.

    (a) Juveniles. A juvenile is defined as an alien under the age of 18 
years.
    (b) Release. Juveniles for whom bond has been posted, for whom 
parole has been authorized, or who have been ordered released on 
recognizance, shall be released pursuant to the following guidelines:
    (1) Juveniles shall be released, in order of preference, to:
    (i) A parent;
    (ii) Legal guardian; or
    (iii) An adult relative (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, grandparent) 
who is not presently in Service detention, unless a determination is 
made that the detention of such juvenile is required to secure his or 
her timely appearance before the Service or the Immigration Court or to 
ensure the juvenile's safety or that of others. In cases where the 
parent, legal guardian, or adult relative resides at a location distant 
from where the juvenile is detained, he or she may secure release at a 
Service office located near the parent, legal guardian, or adult 
relative.
    (2) If an individual specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) 
of this section cannot be located to accept custody of a juvenile, and 
the juvenile has identified a parent, legal guardian, or adult relative 
in Service detention, simultaneous release of the juvenile and the 
parent, legal guardian, or adult relative shall be evaluated on a 
discretionary case-by-case basis.

[[Page 402]]

    (3) In cases where the parent or legal guardian is in Service 
detention or outside the United States, the juvenile may be released to 
such person as is designated by the parent or legal guardian in a sworn 
affidavit, executed before an immigration officer or consular officer, 
as capable and willing to care for the juvenile's well-being. Such 
person must execute an agreement to care for the juvenile and to ensure 
the juvenile's presence at all future proceedings before the Service or 
an immigration judge.
    (4) In unusual and compelling circumstances and in the discretion of 
the district director or chief patrol agent, a juvenile may be released 
to an adult, other than those identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through 
(iii) of this section, who executes an agreement to care for the 
juvenile's well-being and to ensure the juvenile's presence at all 
future proceedings before the Service or an immigration judge.
    (c) Juvenile coordinator. The case of a juvenile for whom detention 
is determined to be necessary should be referred to the ``Juvenile 
Coordinator,'' whose responsibilities should include, but not be limited 
to, finding suitable placement of the juvenile in a facility designated 
for the occupancy of juveniles. These may include juvenile facilities 
contracted by the Service, state or local juvenile facilities, or other 
appropriate agencies authorized to accommodate juveniles by the laws of 
the state or locality.
    (d) Detention. In the case of a juvenile for whom detention is 
determined to be necessary, for such interim period of time as is 
required to locate suitable placement for the juvenile, whether such 
placement is under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the juvenile 
may be temporarily held by Service authorities or placed in any Service 
detention facility having separate accommodations for juveniles.
    (e) Refusal of release. If a parent of a juvenile detained by the 
Service can be located, and is otherwise suitable to receive custody of 
the juvenile, and the juvenile indicates a refusal to be released to his 
or her parent, the parent(s) shall be notified of the juvenile's refusal 
to be released to the parent(s), and shall be afforded an opportunity to 
present their views to the district director, chief patrol agent, or 
immigration judge before a custody determination is made.
    (f) Notice to parent of application for relief. If a juvenile seeks 
release from detention, voluntary departure, parole, or any form of 
relief from removal, where it appears that the grant of such relief may 
effectively terminate some interest inherent in the parent-child 
relationship and/or the juvenile's rights and interests are adverse with 
those of the parent, and the parent is presently residing in the United 
States, the parent shall be given notice of the juvenile's application 
for relief, and shall be afforded an opportunity to present his or her 
views and assert his or her interest to the district director or 
immigration judge before a determination is made as to the merits of the 
request for relief.
    (g) Voluntary departure. Each juvenile, apprehended in the immediate 
vicinity of the border, who resides permanently in Mexico or Canada, 
shall be informed, prior to presentation of the voluntary departure form 
or being allowed to withdraw his or her application for admission, that 
he or she may make a telephone call to a parent, close relative, a 
friend, or to an organization found on the free legal services list. A 
juvenile who does not reside in Mexico or Canada who is apprehended 
shall be provided access to a telephone and must in fact communicate 
either with a parent, adult relative, friend, or with an organization 
found on the free legal services list prior to presentation of the 
voluntary departure form. If such juvenile, of his or her own volition, 
asks to contact a consular officer, and does in fact make such contact, 
the requirements of this section are satisfied.
    (h) Notice and request for disposition. When a juvenile alien is 
apprehended, he or she must be given a Form I-770, Notice of Rights and 
Disposition. If the juvenile is less than 14 years of age or unable to 
understand the notice, the notice shall be read and explained to the 
juvenile in a language he or she understands. In the event a juvenile 
who has requested a hearing pursuant to the notice subsequently decides 
to accept voluntary departure or is allowed

[[Page 403]]

to withdraw his or her application for admission, a new Form I-770 shall 
be given to, and signed by the juvenile.

Sec. 236.4  Removal of S-5, S-6, and S-7 nonimmigrants.

    (a) Condition of classification. As a condition of classification 
and continued stay in classification pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) 
of the Act, nonimmigrants in S classification must have executed Form I-
854, Part B, Inter-agency Alien Witness and Informant Record, certifying 
that they have knowingly waived their right to a removal hearing and 
right to contest, other than on the basis of an application for 
withholding of deportation or removal, any removal action, including 
detention pending deportation or removal, instituted before lawful 
permanent resident status is obtained.
    (b) Determination of deportability. (1) A determination to remove a 
deportable alien classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act 
shall be made by the district director having jurisdiction over the 
place where the alien is located.
    (2) A determination to remove such a deportable alien shall be based 
on one or more of the grounds of deportability listed in section 237 of 
the Act based on conduct committed after, or conduct or a condition not 
disclosed to the Service prior to, the alien's classification as an S 
nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, or for a violation 
of, or failure to adhere to, the particular terms and conditions of 
status in S nonimmigrant classification.
    (c) Removal procedures. (1) A district director who determines to 
remove an alien witness or informant in S nonimmigrant classification 
shall notify the Commissioner, the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, and the relevant law enforcement agency in writing to that 
effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall concur 
in or object to that decision. Unless the Assistant Attorney General, 
Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he or she shall be deemed to 
have concurred in the decision. In the event of an objection by the 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the matter will be 
expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General for a final 
resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the relevant law 
enforcement agency have a right of appeal from any decision to remove.
    (2) A district director who has provided notice as set forth in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section and who has been advised by the 
Commissioner that the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, has 
not objected shall issue a Warrant of Removal. The alien shall 
immediately be arrested and taken into custody by the district director 
initiating the removal. An alien classified under the provisions of 
section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act who is determined, pursuant to a 
warrant issued by a district director, to be deportable from the United 
States shall be removed from the United States to his or her country of 
nationality or last residence. The agency that requested the alien's 
presence in the United States shall ensure departure from the United 
States and so inform the district director in whose jurisdiction the 
alien has last resided. The district director, if necessary, shall 
oversee the alien's departure from the United States and, in any event, 
shall notify the Commissioner of the alien's departure.
    (d) Withholding of removal. An alien classified pursuant to section 
101(a)(15)(S) of the Act who applies for withholding of removal shall 
have 10 days from the date the Warrant of Removal is served upon the 
alien to file an application for such relief with the district director 
initiating the removal order. The procedures contained in Secs. 208.2 
and 208.16 of this chapter shall apply to such an alien who applies for 
withholding of removal.
    (e) Inadmissibility. An alien who applies for admission under the 
provisions of section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act who is determined by an 
immigration officer not to be eligible for admission under that section 
or to be inadmissible to the United States under one or more of the 
grounds of inadmissibility listed in section 212 of the Act and which 
have not been previously waived by the Commissioner will be taken into 
custody. The district director having jurisdiction over the port-of-
entry shall follow the notification procedures

[[Page 404]]

specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A district director who 
has provided such notice and who has been advised by the Commissioner 
that the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, has not objected 
shall remove the alien without further hearing. An alien may not contest 
such removal, other than by applying for withholding of removal.


<R05>
Sec. 236.5  Fingerprints and photographs.

    Every alien 14 years of age or older against whom proceedings based 
on deportability under section 237 of the Act are commenced under this 
part by service of a notice to appear shall be fingerprinted and 
photographed. Such fingerprints and photographs shall be made available 
to Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies upon request to 
the district director or chief patrol agent having jurisdiction over the 
alien's record. Any such alien, regardless of his or her age, shall be 
photographed and/or fingerprinted if required by any immigration officer 
authorized to issue a notice to appear. Every alien 14 years of age or 
older who is found to be inadmissible to the United States and ordered 
removed by an immigration judge shall be fingerprinted, unless during 
the preceding year he or she has been fingerprinted at an American 
consular office.

<R05>
Sec. 236.13  Ineligible aliens.

    The following categories of aliens are ineligible for benefits under 
the Family Unity Program:
    (a) An alien who is deportable under any paragraph in section 237(a) 
of the Act, except paragraphs (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), and (3)(A); 
provided that an alien who is deportable under section 237(a)(1)(A) of 
such Act is also ineligible for benefits under the Family Unity Program 
if deportability is based upon a ground of inadmissibility described in 
section 212(a)(2) or (3) of the Act;
    (b) An alien who has been convicted of a felony or three or more 
misdemeanors in the United States; or
    (c) An alien described in section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 236.14  Filing.

    (a) General. An application for voluntary departure under the Family 
Unity Program must be filed at the service center having jurisdiction 
over the alien's place of residence. A Form I-817, Application for 
Voluntary Departure under the Family Unity Program, must be filed with 
the correct fee required in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter and the 
required supporting documentation. A separate application with 
appropriate fee and documentation must be filed for each person claiming 
eligibility.
    (b) Decision. The service center director has sole jurisdiction to 
adjudicate an application for benefits under the Family Unity Program. 
The director will provide the applicant with specific reasons for any 
decision to deny an application. Denial of an application may not be 
appealed. An applicant who believes that the grounds for denial have 
been overcome may submit another application with the appropriate fee 
and documentation.
    (c) Referral of denied cases for consideration of issuance of notice 
to appear. If an application is denied, the case will be referred to the 
district director with jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence 
for consideration of whether to issue a notice to appear. After an 
initial denial, an applicant's case will not be referred for issuance of 
a notice to appear until 90 days from the date of the initial denial, to 
allow the alien the opportunity to file a new Form I-817 application in 
order to attempt to overcome the basis of the denial. However, if the 
applicant is found not to be eligible for benefits under Sec. 236.13(b), 
the Service reserves the right to issue a notice to appear at any time 
after the initial denial.


<R05>
Sec. 236.15  Voluntary departure and eligibility for employment.

    (a) Authority. Voluntary departure under this section implements the 
provisions of section 301 of IMMACT 90, and authority to grant voluntary 
departure under the family unity program derives solely from that 
section. Voluntary departure under the family unity program shall be 
governed solely by this section, notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 240B of the Act and 8 CFR part 240.
    (b) Children of legalized aliens. Children of legalized aliens 
residing in the United States, who were born during an authorized 
absence from the United States of mothers who are currently residing in 
the United States under voluntary departure pursuant to the Family Unity 
Program, may be granted voluntary departure under section 301 of IMMACT 
90 for a period of 2 years.
    (c) Duration of voluntary departure. An alien whose application for 
benefits under the Family Unity Program is approved will receive 
voluntary departure for 2 years, commencing with the date of approval of 
the application. Voluntary departure under this section shall be 
considered effective from the date on which the application was properly 
filed.
    (d) Employment authorization. An alien granted benefits under the 
Family Unity Program is authorized to be employed in the United States 
and may apply for an employment authorization document on Form I-765, 
Application for Employment Authorization. The application may be filed 
concurrently with Form I-817. The application must be accompanied by the 
correct fee required by Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter. The validity 
period of the employment authorization will coincide with the period of 
voluntary departure.

[[Page 406]]

    (e) Extension of voluntary departure. An application for an 
extension of voluntary departure under the Family Unity Program must be 
filed by the alien on Form I-817 along with the correct fee required in 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter and the required supporting 
documentation. The submission of a copy of the previous approval notice 
will assist in shortening the processing time. An extension may be 
granted if the alien continues to be eligible for benefits under the 
Family Unity Program. However, an extension may not be approved if the 
legalized alien is a lawful permanent resident, and a petition for 
family-sponsored immigrant status has not been filed in behalf of the 
applicant. In such case the Service will notify the alien of the reason 
for the denial and afford him or her the opportunity to file another 
Form I-817 once the petition, Form I-130, has been filed in behalf of 
him or her. No charging document will be issued for a period of 90 days.
    (f) Supporting documentation for extension application. Supporting 
documentation need not include documentation provided with the previous 
application(s). The extension application need only include changes to 
previous applications and evidence of continuing eligibility since the 
date of the prior approval.


<R05>
Sec. 236.16  Travel outside the United States.

    An alien granted Family Unity Program benefits who intends to travel 
outside the United States temporarily must apply for advance 
authorization using Form I-131, Application for Travel Document. The 
authority to grant an application for advance authorization for an alien 
granted Family Unity Program benefits rests solely with the district 
director. An alien who is granted advance authorization and returns to 
the United States in accordance with such authorization, and who is 
found not to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(2) or (3) of the Act, 
shall be inspected and admitted in the same immigration status as the 
alien had at the time of departure, and shall be provided the remainder 
of the voluntary departure period previously granted under the Family 
Unity Program.


<R05>
Sec. 236.17  Eligibility for Federal financial assistance programs.

    An alien granted Family Unity Program benefits based on a 
relationship to a legalized alien as defined in Sec. 236.11 is 
ineligible for public welfare assistance in the same manner and for the 
same period as the legalized alien who is ineligible for such assistance 
under section 245A(h) or 210(f) of the Act, respectively.


<R05>
Sec. 236. 18  Termination of Family Unity Program benefits.

    (a) Grounds for termination. The Service may terminate benefits 
under the Family Unity Program whenever the necessity for the 
termination comes to the attention of the Service. Such grounds will 
exist in situations including, but not limited to, those in which:
    (1) A determination is made that Family Unity Program benefits were 
acquired as the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation of a 
material fact;
    (2) The beneficiary commits an act or acts which render him or her 
inadmissible as an immigrant or who are ineligible for benefits under 
the Family Unity Program;
    (3) The legalized alien upon whose status benefits under the Family 
Unity Program were based loses his or her legalized status;
    (4) The beneficiary is the subject of a final order of exclusion, 
deportation, or removal issued subsequent to the grant of Family Unity 
benefits unless such final order is based on entry without inspection; 
violation of status; or failure to comply with section 265 of the Act; 
or inadmissibility at the time of entry other than inadmissibility 
pursuant to section 212(a)(2) or 212(a)(3) of the Act, regardless of 
whether the facts giving rise to such ground occurred before or after 
the benefits were granted; or
    (5) A qualifying relationship to a legalized alien no longer exists.
    (b) Notice procedure. Notice of intent to terminate and of the 
grounds thereof shall be served pursuant to the provisions of 
Sec. 103.5a of this chapter. The alien shall be given 30 days to respond 
to the notice and may submit to the Service additional evidence in 
rebuttal. Any final decision of termination shall

[[Page 407]]

also be served pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 103.5a of this 
chapter. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Service from 
commencing exclusion or deportation proceedings prior to termination of 
Family Unity Program benefits.
    (c) Effect of termination. Termination of benefits under the Family 
Unity Program, other than as a result of a final order of removal, shall 
render the alien amenable to removal proceedings under section 240 of 
the Act. If benefits are terminated, the period of voluntary departure 
under this section is also terminated.

    Source: 62 FR 10365, Mar. 6, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 238.1  Proceedings under section 238(b) of the Act.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this part:
    Deciding Service officer means a district director, chief patrol 
agent, or another immigration officer designated by a district director 
or chief patrol agent, who is not the same person as the issuing Service 
officer.
    Issuing Service officer means any Service officer listed in 
Sec. 239.1 of this chapter as authorized to issue notices to appear.
    (b) Preliminary consideration and Notice of Intent to Issue a Final 
Administrative Deportation Order; commencement of proceedings--(1) Basis 
of Service charge. An issuing Service officer shall cause to be served 
upon an alien a Form I-851, Notice of Intent to Issue a Final 
Administrative Deportation Order (Notice of Intent), if the officer is 
satisfied that there is sufficient evidence, based upon questioning of 
the alien by an immigration officer and upon any other evidence 
obtained, to support a finding that the individual:
    (i) Is an alien;
    (ii) Has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or has 
conditional permanent resident status under section 216 of the Act;
    (iii) Has been convicted (as defined in section 101(a)(48) of the 
Act and as demonstrated by any of the documents or records listed in 
Sec. 3.41 of this chapter) of an aggravated felony and such conviction 
has become final; and
    (iv) Is deportable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 
including an alien who has neither been admitted nor paroled, but who is 
conclusively presumed deportable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) by 
operation of section 238(c) of the Act (``Presumption of 
Deportability'').
    (2) Notice. (i) Removal proceedings under section 238(b) of the Act 
shall commence upon personal service of the Notice of Intent upon the 
alien, as prescribed by Secs. 103.5a(a)(2) and 103.5a(c)(2) of this 
chapter. The Notice of Intent shall set forth the preliminary 
determinations and inform the alien of the Service's intention to issue 
a Form I-851A, Final Administrative Removal Order, without a hearing 
before an immigration judge. This Notice shall constitute the charging 
document. The Notice of Intent shall include allegations of fact and 
conclusions of law. It shall advise that the alien: has the privilege of 
being represented, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the 
alien's choosing, as long as counsel is authorized to practice in 
deportation proceedings; may inspect the evidence supporting the Notice 
of Intent; and may rebut the charges within 10 calendar days after 
service of such Notice (or 13 calendar days if service of the Notice was 
by mail).
    (ii) The Notice of Intent also shall advise the alien that he or she 
may designate in writing, within the rebuttal period, the country to 
which he or she chooses to be deported in accordance with section 241 of 
the Act, in the event that a Final Administrative Removal Order is 
issued, and that the Service will honor such designation only to the 
extent permitted under the terms, limitations, and conditions of section 
241 of the Act.
    (iii) The Service must determine that the person served with the 
Notice of Intent is the person named on the notice.
    (iv) The Service shall provide the alien with a list of available 
free legal services programs qualified under 8

[[Page 408]]

CFR part 3 and organizations recognized pursuant to 8 CFR part 292, 
located within the district or sector where the Notice of Intent is 
issued.
    (v) The Service must either provide the alien with a written 
translation of the Notice of Intent or explain the contents of the 
Notice of Intent to the alien in the alien's native language or in a 
language that the alien understands.
    (c) Alien's response--(1) Time for response. The alien will have 10 
calendar days from service of the Notice of Intent, or 13 calendar days 
if service is by mail, to file a response to the Notice of Intent. In 
the response, the alien may: designate his or her choice of country for 
removal; submit a written response rebutting the allegations supporting 
the charge and/or requesting the opportunity to review the Government's 
evidence; and/or request in writing an extension of time for response, 
stating the specific reasons why such an extension is necessary. 
Alternatively, the alien may, in writing, choose to accept immediate 
issuance of a Final Administrative Removal Order. The deciding Service 
officer may extend the time for response for good cause shown. A request 
for extension of time for response will not automatically extend the 
period for the response. The alien will be permitted to file a response 
outside the prescribed period only if the deciding Service officer 
permits it. The alien must send the response to the deciding Service 
officer at the address provided in the Notice of Intent.
    (2) Nature of rebuttal or request to review evidence. (i) If an 
alien chooses to rebut the allegations contained in the Notice of 
Intent, the alien's written response must indicate which finding(s) are 
being challenged and should be accompanied by affidavit(s), documentary 
information, or other specific evidence supporting the challenge.
    (ii) If an alien's written response requests the opportunity to 
review the Government's evidence, the Service shall serve the alien with 
a copy of the evidence in the record of proceeding upon which the 
Service is relying to support the charge. The alien may, within 10 
calendar days following service of the Government's evidence (13 
calendar days if service is by mail), furnish a final response in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the alien's final 
response is a rebuttal of the allegations, such a final response should 
be accompanied by affidavit(s), documentary information, or other 
specific evidence supporting the challenge.
    (d) Determination by deciding Service officer--(1) No response 
submitted or concession of deportability. If the deciding Service 
officer does not receive a timely response and the evidence in the 
record of proceeding establishes deportability by clear, convincing, and 
unequivocal evidence, or if the alien concedes deportability, then the 
deciding Service officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the 
alien a Final Administrative Removal Order that states the reasons for 
the deportation decision. The alien may, in writing, waive the 14-day 
waiting period before execution of the final order of removal provided 
in a paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Response submitted--(i) Insufficient rebuttal; no genuine issue 
of material fact. If the alien timely submits a rebuttal to the 
allegations, but the deciding Service officer finds that deportability 
is established by clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence in the 
record of proceeding, the deciding Service officer shall issue and cause 
to be served upon the alien a Final Administrative Removal Order that 
states the reasons for the decision of deportability.
    (ii) Additional evidence required. (A) If the deciding Service 
officer finds that the record of proceeding, including the alien's 
timely rebuttal, raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding the 
preliminary findings, the deciding Service officer may either obtain 
additional evidence from any source, including the alien, or cause to be 
issued a notice to appear to initiate removal proceedings under section 
240 of the Act. The deciding Service officer may also obtain additional 
evidence from any source, including the alien, if the deciding Service 
officer deems that such additional evidence may aid the officer in the 
rendering of a decision.
    (B) If the deciding Service officer considers additional evidence 
from a

[[Page 409]]

source other than the alien, that evidence shall be made a part of the 
record of proceeding, and shall be provided to the alien. If the alien 
elects to submit a response to such additional evidence, such response 
must be filed with the Service within 10 calendar days of service of the 
additional evidence (or 13 calendar days if service is by mail). If the 
deciding Service officer finds, after considering all additional 
evidence, that deportability is established by clear, convincing, and 
unequivocal evidence in the record of proceeding, the deciding Service 
officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the alien a Final 
Administrative Removal Order that states the reasons for the decision of 
deportability.
    (iii) Conversion to proceedings under section 240 of the Act. If the 
deciding Service officer finds that the alien is not amenable to removal 
under section 238 of the Act, the deciding Service officer shall 
terminate the expedited proceedings under section 238 of the Act and 
shall, where appropriate, cause to be issued a notice to appear for the 
purpose of initiating removal proceedings before an immigration judge 
under section 240 of the Act.
    (3) Termination of proceedings by deciding Service officer. Only the 
deciding Service officer may terminate proceedings under section 238 of 
the Act, in accordance with this section.
    (e) Proceedings commenced under section 240 of the Act. In any 
proceeding commenced under section 240 of the Act which is based on 
deportability under section 237 of the Act, if it appears that the 
respondent alien is subject to removal pursuant to section 238 of the 
Act, the immigration judge may, upon the Service's request, terminate 
the case and, upon such termination, the Service may commence 
administrative proceedings under section 238 of the Act. However, in the 
absence of any such request, the immigration judge shall complete the 
proceeding commenced under section 240 of the Act.
    (f) Executing final removal order of deciding Service officer--(1) 
Time of execution. Upon the issuance of a Final Administrative Removal 
Order, the Service shall issue a Warrant of Removal in accordance with 
Sec. 241.2 of this chapter; such warrant shall be executed no sooner 
than 14 calendar days after the date the Final Administrative Removal 
Order is issued, unless the alien knowingly, voluntarily, and in writing 
waives the 14-day period.
    (2) Country to which alien is to be removed. The deciding Service 
officer shall designate the country of removal in the manner prescribed 
by section 241 of the Act.
    (g) Arrest and detention. At the time of issuance of a Notice of 
Intent or at any time thereafter and up to the time the alien becomes 
the subject of a Warrant of Removal, the alien may be arrested and taken 
into custody under the authority of a Warrant of Arrest issued by an 
officer listed in Sec. 287.5(e)(2) of this chapter. The decision of the 
Service concerning custody or bond shall not be administratively 
appealable during proceedings initiated under section 238 of the Act and 
this part.
    (h) Record of proceeding. The Service shall maintain a record of 
proceeding for judicial review of the Final Administrative Removal Order 
sought by any petition for review. The record of proceeding shall 
include, but not necessarily be limited to: the charging document 
(Notice of Intent); the Final Administrative Removal Order (including 
any supplemental memorandum of decision); the alien's response, if any; 
all evidence in support of the charge; and any admissible evidence, 
briefs, or documents submitted by either party respecting deportability. 
The executed duplicate of the Notice of Intent in the record of 
proceedings shall be retained as evidence that the individual upon whom 
the notice for the proceeding was served was, in fact, the alien named 
in the notice.

shall be in accordance with section 239 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 239.2  Cancellation of notice to appear.

    (a) Any officer authorized by Sec. 239.1(a) to issue a notice to 
appear may cancel such notice prior to jurisdiction vesting with the 
immigration judge pursuant to Sec. 3.14 of this chapter provided the 
officer is satisfied that:
    (1) The respondent is a national of the United States;
    (2) The respondent is not deportable or inadmissible under 
immigration laws;
    (3) The respondent is deceased;
    (4) The respondent is not in the United States;
    (5) The notice was issued for the respondent's failure to file a 
timely petition as required by section 216(c) of the Act, but his or her 
failure to file a timely petition was excused in accordance with section 
216(d)(2)(B) of the Act;
    (6) The notice to appear was improvidently issued, or
    (7) Circumstances of the case have changed after the notice to 
appear was issued to such an extent that continuation is no longer in 
the best interest of the government.
    (b) A notice to appear issued pursuant to section 235(b)(3) of the 
Act may be canceled under provisions in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(6) of 
this section only by the issuing officer, unless it is impracticable for 
the issuing officer to cancel the notice.
    (c) Motion to dismiss. After commencement of proceedings pursuant to 
Sec. 3.14 of this chapter, Service counsel, or any officer enumerated in 
paragraph (a) of this section may move for dismissal of the matter on 
the grounds set out under paragraph (a) of this section. Dismissal of 
the matter shall be without prejudice to the alien or the Service.
    (d) Motion for remand. After commencement of the hearing, Service 
counsel, or any officer enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section may 
move for remand of the matter to district jurisdiction on the ground 
that the foreign relations of the United States are involved and require 
further consideration. Remand of the matter shall be without prejudice 
to the alien or the Service.
    (e) Warrant of arrest. When a notice to appear is canceled or 
proceedings are terminated under this section any outstanding warrant of 
arrest is canceled.
    (f) Termination of removal proceedings by immigration judge. An 
immigration

[[Page 411]]

judge may terminate removal proceedings to permit the alien to proceed 
to a final hearing on a pending application or petition for 
naturalization when the alien has established prima facie eligibility 
for naturalization and the matter involves exceptionally appealing or 
humanitarian factors; in every other case, the removal hearing shall be 
completed as promptly as possible notwithstanding the pendency of an 
application for naturalization during any state of the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 239.3  Effect of filing notice to appear.

    The filing of a notice to appear shall have no effect in determining 
periods of unlawful presence as defined in section 212(a)(9)(B) of the 
Act.

<R04>
                     Subpart A--Removal Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 240.1  Immigration judges.

    (a) Authority. In any removal proceeding pursuant to section 240 of 
the Act and section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the immigration judge shall 
have the authority to: determine removability pursuant to section 
240(a)(1) of the Act; to make decisions, including orders of removal as 
provided by section 240(c)(1)(A) of the Act; to determine applications 
under sections 208, 212(a)(2)(F), 212(a)(6)(F)(ii), 212(a)(9)(B)(v), 
212(d)(11), 212(d)(12), 212(g), 212(h), 212(i), 212(k), 
237(a)(1)(E)(iii), 237(a)(1)(H), 237(a)(3)(C)(ii), 240A(a) and (b), 
240B, 245, and 249 of the Act; to order withholding of removal pursuant 
to section 241(b)(3) of the Act; and to take any other action consistent 
with applicable law and regulations as may be appropriate. In 
determining cases referred for further inquiry, immigration judges shall 
have the powers and authority conferred upon them by the Act and this 
chapter. Subject to any specific limitation prescribed by the Act and 
this chapter, immigration judges shall also exercise the discretion and 
authority conferred upon the Attorney General by the Act as is 
appropriate and necessary for the disposition of such cases. An 
immigration judge may certify his or her decision in any case under 
section 240 of the Act to the Board of Immigration Appeals when it 
involves an unusually complex or novel question of law or fact. Nothing 
contained in this part shall be construed to diminish the authority 
conferred on immigration judges under sections 101(b)(4) and 103 of the 
Act.
    (b) Withdrawal and substitution of immigration judges. The 
immigration judge assigned to conduct the hearing shall at any time 
withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If an 
immigration judge becomes unavailable to complete his or her duties, 
another immigration judge may be assigned to complete the case. The new 
immigration judge shall familiarize himself or herself with the record 
in the case and shall state for the record that he or she has done so.
    (c) Conduct of hearing. The immigration judge shall receive and 
consider material and relevant evidence, rule upon objections, and 
otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.
    (d) Withdrawal of application for admission. An immigration judge 
may allow only an arriving alien to withdraw an application for 
admission. Once the issue of inadmissibility has been resolved, 
permission to withdraw an application for admission should ordinarily be 
granted only with the concurrence of the Service. An immigration judge 
shall not allow an alien to withdraw an application for admission unless 
the alien, in addition to demonstrating that he or she possesses both 
the intent and the means to depart immediately from the United States, 
establishes that factors directly relating to the issue of 
inadmissibility indicate that the granting of the withdrawal would be in 
the interest of justice. During the pendency of an appeal from the order 
of removal, permission to withdraw an application for admission must be 
obtained from the immigration judge or the Board.

[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997; 62 FR 15363, Apr. 1, 1997, as amended at 63 
FR 27829, May 21, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 240.2  Service counsel.

    (a) Authority. Service counsel shall present on behalf of the 
government evidence material to the issues of deportability or 
inadmissibility and any other issues that may require disposition by the 
immigration judge. The duties of the Service counsel include, but are 
not limited to, the presentation of evidence and the interrogation, 
examination, and cross-examination of the respondent or other witnesses. 
Nothing contained in this subpart diminishes the authority of an 
immigration judge to conduct proceedings under this part. The Service 
counsel is authorized to appeal from a decision of the immigration judge 
pursuant to Sec. 3.38 of this chapter and to move for reopening or 
reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 3.23 of this chapter.
    (b) Assignment. In a removal proceeding, the Service shall assign an 
attorney to each case within the provisions of Sec. 240.10(d), and to 
each case in which

[[Page 413]]

an unrepresented respondent is incompetent or is under 18 years of age, 
and is not accompanied by a guardian, relative, or friend. In a case in 
which the removal proceeding would result in an order of removal, the 
Service shall assign an attorney to each case in which a respondent's 
nationality is in issue. A Service attorney shall be assigned in every 
case in which the Commissioner approves the submission of non-record 
information under Sec. 240.11(a)(3). In his or her discretion, whenever 
he or she deems such assignment necessary or advantageous, the General 
Counsel may assign a Service attorney to any other case at any stage of 
the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 240.3  Representation by counsel.

    The respondent may be represented at the hearing by an attorney or 
other representative qualified under 8 CFR part 292.


<R05>
Sec. 240.4  Incompetent respondents.

    When it is impracticable for the respondent to be present at the 
hearing because of mental incompetency, the attorney, legal 
representative, legal guardian, near relative, or friend who was served 
with a copy of the notice to appear shall be permitted to appear on 
behalf of the respondent. If such a person cannot reasonably be found or 
fails or refuses to appear, the custodian of the respondent shall be 
requested to appear on behalf of the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 240.5  Interpreter.

    Any person acting as an interpreter in a hearing before an 
immigration judge under this part shall be sworn to interpret and 
translate accurately, unless the interpreter is an employee of the 
United States Government, in which event no such oath shall be required.


<R05>
Sec. 240.6  Postponement and adjournment of hearing.

    After the commencement of the hearing, the immigration judge may 
grant a reasonable adjournment either at his or her own instance or, for 
good cause shown, upon application by the respondent or the Service.


<R05>
Sec. 240.7  Evidence in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act.

    (a) Use of prior statements. The immigration judge may receive in 
evidence any oral or written statement that is material and relevant to 
any issue in the case previously made by the respondent or any other 
person during any investigation, examination, hearing, or trial.
    (b) Testimony. Testimony of witnesses appearing at the hearing shall 
be under oath or affirmation administered by the immigration judge.
    (c) Depositions. The immigration judge may order the taking of 
depositions pursuant to Sec. 3.35 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 240.8  Burdens of proof in removal proceedings.

    (a) Deportable aliens. A respondent charged with deportability shall 
be found to be removable if the Service proves by clear and convincing 
evidence that the respondent is deportable as charged.
    (b) Arriving aliens. In proceedings commenced upon a respondent's 
arrival in the Untied States or after the revocation or expiration of 
parole, the respondent must prove that he or she is clearly and beyond a 
doubt entitled to be admitted to the United States and is not 
inadmissible as charged.
    (c) Aliens present in the United States without being admitted or 
paroled. In the case of a respondent charged as being in the United 
States without being admitted or paroled, the Service must first 
establish the alienage of the respondent. Once alienage has been 
established, unless the respondent demonstrates by clear and convincing 
evidence that he or she is lawfully in the United States pursuant to a 
prior admission, the respondent must prove that he or she is clearly and 
beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted to the United States and is not 
inadmissible as charged.
    (d) Relief from removal. The respondent shall have the burden of 
establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or 
privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. 
If the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory 
denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien shall have the

[[Page 414]]

burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds 
do not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 240.9  Contents of record.

    The hearing before the immigration judge, including the testimony, 
exhibits, applications, proffers, and requests, the immigration judge's 
decision, and all written orders, motions, appeals, briefs, and other 
papers filed in the proceedings shall constitute the record in the case. 
The hearing shall be recorded verbatim except for statements made off 
the record with the permission of the immigration judge. In his or her 
discretion, the immigration judge may exclude from the record any 
arguments made in connection with motions, applications, requests, or 
objections, but in such event the person affected may submit a brief.


<R05>
Sec. 240.10  Hearing.

    (a) Opening. In a removal proceeding, the immigration judge shall:
    (1) Advise the respondent of his or her right to representation, at 
no expense to the government, by counsel of his or her own choice 
authorized to practice in the proceedings and require the respondent to 
state then and there whether he or she desires representation;
    (2) Advise the respondent of the availability of free legal services 
provided by organizations and attorneys qualified under 8 CFR part 3 and 
organizations recognized pursuant to Sec. 292.2 of this chapter, located 
in the district where the removal hearing is being held;
    (3) Ascertain that the respondent has received a list of such 
programs, and a copy of appeal rights;
    (4) Advise the respondent that he or she will have a reasonable 
opportunity to examine and object to the evidence against him or her, to 
present evidence in his or her own behalf and to cross-examine witnesses 
presented by the government (but the respondent shall not be entitled to 
examine such national security information as the government may proffer 
in opposition to the respondent's admission to the United States or to 
an application by the respondent for discretionary relief);
    (5) Place the respondent under oath;
    (6) Read the factual allegations and the charges in the notice to 
appear to the respondent and explain them in non-technical language; and
    (7) Enter the notice to appear as an exhibit in the Record of 
Proceeding.
    (b) Public access to hearings. Removal hearings shall be open to the 
public, except that the immigration judge may, in his or her discretion, 
close proceedings as provided in Sec. 3.27 of this chapter.
    (c) Pleading by respondent. The immigration judge shall require the 
respondent to plead to the notice to appear by stating whether he or she 
admits or denies the factual allegations and his or her removability 
under the charges contained therein. If the respondent admits the 
factual allegations and admits his or her removability under the charges 
and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact 
remain, the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged 
has been established by the admissions of the respondent. The 
immigration judge shall not accept an admission of removability from an 
unrepresented respondent who is incompetent or under the age of 18 and 
is not accompanied by an attorney or legal representative, a near 
relative, legal guardian, or friend; nor from an officer of an 
institution in which a respondent is an inmate or patient. When, 
pursuant to this paragraph, the immigration judge does not accept an 
admission of removability, he or she shall direct a hearing on the 
issues.
    (d) Issues of removability. When removability is not determined 
under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the immigration 
judge shall request the assignment of an Service counsel, and shall 
receive evidence as to any unresolved issues, except that no further 
evidence need be received as to any facts admitted during the pleading. 
The alien shall provide a court certified copy of a Judicial 
Recommendation Against Deportation (JRAD) to the immigration judge when 
such recommendation will be the basis of denying any charge(s) brought 
by the Service in the proceedings against the alien. No JRAD is 
effective against a charge of deportability under former

[[Page 415]]

section 241(a)(11) of the Act or if the JRAD was granted on or after 
November 29, 1990.
    (e) Additional charges in removal hearings. At any time during the 
proceeding, additional or substituted charges of inadmissibility and/or 
deportability and/or factual allegations may be lodged by the Service in 
writing. The alien in removal proceedings shall be served with a copy of 
these additional charges and allegations. The immigration judge shall 
read the additional factual allegations and charges to the alien and 
explain them to him or her. The immigration judge shall advise the 
alien, if he or she is not represented by counsel, that the alien may be 
so represented, and that he or she may be given a reasonable continuance 
to respond to the additional factual allegations and charges. 
Thereafter, the provision of Sec. 240.6(b) relating to pleading shall 
apply to the additional factual allegations and charges.
    (f) Country of removal. The immigration judge shall notify the alien 
that if he or she is finally ordered removed, the country of removal 
will in the first instance be directed pursuant to section 241(b) of the 
Act to the country designated by the alien, unless section 241(b)(2)(C) 
of the Act applies, and shall afford him or her an opportunity then and 
there to make such designation. The immigration judge shall then specify 
and state for the record the country, or countries in the alternative, 
to which the alien's removal will be directed pursuant to section 241(b) 
of the Act if the country of his or her designation will not accept him 
or her into its territory, or fails to furnish timely notice of 
acceptance, or if the alien declines to designate a country.
    (g) In the event that the Service is unable to remove the alien to 
the specified or alternative country or countries, the Service may 
remove the alien to any other country as permitted by section 241(b) of 
the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 240.11  Ancillary matters, applications.

    (a) Creation of the status of an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence. (1) In a removal proceeding, an alien may apply to 
the immigration judge for cancellation of removal under section 240A of 
the Act, adjustment of status under section 1 of the Act of November 2, 
1966 (as modified by section 606 of Pub. L. 104-208), section 101 or 104 
of the Act of October 28, 1977, or section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, or 
for the creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence 
under section 249 of the Act. The application shall be subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 240.20, and 8 CFR parts 245 and 249. The approval 
of any application made to the immigration judge under section 245 of 
the Act by an alien spouse (as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) 
or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the 
Act) shall result in the alien's obtaining the status of lawful 
permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance with the 
provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. 
However, the Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence required by 
section 216(c) of the Act, or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove 
Conditions required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the 
director in accordance with 8 CFR part 216.
    (2) In conjunction with any application for creation of status of an 
alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration 
judge, if the alien is inadmissible under any provision of section 
212(a) of the Act, and believes that he or she meets the eligibility 
requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she 
may apply to the immigration judge for such waiver. The immigration 
judge shall inform the alien of his or her apparent eligibility to apply 
for any of the benefits enumerated in this chapter and shall afford the 
alien an opportunity to make application during the hearing.
    (3) In exercising discretionary power when considering an 
application for status as a permanent resident under this chapter, the 
immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not 
contained in the record and not made available for inspection by the 
alien, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is 
relevant and is classified under the applicable Executive Order as 
requiring protection from

[[Page 416]]

unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever 
the immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while 
safeguarding both the information and its source, the immigration judge 
should inform the alien of the general nature of the information in 
order that the alien may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. 
A decision based in whole or in part on such classified information 
shall state that the information is material to the decision.
    (b) Voluntary departure. The alien may apply to the immigration 
judge for voluntary departure in lieu of removal pursuant to section 
240B of the Act and subpart C of this part.
    (c) Applications for asylum and withholding of removal. (1) If the 
alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return to any of the 
countries to which the alien might be removed pursuant to 
Sec. 240.10(f), and the alien has not previously filed an application 
for asylum or withholding of removal that has been referred to the 
immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance with Sec. 208.14 of 
this chapter, the immigration judge shall:
    (i) Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the 
United States or withholding of removal to those countries;
    (ii) Make available the appropriate application forms; and
    (iii) Advise the alien of the privilege of being represented by 
counsel at no expense to the government and of the consequences, 
pursuant to section 208(d)(6) of the Act, of knowingly filing a 
frivolous application for asylum. The immigration judge shall provide to 
the alien a list of persons who have indicated their availability to 
represent aliens in asylum proceedings on a pro bono basis.
    (2) An application for asylum or withholding of removal must be 
filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to Sec. 208.4(c) of this 
chapter. Upon receipt of an application that has not been referred by an 
asylum officer, the Immigration Court shall forward a copy to the 
Department of State pursuant to Sec. 208.11 of this chapter and shall 
calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if any, from the Department 
of State, unless classified under the applicable Executive Order, shall 
be given to both the alien and to the Service counsel representing the 
government.
    (3) Applications for asylum and withholding of removal so filed will 
be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements and 
standards established in 8 CFR part 208 of this chapter after an 
evidentiary hearing to resolve factual issues in dispute. An evidentiary 
hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a mandatory 
denial of the application pursuant to Sec. 208.14 or Sec. 208.16 of this 
chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has determined that 
such a denial is required.
    (i) Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding 
of removal will be open to the public unless the alien expressly 
requests that the hearing be closed pursuant to Sec. 3.27 of this 
chapter. The immigration judge shall inquire whether the alien requests 
such closure.
    (ii) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of 
the immigration judge to properly control the scope of any evidentiary 
hearing.
    (iii) During the removal hearing, the alien shall be examined under 
oath on his or her application and may present evidence and witnesses in 
his or her own behalf. The alien has the burden of establishing that he 
or she is a refugee as defined in section 101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant 
to the standards set forth in Sec. 208.13 of this chapter.
    (iv) Service counsel may call witnesses and present evidence for the 
record, including information classified under the applicable Executive 
Order, provided the immigration judge or the Board has determined that 
such information is relevant to the hearing. When the immigration judge 
receives such classified information, he or she shall inform the alien. 
The agency that provides the classified information to the immigration 
judge may provide an unclassified summary of the information for release 
to the alien, whenever it determines it can do so consistently with 
safeguarding both the classified nature of the information and its 
sources. The summary should be as detailed as possible, in order that 
the alien may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision 
based in

[[Page 417]]

whole or in part on such classified information shall state whether such 
information is material to the decision.
    (4) The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or 
withholding of removal shall be communicated to the alien and to the 
Service counsel. An adverse decision shall state why asylum or 
withholding of removal was denied.
    (d) Application for relief under sections 237(a)(1)(H) and 
237(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act. The respondent may apply to the 
immigration judge for relief from removal under sections 237(a)(1)(H) 
and 237(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.
    (e) General. An application under this section shall be made only 
during the hearing and shall not be held to constitute a concession of 
alienage or deportability in any case in which the respondent does not 
admit his or her alienage or deportability. However, nothing in this 
section shall prohibit the Service from using information supplied in an 
application for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal 
submitted to the Service on or after January 4, 1995, as the basis for 
issuance of a charging document or to establish alienage or 
deportability in a case referred to an immigration judge under 
Sec. 208.14(b) of this chapter. The alien shall have the burden of 
establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or 
privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. 
Nothing contained in this section is intended to foreclose the 
respondent from applying for any benefit or privilege that he or she 
believes himself or herself eligible to receive in proceedings under 
this part. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the Attorney 
General's authority to remove an alien to any country permitted by 
section 241(b) of the Act.
    (f) Fees. The alien shall not be required to pay a fee on more than 
one application within paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, provided 
that the minimum fee imposed when more than one application is made 
shall be determined by the cost of the application with the highest fee. 
When a motion to reopen or reconsider is made concurrently with an 
application for relief seeking one of the immigration benefits set forth 
in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, only the fee set forth in 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter for the motion must accompany the 
motion and application for relief. If such a motion is granted, the 
appropriate fee for the application for relief, if any, set forth in 8 
CFR 103.7(b)(1), must be paid within the time specified in order to 
complete the application.

Sec. 240.12  Decision of the immigration judge.

    (a) Contents. The decision of the immigration judge may be oral or 
written. The decision of the immigration judge shall include a finding 
as to inadmissibility or deportability. The formal enumeration of 
findings is not required. The decision shall also contain reasons for 
granting or denying the request. The decision shall be concluded with 
the order of the immigration judge.
    (b) Summary decision. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section, in any case where inadmissibility or deportability 
is determined on the pleadings pursuant to Sec. 240.10(b) and the 
respondent does not make an application under Sec. 240.11, the alien is 
statutorily ineligible for relief, or the respondent applies for 
voluntary departure only and the immigration judge grants the 
application, the immigration judge may enter a summary decision or, if 
voluntary departure is granted, a summary decision with an alternate 
order of removal.
    (c) Order of the immigration judge. The order of the immigration 
judge shall direct the respondent's removal, or the termination of the 
proceedings, or such other disposition of the case as may be 
appropriate. When removal is ordered, the immigration judge shall 
specify the country, or countries in the alternate, to which 
respondent's removal shall be directed. The immigration judge is 
authorized to issue orders in the alternative or in combination as he or 
she may deem necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 240.13  Notice of decision.

    (a) Written decision. A written decision shall be served upon the 
respondent and the Service counsel, together

[[Page 418]]

with the notice referred to in Sec. 3.3 of this chapter. Service by mail 
is complete upon mailing.
    (b) Oral decision. An oral decision shall be stated by the 
immigration judge in the presence of the respondent and the Service 
counsel, if any, at the conclusion of the hearing. A copy of the summary 
written order shall be furnished at the request of the respondent or the 
Service counsel.
    (c) Summary decision. When the immigration judge renders a summary 
decision as provided in Sec. 240.12(b), he or she shall serve a copy 
thereof upon the respondent and the Service counsel at the conclusion of 
the hearing.
    (d) Decision to remove. If the immigration judge decides that the 
respondent is removable and orders the respondent to be removed, the 
immigration judge shall advise the respondent of such decision, and of 
the consequences for failure to depart under the order of removal, 
including civil and criminal penalties described at sections 274D and 
243 of the Act. Unless appeal from the decision is waived, the 
respondent shall be furnished with Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appeal, and 
advised of the provisions of Sec. 240.15.


<R05>
Sec. 240.14  Finality of order.

    The order of the immigration judge shall become final in accordance 
with Sec. 3.39 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 240.15  Appeals.

    Pursuant to 8 CFR part 3, an appeal shall lie from a decision of an 
immigration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, except that no 
appeal shall lie from an order of removal entered in absentia. The 
procedures regarding the filing of a Form EOIR 26, Notice of Appeal, 
fees, and briefs are set forth in Secs. 3.3, 3.31, and 3.38 of this 
chapter. An appeal shall be filed within 30 calendar days after the 
mailing of a written decision, the stating of an oral decision, or the 
service of a summary decision. The filing date is defined as the date of 
receipt of the Notice of Appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals. The 
reasons for the appeal shall be stated in the Notice of Appeal in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3.3(b) of this chapter. Failure 
to do so may constitute a ground for dismissal of the appeal by the 
Board pursuant to Sec. 3.1(d)(1-a) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 240.16  Application of new procedures or termination of proceedings in old proceedings pursuant to section 309(c) of Public Law 104-208.

    The Attorney General shall have the sole discretion to apply the 
provisions of section 309(c) of Public Law 104-208, which provides for 
the application of new removal procedures to certain cases in exclusion 
or deportation proceedings and for the termination of certain cases in 
exclusion or deportation proceedings and initiation of new removal 
proceedings. The Attorney General's application of the provisions of 
section 309(c) shall become effective upon publication of a notice in 
the Federal Register. However, if the Attorney General determines, in 
the exercise of his or her discretion, that the delay caused by 
publication would adversely affect the interests of the United States or 
the effective enforcement of the immigration laws, the Attorney 
General's application shall become effective immediately upon issuance, 
and shall be published in the Federal Register as soon as practicable 
thereafter.

<R05>
Sec. 240.20  Cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under section 240A of the Act.

    (a) Jurisdiction. An application for the exercise of discretion 
under section 240A of the Act shall be submitted on Form EOIR-42, 
Application for Cancellation of Removal, to the Immigration Court having 
administrative control over the Record of Proceeding of the underlying 
removal proceeding under section 240 of the Act. The application must be 
accompanied by payment of the filing fee as set forth in Sec. 103.7(b)

    (b) Filing the application. The application may be filed only with 
the Immigration Court after jurisdiction has vested pursuant to 
Sec. 3.14 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 240.21  Suspension of deportation and adjustment of status under 
  section 244(a) of the Act (as in effect before April 1, 1997) and 

  cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under section 240A(b) 
  of the Act for certain nonpermanent residents.

    (a) Applicability of annual cap on suspension of deportation or 
cancellation of removal. (1) As used in this section, the term cap means 
the numerical limitation of 4,000 grants of suspension of deportation or 
cancellation of removal in any fiscal year (except fiscal year 1998, 
which has a limitation of 8,000 grants) pursuant to section 240A(e) of 
the Act.
    (2) The provisions of this section apply to grants of suspension of 
deportation pursuant to section 244(a) of the Act (as in effect before 
April 1, 1997) or cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b) of 
the Act that are subject to a numerical limitation in section 240A(e) of 
the Act for any fiscal year. This section does not apply to grants of 
suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal to aliens described 
in section 309(c)(5)(C)(i) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and 
Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), as amended by section 203(a)(1) 
of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), 
or aliens in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997, who apply 
for suspension of deportation pursuant to section 244(a)(3) of the Act 
(as in effect prior to April 1, 1997). The Immigration Court and the 
Board shall no longer issue conditional grants of suspension of 
deportation or cancellation of removal as provided in 8 CFR 240.21 (as 
in effect prior to September 30, 1998).
    (b) Conditional grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation 
of removal in fiscal year 1998 cases--(1) Conversion to grants. Except 
with respect to cases described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this 
section, EOIR shall grant suspension of deportation or cancellation of 
removal without condition prior to October 1, 1998, to the first 8,000 
aliens given conditional grants of suspension of deportation or 
cancellation of removal (as determined by the date of the immigration 
judge's order or, if the order was appealed to the Board, the date such 
order was entered by the Board.)
    (2) Treatment of certain nationals of Nicaragua and Cuba who 
received conditional grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation 
of removal on or before September 30, 1998--(i) NACARA adjustment 
request. An application for suspension of deportation or cancellation of 
removal filed by a national of Nicaragua or Cuba that was granted on a 
conditional basis on or before September 30, 1998, shall be deemed to be 
a request for adjustment of status pursuant to section 202 of NACARA 
(``NACARA adjustment'') for the period starting September 30, 1998 and 
ending December 31, 1998. The Service shall provide the applicant with 
notice of the date, time, and place at which the applicant must appear 
before a Service officer to perfect the request for NACARA adjustment. 
Such notice shall include an attestation form, Attestation of Alien and 
Memorandum of Creation of Record of Lawful Permanent Residence, Form I-
895, regarding the applicant's eligibility for NACARA adjustment.
    (ii) Submission of documentation. To perfect the request for NACARA 
adjustment, the applicant must appear before a Service officer on the 
date scheduled with the following documentation:
    (A) The order granting suspension of deportation or cancellation of 
removal on a conditional basis issued on or before September 30, 1998;
    (B) A completed, but unsigned Form I-895, which the applicant shall 
be required to sign and to attest to the veracity of the information 
contained therein in the presence of a Service officer;
    (C) Any applicable applications for waiver of inadmissibility; and
    (D) Two ``ADIT-style'' photographs; meeting the specifications in 
the instructions attached to Form I-895.
    (iii) Waiver of documentation and fees. The provisions of 
Sec. 245.13(e) and (f) of this chapter relating to documentary 
requirements for NACARA adjustment are waived with respect to an alien 
seeking to perfect a request for adjustment of status pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition, the fees for the NACARA 
adjustment and for any applications for waivers of inadmissibility 
submitted in conjunction

[[Page 420]]

with perfecting a request for NACARA adjustment shall be waived.
    (iv) NACARA adjustment determination. In determining an applicant's 
eligibility for NACARA adjustment under the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, unless the Service officer before whom the 
applicant appears is not satisfied that the applicant is admissible to 
the United States in accordance with section 202(a)(1)(B) of NACARA, and 
has continuously resided in the United States from December 1, 1995, 
through the date of appearance before the Service officer (not counting 
an absence or absences from the United States totaling 180 days or less 
or any absences that occurred pursuant to advance authorization for 
parole (Form I-512 issued by the Service)), the Service officer shall 
accept an alien's attestation of admissibility and/or continuous 
physical presence as sufficient evidence that the applicant has met the 
admissibility and/or continuous physical presence requirement for NACARA 
adjustment. If the Service officer grants NACARA adjustment, then the 
Service officer shall create a record of lawful permanent residence and 
the prior order granting suspension of deportation or cancellation of 
removal on a conditional basis shall be automatically vacated and the 
deportation or removal proceedings shall be automatically terminated. 
The Service officer (whose decision in this regard is not subject to 
appeal) shall not adjust the applicant to lawful permanent resident 
status pursuant to section 202 of NACARA if:
    (A) The Service officer is not satisfied that the applicant is 
eligible for NACARA adjustment and so indicates on the attestation form; 
or
    (B) The applicant indicates on the attestation form that he or she 
does not wish to receive NACARA adjustment.
    (v) Automatic conversion. If the Service officer does not adjust the 
applicant to lawful permanent resident status pursuant to section 202 of 
NACARA, the applicant's conditional grant of suspension of deportation 
or cancellation of removal shall be automatically converted to a grant 
of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal. Upon such a 
conversion, the Service shall create a record of lawful permanent 
residence based upon the grant of suspension of deportation or 
cancellation of removal.
    (vi) Failure to appear. An alien who fails to appear to perfect his 
or her request for NACARA adjustment shall have his or her conditional 
grant of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal 
automatically converted by the Immigration Court or the Board to a grant 
of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal effective 
December 31, 1998.
    (3) Conditional grants not converted in fiscal year 1998. The 
provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for granting 
relief shall not apply with respect to:
    (i) Any case in which a conditional grant of suspension of 
deportation or cancellation of removal is pending on appeal before the 
Board as of September 30, 1998 or, if the right to appeal to the Board 
has not been waived, the time for an appeal has not expired. After the 
Board issues its decision or the time for appeal has expired, the 
conditional grant shall be converted to a grant when a grant is 
available.
    (ii) Any other conditional grant not described in paragraphs (b)(1), 
(b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section, which was not converted to a grant 
in fiscal year 1998. Such a conditional grant shall be converted to a 
grant when a grant is available.
    (4) Motion to reopen. The Service may file a motion to reopen within 
90 days after the alien is issued a grant of suspension of deportation 
or cancellation of removal pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or 
(b)(3) of this section, if after the issuance of a conditional grant by 
the Immigration Court or the Board the applicant committed an act that 
would have rendered him or her ineligible for suspension of deportation 
or cancellation or removal at the time of the conversion.
    (5) Travel for aliens conditionally granted suspension of 
deportation or cancellation of removal. If the Immigration Court or the 
Board granted suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal on a 
conditional basis or, if the conditional grant by the Immigration Court 
was appealed to the Board and the Board issued such a conditional

[[Page 421]]

grant, the alien shall retain the conditional grant of suspension of 
deportation or cancellation of removal upon return to the United States 
following a temporary absence abroad and be permitted to resume 
completion of his or her case, provided that:
    (i) The alien departed on or before September 30, 1998 with or 
without a grant of advance parole from the District Director; or
    (ii) The alien, prior to his or her departure from the United States 
after September 30, 1998, obtained a grant of advance parole from the 
District Director in accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act and 
Sec. 212.5 of this chapter and complied with the terms and conditions of 
the advance parole.
    (c) Grants of suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal 
in fiscal years subsequent to fiscal year 1998. On and after October 1, 
1998, the Immigration Court and the Board may grant applications for 
suspension of deportation and adjustment of status under section 244(a) 
of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997) or cancellation of 
removal and adjustment of status under section 240A(b) of the Act that 
meet the statutory requirements for such relief and warrant a favorable 
exercise of discretion until the annual numerical limitation has been 
reached in that fiscal year. The awarding of such relief shall be 
determined according to the date the order granting such relief becomes 
final as defined in Secs. 3.1(d)(2) and 3.39 of this chapter.
    (1) Applicability of the annual cap. When grants are no longer 
available in a fiscal year, further decisions to grant or deny such 
relief shall be reserved until such time as a grant becomes available 
under the annual limitation in a subsequent fiscal year. Immigration 
judges and the Board may deny without reserving decision or may 
pretermit those suspension of deportation or cancellation of removal 
applications in which the applicant has failed to establish statutory 
eligibility for relief. The basis of such denial or pretermission may 
not be based on an unfavorable exercise of discretion, a finding of no 
good moral character on a ground not specifically noted in section 
101(f) of the Act, a failure to establish exceptional or extremely 
unusual hardship to a qualifying relative in cancellation cases, or a 
failure to establish extreme hardship to the applicant and/or qualifying 
relative in suspension cases.
    (2) Aliens applying for additional forms of relief. Whether or not 
the cap has been reached, the Immigration Court or the Board shall 
adjudicate concurrently all other forms of relief for which the alien 
has applied. Applications for suspension of deportation or cancellation 
of removal shall be denied in the exercise of discretion if the alien is 
granted asylum or adjustment of status, including pursuant to section 
202 of NACARA, while the suspension of deportation or cancellation of 
removal application is pending. Where an appeal of a decision granting 
asylum or adjustment is sustained by the Board, a decision to deny as a 
matter of discretion an application for suspension of deportation or 
cancellation of removal on this basis shall be reconsidered.

<R04>
                     Subpart C--Voluntary Departure


<R05>
Sec. 240.25  Voluntary departure--authority of the Service.

    (a) Authorized officers. The authority contained in section 240B(a) 
of the Act to permit aliens to depart voluntarily from the United States 
may be exercised in lieu of being subject to proceedings under section 
240 of the Act by district directors, assistant district directors for 
investigations, assistant district directors for examinations, officers 
in charge, chief patrol agents, service center directors, and assistant 
center directors for examinations.
    (b) Conditions. The Service may attach to the granting of voluntary 
departure any conditions it deems necessary to ensure the alien's timely 
departure from the United States, including the posting of a bond, 
continued detention pending departure, and removal under safeguards. The 
alien shall be required to present to the Service, for inspection and 
photocopying, his or her passport or other travel documentation 
sufficient to assure lawful entry into the country to which the alien is 
departing. The

[[Page 422]]

Service may hold the passport or documentation for sufficient time to 
investigate its authenticity. A voluntary departure order permitting an 
alien to depart voluntarily shall inform the alien of the penalties 
under section 240B(d) of the Act.
    (c) Decision. The authorized officer, in his or her discretion, 
shall specify the period of time permitted for voluntary departure, and 
may grant extensions thereof, except that the total period allowed, 
including any extensions, shall not exceed 120 days. Every decision 
regarding voluntary departure shall be communicated in writing on Form 
I-210, Notice of Action--Voluntary Departure. Voluntary departure may 
not be granted unless the alien requests such voluntary departure and 
agrees to its terms and conditions.
    (d) Application. Any alien who believes himself or herself to be 
eligible for voluntary departure under this section may apply therefor 
at any office of the Service. After the commencement of removal 
proceedings, the application may be communicated through the Service 
counsel. If the Service agrees to voluntary departure after proceedings 
have commenced, it may either:
    (1) Join in a motion to terminate the proceedings, and if the 
proceedings are terminated, grant voluntary departure; or
    (2) Join in a motion asking the immigration judge to permit 
voluntary departure in accordance with Sec. 240.26.
    (e) Appeals. An appeal shall not lie from a denial of an application 
for voluntary departure under this section, but the denial shall be 
without prejudice to the alien's right to apply to the immigration judge 
for voluntary departure in accordance with Sec. 240.26 or for relief 
from removal under any provision of law.
    (f) Revocation. If, subsequent to the granting of an application for 
voluntary departure under this section, it is ascertained that the 
application should not have been granted, that grant may be revoked 
without advance notice by any officer authorized to grant voluntary 
departure under Sec. 240.25(a). Such revocation shall be communicated in 
writing, citing the statutory basis for revocation. No appeal shall lie 
from revocation.


<R05>
Sec. 240.26  Voluntary departure--authority of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.

    (a) Eligibility: general. An alien previously granted voluntary 
departure under section 240B of the Act, including by the Service under 
Sec. 240.25, and who fails to depart voluntarily within the time 
specified, shall thereafter be ineligible, for a period of ten years, 
for voluntary departure or for relief under sections 240A, 245, 248, and 
249 of the Act.
    (b) Prior to completion of removal proceedings--(1) Grant by the 
immigration judge. (i) An alien may be granted voluntary departure by an 
immigration judge pursuant to section 240B(a) of the Act only if the 
alien:
    (A) Makes such request prior to or at the master calendar hearing at 
which the case is initially calendared for a merits hearing;
    (B) Makes no additional requests for relief (or if such requests 
have been made, such requests are withdrawn prior to any grant of 
voluntary departure pursuant to this section);
    (C) Concedes removability;
    (D) Waives appeal of all issues; and
    (E) Has not been convicted of a crime described in section 
101(a)(43) of the Act and is not deportable under section 237(a)(4).
    (ii) The judge may not grant voluntary departure under section 
240B(a) of the Act beyond 30 days after the master calendar hearing at 
which the case is initially calendared for a merits hearing, except 
pursuant to a stipulation under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (2) Stipulation. At any time prior to the completion of removal 
proceedings, the Service counsel may stipulate to a grant of voluntary 
departure under section 240B(a) of the Act.
    (3) Conditions. (i) The judge may impose such conditions as he or 
she deems necessary to ensure the alien's timely departure from the 
United States, including the posting of a voluntary departure bond to be 
canceled upon proof that the alien has departed the United States within 
the time specified. The alien shall be required to present to the 
Service, for inspection and photocopying, his or her passport or other 
travel documentation sufficient

[[Page 423]]

to assure lawful entry into the country to which the alien is departing, 
unless:
    (A) A travel document is not necessary to return to his or her 
native country or to which country the alien is departing; or
    (B) The document is already in the possession of the Service.
    (ii) The Service may hold the passport or documentation for 
sufficient time to investigate its authenticity. If such documentation 
is not immediately available to the alien, but the immigration judge is 
satisfied that the alien is making diligent efforts to secure it, 
voluntary departure may be granted for a period not to exceed 120 days, 
subject to the condition that the alien within 60 days must secure such 
documentation and present it to the Service. The Service in its 
discretion may extend the period within which the alien must provide 
such documentation. If the documentation is not presented within the 60-
day period or any extension thereof, the voluntary departure order shall 
vacate automatically and the alternate order of removal will take 
effect, as if in effect on the date of issuance of the immigration judge 
order.
    (c) At the conclusion of the removal proceedings--(1) Required 
findings. An immigration judge may grant voluntary departure at the 
conclusion of the removal proceedings under section 240B(b) of the Act, 
if he or she finds that:
    (i) The alien has been physically present in the United States for 
period of at least one year preceding the date the Notice to Appear was 
served under section 239(a) of the Act;
    (ii) The alien is, and has been, a person of good moral character 
for at least five years immediately preceding the application;
    (iii) The alien has not been convicted of a crime described in 
section 101(a)(43) of the Act and is not deportable under section 
237(a)(4); and
    (iv) The alien has established by clear and convincing evidence that 
the alien has the means to depart the United States and has the 
intention to do so.
    (2) Travel documentation. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, the clear and convincing evidence of the means 
to depart shall include in all cases presentation by the alien of a 
passport or other travel documentation sufficient to assure lawful entry 
into the country to which the alien is departing. The Service shall have 
full opportunity to inspect and photocopy the documentation, and to 
challenge its authenticity or sufficiency before voluntary departure is 
granted.
    (3) Conditions. The judge may impose such conditions as he or she 
deems necessary to ensure the alien's timely departure from the United 
States. In all cases under section 240B(b) of the Act, the alien shall 
be required to post a voluntary departure bond, in an amount necessary 
to ensure that the alien departs within the time specified, but in no 
case less than $500. The voluntary departure bond shall be posted with 
the district director within 5 business days of the immigration judge's 
order granting voluntary departure, and the district director may, at 
his or her discretion, hold the alien in custody until the bond is 
posted. If the bond is not posted within 5 business days, the voluntary 
departure order shall vacate automatically and the alternate order of 
removal will take effect on the following day. In order for the bond to 
be canceled, the alien must provide proof of departure to the district 
director.
    (d) Alternate order of removal. Upon granting a request made for 
voluntary departure either prior to the completion of proceedings or at 
the conclusion of proceedings, the immigration judge shall also enter an 
alternate order or removal.
    (e) Periods of time. If voluntary departure is granted prior to the 
completion of removal proceedings, the immigration judge may grant a 
period not to exceed 120 days. If voluntary departure is granted at the 
conclusion of proceedings, the immigration judge may grant a period not 
to exceed 60 days.
    (f) Extension of time to depart. Authority to extend the time within 
which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge 
or the Board is within the sole jurisdiction of the district director. 
An immigration judge or the Board may reinstate voluntary departure in a 
removal proceeding that

[[Page 424]]

has been reopened for a purpose other than solely making an application 
for voluntary departure if reopening was granted prior to the expiration 
of the original period of voluntary departure. In no event can the total 
period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as 
set forth in section 240B of the Act.
    (g) Administrative Appeals. No appeal shall lie regarding the length 
of a period of voluntary departure (as distinguished from issues of 
whether to grant voluntary departure).
    (h) Reinstatement of voluntary departure. An immigration judge or 
the Board may reinstate voluntary departure in a removal proceeding that 
has been reopened for a purpose other than solely making application for 
voluntary departure, if reopening was granted prior to the expiration of 
the original period of voluntary departure. In no event can the total 
period of time, including any extension, exceed 120 days or 60 days as 
set forth in section 240B of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section.

Subpart D--Exclusion of Aliens (for Proceedings Commenced Prior to April 
                                1, 1997)


<R05>
Sec. 240.30  Proceedings prior to April 1, 1997.

    Subpart D of 8 CFR part 240 applies to exclusion proceedings 
commenced prior to April 1, 1997, pursuant to the former section 236 of 
the Act. An exclusion proceeding is commenced by the filing of Form I-
122 with the Immigration Court, and an alien is considered to be in 
exclusion proceedings only upon such filing. All references to the Act 
contained in this subpart are references to the Act in effect prior to 
April 1, 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 240.31  Authority of immigration judges.

    In determining cases referred for further inquiry as provided in 
section 235 of the Act, immigration judges shall have the powers and 
authority conferred upon them by the Act and this chapter. Subject to 
any specific limitation prescribed by the Act and this chapter, 
including the adjudication of applications for adjustment of status 
pursuant to section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100'' immediately after the 
phrase ``and this chapter, immigration judges shall also exercise the 
discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney General by the Act 
as is appropriate and necessary for the disposition of such cases.

[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 27829, May 21, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 240.32  Hearing.

    (a) Opening. Exclusion hearings shall be closed to the public, 
unless the alien at his or her own instance requests that the public, 
including the press, be permitted to attend; in that event, the hearing 
shall be open, provided that the alien states for the record that he or 
she is waiving the requirement in section 236 of the Act that the 
inquiry shall be kept separate and apart from the public. When the 
hearing is to be open, depending upon physical facilities, reasonable 
limitation may be placed upon the number in attendance at any one time, 
with priority being given to the press over the general public. The 
immigration judge shall ascertain whether the applicant for admission is 
the person to whom Form I-122 was previously delivered by the examining 
immigration officer as provided in 8 CFR part 235; enter a copy of such 
form in evidence as an exhibit in the case; inform the applicant of the 
nature and purpose of the hearing; advise him or her of the privilege of 
being represented by an attorney of his or her own choice at no expense 
to the Government, and of the availability of free legal services 
programs qualified under 8 CFR part 3 and organizations recognized 
pursuant to Sec. 292.2 of this chapter located in the district where his 
or her exclusion hearing is to be held; and shall ascertain that the 
applicant has received a list of such programs; and request him or her 
to ascertain then and there whether he or she desires representation; 
advise him or her that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity to 
present evidence in his or her own behalf, to examine and object to 
evidence against him or her, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by

[[Page 425]]

the Government; and place the applicant under oath.
    (b) Procedure. The immigration judge shall receive and adduce 
material and relevant evidence, rule upon objections, and otherwise 
regulate the course of the hearing.
    (c) Attorney for the Service. The Service shall assign an attorney 
to each case in which an applicant's nationality is in issue and may 
assign an attorney to any case in which such assignment is deemed 
necessary or advantageous. The duties of the Service counsel include, 
but are not limited to, the presentation of evidence and the 
interrogation, examination, and cross-examination of the applicant and 
other witnesses. Nothing contained in this section diminishes the 
authority of an immigration judge to conduct proceedings under this 
part.
    (d) Depositions. The procedures specified in Sec. 240.48(e) shall 
apply.
    (e) Record. The hearing before the immigration judge, including the 
testimony, exhibits, applications, proffers, and requests, the 
immigration judge's decision, and all written orders, motions, appeals, 
and other papers filed in the proceeding shall constitute the record in 
the case. The hearing shall be recorded verbatim except for statements 
made off the record with the permission of the immigration judge.


<R05>
Sec. 240.33  Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation.

    (a) If the alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return 
to his or her country of origin or to a country to which the alien may 
be deported after a determination of excludability from the United 
States pursuant to this subpart, and the alien has not been referred to 
the immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance with 
Sec. 208.14(b) of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:
    (1) Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the 
United States or withholding of deportation to that other country; and
    (2) Make available the appropriate application forms.
    (b) An application for asylum or withholding of deportation must be 
filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to Sec. 208.4(c) of this 
chapter. Upon receipt of an application that has not been referred by an 
asylum officer, the Immigration Court shall forward a copy to the 
Department of State pursuant to Sec. 208.11 of this chapter and shall 
calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if any, from the Department 
of State, unless classified under the applicable Executive Order, shall 
be given to both the applicant and to the Service counsel representing 
the government.
    (c) Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation so filed 
will be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements 
and standards established in 8 CFR part 208 after an evidentiary hearing 
that is necessary to resolve material factual issues in dispute. An 
evidentiary hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a 
mandatory denial of the application pursuant to Sec. 208.13(c) of this 
chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has determined that 
such denial is required.
    (1) Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding 
of deportation will be closed to the public unless the applicant 
expressly requests that it be open pursuant to Sec. 236.3 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of 
the immigration judge properly to control the scope of any evidentiary 
hearing.
    (3) During the exclusion hearing, the applicant shall be examined 
under oath on his or her application and may present evidence and 
witnesses on his or her own behalf. The applicant has the burden of 
establishing that he or she is a refugee as defined in section 
101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant to the standard set forth in Sec. 208.13 
of this chapter.
    (4) The Service counsel for the government may call witnesses and 
present evidence for the record, including information classified under 
the applicable Executive Order, provided the immigration judge or the 
Board has determined that such information is relevant to the hearing. 
The applicant shall be informed when the immigration judge receives such 
classified information. The agency that provides

[[Page 426]]

the classified information to the immigration judge may provide an 
unclassified summary of the information for release to the applicant 
whenever it determines it can do so consistently with safeguarding both 
the classified nature of the information and its source. The summary 
should be as detailed as possible, in order that the applicant may have 
an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or 
in part on such classified information shall state that such information 
is material to the decision.
    (d) The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or 
withholding of deportation shall be communicated to the applicant and to 
the Service counsel for the government. An adverse decision will state 
why asylum or withholding of deportation was denied.


<R05>
Sec. 240.34  Renewal of application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act.

    An adjustment application by an alien paroled under section 
212(d)(5) of the Act, which has been denied by the district director, 
may be renewed in exclusion proceedings under section 236 of the Act (as 
in effect prior to April 1, 1997) before an immigration judge under the 
following two conditions: first, the denied application must have been 
properly filed subsequent to the applicant's earlier inspection and 
admission to the United States; and second, the applicant's later 
absence from and return to the United States must have been under the 
terms of an advance parole authorization on Form I-512 granted to permit 
the applicant's absence and return to pursue the previously filed 
adjustment application.


<R05>
Sec. 240.35  Decision of the immigration judge; notice to the applicant.

    (a) Decision. The immigration judge shall inform the applicant of 
his or her decision in accordance with Sec. 3.37 of this chapter.
    (b) Advice to alien ordered excluded. An alien ordered excluded 
shall be furnished with Form I-296, Notice to Alien Ordered Excluded by 
Immigration Judge, at the time of an oral decision by the immigration 
judge or upon service of a written decision.
    (c) Holders of refugee travel documents. Aliens who are the holders 
of valid unexpired refugee travel documents may be ordered excluded only 
if they are found to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(2), 212(a)(3), 
or 212(a)(6)(E) of the Act, and it is determined that on the basis of 
the acts for which they are inadmissible there are compelling reasons of 
national security or public order for their exclusion. If the 
immigration judge finds that the alien is inadmissible but determines 
that there are no compelling reasons of national security or public 
order for exclusion, the immigration judge shall remand the case to the 
district director for parole.


<R05>
Sec. 240.36  Finality of order.

    The decision of the immigration judge shall become final in 
accordance with Sec. 3.37 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 240.37  Appeals.

    Except for temporary exclusions under section 235(c) of the Act, an 
appeal from a decision of an Immigration Judge under this part may be 
taken by either party pursuant to Sec. 3.38 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 240.38  Fingerprinting of excluded aliens.

    Every alien 14 years of age or older who is excluded from admission 
to the United States by an immigration judge shall be fingerprinted, 
unless during the preceding year he or she has been fingerprinted at an 
American consular office.

 United States: Hearing and Appeal (for Proceedings Commenced Prior to 
                             April 1, 1997)


<R05>
Sec. 240.40  Proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997.

    Subpart E of 8 CFR part 240 applies only to deportation proceedings 
commenced prior to April 1, 1997. A deportation proceeding is commenced 
by the filing of Form I-221 (Order to Show

[[Page 427]]

Cause) with the Immigration Court, and an alien is considered to be in 
deportation proceedings only upon such filing, except in the case of an 
alien admitted to the United States under the provisions of section 217 
of the Act. All references to the Act contained in this subpart pertain 
to the Act as in effect prior to April 1, 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 240.41  Immigration judges.

    (a) Authority. In any proceeding conducted under this part the 
immigration judge shall have the authority to determine deportability 
and to make decisions, including orders of deportation, as provided by 
section 242(b) and 242B of the Act; to reinstate orders of deportation 
as provided by section 242(f) of the Act; to determine applications 
under sections 208, 212(k), 241(a)(1)(E)(iii), 241(a)(1)(H), 244, 245 
and 249 of the Act and section 202 of Public Law 100-105; to determine 
the country to which an alien's deportation will be directed in 
accordance with section 243(a) of the Act; to order temporary 
withholding of deportation pursuant to section 243(h) of the Act; and to 
take any other action consistent with applicable law and regulations as 
may be appropriate. An immigration judge may certify his or her decision 
in any case to the Board of Immigration Appeals when it involves an 
unusually complex or novel question of law or fact. Nothing contained in 
this part shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred on 
immigration judges under section 103 of the Act.
    (b) Withdrawal and substitution of immigration judges. The 
immigration judge assigned to conduct the hearing shall at any time 
withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If an 
immigration judge becomes unavailable to complete his or her duties 
within a reasonable time, or if at any time the respondent consents to a 
substitution, another immigration judge may be assigned to complete the 
case. The new immigration judge shall familiarize himself or herself 
with the record in the case and shall state for the record that he or 
she has done so.

[62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997, as amended at 63 FR 27829, May 21, 1998; 63 
FR 39121, July 21, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 240.42  Representation by counsel.

    The respondent may be represented at the hearing by an attorney or 
other representative qualified under 8 CFR part 292.


<R05>
Sec. 240.43  Incompetent respondents.

    When it is impracticable for the respondent to be present at the 
hearing because of mental incompetency, the guardian, near relative, or 
friend who was served with a copy of the order to show cause shall be 
permitted to appear on behalf of the respondent. If such a person cannot 
reasonably be found or fails or refuses to appear, the custodian of the 
respondent shall be requested to appear on behalf of the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 240.44  Interpreter.

    Any person acting as interpreter in a hearing before an immigration 
judge under this part shall be sworn to interpret and translate 
accurately, unless the interpreter is an employee of the United States 
Government, in which event no such oath shall be required.


<R05>
Sec. 240.45  Postponement and adjournment of hearing.

    After the commencement of the hearing, the immigration judge may 
grant a reasonable adjournment either at his or her own instance or, for 
good cause shown, upon application by the respondent or the Service.


<R05>
Sec. 240.46  Evidence.

    (a) Sufficiency. A determination of deportability shall not be valid 
unless it is found by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that 
the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.
    (b) Use of prior statements. The immigration judge may receive in 
evidence any oral or written statement that is material and relevant to 
any issue in the case previously made by the respondent or any other 
person during any investigation, examination, hearing, or trial.
    (c) Testimony. Testimony of witnesses appearing at the hearing shall 
be under oath or affirmation administered by the immigration judge.

[[Page 428]]

    (d) Depositions. The immigration judge may order the taking of 
depositions pursuant to Sec. 3.35 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 240.47  Contents of record.

    The hearing before the immigration judge, including the testimony, 
exhibits, applications, proffers, and requests, the immigration judge's 
decision, and all written orders, motions, appeals, briefs, and other 
papers filed in the proceedings shall constitute the record in the case. 
The hearing shall be recorded verbatim except for statements made off 
the record with the permission of the immigration judge. In his or her 
discretion, the immigration judge may exclude from the record any 
arguments made in connection with motions, applications, requests, or 
objections, but in such event the person affected may submit a brief.


<R05>
Sec. 240.48  Hearing.

    (a) Opening. The immigration judge shall advise the respondent of 
his or her right to representation, at no expense to the Government, by 
counsel of his or her own choice authorized to practice in the 
proceedings and require him or her to state then and there whether he or 
she desires representation; advise the respondent of the availability of 
free legal services programs qualified under 8 CFR part 3 and 
organizations recognized pursuant to Sec. 292.2 of this chapter, located 
in the district where the deportation hearing is being held; ascertain 
that the respondent has received a list of such programs, and a copy of 
Form I-618, Written Notice of Appeal Rights; advise the respondent that 
he or she will have a reasonable opportunity to examine and object to 
the evidence against him or her, to present evidence in his or her own 
behalf and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government; place 
the respondent under oath; read the factual allegations and the charges 
in the order to show cause to the respondent and explain them in 
nontechnical language, and enter the order to show cause as an exhibit 
in the record. Deportation hearings shall be open to the public, except 
that the immigration judge may, in his or her discretion and for the 
purpose of protecting witnesses, respondents, or the public interest, 
direct that the general public or particular individuals shall be 
excluded from the hearing in any specific case. Depending upon physical 
facilities, reasonable limitation may be placed upon the number in 
attendance at any one time, with priority being given to the press over 
the general public.
    (b) Pleading by respondent. The immigration judge shall require the 
respondent to plead to the order to show cause by stating whether he or 
she admits or denies the factual allegations and his or her 
deportability under the charges contained therein. If the respondent 
admits the factual allegations and admits his or her deportability under 
the charges and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law 
or fact remain, the immigration judge may determine that deportability 
as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent. The 
immigration judge shall not accept an admission of deportability from an 
unrepresented respondent who is incompetent or under age 16 and is not 
accompanied by a guardian, relative, or friend; nor from an officer of 
an institution in which a respondent is an inmate or patient. When, 
pursuant to this paragraph, the immigration judge may not accept an 
admission of deportability, he or she shall direct a hearing on the 
issues.
    (c) Issues of deportability. When deportability is not determined 
under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the immigration 
judge shall request the assignment of a Service counsel, and shall 
receive evidence as to any unresolved issues, except that no further 
evidence need be received as to any facts admitted during the pleading. 
The respondent shall provide a court certified copy of a Judicial 
Recommendation Against Deportation (JRAD) to the immigration judge when 
such recommendation will be the basis of denying any charge(s) brought 
by the Service in the proceedings against the respondent. No JRAD is 
effective against a charge of deportability under section 241(a)(11) of 
the Act or if the JRAD was granted on or after November 29, 1990.
    (d) Additional charges. The Service may at any time during a hearing

[[Page 429]]

lodge additional charges of deportability, including factual 
allegations, against the respondent. Copies of the additional factual 
allegations and charges shall be submitted in writing for service on the 
respondent and entry as an exhibit in the record. The immigration judge 
shall read the additional factual allegations and charges to the 
respondent and explain them to him or her. The immigration judge shall 
advise the respondent if he or she is not represented by counsel that he 
or she may be so represented and also that he or she may have a 
reasonable time within which to meet the additional factual allegations 
and charges. The respondent shall be required to state then and there 
whether he or she desires a continuance for either of these reasons. 
Thereafter, the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply 
to the additional factual allegations and lodged charges.


<R05>
Sec. 240.49  Ancillary matters, applications.

    (a) Creation of the status of an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence. The respondent may apply to the immigration judge 
for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act; for 
adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, or under section 1 of 
the Act of November 2, 1966, or under section 101 or 104 of the Act of 
October 28, 1977; or for the creation of a record of lawful admission 
for permanent residence under section 249 of the Act. The application 
shall be subject to the requirements of 8 CFR parts 240, 245, and 249. 
The approval of any application made to the immigration judge under 
section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse (as defined in section 
216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 
216A(f)(1) of the Act), shall result in the alien's obtaining the status 
of lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance with 
the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is 
applicable. However, the Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence 
required by section 216(c) of the Act or the Petition by Entrepreneur to 
Remove Conditions required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made 
to the director in accordance with 8 CFR part 216. In conjunction with 
any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence made to an immigration judge, if the respondent is 
inadmissible under any provision of section 212(a) of the Act and 
believes that he or she meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver 
of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration 
judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent 
of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for any of the benefits 
enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the respondent an 
opportunity to make application therefor during the hearing. In 
exercising discretionary power when considering an application under 
this paragraph, the immigration judge may consider and base the decision 
on information not contained in the record and not made available for 
inspection by the respondent, provided the Commissioner has determined 
that such information is relevant and is classified under the applicable 
Executive Order as requiring protection from unauthorized disclosure in 
the interest of national security. Whenever the immigration judge 
believes that he or she can do so while safeguarding both the 
information and its source, the immigration judge should inform the 
respondent of the general nature of the information in order that the 
respondent may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A 
decision based in whole or in part on such classified information shall 
state that the information is material to the decision.
    (b) Voluntary departure. The respondent may apply to the immigration 
judge for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation pursuant to section 
244(e) of the Act and Sec. 240.56.
    (c) Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation. (1) The 
immigration judge shall notify the respondent that if he or she is 
finally ordered deported, his or her deportation will in the first 
instance be directed pursuant to section 243(a) of the Act to the 
country designated by the respondent and shall afford him or her an 
opportunity then and there to make such designation. The immigration 
judge shall then specify and state for the record the

[[Page 430]]

country, or countries in the alternative, to which respondent's 
deportation will be directed pursuant to section 243(a) of the Act if 
the country of his or her designation will not accept him or her into 
its territory, or fails to furnish timely notice of acceptance, or if 
the respondent declines to designate a country.
    (2) If the alien expresses fear of persecution or harm upon return 
to any of the countries to which the alien might be deported pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the alien has not previously filed 
an application for asylum or withholding of deportation that has been 
referred to the immigration judge by an asylum officer in accordance 
with Sec. 208.14(b) of this chapter, the immigration judge shall:
    (i) Advise the alien that he or she may apply for asylum in the 
United States or withholding of deportation to those countries; and
    (ii) Make available the appropriate application forms.
    (3) An application for asylum or withholding of deportation must be 
filed with the Immigration Court, pursuant to Sec. 208.4(b) of this 
chapter. Upon receipt of an application that has not been referred by an 
asylum officer, the Immigration Court shall forward a copy to the 
Department of State pursuant to Sec. 208.11 of this chapter and shall 
calendar the case for a hearing. The reply, if any, of the Department of 
State, unless classified under the applicable Executive Order, shall be 
given to both the applicant and to the Service counsel representing the 
government.
    (4) Applications for asylum or withholding of deportation so filed 
will be decided by the immigration judge pursuant to the requirements 
and standards established in 8 CFR part 208 after an evidentiary hearing 
that is necessary to resolve factual issues in dispute. An evidentiary 
hearing extending beyond issues related to the basis for a mandatory 
denial of the application pursuant to Sec. 208.13 or Sec. 208.16 of this 
chapter is not necessary once the immigration judge has determined that 
such a denial is required.
    (i) Evidentiary hearings on applications for asylum or withholding 
of deportation will be open to the public unless the applicant expressly 
requests that it be closed.
    (ii) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of 
the immigration judge properly to control the scope of any evidentiary 
hearing.
    (iii) During the deportation hearing, the applicant shall be 
examined under oath on his or her application and may present evidence 
and witnesses in his or her own behalf. The applicant has the burden of 
establishing that he or she is a refugee as defined in section 
101(a)(42) of the Act pursuant to the standard set forth in Sec. 208.13 
of this chapter.
    (iv) The Service counsel for the government may call witnesses and 
present evidence for the record, including information classified under 
the applicable Executive Order, provided the immigration judge or the 
Board has determined that such information is relevant to the hearing. 
When the immigration judge receives such classified information he or 
she shall inform the applicant. The agency that provides the classified 
information to the immigration judge may provide an unclassified summary 
of the information for release to the applicant, whenever it determines 
it can do so consistently with safeguarding both the classified nature 
of the information and its source. The summary should be as detailed as 
possible, in order that the applicant may have an opportunity to offer 
opposing evidence. A decision based in whole or in part on such 
classified information shall state whether such information is material 
to the decision.
    (5) The decision of an immigration judge to grant or deny asylum or 
withholding of deportation shall be communicated to the applicant and to 
the Service counsel for the government. An adverse decision will state 
why asylum or withholding of deportation was denied.
    (d) Application for relief under sections 241(a)(1)(H) and 
241(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act. The respondent may apply to the 
immigration judge for relief from deportation under sections 
241(a)(1)(H) and 241(a)(1)(E)(iii) of the Act.
    (e) General. An application under this section shall be made only 
during the

[[Page 431]]

hearing and shall not be held to constitute a concession of alienage or 
deportability in any case in which the respondent does not admit his 
alienage or deportability. However, nothing in this section shall 
prohibit the Service from using information supplied in an application 
for asylum or withholding of deportation submitted to an asylum officer 
pursuant to Sec. 208.2 of this chapter on or after January 4, 1995, as 
the basis for issuance of an order to show cause or a notice to appear 
to establish alienage or deportability in a case referred to an 
immigration judge under Sec. 208.14(b) of this chapter. The respondent 
shall have the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any 
requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the 
exercise of discretion. The respondent shall not be required to pay a 
fee on more than one application within paragraphs (a) and (c) of this 
section, provided that the minimum fee imposed when more than one 
application is made shall be determined by the cost of the application 
with the highest fee. Nothing contained in this section is intended to 
foreclose the respondent from applying for any benefit or privilege 
which he or she believes himself or herself eligible to receive in 
proceedings under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 240.50  Decision of the immigration judge.

    (a) Contents. The decision of the immigration judge may be oral or 
written. Except when deportability is determined on the pleadings 
pursuant to Sec. 240.48(b), the decision of the immigration judge shall 
include a finding as to deportability. The formal enumeration of 
findings is not required. The decision shall also contain the reasons 
for granting or denying the request. The decision shall be concluded 
with the order of the immigration judge.
    (b) Summary decision. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 
(a) of this section, in any case where deportability is determined on 
the pleadings pursuant to Sec. 240.48(b) and the respondent does not 
make an application under Sec. 240.49, or the respondent applies for 
voluntary departure only and the immigration judge grants the 
application, the immigration judge may enter a summary decision on Form 
EOIR-7, Summary Order of Deportation, if deportation is ordered, or on 
Form EOIR-6, Summary Order of Voluntary Departure, if voluntary 
departure is granted with an alternate order of deportation.
    (c) Order of the immigration judge. The order of the immigration 
judge shall direct the respondent's deportation, or the termination of 
the proceedings, or such other disposition of the case as may be 
appropriate. When deportation is ordered, the immigration judge shall 
specify the country, or countries in the alternate, to which 
respondent's deportation shall be directed. The immigration judge is 
authorized to issue orders in the alternative or in combination as he or 
she may deem necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 240.51  Notice of decision.

    (a) Written decision. A written decision shall be served upon the 
respondent and the Service counsel, together with the notice referred to 
in Sec. 3.3 of this chapter. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.
    (b) Oral decision. An oral decision shall be stated by the 
immigration judge in the presence of the respondent and the trail 
attorney, if any, at the conclusion of the hearing. Unless appeal from 
the decision is waived, the respondent shall be furnished with Form 
EOIR-26, Notice of Appeal, and advised of the provisions of Sec. 240.53. 
A printed copy of the oral decision shall be furnished at the request of 
the respondent or the Service counsel.
    (c) Summary decision. When the immigration judge renders a summary 
decision as provided in Sec. 240.51(b), he or she shall serve a copy 
thereof upon the respondent at the conclusion of the hearing. Unless 
appeal from the decision is waived, the respondent shall be furnished 
with Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appeal, and advised of the provisions of 
Sec. 240.54.


<R05>
Sec. 240.52  Finality of order.

    The decision of the immigration judge shall become final in 
accordance with Sec. 3.39 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 240.53  Appeals.

    (a) Pursuant to 8 CFR part 3, an appeal shall lie from a decision of 
an immigration judge to the Board, except

[[Page 432]]

that no appeal shall lie from an order of deportation entered in 
absentia. The procedures regarding the filing of a Form EOIR-26, Notice 
of Appeal, fees, and briefs are set forth in Secs. 3.3, 3.31, and 3.38 
of this chapter. An appeal shall be filed within 30 calendar days after 
the mailing of a written decision, the stating of an oral decision, or 
the service of a summary decision. The filing date is defined as the 
date of receipt of the Notice of Appeal by the Board. The reasons for 
the appeal shall be stated in the Form EOIR-26, Notice of Appeal, in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3.3(b) of this chapter. Failure 
to do so may constitute a ground for dismissal of the appeal by the 
Board pursuant to Sec. 3.1(d)(1-a) of this chapter.
    (b) Prohibited appeals; legalization or applications. An alien 
respondent defined in Sec. 245a.2(c)(6) or (7) of this chapter who fails 
to file an application for adjustment of status to that of a temporary 
resident within the prescribed period(s), and who is thereafter found to 
be deportable by decision of an immigration judge, shall not be 
permitted to appeal the finding of deportability based solely on refusal 
by the immigration judge to entertain such an application in deportation 
proceedings.

<R04>
   Subpart F--Suspension of Deportation and Voluntary Departure (for 
              Proceedings Commenced Prior to April 1, 1997)


<R05>
Sec. 240.55  Proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997.

    Subpart F of 8 CFR part 240 applies to deportation proceedings 
commenced prior to April 1, 1997. A deportation proceeding is commenced 
by the filing of Form I-221 (Order to Show Cause) with the Immigration 
Court, and an alien is considered to be in deportation proceedings only 
upon such filing, except in the case of an alien admitted to the United 
States under the provisions of section 217 of the Act. All references to 
the Act contained in this subpart are references to the Act in effect 
prior to April 1, 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 240.56  Application.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an alien who is 
deportable because of a conviction on or after November 18, 1988, for an 
aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, shall not 
be eligible for voluntary departure as prescribed in 8 CFR part 240 and 
section 244 of the Act. Pursuant to subpart F of this part and section 
244 of the Act, an immigration judge may authorize the suspension of an 
alien's deportation; or, if the alien establishes that he or she is 
willing and has the immediate means with which to depart promptly from 
the United States, an immigration judge may authorize the alien to 
depart voluntarily from the United States in lieu of deportation within 
such time as may be specified by the immigration judge when first 
authorizing voluntary departure, and under such conditions as the 
district director shall direct. An application for suspension of 
deportation shall be made on Form EOIR-40.


<R05>
Sec. 240.57  Extension of time to depart.

    Authority to reinstate or extend the time within which to depart 
voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the Board is 
within the sole jurisdiction of the district director, except that an 
immigration judge or the Board may reinstate voluntary departure in a 
deportation proceeding that has been reopened for a purpose other than 
solely making an application for voluntary departure. A request by an 
alien for reinstatement or an extension of time within which to depart 
voluntarily shall be filed with the district director having 
jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence. Written notice of the 
district director's decision shall be served upon the alien and no 
appeal may be taken therefrom.

<R04>
              Subpart A--Post-hearing Detention and Removal


<R05>
Sec. 241.1  Final order of removal.

    An order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion 
of proceedings under section 240 of the Act shall become final:
    (a) Upon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals;
    (b) Upon waiver of appeal by the respondent;
    (c) Upon expiration of the time allotted for an appeal if the 
respondent does not file an appeal within that time;
    (d) If certified to the Board or Attorney General, upon the date of 
the subsequent decision ordering removal;
    (e) If an immigration judge orders an alien removed in the alien's 
absence, immediately upon entry of such order; or
    (f) If an immigration judge issues an alternate order of removal in 
connection with a grant of voluntary departure, upon overstay of the 
voluntary departure period except where the respondent has filed a 
timely appeal with the Board. In such a case, the order shall become 
final upon an order of removal by the Board or the Attorney General, or 
upon overstay of any voluntary departure period granted or reinstated by 
the Board or the Attorney General.


<R05>
Sec. 241.2  Warrant of removal.

    (a) Issuance of a warrant of removal. A Form I-205, Warrant of 
Removal, based upon the final administrative removal order in the 
alien's case shall be issued by a district director. The district 
director shall exercise the authority contained in section 241 of the 
Act to determine at whose expense the alien shall be removed and whether 
his or her mental or physical condition requires personal care and 
attention en route to his or her destination.
    (b) Execution of the warrant of removal. Any officer authorized by 
Sec. 287.5(e) of this chapter to execute administrative warrants of 
arrest may execute a warrant of removal.

[[Page 434]]


<R05>
Sec. 241.3  Detention of aliens during removal period.

    (a) Assumption of custody. Once the removal period defined in 
section 241(a)(1) of the Act begins, an alien in the United States will 
be taken into custody pursuant to the warrant of removal.
    (b) Cancellation of bond. Any bond previously posted will be 
canceled unless it has been breached or is subject to being breached.
    (c) Judicial stays. The filing of (or intention to file) a petition 
or action in a Federal court seeking review of the issuance or execution 
of an order of removal shall not delay execution of the Warrant of 
Removal except upon an affirmative order of the court.


<R05>
Sec. 241.4  Continued detention beyond the removal period.

    (a) Continuation of custody for inadmissible or criminal aliens. The 
district director may continue in custody any alien inadmissible under 
section 212(a) of the Act or removable under section 237(a)(1)(C), 
237(a)(2), or 237(a)(4) of the Act, or who presents a significant risk 
of noncompliance with the order of removal, beyond the removal period, 
as necessary, until removal from the United States. If such an alien 
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the release would not 
pose a danger to the community or a significant flight risk, the 
district director may, in the exercise of discretion, order the alien 
released from custody on such conditions as the district director may 
prescribe, including bond in an amount sufficient to ensure the alien's 
appearance for removal. The district may consider, but is not limited to 
considering, the following factors:
    (1) The nature and seriousness of the alien's criminal convictions;
    (2) Other criminal history;
    (3) Sentence(s) imposed and time actually served;
    (4) History of failures to appear for court (defaults);
    (5) Probation history;
    (6) Disciplinary problems while incarcerated;
    (7) Evidence of rehabilitative effort or recidivism;
    (8) Equities in the United States; and
    (9) Prior immigration violations and history.
    (b) Continuation of custody for other aliens. Any alien removable 
under any section of the Act other than section 212(a), 237(a)(1)(C), 
237(a)(2), or 237(a)(4) may be detained beyond the removal period, in 
the discretion of the district director, unless the alien demonstrates 
to the satisfaction of the district director that he or she is likely to 
comply with the removal order and is not a risk to the community.


<R05>
Sec. 241.5  Conditions of release after removal period.

    (a) Order of supervision. An alien released pursuant to Sec. 241.4 
shall be released pursuant to an order of supervision. A district 
director, acting district director, deputy district director, assistant 
district director for investigations, assistant district director for 
detention and deportation, or officer in charge may issue an order of 
supervision on Form I-220B. The order shall specify conditions of 
supervision including, but not limited to, the following:
    (1) A requirement that the alien report to a specified officer 
periodically and provide relevant information under oath as directed;
    (2) A requirement that the alien continue efforts to obtain a travel 
document and assist the Service in obtaining a travel document;
    (3) A requirement that the alien report as directed for a mental or 
physical examination or examinations as directed by the Service;
    (4) A requirement that the alien obtain advance approval of travel 
beyond previously specified times and distances; and
    (5) A requirement that the alien provide the Service with written 
notice of any change of address on Form AR-11 within ten days of the 
change.
    (b) Posting of bond. An officer authorized to issue an order of 
supervision may require the posting of a bond in an amount determined by 
the officer to be sufficient to ensure compliance with the conditions of 
the order, including surrender for removal.
    (c) Employment authorization. An officer authorized to issue an 
order of supervision may, in his or her discretion,

[[Page 435]]

grant employment authorization to an alien released under an order of 
supervision if the officer specifically finds that:
    (1) The alien cannot be removed because no country will accept the 
alien; or
    (2) The removal of the alien is impracticable or contrary to public 
interest.


<R05>
Sec. 241.6  Administrative stay of removal.

    Any request of an alien under a final order of deportation or 
removal for a stay of deportation or removal shall be filed on Form I-
246, Stay of Removal, with the district director having jurisdiction 
over the place where the alien is at the time of filing. The district 
director, in his or her discretion and in consideration of factors such 
as are listed in Sec. 212.5 of this chapter and section 241(c) of the 
Act, may grant a stay of removal or deportation for such time and under 
such conditions as he or she may deem appropriate. Neither the request 
nor the failure to receive notice of disposition of the request shall 
delay removal or relieve the alien from strict compliance with any 
outstanding notice to surrender for deportation or removal. Denial by 
the district director of a request for a stay is not appealable, but 
such denial shall not preclude an immigration judge or the Board from 
granting a stay in connection with a motion to reopen or a motion to 
reconsider as provided in 8 CFR part 3. The Service shall take all 
reasonable steps to comply with a stay granted by an immigration judge 
or the Board. However, such a stay shall cease to have effect if granted 
(or communicated) after the alien has been placed aboard an aircraft or 
other conveyance for removal and the normal boarding has been completed.


<R05>
Sec. 241.7  Self-removal.

    A district director may permit an alien ordered removed (including 
an alien ordered excluded or deported in proceedings prior to April 1, 
1997) to depart at his or her own expense to a destination of his or her 
own choice. Any alien who has departed from the United States while an 
order of deportation or removal is outstanding shall be considered to 
have been deported, excluded and deported, or removed, except that an 
alien who departed before the expiration of the voluntary departure 
period granted in connection with an alternate order of deportation or 
removal shall not be considered to have been so deported or removed.


<R05>
Sec. 241.8  Reinstatement of removal orders.

    (a) Applicability. An alien who illegally reenters the United States 
after having been removed, or having departed voluntarily, while under 
an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal shall be removed from the 
United States by reinstating the prior order. The alien has no right to 
a hearing before an immigration judge in such circumstances. In 
establishing whether an alien is subject to this section, the 
immigration officer shall determine the following:
    (1) Whether the alien has been subject to a prior order of removal. 
The immigration officer must obtain the prior order of exclusion, 
deportation, or removal relating to the alien.
    (2) The identity of the alien, i.e., whether the alien is in fact an 
alien who was previously removed, or who departed voluntarily while 
under an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal. In disputed cases, 
verification of identity shall be accomplished by a comparison of 
fingerprints between those of the previously excluded, deported, or 
removed alien contained in Service records and those of the subject 
alien. In the absence of fingerprints in a disputed case the alien shall 
not be removed pursuant to this paragraph.
    (3) Whether the alien unlawfully reentered the United States. In 
making this determination, the officer shall consider all relevant 
evidence, including statements made by the alien and any evidence in the 
alien's possession. The immigration officer shall attempt to verify an 
alien's claim, if any, that he or she was lawfully admitted, which shall 
include a check of Service data systems available to the officer.
    (b) Notice. If an officer determines that an alien is subject to 
removal under this section, he or she shall provide the alien with 
written notice of his or her determination. The officer

[[Page 436]]

shall advise the alien that he or she may make a written or oral 
statement contesting the determination. If the alien wishes to make such 
a statement, the officer shall allow the alien to do so and shall 
consider whether the alien's statement warrants reconsideration of the 
determination.
    (c) Order. If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are 
met, the alien shall be removed under the previous order of exclusion, 
deportation, or removal in accordance with section 241(a)(5) of the Act.
    (d) Exception for withholding of removal. If an alien whose prior 
order of removal has been reinstated under this section expresses a fear 
of returning to the country designated in that order, the alien shall be 
immediately referred to an asylum officer to determine whether the 
alien's removal to that country must be withheld under section 241(b)(3) 
of the Act. The alien's claim will be granted or denied by an asylum 
officer in accordance with Sec. 208.16 of this chapter. If the alien has 
previously had a claim to withholding of deportation or removal denied, 
then that decision shall prevail unless the alien can establish the 
existence of changed circumstances that materially affect the alien's 
eligibility for withholding. The alien's case shall not be referred to 
an immigration judge, and there is no appeal from the decision of the 
asylum officer. If the alien is found to merit withholding of removal, 
the Service shall not enforce the reinstated order.
    (e) Execution of reinstated order. Execution of the reinstated order 
of removal and detention of the alien shall be administered in 
accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 241.9  Notice to transportation line of alien's removal.

    (a) An alien who has been ordered removed shall, immediately or as 
promptly as the circumstances permit, be offered for removal to the 
owner, agent, master, commanding officer, person in charge, purser, or 
consignee of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien is to be removed, 
as determined by the district director, with a written notice specifying 
the cause of inadmissibility or deportability, the class of travel in 
which such alien arrived and is to be removed, and with the return of 
any documentation that will assist in effecting his or her removal. If 
special care and attention are required, the provisions of Sec. 241.10 
shall apply.
    (b) Failure of the carrier to accept for removal an alien who has 
been ordered removed shall result in the carrier being assessed any 
costs incurred by the Service for detention after the carrier's failure 
to accept the alien for removal, including the cost of any 
transportation as required under section 241(e) of the Act. The User Fee 
Account shall not be assessed for expenses incurred because of the 
carrier's violation of the provisions of section 241 of the Act and this 
paragraph. The Service will, at the carrier's option, retain custody of 
the alien for an additional 7 days beyond the date of the removal order. 
If, after the third day of this additional 7-day period, the carrier has 
not made all the necessary transportation arrangements for the alien to 
be returned to his or her point of embarkation by the end of the 
additional 7-day period, the Service will make the arrangements and bill 
the carrier for its costs.


<R05>
Sec. 241.10  Special care and attention of removable aliens.

    When, in accordance with section 241(c)(3) of the Act, a 
transportation line is responsible for the expenses of an inadmissible 
or deportable alien's removal, and the alien requires special care and 
attention, the alien shall be delivered to the owner, agent, master, 
commanding officer, person in charge, purser, or consignee of the vessel 
or aircraft on which the alien will be removed, who shall be given Forms 
I-287, I-287A, and I-287B. The reverse of Form I-287A shall be signed by 
the officer of the vessel or aircraft to whom the alien has been 
delivered and immediately returned to the immigration officer effecting 
delivery. Form I-287B shall be retained by the receiving officer and 
subsequently filled out by the agents or persons therein designated and 
returned by mail to the district director named on the form. The 
transportation line shall at its own expense forward the alien from the 
foreign port of disembarkation to the final destination

[[Page 437]]

specified on Form I-287. The special care and attention shall be 
continued to such final destination, except when the foreign public 
officers decline to allow such attendant to proceed and they take charge 
of the alien, in which case this fact shall be recorded by the 
transportation line on the reverse of Form I-287B. If the transportation 
line fails, refuses, or neglects to provide the necessary special care 
and attention or comply with the directions of Form I-287, the district 
director shall thereafter and without notice employ suitable persons, at 
the expense of the transportation line, and effect such removal.


<R05>
Sec. 241.11  Detention and removal of stowaways.

    (a) Presentation of stowaways. The owner, agent, master, commanding 
officer, charterer, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft (referred to in 
this section as the carrier) bringing any alien stowaway to the United 
States is required to detain the stowaway on board the vessel or 
aircraft, at the expense of the owner of the vessel or aircraft, until 
completion of the inspection of the alien by an immigration officer. If 
detention on board the vessel or aircraft pending inspection is not 
possible, the carrier shall advise the Service of this fact without 
delay, and the Service may authorize that the carrier detain the 
stowaway at another designated location, at the expense of the owner, 
until the immigration officer arrives. No notice to detain the alien 
shall be required. Failure to detain an alien stowaway pending 
inspection shall result in a civil penalty under section 243(c)(1)(A) of 
the Act. The owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or 
consignee of a vessel or aircraft must present the stowaway for 
inspection, along with any documents or evidence of identity or 
nationality in the possession of the alien or obtained by the carrier 
relating to the alien stowaway, and must provide any available 
information concerning the alien's boarding or apprehension.
    (b) Removal of stowaways from vessel or aircraft for medical 
treatment. The district director may parole an alien stowaway into the 
United States for medical treatment, but the costs of detention and 
treatment of the alien stowaway shall be at the expense of the owner of 
the vessel or aircraft, and such removal of the stowaway from the vessel 
or aircraft does not relieve the carrier of the requirement to remove 
the stowaway from the United States once such medical treatment has been 
completed.
    (c) Repatriation of stowaways--(1) Requirements of carrier. 
Following inspection, an immigration officer may order the owner, agent, 
master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee of a vessel or 
aircraft bringing any alien stowaway to the United States to remove the 
stowaway on the vessel or aircraft of arrival, unless it is 
impracticable to do so or other factors exist which would preclude 
removal on the same vessel or aircraft. Such factors may include, but 
are not limited to, sanitation, health, and safety concerns for the crew 
and/or stowaway, whether the stowaway is a female or a juvenile, loss of 
insurance coverage on account of the stowaway remaining aboard, need for 
repairs to the vessel, and other similar circumstances. If the owner, 
agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee requests that 
he or she be allowed to remove the stowaway by other means, the Service 
shall favorably consider any such request, provided the carrier has 
obtained, or will obtain in a timely manner, any necessary travel 
documents and has made or will make all transportation arrangements. The 
owner, agent, master, commanding officer, charterer, or consignee shall 
transport the stowaway or arrange for secure escort of the stowaway to 
the vessel or aircraft of departure to ensure that the stowaway departs 
the United States. All expenses relating to removal shall be borne by 
the owner. Other than requiring compliance with the detention and 
removal requirements contained in section 241(d)(2) of the Act, the 
Service shall not impose additional conditions on the carrier regarding 
security arrangements. Failure to comply with an order to remove an 
alien stowaway shall result in a civil penalty under section 
243(c)(1)(A) of the Act.
    (2) Detention of stowaways ordered removed. If detention of the 
stowaway is

[[Page 438]]

required pending removal on other than the vessel or aircraft of 
arrival, or if the stowaway is to be removed on the vessel or aircraft 
of arrival but departure of the vessel or aircraft is not imminent and 
circumstances preclude keeping the stowaway on board the vessel or 
aircraft, the Service shall take the stowaway into Service custody. The 
owner is responsible for all costs of maintaining and detaining the 
stowaway pending removal, including costs for stowaways seeking asylum 
as described in paragraph (d) of this section. Such costs will be 
limited to those normally incurred in the detention of an alien by the 
Service, including, but not limited to, housing, food, transportation, 
medical expenses, and other reasonable costs incident to the detention 
of the stowaway. The Service may require the posting of a bond or other 
surety to ensure payment of costs of detention.
    (d) Stowaways claiming asylum--(1) Referral for credible fear 
determination. A stowaway who indicates an intention to apply for asylum 
or a fear of persecution shall be removed from the vessel or aircraft of 
arrival in accordance with Sec. 208.5(b) of this chapter. The 
immigration officer shall refer the alien to an asylum officer for a 
determination of credible fear in accordance with section 235(b)(1)(B) 
of the Act and Sec. 208.30 of this chapter. The stowaway shall be 
detained in the custody of the Service pending the credible fear 
determination and any review thereof. Parole of such alien, in 
accordance with section 212(d)(5) of the Act, may be permitted only when 
the Attorney General determines, in the exercise of discretion, that 
parole is required to meet a medical emergency or is necessary for a 
legitimate law enforcement objective. A stowaway who has established a 
credible fear of persecution in accordance with Sec. 208.30 of this 
chapter may be detained or paroled pursuant to Sec. 212.5 of this 
chapter during any consideration of the asylum application. In 
determining whether to detain or parole the alien, the Service shall 
consider the likelihood that the alien will abscond or pose a security 
risk.
    (2) Costs of detention of asylum-seeking stowaways. The owner of the 
vessel or aircraft that brought the stowaway to the United States shall 
reimburse the Service for the costs of maintaining and detaining the 
stowaway pending a determination of credible fear under section 
235(b)(1)(B) of the Act, up to a maximum period of 72 hours. The owner 
is also responsible for the costs of maintaining and detaining the 
stowaway during the period in which the stowaway is pursuing his or her 
asylum application, for a maximum period of 15 working days, excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The 15-day period shall begin on the 
day following the day in which the alien is determined to have a 
credible fear of persecution by the asylum officer, or by the 
immigration judge if such review was requested by the alien pursuant to 
section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III) of the Act, but not later than 72 hours 
after the stowaway was initially presented to the Service for 
inspection. Following the determination of credible fear, if the 
stowaway's application for asylum is not adjudicated within 15 working 
days, the Service shall pay the costs of detention beyond this time 
period. If the stowaway is determined not to have a credible fear of 
persecution, or if the stowaway's application for asylum is denied, 
including any appeals, the carrier shall be notified and shall arrange 
for repatriation of the stowaway at the expense of the owner of the 
vessel or aircraft on which the stowaway arrived.


<R05>
Sec. 241.12  Nonapplication of costs of detention and maintenance.

    The owner of a vessel or aircraft bringing an alien to the United 
States who claims to be exempt from payment of the costs of detention 
and maintenance of the alien pursuant to section 241(c)(3)(B) of the Act 
shall establish to the satisfaction of the district director in charge 
of the port of arrival that such costs should not be applied. The 
district director shall afford the owner a reasonable time within which 
to submit affidavits and briefs to support the claim. There is no appeal 
from the decision of the district director.

<R05>
Sec. 241.20  Proceedings commenced prior to April 1, 1997.

    Subpart B of 8 CFR part 241 applies to exclusion proceedings 
commenced prior to April 1, 1997. All references to the Act contained in 
this subpart are references to the Act in effect prior to April 1, 1997.


<R05>
Sec. 241.21  Stay of deportation of excluded alien.

    The district director in charge of the port of arrival may stay the 
immediate deportation of an excluded alien pursuant to sections 237 (a) 
and (d) of the Act under such conditions as he or she may prescribe.


<R05>
Sec. 241.22  Notice to surrender for deportation.

    An alien who has been finally excluded pursuant to 8 CFR part 240, 
subpart D may at any time surrender himself or herself to the custody of 
the Service and shall surrender to such custody upon notice in writing 
of the time and place for his or her surrender. The Service may take the 
alien into custody at any time. An alien taken into custody either upon 
notice to surrender or by arrest shall not be deported less than 72 
hours thereafter without his or her consent thereto filed in writing 
with the district director in charge of the place of his or her 
detention. An alien in foreign contiguous territory shall be informed 
that he or she may remain there in lieu of surrendering to the Service, 
but that he or she will be deemed to have acknowledged the execution of 
the order of exclusion and deportation in his or her case upon his or 
her failure to surrender at the time and place prescribed.


<R05>
Sec. 241.23  Cost of maintenance not assessed.

    A claim pursuant to section 237(a)(1) of the Act shall be 
established to the satisfaction of the district director in charge of 
the port of arrival, from whose adverse decision no appeal shall lie. 
The district director shall afford the line a reasonable time within 
which to submit affidavits and briefs to support its claim.


<R05>
Sec. 241.24  Notice to transportation line of alien's exclusion.

    (a) An excluded alien shall, immediately or as promptly as the 
circumstances permit, be offered for deportation to the master, 
commanding officer, purser, person in charge, agent, owner, or consignee 
of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien is to be deported, as 
determined by the district director, with a written notice specifying 
the cause of exclusion, the class of travel in which such alien arrived 
and is to be deported, and with the return of any documentation that 
will assist in effecting his or her deportation. If special care and 
attention are required, the provisions of Sec. 241.10 shall apply.
    (b) Failure of the carrier to accept for removal an alien who has 
been ordered excluded and deported shall result in the carrier being 
assessed any costs incurred by the Service for detention after the 
carrier's failure to accept the alien for removal including the cost of 
any transportation. The User Fee Account shall not be assessed for 
expenses incurred because of the carrier's violation of the provisions 
of section 237 of the Act and this paragraph. The Service will, at the 
carrier's option, retain custody of the excluded alien for an additional 
7 days beyond the date of the deportation/exclusion order. If, after the 
third day of this additional 7-day period, the carrier has not made all 
the necessary transportation arrangements for the excluded alien to be 
returned to his or her point of embarkation by the end of the additional 
7-day period, the Service will make the arrangements and bill the 
carrier for its costs.


<R05>
Sec. 241.25  Deportation.

    (a) Definitions of terms. For the purposes of this section, the 
following terms mean:

    (2) Foreign contiguous territory--any country sharing a common 
boundary with the United States.

[[Page 440]]

    (3) Residence in foreign contiguous territory or adjacent island--
any physical presence, regardless of intent, in a foreign contiguous 
territory or an adjacent island if the government of such territory or 
island agrees to accept the alien.
    (4) Aircraft or vessel--any conveyance and other mode of travel by 
which arrival is effected.
    (5) Next available flight--the carrier's next regularly scheduled 
departure to the excluded alien's point of embarkation regardless of 
seat availability. If the carrier's next regularly scheduled departure 
to the excluded aliens point of embarkation is full, the carrier has the 
option of arranging for return transportation on other carriers which 
service the excluded aliens point of embarkation.
    (b) Place to which deported. Any alien (other than an alien 
crewmember or an alien who boarded an aircraft or vessel in foreign 
contiguous territory or an adjacent island) who is ordered excluded 
shall be deported to the country where the alien boarded the vessel or 
aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States. If that 
country refuses to accept the alien, the alien shall be deported to:
    (1) The country of which the alien is a subject, citizen, or 
national;
    (2) The country where the alien was born;
    (3) The country where the alien has a residence; or
    (4) Any country willing to accept the alien.
    (c) Contiguous territory and adjacent islands. Any alien ordered 
excluded who boarded an aircraft or vessel in foreign contiguous 
territory or in any adjacent island shall be deported to such foreign 
contiguous territory or adjacent island if the alien is a native, 
citizen, subject, or national of such foreign contiguous territory or 
adjacent island, or if the alien has a residence in such foreign 
contiguous territory or adjacent island. Otherwise, the alien shall be 
deported, in the first instance, to the country in which is located the 
port at which the alien embarked for such foreign contiguous territory 
or adjacent island.
    (d) Land border pedestrian arrivals. Any alien ordered excluded who 
arrived at a land border on foot shall be deported in the same manner as 
if the alien had boarded a vessel or aircraft in foreign contiguous 
territory.

    (2) An immigration judge enters an order of deportation without 
granting voluntary departure or other relief, and the alien respondent 
waives his or her right to appeal;
    (3) The Board of Immigration Appeals enters an order of deportation 
on appeal, without granting voluntary departure or other relief; or
    (4) A Federal district or appellate court affirms an administrative 
order of deportation in a petition for review or habeas corpus action.

the authorities enumerated above, the order shall be executed no sooner 
than 72 hours after service of the decision, regardless of whether the 
alien is in Service custody, provided that such period may be waived on 
the knowing and voluntary request of the alien. Nothing in this 
paragraph shall be construed, however, to preclude assumption of custody 
by the Service at the time of issuance of the final order.

order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary 
departure without the institution of deportation proceedings; and
    (3) The purposes for the absence from the United States or actions 
while outside of the United States were not contrary to law.
    Charging document means the written instrument which initiates a 
proceeding before an Immigration Judge. For proceedings initiated prior 
to April 1, 1997, these documents include an Order to Show Cause, a 
Notice to Applicant for Admission Detained for Hearing before 
Immigration Judge, and a Notice of Intention to Rescind and Request for

physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and 
innocent absences as defined within this section.

outside the control of the alien.
    Felony means a crime committed in the United States, punishable by 
imprisonment for a term of more than one year, regardless of the term 
such alien actually served, if any, except: When the offense is defined

this exception for purposes of section 244 of the Act, the crime shall 
be treated as a misdemeanor.
    Foreign state means any foreign country or part thereof as 
designated by the Attorney General pursuant to section 244 of the Act.

    (2) A crime treated as a misdemeanor under the term ``felony'' of 
this section.
    For purposes of this definition, any crime punishable by 
imprisonment for a maximum term of five days or less shall not be

completed application, with proper fee, for Temporary Protected Status 
during the registration period designated under section 244(b) of the

Sec. 244.5  Temporary treatment benefits for eligible aliens.

    (a) Prior to the registration period. Prior to the registration 
period established by the Attorney General, a national of a foreign 
state designated by the Attorney General shall be afforded temporary

days of the registration period designated by the Attorney General. If 
the registration fee is paid or a waiver is sought within such thirty 
day period, temporary treatment benefits shall continue until terminated 
under Sec. 244.13. The denial of temporary treatment benefits prior to 
the registration period designated by the Attorney General shall be 
without prejudice to the filing of an application for Temporary 
Protected Status during such registration period.
    (b) During the registration period. Upon the filing of an 
application for Temporary Protected Status, the alien shall be afforded 
temporary treatment benefits, if the application establishes the alien's

treatment benefits shall continue until terminated under Sec. 244.13.
    (c) Denied benefits. There shall be no appeal from the denial of 
temporary treatment benefits.

provide supporting documentary evidence of eligibility apart from his or 
her own statements.
    (c) Failure to timely respond. Failure to timely respond to a 
request for information, or to appear for a scheduled interview, without

result in a denial of the application for lack of prosecution. Such 
failure shall be excused if the request for information, or the notice 
of

Sec. 244.10  Decision by the district director or Administrative Appeals Unit (AAU).

    (a) Temporary treatment benefits. The district director shall grant 
temporary treatment benefits to the applicant if the applicant 
establishes prima facie eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in 
accordance with Sec. 244.5.
    (b) Temporary Protected Status. Upon review of the evidence 
presented, the district director may approve or deny the application for 
Temporary Protected Status in the exercise of discretion, consistent 
with the standards for eligibility in Secs. 244.2, 244.3, and 244.4.
    (c) Denial by director. The decision of the director to deny 
Temporary Protected Status, a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility, or 
temporary treatment benefits shall be in writing served in person or by 
mail to the alien's most recent address provided to the Service and 
shall state the reason(s) for the denial. Except as otherwise provided 
in this section, the alien shall be given written notice of his or her 
right to appeal a decision denying Temporary Protected Status. To 
exercise such right, the alien shall file a notice of appeal, Form I-
290B, with the director who issued the denial. If an appeal is filed, 
the administrative record shall be forwarded to the AAU for review and 
decision, pursuant to authority delegated in Sec. 103.1(f)(2), except as 
otherwise provided in this section.
    (1) If the basis for the denial of the Temporary Protected Status 
constitutes a ground for deportability or excludability which renders 
the alien ineligible for Temporary Protected Status under Sec. 244.4 or 
inadmissible under Sec. 244.3(c), the decision shall include a charging 
document which sets forth such ground(s).
    (2) If such a charging document is issued, the alien shall not have 
the right to appeal the director's decision denying Temporary Protected 
Status as provided in this subsection. The decision shall also apprise 
the alien of his or her right to a de novo determination of his or her 
eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in deportation or exclusion 
proceedings pursuant to Secs. 240.11 and 244.18.
    (d) Decision by AAU. The decision of the AAU shall be in writing 
served in person, or by mail to the alien's most recent address provided 
to the Service, and, if the appeal is dismissed, the decision shall 
state the reason(s) for the denial.
    (1) If the appeal is dismissed by the AAU under Sec. 240.18(b), the 
decision shall also apprise the alien of his or her right to a de novo 
determination of eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in 
deportation or exclusion proceedings.
    (2) If the appeal is dismissed by the AAU, the district director may 
issue a charging document if no charging document is presently filed 
with the Immigration Court.
    (3) If a charging document has previously been filed or is pending 
before the Immigration Court, either party may move to recalendar the 
case after the decision by the AAU.
    (e) Grant of temporary treatment benefits. (1) Temporary treatment 
benefits shall be evidenced by the issuance of an employment 
authorization document. The alien shall be given, in English and in the 
language of the designated foreign state or a language that the alien 
understands, a notice of the registration requirements for Temporary 
Protected Status and a notice of the following benefits:
    (i) Temporary stay of deportation; and
    (ii) Temporary employment authorization.
    (2) Unless terminated under Sec. 244.13, temporary treatment 
benefits shall remain in effect until a final decision has been made on 
the application for Temporary Protected Status.
    (f) Grant of temporary protected status. (1) The decision to grant 
Temporary Protected Status shall be evidenced by the issuance of an 
alien registration document. For those aliens requesting employment 
authorization, the employment authorization document will act as alien 
registration.

[[Page 447]]

    (2) The alien shall be provided with a notice, in English and in the 
language of the designated foreign state or a language that the alien 
understands, of the following benefits:
    (i) The alien shall not be deported while maintaining Temporary 
Protected Status;
    (ii) Employment authorization;
    (iii) The privilege to travel abroad with the prior consent of the 
district director as provided in Sec. 244.15;
    (iv) For the purposes of adjustment of status under section 245 of 
the Act and change of status under section 248 of the Act, the alien is 
considered as being in, and maintaining, lawful status as a nonimmigrant 
while the alien maintains Temporary Protected Status.
    (v) An alien eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status under 
Sec. 244.2(f)(2), who was prevented from filing a late application for 
registration because the regulations failed to provide him or her with 
this opportunity, will be considered to have been maintaining lawful 
status as a nonimmigrant until the benefit is granted.
    (3) The benefits contained in the notice are the only benefits the 
alien is entitled to under Temporary Protected Status.
    (4) Such notice shall also advise the alien of the following:
    (i) The alien must remain eligible for Temporary Protected Status;
    (ii) The alien must register annually with the District Office 
having jurisdiction over the alien's place of residence; and
    (iii) The alien's failure to comply with paragraphs (f)(4) (i) or 
(ii) of this section will result in the withdrawal of Temporary 
Protected Status, including work authorization granted under this 
Program, and may result in the alien's deportation from the United 
States.

Sec. 244.11  Renewal of application; appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

    If a charging document is served on the alien with a notice of 
denial or withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status, an alien may renew 
the application for Temporary Protected Status in deportation or 
exclusion proceedings. The decision of the immigration judge as to 
eligibility for Temporary Protected Status may be appealed to the Board 
of Immigration Appeals pursuant to Sec. 3.3 of this chapter. The 
provisions of this section do not extend the benefits of Temporary 
Protected Status beyond the termination of a foreign state's designation 
pursuant to Sec. 244.19.

extensions of such period) or twelve (12) months, whichever is shorter.
    (b) If the alien's Temporary Protected Status is withdrawn under 
Sec. 244.14, employment authorization expires upon notice of withdrawal 
or on the date stated on the employment authorization document, 
whichever occurs later.
    (c) If Temporary Protected Status is denied by the INS, employment 
authorization shall terminate upon notice of denial or at the expiration 
of the employment authorization document, whichever occurs later.
    (d) If the application is renewed or appealed in deportation or 
exclusion proceedings, or appealed to the Administrative Appeals Unit 
pursuant to Sec. 244.18(b), employment authorization will be extended 
during the pendency of the renewal and/or appeal.

Sec. 244.14  Withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status.

    (a) Authority of director. The director may withdraw the status of 
an alien granted Temporary Protected Status under section 244 of the Act 
at any time upon the occurrence of any of the following:
    (1) The alien was not in fact eligible at the time such status was 
granted, or at any time thereafter becomes ineligible for such status;
    (2) The alien has not remained continuously physically present in 
the United States from the date the alien was first granted Temporary 
Protected Status under this part. For the purpose of this provision, an 
alien granted Temporary Protected Status under this part shall be deemed 
not to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the 
United States if the alien departs the United States after first 
obtaining permission from the district director to travel pursuant to 
Sec. 244.15;
    (3) The alien fails without good cause to register with the Attorney 
General annually within thirty (30) days before the end of each 12-month 
period after the granting of Temporary Protected Status.
    (b) Decision by director. (1) Withdrawal of an alien's status under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be in writing and served by personal 
service pursuant to Sec. 103.5(a) of this chapter. If the ground for 
withdrawal is Sec. 240.14(a)(3), the notice shall provide that the alien 
has thirty (30) days within which to provide evidence of good cause for 
failure to register. If the alien fails to respond within thirty (30) 
days, Temporary Protected Status shall be withdrawn without further 
notice.
    (2) Withdrawal of the alien's Temporary Protected Status under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section may subject the applicant to exclusion 
or deportation proceedings under sections 235, 236, 237, 238, 240, or 
241 of the Act as appropriate.
    (3) If the basis for the withdrawal of Temporary Protected Status 
constitutes a ground of deportability or excludability which renders an 
alien ineligible for Temporary Protected Status under Sec. 244.4 or 
inadmissible under Sec. 244.3(c), the decision shall include a charging 
document which sets forth such ground(s) with notice of the right of a 
de novo determination of eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in 
deportation or exclusion proceedings. If the basis for withdrawal does 
not constitute such a ground, the alien shall be given written notice of 
his or her right to appeal to the AAU. Upon receipt of an appeal, the 
administrative record will be forwarded to the AAU for review and 
decision pursuant to the authority delegated under Sec. 103.1(f)(2). 
Temporary Protected Status benefits will be extended during the pendency 
of an appeal.
    (c) Decision by AAU. If a decision to withdraw Temporary Protected 
Status is entered by the AAU, the AAU shall notify the alien of the 
decision and the right to a de novo determination of eligibility for 
Temporary Protected Status in deportation or exclusion proceedings, if 
the alien is then deportable or excludable, as provided by 
Sec. 244.10(d).

Sec. 244.15  Travel abroad.

    (a) After the grant of Temporary Protected Status, the alien must 
remain continuously physically present in the United States under the 
provisions of section 244(c)(3)(B) of the Act. The grant of Temporary 
Protected Status shall not constitute permission to travel abroad. 
Permission to travel may be granted by the district director pursuant to 
the Service's advance parole provisions. There is no appeal from a 
denial of advance parole.
    (b) Failure to obtain advance parole prior to the alien's departure 
from the United States may result in the withdrawal of Temporary 
Protected Status and/or the institution or recalendering

[[Page 449]]

of deportation or exclusion proceedings against the alien.

Sec. 244.16  Confidentiality.

    The information contained in the application and supporting 
documents submitted by an alien shall not be released in any form 
whatsoever to a third party requester without a court order, or the 
written consent of the alien. For the purpose of this provision, a third 
party requester means any requester other than the alien, his or her 
authorized representative, an officer of the Department of Justice, or 
any federal or State law enforcement agency. Any information provided 
under this part may be used for purposes of enforcement of the Act or in 
any criminal proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 244.17  Annual registration.

    (a) Aliens granted Temporary Protected Status must register annually 
with the INS designated office having jurisdiction over their place of 
residence. Such registration will apply to nationals of those foreign 
states designated or redesignated for more than one year by the Attorney 
General pursuant to section 244(b) of the Act. Registration may be 
accomplished by mailing or submitting in person, depending on the 
practice in place at the INS designated office, completed Forms I-821 
and I-765 within the thirty (30) day period prior to the anniversary of 
the grant of Temporary Protected Status (inclusive of such anniversary 
date). Form I-821 will be filed without fee. Form I-765 will be filed 
with fee only if the alien is requesting employment authorization. 
Completing the block on the I-821 attesting to the continued maintenance 
of the conditions of eligibility will generally preclude the need for 
supporting documents or evidence. The Service, however, reserves the 
right to request additional information and/or documentation on a case-
by-case basis.
    (b) Unless the Service determines otherwise, registration by mail 
shall suffice to meet the alien's registration requirements. However, as 
part of the registration process, an alien will generally have to appear 
in person in order to secure a renewal of employment authorization 
unless the Service determines that employment authorization will be 
extended in another fashion due to operational need. The Service may 
also request that an alien appear in person as part of the registration 
process. In such cases, failure to appear without good cause shall be 
deemed a failure to register under this chapter.
    (c) Failure to register without good cause will result in the 
withdrawal of the alien's Temporary Protected Status.

Sec. 244.18  Issuance of charging documents; detention.

    (a) A charging document may be issued against an alien granted 
Temporary Protected Status on grounds of deportability or excludability 
which would have rendered the alien statutorily ineligible for such 
status pursuant to Secs. 244.3(c) and 244.4. Aliens shall not be 
deported for a particular offense for which the Service has expressly 
granted a waiver. If the alien is deportable on a waivable ground, and 
no such waiver for the charged offense has been previously granted, then 
the alien may seek such a waiver in deportation or exclusion 
proceedings. The charging document shall constitute notice to the alien 
that his or her status in the United States is subject to withdrawal. A 
final order of deportation or exclusion against an alien granted 
Temporary Protected Status shall constitute a withdrawal of such status.
    (b) The filing of the charging document by the Service with the 
Immigration Court renders inapplicable any other administrative, 
adjudication or review of eligibility for Temporary Protected Status. 
The alien shall have the right to a de novo determination of his or her 
eligibility for Temporary Protected Status in the deportation or 
exclusion proceedings. Review by the Board of Immigration Appeals shall 
be the exclusive administrative appellate

[[Page 450]]

review procedure. If an appeal is already pending before the 
Administrative Appeals Unit, the district director shall notify the 
Administrative Appeals Unit of the filing of the charging document, in 
which case the pending appeal shall be dismissed and the record of 
proceeding returned to the district where the charging document was 
filed.
    (c) Upon denial of Temporary Protected Status by the Administrative 
Appeals Unit, the Administrative Appeals Unit shall immediately forward 
the record of proceeding to the director having jurisdiction over the 
alien's place of residence. The director shall, as soon as practicable, 
file a charging document with the Immigration Court if the alien is then 
deportable or excludable under section 241(a) or section 212(a) of the 
Act, respectively.
    (d) An alien who is determined by the Service to be deportable or 
excludable upon grounds which would have rendered the alien ineligible 
for such status as provided in Secs. 240.3(c) and 240.4 may be detained 
under the provisions of this chapter pending deportation or exclusion 
proceedings. Such alien may be removed from the United States upon entry 
of a final order of deportation or exclusion.

Sec. 244.19  Termination of designation.

    Upon the termination of designation of a foreign state, those 
nationals afforded temporary Protected Status shall, upon the sixtieth 
(60th) day after the date notice of termination is published in the 
Federal Register, or on the last day of the most recent extension of 
designation by the Attorney General, automatically and without further 
notice or right of appeal, lose Temporary Protected Status in the United 
States. Such termination of a foreign state's designation is not subject 
to appeal.

Sec. 244.20  Waiver of fees.

    (a) Any of the fees prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b) which relate to 
applications to the district director or service center director for 
Temporary Protected Status may be waived if the applicant establishes 
that he or she is unable to pay the prescribed fee. The applicant will 
have established his or her inability to pay when the adjudicating 
officer concludes, on the basis of the requisite affidavit and of any 
other information submitted, that it is more probable than not that:
    (1) The applicant's gross income from all sources for the three-
month period prior to the filing of the fee waiver request, including 
income received or earned by any dependent in the United States, was 
equaled or exceeded by essential expenditures for such three-month 
period; and
    (2) The applicant does not own, possess, or control assets 
sufficient to pay the fee without substantial hardship.
    (b) For purposes of this section, essential expenditures are limited 
to reasonable expenditures for rent, utilities, food, transportation to 
and from employment, and any essential extraordinary expenditures, such 
as essential medical expenses, or expenses for clothing, laundry, and 
child care, to the extent that the applicant can show that those 
expenditures made during the three-month period prior to the filing of 
the fee waiver request were reasonable and essential to his or her 
physical well-being or to earning a livelihood.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the TPS registration fee 
(including the fee for employment authorization, if applicable) shall be 
considered an essential expenditure. A fee waiver will be granted if the 
sum of the fees for TPS registration and employment authorization equals 
or exceeds income and assets that remain after deducting other essential 
expenditures.
    (d) If an adjudicating officer is satisfied that an applicant has 
established inability to pay, he or she shall not deny a fee waiver due 
to the cost of administering the TPS program.
    (e) For purposes of this section, the following documentation shall 
be required:

[[Page 451]]

    (1) The applicant seeking a fee waiver must submit an affidavit, 
under penalty of perjury, setting forth information to establish that he 
or she satisfies the requirements of this section. The affidavit shall 
individually list:
    (i) The applicant's monthly gross income from each source for each 
of the three months prior to the filing of the fee waiver request;
    (ii) All assets owned, possessed, or controlled by the applicant or 
by his or her dependents;
    (iii) The applicant's essential monthly expenditures, itemized for 
each of the three months prior to the filing of the fee waiver request, 
including essential extraordinary expenditures; and
    (iv) The applicant's dependents in the United States, his or her 
relationship to those dependents, the dependents' ages, any income 
earned or received by those dependents, and the street address of each 
dependent's place of residence.
    (2) The applicant may also submit other documentation tending to 
substantiate his or her inability to pay.
    (f) If the adjudicating officer concludes based upon the totality of 
their circumstances that the information presented in the affidavit and 
in any other additional documentation is inaccurate or insufficient, the 
adjudicating officer may require that the applicant submit the following 
additional documents prior to the adjudication of a fee waiver:
    (1) The applicant's employment records, pay stubs, W-2 forms, 
letter(s) from employer(s), and proof of filing of a local, state, or 
federal income tax return. The same documents may also be required from 
the applicant's dependents in the United States.
    (2) The applicant's rent receipts, bills for essential utilities 
(for example, gas, electricity, telephone, water), food, medical 
expenses, and receipts for other essential expenditures.
    (3) Documentation to show all assets owned, possessed, or controlled 
by the applicant or by dependents of the applicant.
    (4) Evidence of the applicant's living arrangements in the United 
States (living with relative, living in his or her own house or 
apartment, etc.), and evidence of whether his or her spouse, children, 
or other dependents are residing in his or her household in the United 
States.
    (5) Evidence of the applicant's essential extraordinary expenditures 
or those of his or her dependents residing in the United States.
    (g) The adjudicating officer must consider the totality of the 
information submitted in each case before requiring additional 
information or rendering a final decision.
    (h) All documents submitted by the applicant or required by the 
adjudicating officer in support of a fee waiver request are subject to 
verification by the Service.
    (i) In requiring additional information, the adjudicating officer 
should consider that some applicants may have little or no documentation 
to substantiate their claims. An adjudicating officer may accept other 
evidence, such as an affidavit from a member of the community of good 
moral character, but only if the applicant provides an affidavit stating 
that more direct documentary evidence in unavailable.

adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident of the 
United States if the applicant is eligible to receive an immigrant visa

permanent resident alien under section 245 of the Act:

requirement, under that section. An alien who has been granted a waiver

Department of Health (or its equivalent) under Pub. L. 103-416 shall be

Act if the terms and conditions specified in section 214(k) of the Act 
and Sec. 212.7(c)(9) of this chapter have not been met;
    (3) Any alien who has nonimmigrant status under paragraph (15)(A), 
(15)(E), or (15)(G) of section 101(a) of the Act, or has an occupational 
status which would, if the alien were seeking admission to the United 
States, entitle the alien to nonimmigrant status under those paragraphs, 
unless the alien first executes and submits the written waiver required 
by section 247(b) of the Act and part 247 of this chapter;
    (4) Any alien who claims immediate relative status under section 
201(b) or preference status under sections 203(a) or 203(b) of the Act,

petition filed in accordance with part 204 of this chapter;
    (5) Any alien who is already an alien lawfully admitted to the 
United States for permanent residence on a conditional basis pursuant to 
section 216 or 216A of the Act, regardless of any other quota or non-
quota immigrant visa classification for which the alien may otherwise be 
eligible;
    (6) Any alien admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant fiance 
as defined in section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act, unless the alien is 
applying for adjustment of status based upon a marriage which was 
contracted within 90 days of entry with the United States citizen who 
filed a petition on behalf of the alien pursuant to Sec. 214.2(k) of 
this chapter;
    (7) A nonimmigrant classified pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of 
the Act, unless the nonimmigrant is applying for adjustment of status 
pursuant to the request of a law enforcement authority, the provisions 
of section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act, and 8 CFR 245.11;
    (8) Any arriving alien who is in removal proceedings pursuant to 
section 235(b)(1) or section 240 of the Act; and
    (9) Any alien who seeks to adjust status based upon a marriage which 
occurred on or after November 10, 1986, and while the alien was in 
exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, or judicial proceedings 
relating thereto.
    (i) Commencement of proceedings. The period during which the alien 
is in deportation, exclusion, or removal proceedings or judicial 
proceedings relating thereto, commences:
    (A) With the issuance of the Form I-221, Order to Show Cause and 
Notice of Hearing prior to June 20, 1991;
    (B) With the filing of a Form I-221, Order to Show Cause and Notice 
of Hearing, issued on or after June 20, 1991, with the Immigration 
Court;

[[Page 454]]

    (C) With the issuance of Form I-122, Notice to Applicant for 
Admission Detained for Hearing Before Immigration Judge, prior to April 
1, 1997,
    (D) With the filing of a Form I-862, Notice to Appear, with the 
Immigration Court, or
    (E) With the issuance and service of Form I-860, Notice and Order of 
Expedited Removal.
    (ii) Termination of proceedings. The period during which the alien 
is in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, or judicial 
proceedings relating thereto, terminates:
    (A) When the alien departs from the United States while an order of 
exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding or before the 
expiration of the voluntary departure time granted in connection with an 
alternate order of deportation or removal;
    (B) When the alien is found not to be inadmissible or deportable 
from the United States;
    (C) When the Form I-122, I-221, I-860, or I-862 is canceled;
    (D) When proceedings are terminated by the immigration judge or the 
Board of Immigration Appeals; or
    (E) When a petition for review or an action for habeas corpus is 
granted by a Federal court on judicial review.
    (iii) Exemptions. This prohibition shall no longer apply if:
    (A) The alien is found not to be inadmissible or deportable from the 
United States;
    (B) Form I-122, I-221, I-860, or I-862, is canceled;
    (C) Proceedings are terminated by the immigration judge or the Board 
of Immigration Appeals;
    (D) A petition for review or an action for habeas corpus is granted 
by a Federal court on judicial review;
    (E) The alien has resided outside the United States for 2 or more 
years following the marriage; or
    (F) The alien establishes the marriage is bona fide by providing 
clear and convincing evidence that the marriage was entered into in good 
faith and in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage 
took place, was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the 
alien's entry as an immigrant, and no fee or other consideration was 
given (other than to an attorney for assistance in preparation of a 
lawful petition) for the filing of a petition.
    (iv) Request for exemption. No application or fee is required to 
request the exemption under section 245(e) of the Act. The request must 
be made in writing and submitted with the Form I-485. Application for 
Permanent Residence. The request must state the basis for requesting 
consideration for the exemption and must be supported by documentary 
evidence establishing eligibility for the exemption.
    (v) Evidence to establish eligibility for the bona fide marriage 
exemption. Section 204(g) of the Act provides that certain visa 
petitions based upon marriages entered into during deportation, 
exclusion or related judicial proceedings may be approved only if the 
petitioner provides clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is 
bona fide. Evidence that a visa petition based upon the same marriage 
was approved under the bona fide marriage exemption to section 204(g) of 
the Act will be considered primary evidence of eligibility for the bona 
fide marriage exemption provided in this part. The applicant will not be 
required to submit additional evidence to qualify for the bona fide 
marriage exemption provided in this part, unless the district director 
determines that such additional evidence is needed. In cases where the 
district director notifies the applicant that additional evidence is 
required, the applicant must submit documentary evidence which clearly 
and convincingly establishes that the marriage was entered into in good 
faith and not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien's 
entry as an immigrant. Such evidence may include:
    (A) Documentation showing joint ownership of property;
    (B) Lease showing joint tenancy of a common residence;
    (C) Documentation showing commingling of financial resources;
    (D) Birth certificates of children born to the applicant and his or 
her spouse;
    (E) Affidavits of third parties having knowledge of the bona fides 
of the marital relationship, or
    (F) Other documentation establishing that the marriage was not 
entered into

[[Page 455]]

in order to evade the immigration laws of the United States.
    (vi) Decision. An application for adjustment of status filed during 
the prohibited period shall be denied, unless the applicant establishes 
eligibility for an exemption from the general prohibition.
    (vii) Denials. The denial of an application for adjustment of status 
because the marriage took place during the prohibited period shall be 
without prejudice to the consideration of a new application or a motion 
to reopen a previously denied application, if deportation or exclusion 
proceedings are terminated while the alien is in the United States. The 
denial shall also be without prejudice to the consideration of a new 
application or motion to reopen the adjustment of status application, if 
the applicant presents clear and convincing evidence establishing 
eligibility for the bona fide marriage exemption contained in this part.
    (viii) Appeals. An application for adjustment of status to lawful 
permanent resident which is denied by the district director solely 
because the applicant failed to establish eligibility for the bona fide 
marriage exemption contained in this part may be appealed to the 
Associate Commissioner, Examinations, in accordance with 8 CFR part 103. 
The appeal to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations, shall be the 
single level of appellate review established by statute.
    (d) Definitions--(1) Lawful immigration status. For purposes of 
section 245(c)(2) of the Act, the term ``lawful immigration status'' 
will only describe the immigration status of an individual who is:
    (i) In lawful permanent resident status;
    (ii) An alien admitted to the United States in nonimmigrant status 
as defined in section 101(a)(15) of the Act, whose initial period of 
admission has not expired or whose nonimmigrant status has been extended 
in accordance with part 214 of this chapter;
    (iii) In refugee status under section 207 of the Act, such status 
not having been revoked;
    (iv) In asylee status under section 208 of the Act, such status not 
having been revoked;
    (v) In parole status which has not expired, been revoked or 
terminated; or
    (vi) Eligible for the benefits of Public Law 101-238 (the 
Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989) and files an application for 
adjustment of status on or before October 17, 1991.
    (2) No fault of the applicant or for technical reasons. The 
parenthetical phrase other than through no fault of his or her own or 
for technical reasons shall be limited to:
    (i) Inaction of another individual or organization designated by 
regulation to act on behalf of an individual and over whose actions the 
individual has no control, if the inaction is acknowledged by that 
individual or organization (as, for example, where a designated school 
official certified under Sec. 214.2(f) of this chapter or an exchange 
propram sponsor under Sec. 214.2(j) of this chapter did not provide 
required notification to the Service of continuation of status, or did 
not forward a request for continuation of status to the Service); or
    (ii) A technical violation resulting from inaction of the Service 
(as for example, where an applicant establishes that he or she properly 
filed a timely request to maintain status and the Service has not yet 
acted on that request). An individual whose refugee or asylum status has 
expired through passage of time, but whose status has not been revoked, 
will be considered to have gone out of status for a technical reason.
    (iii) A technical violation caused by the physical inability of the 
applicant to request an extension of nonimmigrant stay from the Service 
either in person or by mail (as, for example, an individual who is 
hospitalized with an illness at the time nonimmigrant stay expires). The 
explanation of such a technical violation shall be accompanied by a 
letter explaining the circumstances from the hospital or attending 
physician.
    (iv) A technical violation resulting from the Service's application 
of the maximum five/six year period of stay for certain H-1 nurses only 
if the applicant was subsequently reinstated to H-1 status in accordance 
with the terms of Public Law 101-656 (Immigration Amendments of 1988).

[[Page 456]]

    (3) Effect of departure. The departure and subsequent reentry of an 
individual who was employed without authorization in the United States 
after January 1, 1977 does not erase the bar to adjustment of status in 
section 245(c)(2) of the Act. Similarly, the departure and subsequent 
reentry of an individual who has not maintained a lawful immigration 
status on any previous entry into the United States does not erase the 
bar to adjustment of status in section 245(c)(2) of the Act for any 
application filed on or after November 6, 1986.
    (e) Special categories--(1) Alien medical graduates. Any alien who 
is a medical graduate qualified for special immigrant classification 
under section 101(a)(27)(H) of the Act and is the beneficiary of an 
approved petition as required under section 204(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Act 
is eligible for adjustment of status. An accompanying spouse and 
children also may apply for adjustment of status under this section. 
Temporary absences from the United States for 30 days or less, during 
which the applicant was practicing or studying medicine, do not 
interrupt the continuous presence requirement. Temporary absences 
authorized under the Service's advance parole procedures will not be 
considered interruptive of continuous presence when the alien applies 
for adjustment of status.
    (2) Adjustment of certain nurses who were in H-1 nonimmigrant status 
on September 1, 1989 (Pub. L. 101-238)--(i) Eligibility. An alien is 
eligible to apply for adjustment of status without regard to the 
numerical limitations of sections 201 and 202 of the Act if:
    (A) The applicant was admitted to the United States in, or had been 
granted a change of status to, nonimmigrant status under section 
101(a)(15)(H)(i) of the Act on or before September 1, 1989, to perform 
services as a registered nurse (regardless of the date upon which the 
applicant's authorization to remain in the United States expired or will 
expire), and the applicant had not thereafter been granted a change to 
status to any other nonimmigrant classification prior to September 1, 
1989,
    (B) The applicant has been employed in the United States as a 
registered nurse for an aggregate of three years prior to the date of 
application for adjustment of status,
    (C) The applicant's continued employment as a registered nurse meets 
the standards established for certification described in section 
212(a)(5)(A)(i) of the Act,
    (D) The applicant is the beneficiary of:
    (1) A valid, unexpired visa petition filed prior to October 1, 1991, 
which has been approved to grant the applicant preference status under 
section 202(a) (3) or (6) of the Act (as in effect prior to October 1, 
1991), and is deemed by operation of the automatic conversion provisions 
of section 4 of Public Law 102-110 (the Armed Forces Immigration 
Adjustment Act of 1991), to be effective to grant the applicant 
preference status under section 203(b) (2) or (3) of the Act (as in 
effect on and after October 1, 1991) because of his or here occupation 
as a registered nurse, provided the application for adjustment of status 
is approved no later than October 1, 1993, or
    (2) A valid, unexpired visa petition filed on or after October 1, 
1991, which has been approved to grant the applicant preference, status 
under section 203(b) (1), (2), or (3) of this Act (as in effect on and 
after October 1, 1991) because of his or her occupation as a registered 
nurse, and
    (E) The applicant properly files an application for adjustment of 
status under the provisions of section 245 of the Act.
    (ii) Application period. To benefit from the provisions of Public 
Law 101-238, an alien must properly file an application for adjustments 
of status under section 245 of the Act on or before March 20, 1995.
    (iii) Application. An applicant for the benefits of Public Law 101-
238 must file an application for adjustment of status on Form I-485, 
accompanied by the fee and supporting documents described in Sec. 245.2 
of this part. Beneficiaries of Public Law 101-238 must also submit:
    (A) Evidence that the applicant is the beneficiary of:
    (1) A valid, unexpired visa petition filed prior to October 1, 1991, 
which has been approved to grant the applicant preference status under 
section 203(a)

[[Page 457]]

(3) or (6) of the Act (as in effect prior to October 1, 1991) and is 
deemed by operation of the automatic conversion provisions of section 4 
of Public Law 101-110 to be effective to grant the applicant preference 
status under section 203(b) (2) or (3) of the Act (as in effect on and 
after October 1, 1991) because of his or her occupation as a registered 
nurse, provided the application for adjustment of status is approved no 
later than October 1, 1993, or
    (2) A valid, unexpired visa petition filed on or after October 1, 
1991, which has been approved to grant the applicant preference status 
under section 203(b) (1), (2), or (3) of the Act (as in effect on and 
after October 1, 1991) because of his or her occupation as a registered 
nurse, and

    (B) A request, made on Form ETA 750 submitted in duplicate, for a 
determination by the district director that the alien is qualified for 
and will engage in the occupation of registered nurse, as currently 
listed on Schedule A (20 CFR part 656),
    (C) Evidence showing that the applicant has been employed in the 
United States as a registered nurse for an aggregate of three years 
prior to the date the application for adjustment of status is filed, in 
the form of:
    (1) Letters from employers stating the beginning and ending dates of 
employment as a registered nurse, or
    (2) Other evidence of employment as a registered nurse, such as pay 
receipts supported by affidavits of co-workers, which is accompanied by 
evidence that the nurse has made reasonable efforts to obtain employment 
letter(s), but has been unable to do so because the current or former 
employer refuses to issue the letter or has gone out of business,
    (D) Evidence that the applicant was licensed, either temporarily or 
permanently, as a registered nurse during all periods of qualifying 
employment, and
    (E) Evidence which establishes that the applicant was in the United 
States in H-1 nonimmigrant status for the purpose of performing services 
as a registered nurse on September 1, 1989.
    (iv) Effect of section 245(c)(2). An applicant for the benefits of 
the adjustment of status provisions of Public Law 101-238 must establish 
eligibility for adjustment of status under all provisions of section 245 
unless those provisions have specifically been waived.
    (A) Application for adjustment of status filed on or before October 
17, 1991. An applicant who qualifies for the benefits of Public Law 101-
238, who properly files an application for adjustment of status on or 
before October 17, 1991, may be granted adjustment of status even though 
the alien has engaged or is engaging in unauthorized employment. For 
purposes of adjustment of status, the applicant will be considered to 
have continuously maintained a lawful nonimmigrant status throughout his 
or her stay in the United States as a nonimmigrant and to be in lawful 
nonimmigrant status at the time the application is filed.
    (B) Application for adjustment of status filed after October 17, 
1991. An alien who files an application for adjustment of status after 
October 17, 1991, will not automatically be considered as having 
maintained lawful nonimmigrant status. An alien who files for adjustment 
after this date will be subject to the statutory bar of section 
245(c)(2) of the Act and will be ineligible to apply for adjustment of 
status if he or she has failed to continuously maintain lawful 
nonimmigrant status (other than through no fault of his or her own or 
for technical reasons); if he or she was not in lawful nonimmigrant 
status at the time the application was filed; or if he or she was 
employed without authorization on or after November 29, 1990. 
Unauthorized employment which has been waived as a basis for 
ineligibility for adjustment of status may not be used as the basis of a 
determination that the applicant is ineligible for adjustment of status 
due to failure to continuously maintain lawful nonimmigrant status.
    (C) Motions to reopen. Public Law 101-649 (the Immigration Act of 
1990), which became law on November 29, 1990, retroactively amended 
Public Law 101-238 (the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989). An 
alien whose application for adjustment of status under the provisions of 
Public Law 101-238

[[Page 458]]

was denied by the district director before November 29, 1990, because of 
unauthorized employment, failure to continuously maintain a lawful 
nonimmigrant status, or not being in lawful immigration status at the 
time of filing, may file a motion to reopen the adjustment application. 
The motion to reopen must be made in accordance with the provisions of 8 
CFR 103.5. The district director will reopen the application for 
adjustment of status and enter a new decision based upon the provisions 
of Public Law 101-238, as amended by Public Law 101-649. Any other alien 
whose application for adjustment of status was denied may file a motion 
to reopen or reconsider in accordance with normal statutory and 
regulatory provisions.
    (v) Description of qualifying employment. Qualifying employment as a 
registered nurse may have taken place at any time before the alien files 
the application for adjustment of status. It may have occurred before, 
on, or after the enactment of Public Law 101-238. All qualifying 
employment must have occurred in the United States. The qualifying 
employment as a registered nurse may have occurred while the alien was 
in any immigration status, provided that the alien had been admitted in 
or changed to H-1 status for the purpose of performing services as a 
registered nurse on or before September 1, 1989, and had not thereafter 
changed from H-1 status to any other status before September 1, 1989. 
The employment need not have been continuous, provided the applicant can 
establish that he or she engaged in qualifying employment for a total of 
three or more years. Qualifying employment may include periods when the 
applicant possessed a provisional, temporary, interim, or other permit 
or license authorizing the applicant to perform services as a registered 
nurse; provided the license or permit was issued or recognized by the 
State Board of Nursing of the state in which the employment was 
performed. Qualifying employment may not include periods when the 
applicant performed duties as a registered nurse in violation of any 
state law regulating the employment of registered nurses in that state.
    (vi) Effect of enactment on spouse or child--(A) Spouse or child 
accompanying principal alien. The accompanying spouse or child of an 
applicant for adjustment of status who benefits from Public Law 101-238, 
may also apply for adjustment of status. All benefits and limitations of 
this section, including those resulting from the implementation of the 
adjustment of status provisions of section 162(f) of Public Law 101-649, 
apply equally to the principal applicant and his or her accompanying 
spouse or child.
    (B) Spouse or child residing outside the United States or ineligible 
for adjustment of status. A spouse or child who is ineligible to apply 
for adjustment of status as an accompanying spouse or child is not 
immediately eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa under the 
provisions of Public Law 101-238. However, the spouse or child may be 
eligible for visa issuance under other provisions of the Act.
    (1) Existing relationship. A spouse or child acquired by the 
principal alien prior to the approval of the principal's adjustment of 
status application may be accorded the derivative priority date and 
preference category of the principal alien. The spouse or child may use 
the priority date and category when it becomes current, in accordance 
with existing limitations outlined in sections 201 and 202 of the Act. 
The priority date is not considered immediately available for these 
family members under Public Law 101-238.
    (2) Relationship entered into after adjustment of status is 
approved. An alien who acquires lawful permanent residence under the 
provisions of Public Law 101-238 may file a petition under section 204 
of the Act for an alien spouse, unmarried son or unmarried daughter in 
accordance with existing laws and regulations. The priority date is not 
considered immediately available for these family members under Public 
Law 101-238.
    (3) Special immigrant juveniles. Any alien qualified for special 
immigrant classification under section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act shall be 
deemed, for the purpose of section 245(a) of the Act, to have been 
paroled into the United States, regardless of the alien's actual method 
of entry into the United

[[Page 459]]

States. Neither the provisions of section 245(c)(2) nor the exclusion 
provisions of sections 212(a)(4), (5)(A), or (7)(A) of the Act shall 
apply to a qualified special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(J) of 
the Act. The exclusion provisions of sections 212(a)(2)(A), (2)(B), 
(2)(C) (except for so much of such paragraph as related to a single 
offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana), (3)(A), 
(3)(B), (3)(C), or (3)(E) of the Act may not be waived. Any other 
exclusion provision may be waived on an individual basis for 
humanitarian purposes, family unity, or when it is otherwise in the 
public interest; however, the relationship between the alien and the 
alien's natural parents or prior adoptive parents shall not be 
considered a factor in a discretionary waiver determination.
    (f) Concurrent applications to overcome grounds of inadmissibility. 
Except as provided in 8 CFR parts 235 and 249, an application under this 
part shall be the sole method of requesting the exercise of discretion 
under sections 212(g), (h), (i), and (k) of the Act, as they relate to 
the inadmissibility of an alien in the United States. No fee is required 
for filing an application to overcome the grounds of inadmissibility of 
the Act if filed concurrently with an application for adjustment of 
status under the provisions of the Act of October 28, 1977, and of this 
part.
    (g) Availability of immigrant visas under section 245 and priority 
dates--(1) Availability of immigrant visas under section 245. An alien 
is ineligible for the benefits of section 245 of the Act unless an 
immigrant visa is immediately available to him or her at the time the 
application is filed. If the applicant is a preference alien, the 
current Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Bulletin 
will be consulted to determine whether an immigrant visa is immediately 
available. An immigrant visa is considered available for accepting and 
processing the application Form I-485 if the preference category 
applicant has a priority date on the waiting list which is earlier than 
the date shown in the Bulletin (or the Bulletin shows that numbers for 
visa applicants in his or her category are current), and (if the 
applicant is seeking status pursuant to section 203(b) of the Act) the 
applicant presents evidence that the appropriate petition filed on his 
or her behalf has been approved. An immigrant visa is also considered 
immediately available if the applicant establishes eligibility for the 
benefits of Public Law 101-238. Information concerning the immediate 
availability of an immigrant visa may be obtained at any Service office.
    (2) Priority dates. The priority date of an applicant who is seeking 
the allotment of an immigrant visa number under one of the preference 
classes specified in section 203(a) or 203(b) of the Act by virtue of a 
valid visa petition approved in his or her behalf shall be fixed by the 
date on which such approved petition was filed.
    (h) Conditional basis of status. Whenever an alien spouse (as 
defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act), an alien son or daughter (as 
defined in section 216(g)(2) of the Act), an alien entrepreneur (as 
defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), or an alien spouse or child 
(as defined in section 216A(f)(2) of the Act) is granted adjustment of 
status to that of lawful permanent residence, the alien shall be 
considered to have obtained such status on a conditional basis subject 
to the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, as appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 245.2  Application.

    (a) General--(1) Jurisdiction. An alien who believes he or she meets 
the eligibility requirements of section 245 of the Act or section 1 of 
the Act of November 2, 1966, and Sec. 245.1 shall apply to the director 
having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence unless otherwise 
instructed in 8 CFR part 245, or by the instruction on the application 
form. After an alien, other than an arriving alien, is in deportation or 
removal proceedings, his or her application for adjustment of status 
under

[[Page 460]]

section 245 of the Act or section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966 shall 
be made and considered only in those proceedings. An arriving alien, 
other than an alien in removal proceedings, who believes he or she meets 
the eligibility requirements of section 245 of the Act or section 1 of 
the Act of November 2, 1966, and Sec. 245.1 shall apply to the director 
having jurisdiction over his or her place of arrival. An adjustment 
application by an alien paroled under section 212(d)(5) of the Act, 
which has been denied by the director, may be renewed in removal 
proceedings under 8 CFR part 240 only if:
    (i) The denied application must have been properly filed subsequent 
to the applicant's earlier inspection and admission to the United 
States; and
    (ii) The applicant's later absence from and return to the United 
States was under the terms of an advance parole authorization on Form I-
512 granted to permit the applicant's absence and return to pursue the 
previously filed adjustment application.
    (2) Proper filing of application--(i) Under section 245. Before an 
application for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act may be 
considered properly filed, a visa must be immediately available. If a 
visa would be immediately available upon approval of a visa petition, 
the application will not be considered properly filed unless such 
petition has first been approved. If an immediate relative petition 
filed for classification under section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Act or a 
preference petition filed for classification under section 203(a) of the 
Act is submitted simultaneously with the adjustment application, the 
adjustment application shall be retained for processing only if approval 
of the visa petition would make a visa immediately available at the time 
of filing the adjustment application. If the visa petition is 
subsequently approved, the date of filing the adjustment application 
shall be deemed to be the date on which the accompanying petition was 
filed.
    (ii) Under the Act of November 2, 1966. An application for the 
benefits of section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966 is not properly 
filed unless the applicant was inspected and admitted or paroled into 
the United States subsequent to January 1, 1959. An applicant is 
ineligible for the benefits of the Act of November 2, 1966 unless he or 
she has been physically present in the United States for one year 
(amended from two years by the Refugee Act of 1980).
    (3) Submission of documents--(i) General. A separate application 
shall be filed by each applicant for benefits under section 245, or the 
Act of November 2, 1966. Each application shall be accompanied by an 
executed Form G-325A, if the applicant has reached his or her 14th 
birthday. Form G-325A shall be considered part of the application. An 
application under this part shall be accompanied by the document 
specified in the instructions which are attached to the application.
    (ii) Under section 245. An application for adjustment of status is 
submitted on Form I-485, Application for Permanent Residence. The 
application must be accompanied by the appropriate fee as explained in 
the instructions to the application.
    (iii) Under section 245(i). An alien who seeks adjustment of status 
under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act must file Form I-485, 
with the required fee. The alien must also file Supplement A to Form I-
485, with any required additional sum.
    (iv) Under the Act of November 2, 1966. An application for 
adjustment of status is made on Form I-485A. The application must be 
accompanied by Form I-643, Health and Human Services Statistical Data 
Sheet. The application must include a clearance from the local police 
jurisdiction for any area in the United States when the applicant has 
lived for six months or more since his or her 14th birthday.
    (4) Effect of departure--(i) General. The effect of a departure from 
the United States is dependent upon the law under which the applicant is 
applying for adjustment.
    (ii) Under section 245 of the Act. The departure from the United 
States of an applicant who is under exclusion, deportation, or removal 
proceedings shall be deemed an abandonment of the application 
constituting grounds for termination of the proceeding by reason of the 
departure. The departure of an applicant who is not under exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceedings

[[Page 461]]

shall be deemed an abandonment of his or her application constituting 
grounds for termination, unless the applicant was previously granted 
advance parole by the Service for such absence, and was inspected upon 
returning to the United States. If the application of an individual 
granted advance parole is subsequently denied, the applicant will be 
treated as an applicant for admission, and subject to the provisions of 
sections 212 and 235 of the Act.
    (iii) Under the Act of November 2, 1966. If an applicant who was 
admitted or paroled subsequent to January 1, 1959, later departs from 
the United States temporarily with no intention of abandoning his or her 
residence, and is readmitted or paroled upon return, the temporary 
absence shall be disregarded for purposes of the applicant's ``last 
arrival'' into the United States in regard to cases filed under section 
1 of the Act of November 2, 1966.
    (5) Decision--(i) General. The applicant shall be notified of the 
decision of the director and, if the application is denied, the reasons 
for the denial.
    (ii) Under section 245 of the Act. If the application is approved, 
the applicant's permanent residence shall be recorded as of the date of 
the order approving the adjustment of status. An application for 
adjustment of status, as a preference alien, shall not be approved until 
an immigrant visa number has been allocated by the Department of State, 
except when the applicant has established eligibility for the benefits 
of Public Law 101-238. No appeal lies from the denial of an application 
by the director, but the applicant, if not an arriving alien, retains 
the right to renew his or her application in proceedings under 8 CFR 
part 240. Also, an applicant who is a parolee and meets the two 
conditions described in Sec. 245.2(a)(1) may renew a denied application 
in proceedings under 8 CFR part 240 to determine admissibility. At the 
time of renewal of the application, an applicant does not need to meet 
the statutory requirement of section 245(c) of the Act, or 
Sec. 245.1(g), if, in fact, those requirements were met at the time the 
renewed application was initially filed with the director. Nothing in 
this section shall entitle an alien to proceedings under section 240 of 
the Act who is not otherwise so entitled.
    (iii) Under the Act of November 2, 1966. If the application is 
approved, the applicant's permanent residence shall be recorded in 
accordance with the provisions of section 1. No appeal lies from the 
denial of an application by the director, but the applicant, if not an 
arriving alien, retains the right to renew his or her application in 
proceedings under 8 CFR part 240. Also, an applicant who is a parolee 
and meets the two conditions described in Sec. 245.2(a)(1) may renew a 
denied application in proceedings under 8 CFR part 240 to determine 
admissibility.
    (b) Application under section 2 of the Act of November 2, 1966. An 
application by a native or citizen of Cuba or by his spouse or child 
residing in the United States with him, who was lawfully admitted to the 
United States for permanent residence prior to November 2, 1966, and who 
desires such admission to be recorded as of an earlier date pursuant to 
section 2 of the Act of November 2, 1966, shall be made on Form I-485A. 
The application shall be accompanied by the Permanent Resident Card, 
Form I-151 or I-551, issued to the applicant in connection with his 
lawful admission for permanent residence, and shall be submitted to the 
director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence in 
the United States. The decision on the application shall be made by the 
director. No appeal shall lie from his decision. If the application is 
approved, the applicant will be furnished with a replacement of his Form 
I-151 or I-551 bearing the new date as of which the lawful admission for 
permanent residence has been recorded.
    (c) Application under section 214(d) of the Act. An application for 
permanent resident status pursuant to section 214(d) of the Act shall be 
filed on Form I-485 with the director having jurisdiction over the 
applicant's place of residence. A separate application shall be filed by 
each applicant. If the application is approved, the director shall 
record the lawful admission of the applicant as of the date of approval. 
The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, if the application 
is denied, of the reasons therefor. No appeal shall lie from the denial 
of an application by

[[Page 462]]

the director but such denial shall be without prejudice to the alien's 
right to renew his or her application in proceedings under 8 CFR part 
240.

Sec. 245.3  Adjustment of status under section 13 of the Act of September 11, 1957, as amended.

    Any application for benefits under section 13 of the Act of 
September 11, 1957, as amended, must be filed on Form I-485 with the 
director having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence. 
The benefits under section 13 are limited to aliens who were admitted 
into the United States under section 101, paragraphs (a)(15)(A)(i), 
(a)(15)(A)(ii), (a)(15)(G)(i), or (a)(15)(G)(ii) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act who performed diplomatic or semi-diplomatic duties and 
to their immediate families, and who establish that there are compelling 
reasons why the applicant or the member of the applicant's immediate 
family is unable to return to the country represented by the government 
which accredited the applicant and that adjustment of the applicant's 
status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
would be in the national interest. Aliens whose duties were of a 
custodial, clerical, or menial nature, and members of their immediate 
families, are not eligible for benefits under section 13. In view of the 
annual limitation of 50 on the number of aliens whose status may be 
adjusted under section 13, any alien who is prima facie eligible for 
adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident under 
another provision of law shall be advised to apply for adjustment 
pursuant to such other provision of law. An applicant for the benefits 
of section 13 shall not be subject to the labor certification 
requirement of section 212(a)(14) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act. The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, if the 
application is denied, of the reasons for the denial and of the right to 
appeal under the provisions of part 103 of this chapter. Any 
applications pending with the Service before December 29, 1981 must be 
resubmitted to comply with the requirements of this section.

Sec. 245.5  Medical examination.

    Pursuant to section 232(b) of the Act, an applicant for adjustment 
of status shall be required to have a medical examination by a 
designated civil surgeon, whose report setting forth the findings of the 
mental and physical condition of the applicant, including compliance 
with section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, shall be incorporated into the 
record. A medical examination shall not be required of an applicant for 
adjustment of status who entered the United States as a non-immigrant 
fiance or fiancee of a United States citizen as defined in section 
101(a)(15)(K) of the Act pursuant to Sec. 214.2(k) of this chapter if 
the applicant was medically examined prior to, and as a condition of, 
the issuance of the nonimmigrant visa; provided that the medical 
examination must have occurred not more than one year prior to the date 
of application for adjustment of status. Any applicant certified under 
paragraphs (1)(A)(ii) or (1)(A)(iii) of section 212(a) of the Act may 
appeal to a Board of

[[Page 463]]

Medical Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as provided in

    Each applicant for adjustment of status under this part shall be 
interviewed by an immigration officer. This interview may be waived in 
the case of a child under the age of 14; when the applicant is clearly 
ineligible under section 245(c) of the Act or Sec. 245.1 of this 
chapter; or when it is determined by the Service that an interview is 
unnecessary.

Form I-643, Health and Human Services Statistical Data for Refugee/
Asylee Adjusting Status, and the results of a medical examination given 
in accordance with Sec. 245.8. In addition, if the applicant has reached 
his or her 14th birthday but is not over 79 years of age, the 
application shall be accompanied by a completed Form G-325A, Biographic 
Information, and the applicant shall be fingerprinted on Form FD-258, 
Applicant Card, as prescribed in Sec. 103.2(e) of this chapter.
    (b) Aliens eligible to apply for adjustment. The benefits of this 
section shall only apply to an alien who:

and
    (2) Was inspected and granted parole into the United States during 
the period beginning on August 15, 1988, and ending on September 30, 
1990, after being denied refugee status.
    (c) Eligibility. Benefits under Section 599E of Public Law 101-167 
are limited to any alien described in paragraph (b) of this section who:

under this section. The Attorney General may waive any other provision 
of section 212(a) (other than paragraph (23)(B), (27), (29), or (33)) 
with respect to such an adjustment for humanitarian purposes, to assure 
family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.
    (e) Date of approval. Upon approval of such an application for 
adjustment of status, the Attorney General shall create a record of the 
alien's admission as a lawful permanent resident as of the date of the 
alien's inspection and parole described in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (f) No offset in number of visas available. When an alien is granted 
the status of having been lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
under this section, the Secretary of State shall not be required to 
reduce the number of immigrant visas authorized to be issued under the

Sec. 245.8  Adjustment of status as a special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act.

    (a) Application. Each person applying for adjustment of status as a 
special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(K)

[[Page 464]]

of the Act must file a Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent 
Residence or Adjust Status, with the director having jurisdiction over 
the applicant's place of residence. Benefits under this section are 
limited to aliens who have served honorably (or are enlisted to serve) 
in the Armed Forces of the United States for at least 12 years, and 
their spouses and children. For purposes of this section, special 
immigrants described in section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act and his or her 
spouse and children shall be deemed to have been paroled into the United 
States pursuant to section 245(g) of the Act. Each applicant must file a 
separate application with the appropriate fee.
    (b) Eligibility. The benefits of this section shall apply only to an 
alien described in section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Act who applies for such 
adjustment. The accompanying spouse or child of an applicant for 
adjustment of status who benefits from Public Law 102-110 may also apply 
for adjustment of status. The provisions of section 245(c) of the Act do 
not apply to the principal Armed Forces special immigrant or to his or 
her spouse or child.
    (c) Interview of the applicant. Upon completion of the adjustment of 
status interview for a special immigrant under section 101(a)(27)(K) of 
the Act, the director shall make a prima facie determination regarding 
eligibility for naturalization benefits if the applicant is to be 
granted status as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. If 
the director determines that the applicant is immediately eligible for 
naturalization under section 328 or 329 of the Act, the director shall 
advise the applicant that he or she is eligible to apply for 
naturalization on Form N-400, Application to File Petition for 
Naturalization. If the applicant wishes to apply for naturalization, the 
director shall instruct the applicant concerning the requirements for 
naturalization and provide him or her with the necessary forms.
    (d) Spouse or child outside the United States. When a spouse or 
child of an alien granted special immigrant status under section 
101(a)(27)(K) of the Act is outside the United States, the principal 
alien may file Form I-824, Application for Action on an Approved 
Application or Petition, with the office which approved the original 
application.
    (e) Removal provisions of section 237 of the Act. If the Service is 
made aware by notification from the appropriate executive department or 
by any other means that a section 101(a)(27)(K) special immigrant who 
has already been granted permanent residence fails to complete his or 
her total active duty service obligation for reasons other than an 
honorable discharge, the alien may become subject to the removal 
provisions of section 237 of the Act, provided the alien is in one or 
more of the classes of deportable aliens specified in section 237 of the 
Act. The Service shall obtain a current Form DD-214, Certificate of 
Release or Discharge from Active Duty, from the appropriate executive 
department for verification of the alien's failure to maintain 
eligibility.
    (f) Rescission proceedings under section 246 of the Act. If the 
Service determines that a military special immigrant under section 
101(a)(27)(K) of the Act was not in fact eligible for adjustment of 
status, the Service may pursue rescission proceedings under section 246 
of the Act.

    (c) Qualified family member who is not a national of the People's 
Republic of China. A qualified family member within the meaning of this

the People's Republic of China who is eligible for benefits under the

Republic of China and the family member was unmarried and under the age 
of 21 on April 11, 1990.
    (d) Waivers of inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act. An 
applicant for the benefits of the adjustment of status provisions of 
Pub. L. 102-404 is automatically exempted from compliance with the 
requirements of sections 212(a)(5) and 212(a)(7)(A) of the Act. A Pub. 
L. 102-404 applicant may also apply for one or more waivers of 
inadmissibility under section 212(a) of the Act, except for 
inadmissibility under section 212(a)(2)(C), 212(a)(3)(A), 212(a)(3)(B), 
212(a)(3)(C) or 212(a)(3)(E) of the Act.
    (e) Waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of section

compliance with the two-year foreign residence requirement of section 
212(e) of the Act.
    (f) Waiver of section 245(c) of the Act. Public Law 102-404 provides

persons applying for the adjustment of status benefits of Public Law 
102-404.
    (g) Application. Each applicant must file an application for 
adjustment of status on Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent 
Residence or Adjust Status, accompanied by the prescribed fee, and the 
supporting documents specified on the instructions to Form I-485 and

applicant is unable to obtain the required primary evidence. Applicants 
who are nationals of the People's Republic of China should complete Part 
2 of Form I-485 by checking box ``h--other'' and writing ``CSPA--
Principal'' next to that block. Applicants who are not nationals of the 
People's Republic of China should complete Part 2 of Form I-485 by 
checking box ``h--other'' and writing ``CSPA--Qualified Family Member'' 
next to that block. Each applicant for the benefits of Public Law 102-
404 must also submit evidence of eligibility for the adjustment of 
status benefits of Public Law 102-404:
    (1) A photocopy of all pages of the applicant's most recent passport 
or an explanation of why the applicant does not have a passport;
    (2) An attachment on a plain piece of paper showing:
    (i) The date of the applicant's last arrival in the United States 
before or on April 11, 1990;
    (ii) The date of each departure the applicant made from the United 
States since that arrival (if the applicant did not depart the United 
States after the initial date of arrival, the applicant should write ``I 
was in the United States on April 11, 1990, and I have not departed the 
United States since April 11, 1990'');

[[Page 466]]

    (iii) The reason for each departure; and
    (iv) The date of each return to the United States.
    (3) An attachment on a plain piece of paper showing:
    (i) The date the applicant arrived in the People's Republic of 
China; and
    (ii) The date the applicant left the People's Republic of China for 
each trip the applicant made to the People's Republic of China between 
April 11, 1990, and October 9, 1992 (if the applicant did not travel to 
the People's Republic of China, the applicant should write ``I was not 
in the People's Republic of China between April 11, 1990, and October 9, 
1992'');
    (4) A copy of evidence showing that the applicant was found eligible 
for benefits under E.O. 12711, such as deferred enforced departure 
(DED), employment authorization, and/or waiver of the two-year foreign 
residence requirement, if the applicant previously applied for benefits 
under E.O. 12711; and
    (5) Primary or secondary evidence of a qualifying family 
relationship to an eligible national of the People's Republic of China, 
such as a birth or marriage certificate, if the applicant is a qualified 
family member who is not a national of the People's Republic of China.
    (h) Secondary evidence. If any required primary evidence is 
unavailable, church or school records, or other secondary evidence 
pertinent to the facts in issue, may be submitted. If such documents are 
unavailable, affidavits may be submitted. The applicant may submit as 
many types of secondary evidence as necessary to establish the birth, 
marriage, or other event. Documentary evidence establishing that primary 
evidence is unavailable need not accompany secondary evidence of birth 
or marriage in the People's Republic of China.
    (i) Filing. The application period begins on July 1, 1993. To 
benefit from the provisions of Public Law 102-404 (the Chinese Student 
Protection Act of 1992), an alien must properly file an application for 
adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act on or before June 30, 
1994. All applications for the benefits of Public Law 102-404 must be 
submitted by mail to the Service Center having jurisdiction over the 
applicant's place of residence in the United States. Pursuant to the 
deactivation clause of Public Law 102-404, if the President of the 
United States determines and certifies to Congress before July 1, 1993, 
that conditions in the People's Republic of China permit persons covered 
by Public Law 102-404 to safely return to the People's Republic of 
China, no applications for lawful permanent resident status under Public 
Law 102-404 will be processed or granted.
    (j) Immigrant classification and assignment of priority date. Public 
Law 102-404 provides eligible applicants with automatic classifications 
as immigrants under section 203(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act. No immigrant 
visa petition is required and applicants need not meet the usual 
requirements for classification as skilled workers. The applicant's 
priority date shall be the date his or her application for adjustment of 
status under Public Law 102-404 is properly filed with the Service.
    (k) Effect of immigrant visa number limitations. Eligible Public Law 
102-404 applicants are exempt from the per-country immigrant visa number 
limitations of section 202(a)(2) of the Act. Eligible Public Law 102-404 
applicants may file an application for adjustment of status under Public 
Law 102-404 without regard to immigrant visa number limitations of 
sections 202(a)(2) and 203(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act. However, the 
adjustment of status application may not be approved and adjustment of 
status to that of a lawful permanent resident of the United States may 
not be granted until a visa number becomes available for the applicant 
under the worldwide allocation of immigrant visa numbers for employment-
based aliens under section 203(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act. The applicant may 
request initial or continued employment authorization during this period 
by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. If the 
applicant needs to travel outside the United States during this period, 
he or she may file a request for advance parole on Form I-131, 
Application for Travel Document.

[[Page 467]]

    (l) Decision. In the case of an application for adjustment of status 
filed pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 102-404, the authority 
conferred upon district directors in 8 CFR part 245 to accept and 
adjudicate an application for adjustment of status under section 245 of 
the Act is delegated exclusively to the service center director having 
jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence in the United 
States. If the service center director transfers the application to the 
district director, authority to adjudicate an application for adjustment 
of status filed pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 102-404 lies 
with the district director having jurisdiction over the applicant's 
place of residence.
    (m) Effect of enactment on family members other than qualified 
family members. The adjustment of status benefits and waivers provided 
by Public Law 102-404 do not apply to a spouse or child who is not a 
qualified family member as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. 
However, a spouse or child whose relationship to the principal alien was 
established prior to the approval of the principal's adjustment-of-
status application may be accorded the derivative priority date and 
preference category of the principal alien, in accordance with the 
provisions of section 203(d) of the Act. The spouse or child may use the 
priority date and category when it becomes current, in accordance with 
the limitations set forth in sections 201 and 202 of the Act.

Sec. 245.10  Adjustment of status upon payment of additional sum under Public Law 103-317.

    (a) Eligibility. Any alien who is included in the categories of

under section 245 of the Act if the alien:
    (1) Is physically present in the United States;
    (2) Is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immigrant 
visa number immediately available at the time of filing for adjustment 
of status;
    (3) Is not inadmissible from the United States under any provision 
of section 212 of the Act, or all grounds for inadmissibility have been 
waived;
    (4) Properly files Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent 
Residence or Adjust Status on or after October 1, 1994, with the fee 
required for that application;
    (5) Properly files Supplement A to Form I-485 on or after October 1, 
1994;
    (6) Pays an additional sum of $1,000, unless payment of the 
additional sum is not required under section 245(i) of the Act; and
    (7) Will adjust status under section 245 of the Act to that of a 
lawful permanent resident of the United States on or after October 1, 
1994, and before October 1, 1997.
    (b) Payment of additional sum. An adjustment applicant filing under 
the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act must pay the standard 
adjustment application filing fee as specified in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of 
this chapter. Each application submitted to the Service under the 
provisions of section 245(i) of the Act on or after October 1, 1994, and 
before December 29, 1996, must be submitted with an additional sum of 
$650. Each application submitted to the Service under the provisions of 
section 245(i) of the Act on or after December 29, 1996, must be 
submitted with an additional sum of $1,000. If a determination is made 
by an officer of the Service on or after December 29, 1996, that an 
applicant is subject to section 245(i) of the Act, and the Form I-485 is 
not accompanied by Supplement A to Form I-485 and, if required by 
section 245(i), the additional sum of $1,000, the applicant will be 
afforded the opportunity to amend the application by submitting 
Supplement A, the additional sum of $1,000, if required, and any other 
required documentation. However, an applicant filing under the 
provisions of section 245(i) of the Act is not required to pay the 
additional sum if, at the time the application for adjustment of status 
is filed, the alien is:
    (1) Unmarried and less than 17 years of age;
    (2) The spouse of a legalized alien, qualifies for and has properly 
filed Form I-817, Application for Voluntary Departure under the Family 
Unity Program, and submits a copy of his or her

[[Page 468]]

receipt or approval notice for filing Form I-817; or
    (3) The child of a legalized alien, is unmarried and less than 21 
years of age, qualifies for and has filed Form I-817, and submits a copy 
of his or her receipt of approval notice for filing Form I-817. Such an 
alien must pay the additional sum if he or she has reached the age of 21 
years at the time of filing for adjustment of status. Such an alien must 
meet all other conditions for adjustment of status contained in the Act 
and in this chapter.
    (c) Application period. The Service or the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review may approve an application for adjustment of status 
pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act if such application was filed 
either on or after October 1, 1994, and before October 23, 1997 or any 
other such date as Congress may determine in an extension of section 
245(i). If an alien attempts to file an adjustment of status application 
under the provisions of section 245(i) outside of this time period, the 
Service will accept the application and base filing fee, as set forth in 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter, return the additional sum of $1,000 to 
the alien, and either the Service or the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review will adjudicate the application pursuant to section 
245(a) of the Act. If the alien, in such a case, is not eligible for 
adjustment of status, either the Service will issue a written notice 
advising the alien of the denial of the application for adjustment of 
status, or the Executive Office for Immigration Review will deny the 
application for adjustment of status.
    (d) Adjustment application filed on or after October 1, 1994, dated 
before October 23, 1997 or any other such date as Congress may determine 
in an extension of this provision, without Supplement A to Form I-485 
and additional sum. An adjustment of status applicant will be allowed 
the opportunity to amend an adjustment of status application filed in 
accordance with Sec. 103.2 of this chapter on or after October 1, 1994, 
and before October 23, 1997 or any other such date as Congress may 
determine in an extension of section 245(i) of the Act, in order to 
request consideration under the provisions of section 245(i), if it 
appears that the alien is not otherwise ineligible for adjustment of 
status. If the application for adjustment of status is pending before 
the Service, the Service shall notify the applicant in writing of the 
Service's intent to deny the adjustment of status application, and any 
other requests for benefits that derive from the adjustment application, 
unless Supplement A to Form I-485 and any required additional sum is 
filed within 30 days of the date of the notice. If the application for 
adjustment of status is pending before the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review, the Executive Office for Immigration Review will 
deny the application and permit the applicant to file a motion to reopen 
in accordance with Secs. 3.2(c) and 3.23 of this chapter along with 
proof of payment to the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the 
additional sum within 30 days of the denial.
    (e) Applications for Adjustment of Status filed before October 1, 
1994. The provisions of section 245(i) of the Act shall not apply to an 
application for adjustment of status that was filed before October 1, 
1994. The provisions of section 245(i) of the Act also shall not apply 
to a motion to reopen or reconsider an application for adjustment of 
status if the application for adjustment of status was filed before 
October 1, 1994. An applicant whose pre-October 1, 1994, application for 
adjustment of status has been denied may file a new application for 
adjustment of status pursuant to section 245(i) of the Act on or after 
October 1, 1994, and before October 23, 1997, or any other such date as 
Congress may determine in an extension of section 245(i), provided that 
such new application is accompanied by: the required fee; Supplement A 
to Form I-485; and additional sum required by section 245(i) of the Act; 
and all other required initial and additional evidence.
    (f) Completion of processing of pending applications. (1) An 
application for adjustment of status filed on or after October 1, 1994, 
and before October 23, 1997 or any other such date as Congress may 
determine in an extension of section 245(i) of the Act, shall be 
adjudicated to completion by an officer of the Service or by the 
Executive Office for Immigration Review, regardless of whether the

[[Page 469]]

final decision is made after the termination of this program. The 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this section regarding amended 
applications shall apply to all such applications. The Service or the 
Executive Office for Immigration Review may consider a motion to open or 
reconsider an application for adjustment of status on the basis of 
section 245(i) if the applicant submitted a copy of the application for 
adjustment of status, a copy of Supplement A to Form I-485, and any 
other required documentation on or after October 1, 1994, and before 
October 23, 1997 or any other such date as Congress may determine in an 
extension of section 245(i). However, in order to receive the benefit of 
a motion to reopen or reconsider that has been granted, the applicant 
must have remitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service before 
October 23, 1997 or any other such date as Congress may determine in an 
extension of section 245(i), any additional sum required by section 
245(i). Even if a motion to reopen or reconsider is granted, failure to 
pay the additional sum to the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
before October 23, 1997 or any other such date as Congress may determine 
in an extension of 245(i) will result in the ultimate denial of the 
application for adjustment of status.
    (2) Any application for adjustment of status submitted pursuant to 
section 245(i) and considered in deportation or removal proceedings must 
be filed between October 1, 1994, and October 23, 1997 or any other such 
date as Congress may determine in an extension of section 245(i).
    (g) Aliens deportable under section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act are 
ineligible to adjust status. Section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act renders any 
alien who has engaged, is engaged, or at any time after admission 
engages in any terrorist activity, as defined in section 
212(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, deportable. Under section 245(c)(6) of the 
Act, persons who are deportable under section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act 
are ineligible to adjust status under section 245(a) of the Act. Any 
person who is deportable under section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Act is also 
ineligible to adjust status under section 245(i) of the Act.

Sec. 245.11  Adjustment of aliens in S nonimmigrant classification.

    (a) Eligibility. An application on Form I-854, requesting that an 
alien witness or informant in S nonimmigrant classification be allowed 
to adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident, may only be filed 
by the federal or state law enforcement authority (``LEA'') (which shall 
include a federal or state court or a United States Attorney's Office) 
that originally requested S classification for the alien. The completed 
application shall be filed with the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, Department of Justice, who will forward only properly 
certified applications to the Commissioner, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, for approval. Upon receipt of an approved Form 
I-854 allowing the S nonimmigrant to adjust status to that of lawful 
permanent resident, the alien may proceed to file with that Form, Form 
I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, 
pursuant to the following process.
    (1) Request to allow S nonimmigrant to apply for adjustment of 
status to that of lawful permanent resident. The LEA that requested S 
nonimmigrant classification for an S nonimmigrant witness or informant 
pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act may request that the 
principal S nonimmigrant be allowed to apply for adjustment of status by 
filing Form I-854 with the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, in accordance with the instructions on, or attached to, that 
form and certifying that the alien has fulfilled the terms of his or her 
admission and classification. The same Form I-854 may be used by the LEA 
to request that the principals nonimmigrant's spouse, married and 
unmarried sons and daughters, regardless of age, and parents who are in 
derivative S nonimmigrant classification and who are qualified family 
members as described

[[Page 470]]

in paragraph (b) of this section similarly be allowed to apply for 
adjustment of status pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act.
    (2) Certification. Upon receipt of an LEA's request for the 
adjustment of an alien in S nonimmigrant classification on Form I-854, 
the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, shall review the 
information and determine whether to certify the request to the 
Commissioner in accordance with the instructions on the form.
    (3) Submission of requests for adjustment of status to the 
Commissioner. No application by an LEA on Form I-854 requesting the 
adjustment to lawful permanent resident status of an S nonimmigrant 
shall be forwarded to the Commissioner unless first certified by the 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division.
    (4) Decision on request to allow adjustment of S nonimmigrant. The 
Commissioner shall make the final decision on a request to allow an S 
nonimmigrant to apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent 
resident.
    (i) In the event the Commissioner decides to deny an application on 
Form I-854 to allow an S nonimmigrant to apply for adjustment of status, 
the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA 
shall be notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. 
Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 
7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In 
the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy 
Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the 
alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to 
deny.
    (ii) Upon approval of the request on Form I-854, the Commissioner 
shall forward a copy of the approved form to the Assistant Attorney 
General and the S nonimmigrant, notifying them that the S nonimmigrant 
may proceed to file Form I-485 and request adjustment of status to that 
of lawful permanent resident, and that, to be eligible for adjustment of 
status, the nonimmigrant must otherwise:
    (A) Meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, if 
requesting adjustment as a qualified family member of the certified 
principal S nonimmigrant witness or informant;
    (B) Be admissible to the United States as an immigrant, unless the 
ground of inadmissibility has been waived;
    (C) Establish eligibility for adjustment of status under all 
provisions of section 245 of the Act, unless the basis for ineligibility 
has been waived; and
    (D) Properly file with his or her Form I-485, Application to 
Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, the approved Form I-854.
    (b) Family members--(1) Qualified family members. A qualified family 
member of an S nonimmigrant includes the spouse, married or unmarried 
son or daughter, or parent of a principal S nonimmigrant who meets the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, provided that:
    (i) The family member qualified as the spouse, married or unmarried 
son or daughter, or parent (as defined in section 101(b) of the Act) of 
the principal S nonimmigrant when the family member was admitted as or 
granted a change of status to that of a nonimmigrant under section 
101(a)(15)(S) of the Act;
    (ii) The family member was admitted in S nonimmigrant classification 
to accompany, or follow to join, the principal S-5 or S-6 alien pursuant 
to the LEA's request;
    (iii) The family member is not inadmissible from the United States 
as a participant in Nazi persecution or genocide as described in section 
212(a)(3)(E) of the Act;
    (iv) The qualifying relationship continues to exist; and
    (v) The principal alien has adjusted status, has a pending 
application for adjustment of status or is concurrently filing an 
application for adjustment of status under section 101(a)(15)(S) of the 
Act.
    (vi) Paragraphs (b)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section do not apply if 
the alien witness or informant has died and, in the opinion of the 
Attorney General, was in compliance with the terms of

[[Page 471]]

his or her S classification under section 245(i) (1) and (2) of the Act.
    (2) Other family member. The adjustment provisions in this section 
do not apply to a family member who has not been classified as an S 
nonimmigrant pursuant to a request on Form I-854 or who does not 
otherwise meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. 
However, a spouse or an unmarried child who is less than 21 years old, 
and whose relationship to the principal S nonimmigrant or qualified 
family member was established prior to the approval of the principal S 
nonimmigrant's adjustment of status application, may be accorded the 
priority date and preference category of the principal S nonimmigrant or

the limitations set forth in sections 201 and 202 of the Act;
    (ii) May seek immigrant visa issuance abroad or adjustment of status 
to that of a lawful permanent resident of the United States when the 
priority date becomes current for the spouse's or child's country of 
chargeability under the fourth employment-based preference 
classification;
    (iii) Must meet all the requirements for immigrant visa issuance or 
adjustment of status, unless those requirements have been waived;

his or her twenty-first birthday before being admitted with an immigrant 
visa or granted adjustment of status.
    (c) Waivers of inadmissibility. An alien seeking to adjust status 
pursuant to the provisions of section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act may not 
be denied adjustment of status for conduct or a condition that:
    (1) Was disclosed to the Attorney General prior to admission; and
    (2) Was specifically waived pursuant to the waiver provisions set 
forth at section 212(d)(1) and 212(d)(3) of the Act.
    (d) Application. Each S nonimmigrant requesting adjustment of status 
under section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act must:
    (1) File Form I-485, with the prescribed fee, accompanied by the 
approved Form I-854, and the supporting documents specified in the 
instructions to Form I-485 and described in 8 CFR 245.2. Secondary 
evidence may be submitted if the nonimmigrant is unable to obtain the 
required primary evidence as provided in 8 CFR 103.2(b)(2). The S 
nonimmigrant applying to adjust must complete Part 2 of Form I-485 by 
checking box ``h-other'' and writing ``S'' or ``S-Qualified Family 
Member.'' Qualified family members must submit documentary evidence of 
the relationship to the principal S nonimmigrant witness or informant.
    (2) Submit detailed and inclusive evidence of eligibility for the

all arrivals and departures from the United States in S nonimmigrant 
classification and the reason for each departure; and
    (iii) Primary evidence of a qualifying relationship to the principal

primary evidence is unavailable, church or school records, or other 
secondary evidence may be submitted. If such documents are unavailable, 
affidavits may be submitted as provided in 8 CFR 103.2(b)(2).
    (e) Priority date. The S nonimmigrant's priority date shall be the 
date his or her application for adjustment of status as an S 
nonimmigrant is properly filed with the Service.
    (f) Visa number limitation. An adjustment of status application

availability of immigrant visa numbers. The adjustment of status 
application may not, however, be approved and the alien's

[[Page 472]]

adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident of the United 
States may not be granted until a visa number becomes available for the 
alien under the worldwide allocation for employment-based immigrants 
under section 201(d) and section 203(b)(4) of the Act. The alien may 
request initial or continued employment authorization while the 
adjustment application is pending by filing Form I-765, Application for 
Employment Authorization. If the alien needs to travel outside the 
United States during this period, he or she may file a request for 
advance parole on Form I-131, Application for Travel Document.
    (g) Filing and decision. An application for adjustment of status 
filed by an S nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(S) of the Act shall 
be filed with the district director having jurisdiction over the alien's 
place of residence. Upon approval of adjustment of status under this 
section, the district director shall record the alien's lawful admission 
for permanent residence as of the date of such approval. The district 
director shall notify the Commissioner and the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, of the adjustment.
    (h) Removal under section 237 of the Act. Nothing in this section 
shall prevent an alien adjusted pursuant to the terms of these 
provisions from being removed for conviction of a crime of moral 
turpitude committed within 10 years after being provided lawful 
permanent residence under this section or for any other ground under 
section 237 of the Act.
    (i) Denial of application. In the event the district director 
decides to deny an application on Form I-485 and an approved Form I-854 
to allow an S nonimmigrant to adjust status, the Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA shall be notified in 
writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. Unless the 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 7 days, he 
or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In the event 
of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, 
the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy Attorney General 
for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the alien or the 
relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to deny. A denial 
of an adjustment application under this paragraph may not be renewed in 
subsequent removal proceedings.

[[Page 473]]

for adjustment is granted, excluding:
    (i) Any periods of absence from the United States not exceeding 180 
days in the aggregate; and
    (ii) Any periods of absence for which the applicant received an 
Advance Authorization for Parole (Form I-512) prior to his or her 
departure from the United States, provided the applicant returned to the 
United States in accordance with the conditions of such Advance 
Authorization for Parole;
    (3) Is not inadmissible to the United States for permanent residence 
under any provisions of section 212(a) of the Act, with the exception of

applicant may apply for an individual waiver as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section;
    (4) Is physically present in the United States at the time the 
application is filed; and
    (5) Properly files an application for adjustment of status in 
accordance with this section.
    (b) Qualified family members--(1) Existence of relationship at time 
of adjustment. The spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of an 
alien eligible for adjustment of status under the provisions of Pub. L. 
105-100 is eligible to apply for benefits as a dependent provided the 
qualifying relationship existed when the principal beneficiary was 
granted adjustment of status and the dependent meets all applicable 
requirements of sections 202(a) and (d) of Pub. L. 105-100.
    (2) Spouse and minor children. If physically present in the United 
States, the spouse or minor child of an alien who is eligible for 
permanent residence under the provisions of Pub. L. 105-100 may also 
apply for and receive adjustment of status under this section, provided 
such spouse or child meets the criteria established in paragraph (a) of 
this section, except for the requirement of continuous physical presence 
in the United States since December 1, 1995. Such application may be 
filed concurrently with or subsequent to the filing of the principal's 
application but may not be approved prior to approval of the principal's 
application.
    (3) Unmarried adult sons and daughters. An unmarried son or daughter 
of an alien who is eligible for permanent residence under the provisions 
of Pub. L. 105-100 may apply for and receive adjustment under this 
section, provided such son or daughter meets the criteria established in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Applicability of inadmissibility grounds contained in section 
212(a). An applicant for the benefits of the adjustment of status 
provisions of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 need not establish 
admissibility under paragraphs (4), (5), (6)(A), (7)(A), and (9)(B) of 
section 212(a) of the Act in order to be able to adjust his or her 
status to that of permanent resident. An applicant under section 202 of 
Pub. L. 105-100 may also apply for one or more of the immigrant waivers 
of inadmissibility under section 212 of the Act, if applicable, in 
accordance with Sec. 212.7 of this chapter.
    (d) Aliens in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, and 
aliens subject to a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal--
(1) Proceedings pending before an Immigration Court. Except as provided 
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, while an alien is in exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceedings pending before an immigration judge, 
or has a pending motion to reopen or motion to reconsider filed with an 
immigration judge on or before May 21, 1998, sole jurisdiction over an 
application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 
105-100 shall lie with the immigration judge. If an alien who has a 
pending motion to reopen or motion to reconsider filed with an 
immigration judge on or before May 21, 1998 files an application for 
adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the 
immigration judge shall reopen the alien's proceedings for consideration 
of the adjustment application, unless the alien is clearly ineligible 
for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100. All 
applications for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-
100 filed with an Immigration Court shall be subject to the requirements 
of Secs. 3.11 and 3.31 of this chapter.
    (2) Proceedings pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
Except as

[[Page 474]]

provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, in the case of an alien 
who either has a pending appeal with the Board or has a pending motion 
to reopen or motion to reconsider filed with the Board on or before May 
21, 1998, the Board shall remand, or reopen and remand, the proceedings 
to the Immigration Court for the sole purpose of adjudicating an 
application for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-
100, unless the alien is clearly ineligible for adjustment of status 
under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100. If the immigration judge denies, 
or the alien fails to file, the application for adjustment of status 
under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the immigration judge shall 
certify the decision to the Board for consideration in conjunction with 
the applicant's previously pending appeal or motion.
    (3) Administrative closure of pending exclusion, deportation, or 
removal proceedings. (i) In the case of an alien who is in exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceedings, or has a pending motion to reopen 
or a motion to reconsider such proceedings filed on or before May 21, 
1998, and who appears to be eligible to file an application for 
adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the 
Immigration Court having jurisdiction over such proceedings or motion, 
or if the matter is before the Board on appeal or by motion, the Board, 
shall, upon request of the alien and with the concurrence of the 
Service, administratively close the proceedings, or continue 
indefinitely the motion, to allow the alien to file such application 
with the Service as prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (ii) In any case not administratively closed in accordance with 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the immigration judge having 
jurisdiction over the exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings 
shall have jurisdiction to accept and adjudicate any application for 
adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 during the 
course of such proceedings.
    (4) Aliens with final orders of exclusion, deportation, or removal. 
An alien who is subject to a final order of exclusion, deportation, or 
removal, and who has not been denied adjustment of status under section 
202 of Public Law 105-100 by the immigration judge or the Board of 
Immigration Appeals, may apply to the Service for adjustment of status 
under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100.
    (5) Stay of final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal--(i) 
With the Service. The filing of an application for adjustment under 
section 202 of Public Law 105-100 with the Service shall not stay the 
execution of such final order unless the applicant has filed, and the 
Service has approved an Application for Stay of Removal (Form I-246) in 
accordance with section 241(c)(2) of the Act and Sec. 241.6 of this 
chapter.
    (ii) With EOIR. When the Service refers a decision to an immigration 
judge on a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) in accordance with 
paragraph (m)(3) of this section, the referral shall not stay the 
execution of the final order. Execution of such final order shall 
proceed unless a stay of execution is specifically granted by the 
immigration judge, the Board, or an authorized Service officer.
    (6) Effect on applications for adjustment under other provisions of 
the law. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to allow any alien who 
is in either exclusion proceedings that commenced prior to April 1, 
1997, or removal proceedings as an inadmissible arriving alien that 
commenced on or after April 1, 1997, and who has not been paroled into 
the United States, to apply for adjustment of status under any provision 
of law other than section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100.
    (e) Application and supporting documents. Each applicant for 
adjustment of status must file an Application to Register Permanent 
Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485). An applicant should complete 
Part 2 of Form I-485 by checking box ``h--other'' and writing ``NACARA--
Principal'' or ``NACARA--Dependent'' next to that block. Each 
application must be accompanied by:
    (1) The fee prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter;

documentation exceeding 90 days in length, excluding periods when the 
applicant states that he or she was not physically present in the United 
States. Such documentation need not bear the seal of the issuing 
authority and may include, but is not limited to:
    (i) School records;
    (ii) Rental receipts;
    (iii) Utility bill receipts;
    (iv) Any other dated receipts;

adoption decree, or other relevant evidence) to demonstrate the 
relationship between the applicant and the other beneficiary;
    (11) A copy of the Arrival-Departure Record (Form-I-94) issued at

affidavits may be submitted. The applicant may submit as many types of 
secondary evidence as necessary to establish the birth, marriage, or 
other

[[Page 476]]

event. Documentary evidence establishing that primary evidence is 
unavailable must accompany secondary evidence of birth or marriage in 
the home country. In adjudicating the application for adjustment of 
status under section 202 of Public Law 105-100, the Service or 
immigration judge shall determine the weight to be given such secondary 
evidence. Secondary evidence may not be submitted in lieu of the 
documentation specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. 
However, subject to verification by the Service, if the documentation 
specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) is already contained in the 
Service's file relating to the applicant, the applicant may submit an 
affidavit to that effect in lieu of the actual documentation.
    (g) Filing. The application period begins on June 22, 1998. To 
benefit from the provisions of section 202 of Public Law 105-100, an 
alien must properly file an application for adjustment of status before 
April 1, 2000. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all 
applications for the benefits of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 must be 
submitted by mail to: USINS Texas Service Center, P.O. Box 851804, 
Mesquite, TX 75185-1804. After proper filing of the application, the 
Service will notify the applicant to appear for fingerprinting as 
prescribed in Sec. 103.2(e) of this chapter.
    (h) Jurisdiction. Except as provide din paragraphs (d) and (i) of 
this section, the director of the Texas Service Center shall have 
jurisdiction over all applications for adjustment of status under 
section 202 of Public Law 105-100.
    (i) Interview. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (i)(2), and 
(i)(3) of this section, all applicants for adjustment of status under 
section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 must be personally interviewed by an 
immigration officer at a local office of the Service. In any case in 
which the director of the Texas Service Center determines that an 
interview of the applicant is necessary, that director shall forward the 
case to the appropriate local Service office for interview and 
adjudication.
    (2) In the case of an applicant who has submitted evidence of 
commencement of physical presence in the United States consisting of one 
or more of the documents specified in section 202(b)(2)(A)(i) through 
(v) or section 202(b)(2)(A)(vii) of Pub. L. 105-100 and upon examination 
of the application, including all other evidence submitted in support of 
the application, all relevant Service records and all other relevant law 
enforcement indices, if the director of the Texas Service Center 
determines that the alien is clearly eligible for adjustment of status 
under Pub. L. 105-100 and that an interview of the applicant is not 
necessary, the director may approve the application.
    (3) Upon examination of the application, all supporting 
documentation, all relevant Service records, and all other relevant law 
enforcement indices, if the director of the Texas Service Center 
determines that the alien is clearly ineligible for adjustment of status 
under Pub. L. 105-100 and that an interview of the applicant is not 
necessary, the director may deny the application.
    (j) Authorization to be employed in the United States while the 
application is pending--(1) Application. An applicant for adjustment of 
status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 who wishes to obtain initial 
or continued employment authorization during the pendency of the 
adjustment application must file an Application for Employment 
authorization (Form I-765), with fee as set forth in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of 
this chapter. The applicant may either submit Form I-765 concurrently 
with Form I-485 or wait for at least 90 days after submission of Form I-
485.
    (2) Adjudication and issuance. In general, employment authorization 
may not be issued to an applicant for adjustment of status under section 
202 of Pub. L. 105-100 until the adjustment application has been pending 
for 180 days. However, if Service records contain one or more of the 
documents specified in section 202(b)(2)(A)(i) through (v) and (vii) of 
Pub. L. 105-100, evidence of the applicant's Nicaraguan or Cuban 
nationality, and no indication that the applicant is clearly ineligible 
for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the 
application for employment authorization may be approved, and the 
resulting document issued immediately upon verification that the Service 
record contains such

[[Page 477]]

information. If the Service fails to adjudicate the application for 
employment authorization upon expiration of the 180-day waiting period 
or within 90 days of the filing of application for employment 
authorization, whichever comes later, the alien shall be eligible for 
interim employment authorization in accordance with Sec. 274a.13(d) of 
this chapter. Nothing in this section shall preclude an applicant for 
adjustment of status under Pub. L. 105-100 from being granted an initial 
employment authorization or an extension of employment authorization 
under any other provision of law or regulation for which the alien may 
be eligible.
    (k) Parole authorization for purposes of travel--(1) Travel from and 
return to the United States while the application for adjustment of 
status is pending. If an applicant for benefits under section 202 of 
Pub. L. 105-100 desires to travel outside, and return to, the United 
States while the application for adjustment of status is pending, he or 
she must file a request for advance parole authorization on an 
Application for Travel Document (Form I-131), with fee as set forth in 
Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter and in accordance with the instructions 
on the form. If the alien is either in deportation or removal 
proceedings, or subject to a final order of deportation or removal, the 
Form I-131 must be submitted to the Assistant Commissioner for 
International Affairs; otherwise the Form I-131 must be submitted to the 
director of the Texas Service Center, who shall have jurisdiction over 
such applications. If any applicant departs the United States without 
first obtaining an advance parole, his or her application for adjustment 
of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 is deemed to be abandoned 
as of the moment of his or her departure.
    (2) Parole authorization for the purpose of filing an application 
for adjustment of status under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100. An 
otherwise eligible applicant who is outside the United States and wishes 
to come to the United States in order to apply for benefits under 
section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100 may request parole authorization for such 
purpose by filing an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131) with 
the Texas Service Center, at P.O. Box 851804, Mesquite, TX 75185-1804. 
Such application must be supported by a photocopy of the Form I-485 that 
the alien will file once he or she has been paroled into the United 
States. The applicant must include photocopies of all the supporting 
documentation listed in paragraph (e) of this section, except the filing 
fee, the medical report, the fingerprint card, and the local police 
clearances. If the director of the Texas Service Center is satisfied 
that the alien will be eligible for adjustment of status once the alien 
has been paroled into the United States and files the application, he or 
she may issue an Authorization for Parole of an Alien into the United 
States (Form I-512) to allow the alien to travel to, and be paroled 
into, the United States for a period of 60 days. The applicant shall 
have 60 days from the date of parole to file the application for 
adjustment of status. If the alien files the application for adjustment 
of status within that 60-day period, the Service may re-parole the alien 
for such time as is necessary for adjudication of the application. 
Failure to file such application for adjustment of status within 60 days 
shall result in the alien being returned to the custody of the Service 
and being examined as an arriving alien applying for admission. Such 
examination will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of 
section 235(b)(1) of the Act if the alien is inadmissible under section 
212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) of the Act, or section 240 of the Act if the 
alien is inadmissible under any other grounds.
    (3) Effect of departure on an outstanding warrant of exclusion, 
deportation, or removal. If an alien who is the subject of an 
outstanding final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal departs 
from the United States, with or without an advance parole authorization, 
such final order shall be executed by the alien's departure. The 
execution of such final order shall not preclude the applicant from 
filing an Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission Into the 
United States After Deportation or Removal (Form I-212) in accordance 
with Sec. 212.2 of this chapter.
    (l) Approval. If the director approves the application for 
adjustment of status under the provisions of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-
100, the director shall

[[Page 478]]

record the alien's lawful admission for permanent resident as of the 
date of such approval and notify the applicant accordingly. If the alien 
had previously been issued a final order of exclusion, deportation, or 
removal, such order shall be deemed canceled as of the date of the 
director's approval of the application for adjustment of status. If the 
alien had been in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings that 
were administratively closed, such proceedings shall be deemed 
terminated as of the date of approval of the application for adjustment 
of status by the director. If an immigration judge grants or if the 
Board, upon appeal, grants an application for adjustment under the 
provisions of section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100, the alien's lawful 
admission for permanent residence shall be as of the date of such grant.
    (m) Denial and review of decision. If the director denies the 
application for adjustment of status under the provisions of section 202 
of Pub. L. 105-100, the director shall notify the applicant of the 
decision. The director shall also:
    (1) In the case of an alien who is not maintaining valid 
nonimmigrant status and who had not previously been placed in exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceedings, initiate removal proceedings in 
accordance with Sec. 239.1 of this chapter during which the alien may 
renew his or her application for adjustment of status under section 202 
of Pub. L. 105-100; or
    (2) In the case of an alien whose previously initiated exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceeding had been administratively closed or 
continued indefinitely under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, advise 
the Immigration Court that had administratively closed the proceeding, 
or the Board, as appropriate, of the denial of the application. The 
Immigration Court or the Board will then recalendar or reinstate the 
prior exclusion, deportation, or removal proceeding, during which 
proceeding the alien may renew his or her application for adjustment 
under section 202 of Pub. L. 105-100; or
    (3) In the case of an alien who is the subject of an outstanding 
final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal, refer the decision to 
deny the application by filing a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) 
with the Immigration Court that issued the final order for consideration 
in accordance with paragraph (n) of this section.
    (n) Action of immigration judge upon referral of decision by a 
Notice of Certification (Form I-290C)-- (1) General. Upon the referral 
by a Notice of Certification (Form I-290C) of a decision to deny the 
application, in accordance with paragraph (m)(3) of this section, and 
under the authority contained in Sec. 3.10 of this chapter, the 
immigration judge shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the alien 
is eligible for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public Law 
105-100. Such hearing shall be conducted under the same rules of 
procedure as proceedings conducted under part 240 of this chapter, 
except the scope of review shall be limited to a determination on the 
alien's eligibility for adjustment of status under section 202 of Public 
Law 105-100. During such proceedings all parties are prohibited from 
raising or considering any other issues, including but not limited to 
issues of admissibility, deportability, removability, and eligibility 
for any form of relief other than adjustment of status under section 202 
of Public Law 105-100. Should the alien fail to appear for such hearing, 
the immigration judge shall deny the application for adjustment under 
section 202 of Public Law 105-100.
    (2) Appeal of immigration judge decision. Once the immigration judge 
issues his or her decision on the application, either the alien or the 
Service may appeal the decision to the Board. Such appeal must be filed 
pursuant to the requirements for appeals to the Board from an 
immigration judge decision set forth in Secs. 3.3 and 3.8 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Rescission of the decision of an immigration judge. The decision 
of an immigration judge under paragraph (n)(1) of this section denying 
an application for adjustment under section 202 of Public Law 105-100 
for failure to appear may be rescinded only:
    (i) Upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of 
the denial if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was 
because of exceptional circumstances as defined in section 240(e)(1) of 
the Act; or

[[Page 479]]

    (ii) Upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien 
demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice of the hearing in 
person (or, if personal service was not practicable, through service by 
mail to the alien or to the alien's counsel of record, if any) or the 
alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and 
the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien.
    (o) Transition period provisions for tolling the physical presence 
in the United States provision for certain individuals--(1) Departure 
without advance authorization for parole. In the case of an otherwise 
eligible applicant who departed the United States on or before December 
31, 1997, the physical presence in the United States provision of 
section 202(b)(1) of Pub. L. 105-100 is tolled as of November 19, 1997, 
and until July 20, 1998.
    (2) Departure with advance authorization for parole. In the case of 
an alien who departed the United States after having been issued an 
Authorization for parole of an Alien into the United States (Form I-
512), and who returns to the United States in accordance with the 
conditions of that document, the physical presence in the United States 
requirement of section 202(b)(1) of Pub. L. 105-100 is tolled while the 
alien is outside the United States pursuant to the issuance of the Form 
I-512.
    (3) Request for parole authorization from outside the United States. 
In the case of an alien who is outside the United States and submits an 
application for parole authorization in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) 
of this section, and such application for parole authorization is 
granted by the Service, the physical presence in the United States 
provisions of section 202(b)(1) of Pub. L. 105-100 is tilled from the 
date the application is received at the Texas Service Center until the 
alien is paroled into the United States pursuant to the issuance of the 
Form I-512.

<R05>
Sec. 245a.1  Definitions.

    As used in this chapter:
    (a) Act means the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by The 
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
    (b) Service means the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
    (c)(1) Resided continuously as used in section 245A(a)(2) of the 
Act, means that the alien shall be regarded as having resided 
continuously in the United States if, at the time of filing of the 
application for temporary resident status:

An alien who after appearing for a scheduled interview to obtain an 
immigrant visa at a Consulate or Embassy in Canada or Mexico but who 
subsequently is not issued an immigrant visa and who is paroled back 
into the United States, pursuant to the stateside criteria program, 
shall be regarded

[[Page 480]]

as having been granted advance parole by the Service.
    (i) No single absence from the United States has exceeded forty-five 
(45) days, and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded one 
hundred and eighty (180) days between January 1, 1982 through the date 
the application for temporary resident status is filed, unless the alien 
can establish that due to emergent reasons, his or her return to the 
United States could not be accomplished within the time period allowed;
    (ii) The alien was maintaining residence in the United States; and
    (iii) The alien's departure from the United States was not based on 
an order of deportation.

An alien who has been absent from the United States in accordance with 
the Service's advance parole procedures shall not be considered as 
having interrupted his or her continuous residence as required at the 
time of filing an application.
    (2) Continuous residence, as used in section 245A(b)(1)(B) of the 
Act, means that the alien shall be regarded as having resided 
continuously in the United States if, at the time of applying for 
adjustment from temporary residence to permanent resident status: No 
single absence from the United States has exceeded thirty (30) days, and 
the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded ninety (90) days between 
the date of granting of lawful temporary resident status and of applying 
for permanent resident status, unless the alien can establish that due 
to emergent reasons the return to the United States could not be 
accomplished within the time period(s) allowed.
    (d) In the term alien's unlawful status was known to the government, 
the term government means the Immigration and Naturalization Service. An 
alien's unlawful status was known to the government only if:
    (1) The Service received factual information constituting a 
violation of the alien's nonimmigrant status from any agency, bureau or 
department, or subdivision thereof, of the Federal government, and such 
information was stored or otherwise recorded in the official Service 
alien file, whether or not the Service took follow-up action on the 
information received. In order to meet the standard of information 
constituting a violation of the alien's nonimmigrant status, the alien 
must have made a clear statement or declaration to the other federal 
agency, bureau or department that he or she was in violation of 
nonimmigrant status; or
    (2) An affirmative determination was made by the Service prior to 
January 1, 1982 that the alien was subject to deportation proceedings. 
Evidence that may be presented by an alien to support an assertion that 
such a determination was made may include, but is not limited to, 
official Service documents issued prior to January 1, 1982, i.e., Forms 
I-94, Arrival-Departure Records granting a period of time in which to 
depart the United States without imposition of proceedings; Forms I-210, 
Voluntary Departure Notice letter; and Forms I-221, Order to Show Cause 
and Notice of Hearing. Evidence from Service records that may be used to 
support a finding that such a determination was made may include, but is 
not limited to, record copies of the aforementioned forms and other 
documents contained in alien files, i.e., Forms I-213, Record of 
Deportable Alien;
    Unexecuted Forms I-205, Warrant of Deportation; Forms I-265, 
Application for Order to Show Cause and Processing Sheet; Forms I-541, 
Order of Denial of Application for Extension of Stay granting a period 
of time in which to depart the United States without imposition of 
proceedings, or any other Service record reflecting that the alien's 
nonimmigrant status was considered by the Service to have terminated or 
the alien was otherwise determined to be subject to deportation 
proceedings prior to January 1, 1982, whether or not deportation 
proceedings were instituted; or
    (3) A copy of a response by the Service to any other agency which 
advised that agency that a particular alien had no legal status in the 
United States or for whom no record could be found.
    (4) The applicant produces documentation from a school approved to 
enroll foreign students under Sec. 214.3 which establishes that the said 
school forwarded to the Service a report that

[[Page 481]]

clearly indicated the applicant had violated his or her nonimmigrant 
student status prior to January 1, 1982. A school may submit an 
affirmation that the school did forward to the Service the 
aforementioned report and that the school no longer has available copies 
of the actual documentation sent. In order to be eligible under this 
part, the applicant must not have been reinstated to nonimmigrant 
student status.
    (e) The term to make a determination as used in Sec. 245a.2(t)(3) of 
this part means obtaining and reviewing all information required to 
adjudicate an application for the benefit sought and making a decision 
thereon. If fraud, willful misrepresentation or concealment of a 
material fact, knowingly providing a false writing or document, 
knowingly making a false statement or representation, or any other 
activity prohibited by section 245A(c)(6) of the Act is established 
during the process of making the determination on the application, the 
Service shall refer to the United States Attorney for prosecution of the 
alien or of any person who created or supplied a false writing or 
document for use in an application for adjustment of status under this 
part.
    (f) The term continuous physical presence as used in section 
245A(a)(3)(A) of the Act means actual continuous presence in the United 
States since November 6, 1986 until filing of any application for 
adjustment of status. Aliens who were outside of the United States on 
the date of enactment or departed the United States after enactment may 
apply for legalization if they reentered prior to May 1, 1987, provided 
they meet the continuous residence requirements, and are otherwise 
eligible for legalization.
    (g) Brief, casual, and innocent means a departure authorized by the 
Service (advance parole) subsequent to May 1, 1987 of not more than 
thirty (30) days for legitimate emergency or humanitarian purposes 
unless a further period of authorized departure has been granted in the 
discretion of the district director or a departure was beyond the 
alien's control.
    (h) The term brief and casual absences as used in section 
245a(b)(3)(A) of the Act permits temporary trips abroad as long as the 
alien establishes a continuing intention to adjust to lawful permanent 
resident status. However, such absences must comply with 
Sec. 245a.3(b)(2) of this chapter in order for the alien to maintain 
continuous residence as specified in the Act.
    (i) Public cash assistance means income or needs-based monetary 
assistance to include, but not limited to, supplemental security income 
received by the alien through federal, state, or local programs designed 
to meet subsistence levels. It does not include assistance in kind, such

include work-related compensation or certain types of medical assistance 
(Medicare, Medicaid, emergency treatment, services to pregnant women or 
children under 18 years of age, or treatment in the interest of public 
health).
    (j) Legalization Office means local offices of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service which accept and process applications for 
Legalization or Special Agricultural Worker status, under the authority 
of the INS district directors in whose districts such offices are 
located.
    (k) Regional Processing Facility means Service offices established 
in each of the four Service regions to adjudicate, under the authority 
of the INS Directors of the Regional Processing Facilities, applications 
for adjustment of status under section 210, 245A(a) or 245A(b)(1) of the 
Act.
    (l) Designated entity means any state, local, church, community, 
farm labor organization, voluntary organization, association of 
agricultural employers or individual determined by the Service to be 
qualified to assist aliens in the preparation of applications for 
Legalization status.
    (m) The term family unity as used in section 245(d)(2)(B)(i) of the 
Act means maintaining the family group without deviation or change. The 
family group shall include the spouse, unmarried minor children under 18 
years of age who are not members of some other household, and parents 
who reside regularly in the household of the family group.
    (n) The term prima facie as used in section 245(e)(1) and (2) of the 
Act

[[Page 482]]

means eligibility is established if the applicant presents a completed 
I-687 and specific factual information which in the absence of rebuttal 
will establish a claim of eligibility under this part.
    (o) Misdemeanor means a crime committed in the United States, either 
(1) punishable by imprisonment for a term of one year or less, 
regardless of the term such alien actually served, if any, or (2) a 
crime treated as a misdemeanor under 8 CFR 245a.1(p). For purposes of 
this definition, any crime punishable by imprisonment for a maximum term 
of five days or less shall not be considered a misdemeanor.
    (p) Felony means a crime committed in the United States, punishable 
by imprisonment for a term of more than one year, regardless of the term 
such alien actually served, if any, except: When the offense is defined 
by the State as a misdemeanor and the sentence actually imposed is one

this exception, for purposes of 8 CFR part 245a, the crime shall be 
treated as a misdemeanor.
    (q) Subject of an Order to Show Cause means actual service of the 
Order to Show Cause upon the alien through the mail or by personal 
service.
    (r) A qualified designated entity in good-standing with the Service 
means those designated entities whose cooperative agreements were not 
suspended or terminated by the Service or those whose agreements were 
not allowed to lapse by the Service prior to January 30, 1989 (the 
expiration date of the INS cooperative agreements for all designated 
entities), or those whose agreements were not terminated for cause by 
the Service subsequent to January 30, 1989.
    Subsequent to January 30, 1989, and throughout the period ending on

long as enrollment occurred on or after May 1, 1987, course standards 
include attainment of particular functional skills related to 
communicative ability, subject matter knowledge, and English language 
competency, and attainment of these skills is measured either by 
successful completion of learning objectives appropriate to the 
applicant's ability level, or attainment of a determined score on a test 
or tests, or both of these); or
    (2) An applicant presents a high school diploma or general 
educational development diploma (GED) from a school in the United 
States. A GED gained in a language other than English is acceptable only

hours of instruction in English and U.S. history and government); or
    (3) An applicant has attended for a period of one academic year (or

U.S. history and government); or
    (4) An applicant has attended courses conducted by employers, 
social, community, or private groups certified (retroactively, if 
necessary, as long as enrollment occurred on or after May 1, 1987, and

U.S. history and government) by the district director or the Director of

[[Page 483]]

the Outreach Program under Sec. 245a.3(b)(5)(i)(D) of this chapter; or

the proficiency test for legalization, called the IRCA Test for 
Permanent Residency, indicating that the applicant is able to read and 
understand minimal functional English within the context of the history 
and government of the United States. Such test may be given by INS, as 
well as, State Departments of Education (SDEs) (and their accredited 
educational agencies) and Qualified Designated Entities in good-standing 
(QDEs) upon agreement with and authorization by INS. Those SDEs and QDEs

may be used in addition to, but not in lieu of, the Federal Citizenship 
Text series);
    (3) Be designed to provide at least 60 hours of instruction per 
class level;
    (4) Be relevant and educationally appropriate for the program focus 
and the intended audience; and
    (5) Be available for examination and review by INS as requested.
    (v) The term developmentally disabled means the same as the term 
developmental disability defined in section 102(5) of the Developmental 
Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1987, Public Law 100-
146. As a convenience to the public, that definition is printed here in 
its entirety:

    The term developmental disability means a severe, chronic disability 
of a person which:
    (1) Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or 
combination of mental and physical impairments;
    (2) Is manifested before the person attains age twenty-two;
    (3) Is likely to continue indefinitely;
    (4) Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more

United States prior to January 1, 1982, and whose parole status 
terminated prior to January 1, 1982, and who has thereafter resided

physically present in the United States from November 6, 1986, until the 
date of filing the application.
    (7) An alien who establishes that he or she is a Cuban or Haitian

States, and who has been physically present in the United States from 
November 6, 1986, until the date of filing the application, without 
regard to whether such alien has applied for adjustment of status 
pursuant to section 202 of the Act.
    (8) An alien's eligibility under the categories described in section 
245(a)(2)(b) (1) through (7) and (9) through (15) shall not be affected 
by entries to the United States subsequent to January 1, 1982 that were 
not documented on Service Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record.
    (9) An alien who would be otherwise eligible for legalization and 
who was present in the United States in an unlawful status prior to 
January 1, 1982, and reentered the United States as a nonimmigrant, such 
entry being documented on Service Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, 
in order to return to an unrelinquished unlawful residence.
    (10) An alien described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section must 
receive a waiver of the excludable charge 212(a)(19) as an alien who 
entered the United States by fraud.

[[Page 485]]

by the Department of State as being entitled to such classification 
prior to January 1, 1982, and who has thereafter continued to reside in 
the United States in an unlawful status. An alien who was a dependent 
family member and who may be otherwise eligible for legalization may be

family member was also in A and G status when the principal A or G 
alien's status terminated or ceased to be recognized by the Department

    (12) A nomimmigrant who entered the United States for duration of 
status (``D/S'') in one of the following classes, F, F-1, or F-2, who 
completed a full course of study, including practical training and whose 
time period if any to depart the United States after completion of study 
expired prior to January 1, 1982 and who has remained in the United 
States in an unlawful status since that time. A dependent F-2 alien 
otherwise eligible who was admitted into the United States with a 
specific time period, as opposed to duration of status, documented on 
Service Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record that extended beyond January 
1, 1982 is considered eligible if the principal F-1 alien is found 
eligible.
    (13) An alien who establishes that he or she is a member of the

was paroled into the United States on or before May 1, 1987 in order to 
return to an unrelinquished unlawful residence.
    (c) Ineligible aliens. (1) An alien who has been convicted of a

    (4) An alien who at any time was a nonimmigrant exchange visitor who 
is subject to the two-year foreign residence requirement unless the 
requirement has been satisfied or waived pursuant to the provisions of 
section 212(e) of the Act who has resided continuously in the United 
States in an unlawful status since January 1, 1982.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) An alien who is the subject of an Order to Show Cause issued

adjustment of status to that of temporary resident under section 245A(a) 
of the Act prior to the thirty-first day after issuance of the order.
    (7) An alien who is the subject of an Order to Show Cause issued

    (d) Documentation. Evidence to support an alien's eligibility for 
the legalization program shall include documents establishing proof of 
identity, proof of residence, and proof of financial responsibility, as 
well as photographs, a completed fingerprint card (Form FD-258), and a 
completed medical report of examination (Form I-693). All documentation 
submitted will be subject to Service verification. Applications 
submitted with unverifiable

[[Page 486]]

documentation may be denied. Failure by an applicant to authorize 
release to INS of information protected by the Privacy Act and/or 
related laws in order for INS to adjudicate a claim may result in denial 
of the benefit sought. Acceptable supporting documents for these three 
categories are discussed below.
    (1) Proof of identity. Evidence to establish identity is listed 
below in descending order of preference:
    (i) Passport;
    (ii) Birth certificate;
    (iii) Any national identity document from the alien's country of 
origin bearing photo and fingerprint (e.g., a ``cedula'' or 
``cartilla'');
    (iv) Driver's license or similar document issued by a state if it 
contains a photo;
    (v) Baptismal Record/Marriage Certificate; or
    (vi) Affidavits.
    (2) Assumed names--(i) General. In cases where an applicant claims 
to have met any of the eligibility criteria under an assumed name, the 
applicant has the burden of proving that the applicant was in fact the 
person who used that name. The applicant's true identity is established 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The 
assumed name must appear in the documentation provided by the applicant 
to establish eligibility. To meet the requirements of this paragraph 
documentation must be submitted to prove the common identity, i.e., that 
the assumed name was in fact used by the applicant.
    (ii) Proof of common identity. The most persuasive evidence is a 
document issued in the assumed name which identifies the applicant by 
photograph, fingerprint or detailed physical description. Other evidence 
which will be considered are affidavit(s) by a person or persons other 
than the applicant, made under oath, which identify the affiant by name 
and address, state the affiant's relationship to the applicant and the 
basis of the affiant's knowledge of the applicant's use of the assumed 
name. Affidavits accompanied by a photograph which has been identified 
by the affiant as the individual known to affiant under the assumed name 
in question will carry greater weight.
    (3) Proof of residence. Evidence to establish proof of continuous 
residence in the United States during the requisite period of time may 
consist of any combination of the following:
    (i) Past employment records, which may consist of pay stubs, W-2 
Forms, certification of the filing of Federal income tax returns on IRS 
Form 6166, state verification of the filing of state income tax returns, 
letters from employer(s) or, if the applicant has been in business for 
himself or herself, letters from banks and other firms with whom he or 
she has done business. In all of the above, the name of the alien and 
the name of the employer or other interested organization must appear on 
the form or letter, as well as relevant dates. Letters from employers 
should be on employer letterhead stationery, if the employer has such 
stationery, and must include:
    (A) Alien's address at the time of employment;
    (B) Exact period of employment;
    (C) Periods of layoff;
    (D) Duties with the company;
    (E) Whether or not the information was taken from official company 
records; and
    (F) Where records are located and whether the Service may have 
access to the records.

If the records are unavailable, an affidavit form-letter stating that 
the alien's employment records are unavailable and why such records are 
unavailable may be accepted in lieu of (3)(i)(E) and (3)(i)(F) of this 
paragraph. This affidavit form-letter shall be signed, attested to by 
the employer under penalty of perjury, and shall state the employer's 
willingness to come forward and give testimony if requested.
    (ii) Utility bills (gas, electric, phone, etc.), receipts, or 
letters from companies showing the dates during which the applicant 
received service are acceptable documentation.
    (iii) School records (letters, report cards, etc.) from the schools 
that the applicant or their children have attended in the United States 
must show name of school and periods of school attendance.
    (iv) Hospital or medical records showing treatment or 
hospitalization

[[Page 487]]

of the applicant or his or her children must show the name of the 
medical facility or physician and the date(s) of the treatment or 
hospitalization.
    (v) Attestations by churches, unions, or other organizations to the 
applicant's residence by letter which:
    (A) Identifies applicant by name;
    (B) Is signed by an official (whose title is shown);
    (C) Shows inclusive dates of membership;
    (D) States the address where applicant resided during membership 
period;
    (E) Includes the seal of the organization impressed on the letter or 
the letterhead of the organization, if the organization has letterhead 
stationery;
    (F) Establishes how the author knows the applicant; and
    (G) Establishes the origin of the information being attested to.
    (vi) Additional documents to support the applicant's claim may 
include:
    (A) Money order receipts for money sent in or out of the country;
    (B) Passport entries;
    (C) Birth certificates of children born in the United States;
    (D) Bank books with dated transactions;
    (E) Letters or correspondence between applicant and another person 
or organization;
    (F) Social Security card;
    (G) Selective Service card;
    (H) Automobile license receipts, title, vehicle registration, etc.;
    (I) Deeds, mortgages, contracts to which applicant has been a party;
    (J) Tax receipts;
    (K) Insurance policies, receipts, or letters; and
    (L) Any other relevant document.
    (4) Proof of financial responsibility. An applicant for adjustment 
of status under this part is subject to the provisions of section 
212(a)(15) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likely to 
become public charges. Generally, the evidence of employment submitted 
under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section will serve to demonstrate the 
alien's financial responsibility during the documented period(s) of 
employment. If the alien's period(s) of residence in the United States 
include significant gaps in employment or if there is reason to believe 
that the alien may have received public assistance while employed, the 
alien may be required to provide proof that he or she has not received 
public cash assistance. An applicant for residence who is determined 
likely to become a public charge and is unable to overcome this 
determination after application of the special rule will be denied 
adjustment. The burden of proof to demonstrate the inapplicability of 
this provision of law lies with the applicant who may provide:
    (i) Evidence of a history of employment (i.e., employment letter, W-
2 Forms, income tax returns, etc.);
    (ii) Evidence that he/she is self-supporting (i.e., bank statements, 
stocks, other assets, etc.); or
    (iii) Form I-134, Affidavit of Support, completed by a spouse in 
behalf of the applicant and/or children of the applicant or a parent in 
behalf of children which guarantees complete or partial financial 
support. Acceptance of the affidavit of support shall be extended to 
other family members where family circumstances warrant.
    (5) Burden of proof. An alien applying for adjustment of status 
under this part has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the 
evidence that he or she has resided in the United States for the 
requisite periods, is admissible to the United States under the 
provisions of section 245a of the Act, and is otherwise eligible for 
adjustment of status under this section. The inference to be drawn from 
the documentation provided shall depend on the extent of the 
documentation, its credibility and amenability to verification as set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (6) Evidence. The sufficiency of all evidence produced by the 
applicant will be judged according to its probative value and 
credibility. To meet his or her burden of proof, an applicant must 
provide evidence of eligibility apart from his or her own testimony. In 
judging the probative value and credibility of the evidence submitted, 
greater weight will be given to the submission of original 
documentation.
    (e) Filing of application. (1) The application must be filed on Form 
I-687 at an office of a designated entity or at a Service Legalization 
Office within the jurisdiction of the District wherein the

[[Page 488]]

applicant resides. If the application is filed with a designated entity, 
the alien must have consented to having the designated entity forward 
the application to the legalization office. In the case of applications 
filed at a legalization office, the district director may, at his or her 
discretion:
    (i) Require the applicant to file the application in person; or
    (ii) Require the applicant to file the application by mail; or
    (iii) Permit the filing of applications either by mail or in person.

    The applicant must appear for a personal interview at the 
legalization office as scheduled. If the applicant is 14 years of age or 
older, the application must be accompanied by a completed Form FD-258 
(Applicant Card).
    (2) At the time of the interview, wherever possible, original 
documents must be submitted except the following: Official government 
records; employment or employment-related records maintained by 
employers, unions, or collective bargaining organizations; medical 
records; school records maintained by a school or school board; or other 
records maintained by a party other than the applicant. Copies of 
records maintained by parties other than the applicant which are 
submitted in evidence must be certified as true and correct by such 
parties and must bear their seal or signature or the signature and title 
of persons authorized to act in their behalf. If at the time of the 
interview the return of original documents is desired by the applicant, 
they must be accompanied by notarized copies or copies certified true 
and correct by a qualified designated entity or by the alien's 
representative in the format prescribed in Sec. 204.2(j)(1) or (2) of 
this chapter. At the discretion of the district director, original 
documents, even if accompanied by certified copies, may be temporarily 
retained for forensic examination by the Document Analysis Unit at the 
Regional Processing Facility having jurisdiction over the legalization 
office to which the documents were submitted.
    (3) A separate application (I-687) must be filed by each eligible 
applicant. All fees required by Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter must be 
submitted in the exact amount in the form of a money order, cashier's 
check, or certified bank check, made payable to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. No personal checks or currency will be accepted. 
Fees will not be waived or refunded under any circumstances.
    (f) Filing date of application. The date the alien submits a 
completed application to a Service Legalization Office or designated 
entity shall be considered the filing date of the application, provided 
that in the case of an application filed at a designated entity the 
alien has consented to having the designated entity forward the 
application to the Service Legalization Office having jurisdiction over 
the location of the alien's residence. The designated entities are 
required to forward completed applications to the appropriate Service 
Legalization Office within sixty days of receipt.
    (g) Selective Service registration. At the time of filing an 
application under this section, male applicants over the age of 17 and 
under the age of 26 are required to be registered under the Military 
Selective Service Act. An applicant shall present evidence that he has 
previously registered under that Act in the form of a letter of 
acknowledgement from the Selective Service System, or such alien shall 
present a completed and signed Form SSS-1 at the time of filing Form I-
687 with the Immigration and Naturalization Service or a designated 
entity. Form SSS-1 will be forwarded to the Selective Service System by 
the Service.
    (h) Continuous residence. (1) For the purpose of this Act, an 
applicant for temporary resident status shall be regarded as having 
resided continuously in the United States if, at the time of filing of 
the application:
    (i) No single absence from the United States has exceeded forty-five 
(45) days, and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded one 
hundred and eighty (180) days between January 1, 1982 through the date 
the application for temporary resident status is filed, unless the alien 
can establish that due to emergent reasons, his or her return to the 
United States could not be accomplished within the time period allowed;

[[Page 489]]

    (ii) The alien was maintaining a residence in the United States; and
    (iii) The alien's departure from the United States was not based on 
an order of deportation.
    (2) An alien who has been absent from the United States in 
accordance with the Service's advance parole procedures shall not be 
considered as having interrupted his or her continuous residence as 
required at the time of filing an application under this section.
    (i) Medical examination. An applicant under this part shall be 
required to submit to an examination by a designated civil surgeon at no 
expense to the government. The designated civil surgeon shall report on 
the findings of the mental and physical condition of the applicant and 
the determination of the alien's immunization status. Results of the 
medical examinaton must be presented to the Service at the time of 
interview and shall be incorporated into the record. Any applicant 
certified under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of section 212(a) 
of the Act may appeal to a Board of Medical Officers of the U.S. Public 
Health Service as provided in section 234 of the Act and part 235 of 
this chapter.
    (j) Interview. Each applicant, regardless of age, must appear at the 
appropriate Service Office and must be fingerprinted for the purpose of 
issuance of an employment authorization document and Form I-688. Each 
applicant shall be interviewed by an immigration officer, except that 
the interview may be waived for a child under 14, or when it is 
impractical because of the health or advanced age of the applicant.
    (k) Applicability of exclusion grounds--(1) Grounds of exclusion not 
to be applied. The following paragraphs of section 212(a) of the Act 
shall not apply to applicants for temporary resident status: (14) 
Workers entering without Labor Certification; (20) immigrants not in 
possession of a valid entry document; (21) visas issued without 
compliance with section 203; (25) illiterates; and (32) graduates of 
non-accredited medical schools.
    (2) Waiver of grounds of exclusion. Except as provided in paragraph 
(k)(3) of this section, the Attorney General may waive any other 
provision of section 212(a) of the Act only in the case of individual 
aliens for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when the 
granting of such a waiver is in the public interest. If an alien is 
excludable on grounds which may be waived as set forth in this 
paragraph, he or she shall be advised of the procedures for applying for 
a waiver of grounds of excludability on Form I-690. When an application 
for waiver of grounds of excludability is filed jointly with an 
application for temporary residence under this section, it shall be 
accepted for processing at the legalization office. If an application 
for waiver of grounds of excludability is submitted after the alien's 
preliminary interview at the legalization office, it shall be forwarded 
to the appropriate Regional Processing Facility. All applications for 
waivers of grounds of excludability must be accompanied by the correct 
fee in the exact amount. All fees for applications filed in the United 
States must be in the form of a money order, cashier's check, or bank 
check. No personal checks or currency will be accepted. Fees will not be 
waived or refunded under any circumstances. An application for waiver of 
grounds of excludability under this part shall be approved or denied by 
the director of the Regional Processing Facility in whose jurisdiction 
the applicant's application for adjustment of status was filed except 
that in cases involving clear statutory ineligibility or admitted fraud, 
such application may be denied by the district director in whose 
jurisdiction the application is filed, and in cases returned to a 
Service Legalization Office for re-interview, such application may be 
approved at the discretion of the district director. The applicant shall 
be notified of the decision and, if the application is denied, of the 
reason therefor. Appeal from an adverse decision under this part may be 
taken by the applicant on Form I-694 within 30 days after the service of 
the notice only to the Service's Administrative Appeals Unit pursuant to 
the provisions of Sec. 103.3(a) of this chapter.
    (3) Grounds of exclusion that may not be waived. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of the Act, the following provisions of section 212(a) 
may not be

[[Page 490]]

waived by the Attorney General under paragraph (k)(2) of this section:
    (i) Paragraphs (9) and (10) (criminals);
    (ii) Paragraph (23) (narcotics) except for a single offense of 
simple possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana;
    (iii) Paragraphs (27) (prejudicial to the public interest), (28) 
(communist), and (29) (subversive);
    (iv) Paragraph (33) (participated in Nazi persecution).
    (4) Special rule for determination of public charge. An alien who 
has a consistent employment history which shows the ability to support 
himself or herself even though his or her income may be below the 
poverty level, may be admissible. The alien's employment history need 
not be continuous in that it is uninterrupted. It should be continuous 
in the sense that the alien shall be regularly attached to the 
workforce, has an income over a substantial period of the applicable 
time, and has demonstrated the capacity to exist on his or her income 
without recourse to public cash assistance. This regulation is 
prospective in that the Service shall determine, based on the alien's 
history, whether he or she is likely to become a public charge. Past 
acceptance of public cash assistance within a history of consistent 
employment will enter into this decision. The weight given in 
considering applicability of the public charge provisions will depend on 
many factors, but the length of time an applicant has received public 
cash assistance will constitute a significant factor.
    (5) Public assistance and criminal history verification. 
Declarations by an applicant that he or she has not been the recipient 
of public cash assistance and/or has not had a criminal record are 
subject to a verification of facts by the Service. The applicant must 
agree to fully cooperate in the verification process. Failure to assist 
the Service in verifying information necessary for the adjudication of 
the application may result in a denial of the application.
    (l) Continous physical presence since November 6, 1986. (1) An alien 
applying for adjustment to temporary resident status must establish that 
he or she has been continuously physically present in the United States 
since November 6, 1986. Aliens who were outside of the United States on 
the date of enactment or departed the United States after enactment may 
apply for legalization if they reentered prior to May 1, 1987, and meet 
the continuous residence requirements and are otherwise eligible for 
legalization.
    (2) A brief, casual and innocent absence means a departure 
authorized by the Service (advance parole) subsequent to May 1, 1987 of 
not more than thirty (30) days for legitimate emergency or humanitarian 
purposes unless a further period of authorized departure has been 
granted in the discretion of the district director or a departure was 
beyond the alien's control.
    (m) Departure. (1) During the time period from the date that an 
alien's application establishing prima facie eligibility for temporary 
resident status is reviewed at a Service Legalization Office and the 
date status as a temporary resident is granted, the alien applicant can 
only be readmitted to the United States provided his or her departure 
was authorized under the Service's advance parole provisions contained 
in Sec. 212.5(e) of this chapter.
    (2) An alien whose application for temporary resident status has 
been approved may be admitted to the United States upon return as a 
returning temporary resident provided he or she:
    (i) Is not under deportation proceedings, such proceedings having 
been instituted subsequent to the approval of temporary resident status. 
A temporary resident alien will not be considered deported if that alien 
departs the United States while under an outstanding order of 
deportation issued prior to the approval of temporary resident status;
    (ii) Has not been absent from the United States more than thirty 
(30) days on the date application for admission is made;
    (iii) Has not been absent from the United States for an aggregate 
period of more than 90 days since the date the alien was granted lawful 
temporary resident status;
    (iv) Presents Form I-688;
    (v) Presents himself or herself for inspection; and
    (vi) Is otherwise admissible.

[[Page 491]]

    (3) The periods of time in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) and (m)(2)(iii) of 
this section may be waived at the discretion of the Attorney General in 
cases where the absence from the United States was due merely to a brief 
temporary trip abroad due to emergent or extenuating circumstances 
beyond the alien's control.
    (n)(1) Employment and travel authorization; general. Authorization 
for employment and travel abroad for temporary resident status 
applicants under section 245A(a) of the Act may only be granted by a 
Service Office. INS district directors will determine the Service 
location for the completion of processing of travel documentation. In 
the case of an application which has been filed with a designated 
entity, employment authorization may only be granted by the Service 
after the application has been properly received at the Service Office.
    (2) Employment authorization prior to the granting of temporary 
resident status. (i) Permission to travel abroad and accept employment 
may be granted to the applicant after an interview has been conducted in 
connection with an application establishing prima facie eligibility for 
temporary resident status. Permission to travel abroad may be granted in 
emergent circumstances in accordance with the Service's advance parole 
provisions contained in Sec. 212.5(e) of this chapter after an interview 
has been conducted in connection with an application establishing prima 
facie eligiblity for temporary resident status.
    (ii) If an interview appointment cannot be scheduled within 30 days 
from the date an application is filed at a Service office, authorization 
to accept employment will be granted, valid until the scheduled 
appointment date. Employment authorization, both prior and subsequent to 
an interview, will be restricted to increments of 1 year, pending final 
determination on the application for temporary resident status. If a 
final determination has not been made prior to the expiration date on 
the Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766, Form I-688A or Form 
I-688B), that date may be extended upon return of the employment 
authorization document by the applicant to the appropriate Service 
office.
    (3) Employment and travel authorization upon grant of temporary 
resident status. Upon the granting of an application for adjustment to 
temporary resident status, the service center will forward a notice of 
approval to the applicant at his or her last known address and to his or 
her qualified designated entity or representative. The applicant may 
appear at any Service office and, upon surrender of the previously 
issued Employment Authorization Document, will be issued Form I-688, 
Temporary Resident Card, authorizing employment and travel abroad.
    (4) Revocation of employment authorization upon denial of temporary 
resident status. Upon denial of an application for adjustment to 
temporary resident status the alien will be notified that if a timely 
appeal is not submitted, employment authorization shall be automatically 
revoked on the final day of the appeal period.
    (o) Decision. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the 
decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason therefor. An 
appeal from an adverse decision under this part may be taken by the 
applicant on Form I-694.
    (p) Appeal process. An adverse decision under this part may be 
appealed to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative 
Appeals Unit). Any appeal with the required fee shall be filed with the 
Regional Processing Facility within thirty (30) days after service of 
the notice of denial in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 103.3(a)

tolled will not be accepted. The thirty (30) day period includes any 
time required for service or receipt by mail.
    (q) Motions. The Regional Processing Facility director may sua 
sponte reopen and reconsider any adverse decision. When an appeal to the 
Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit) has

    (r) Certifications. The Regional Processing Facility director may, 
in accordance with Sec. 103.4 of this chapter, certify a decision to the 
Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit) when 
the case involves an unusually complex or novel question of law or fact. 
The party affected shall be given notice of such certification and of 
the right to submit a brief within thirty (30) days from service of the 
notice.
    (s) Date of adjustment to temporary residence. The status of an 
alien whose application for temporary resident status is approved shall

Office.
    (t) Limitation on access to information and confidentiality. (1) No 
person other than a sworn officer or employee of the Justice Department 
or bureau of agency thereof, will be permitted to examine individual 
applications, except employees of designated entities where applications 
are filed with the same designated entity. For purposes of this part, 
any individual employed under contract by the Service to work in 
connection with the legalization program shall be considered an 
``employee of the Justice Department or bureau or agency thereof.''
    (2) Files and records prepared by designated entites under this 
section are confidential. The Attorney General and the Service shall not 
have access to these files and records without the consent of the alien.
    (3) No information furnished pursuant to an application for 
legalization under this section shall be used for any purpose except: 
(i) To make a determination on the application; or, (ii) for the 
enforcement of the provisions encompassed in section 245A(c)(6) of the 
Act, except as provided in paragraph (t)(4) of this section.
    (4) If a determination is made by the Service that the alien has, in 
connection with his or her application, engaged in fraud or willful 
misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, knowingly provided 
a false writing or document in making his or her application, knowingly 
made a false statement or representation, or engaged in any other 
activity prohibited by section 245A(c)(6) of the Act, the Service shall 
refer the matter to the United States Attorney for prosecution of the 
alien or of any person who created or supplied a false writing or 
document for use in an application for adjustment of status under this 
part.
    (5) Information obtained in a granted legalization application and 
contained in the applicant's file is subject to subsequent review in 
reference to future benefits applied for (including petitions for 
naturalization and permanent resident status for relatives).
    (u) Termination of temporary resident staus--(1) Termination of 
temporary resident status; General. The status of an alien lawfully 
admitted for temporary residence under section 245A(a)(1) of the Act may 
be terminated at any time in accordance with section 245A(b)(2) of the 
Act. It is not necessary that a final order of deportation be entered in 
order to terminate temporary resident status. The temporary resident 
status may be terminated upon the occurence of any of the following:
    (i) It is determined that the alien was ineligible for temporary 
residence under section 245A of this Act;
    (ii) The alien commits an act which renders him or her inadmissible 
as an immigrant, unless a waiver is secured pursuant to 
Sec. 245a.2(k)(2).
    (iii) The alien is convicted of any felony, or three or more 
misdemeanors;
    (iv) The alien fails to file for adjustment of status from temporary 
resident to permanent resident on Form I-698 within forty-three (43) 
months of the date he/she was granted status as a temporary resident 
under Sec. 245a.1 of this part.
    (2) Procedure--(i) Termination by the Service. Except as provided in 
paragraph (u)(2)(ii) of this section, termination of an alien's 
temporary resident status under paragraph (u)(1) of this section will be 
made before instituting deportation proceedings against a temporary 
resident alien and only on notice sent to the alien by certified mail

[[Page 493]]

directed to his or her last known address, and to his or her 
representative, if any. The alien must be given an opportunity to offer 
evidence in opposition to the grounds alleged for termination of his or 
her status. Evidence in opposition must be submitted within thirty (30) 
days after the service of the Notice of Intent to Terminate. If the 
alien's status is terminated, the director of the regional processing 
facility shall notify the alien of the decision and the reasons for the 
termination, and further notify the alien that any Service Form I-94, 
Arrival-Departure Record or other official Service document issued to 
the alien authorizing employment and/or travel abroad, or any Form I-
688, Temporary Resident Card previously issued to the alien will be 
declared void by the director of the regional processing facility within 
thirty (30) days if no appeal of the termination decision is filed 
within that period. The alien may appeal the decision to the Associate 
Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit). Any appeal 
with the required fee shall be filed with the regional processing 
facility within thirty (30) days after the service of the notice of 
termination. If no appeal is filed within that period, the I-94, I-688 
or other official Service document shall be deemed void, and must be 
surrendered without delay to an immigration officer or to the issuing 
office of the Service.
    (ii) Termination upon entry of final order of deportation or 
exclusion. (A) The Service may institute deportation or exclusion 
proceedings against a temporary resident alien without regard to the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (u)(2)(i) of this section:
    (1) If the ground for deportation arises under section 
241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii));
    (2) If the ground for deportation arises after the acquisition of 
temporary resident status, and the basis of such ground of deportation 
is not waivable pursuant to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act (8 
U.S.C. 1255a(d)(2)(B)(ii)); or
    (3) If the ground for exclusion arises after the acquisition of 
temporary resident status and is not waivable pursuant to section 
245A(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1255a(d)(2)(B)(ii)).
    (B) In such cases, the entry of a final order of deportation or 
exclusion will automatically terminate an alien's temporary resident 
status acquired under section 245A(a)(1) of the Act.
    (3) Termination not construed as rescission under section 246. For 
the purposes of this part the phrase termination of status of an alien 
granted lawful temporary residence under section 245A(a) of the Act 
shall not be construed to necessitate a rescission of status as 
described in section 246 of the Act, and the proceedings required by the 
regulations issued thereunder shall not apply.
    (4) Return to unlawful status after termination. Termination of the 
status of any alien previously adjusted to lawful temporary residence 
under section 245A(a) of the Act shall act to return such alien to the 
unlawful status held prior to the adjustment, and render him or her 
amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings under section 236 or 
242 of the Act, as appropriate.
    (v) Ineligibility for immigration benefits. An alien whose status is 
adjusted to that of a lawful temporary resident under section 245A of 
the Act is not entitled to submit a petition pursuant to section 
203(a)(2) or to any other benefit or consideration accorded under the 
Act to aliens lawfuly admitted for permanent residence.
    (w) Declaration of Intending Citizen. An alien who has been granted 
the status of temporary resident under section 245A(a)(1) of this Act 
may assert a claim of discrimination on the basis of citizenship status 
under section 274B of the Act only if he or she has previously filed 
Form I-772 (Declaration of Intending Citizen) after being granted such 
status. The Declaration of Intending Citizen is not required as a basis 
for filing a petition for naturalization; nor shall it be regarded as a 
right to United States citizenship; nor shall it be regarded as evidence 
of a person's status as a resident.

Sec. 245a.3  Application for adjustment from temporary to permanent resident status.

    (a) Application period for permanent residence. (1) An alien may 
submit an application for lawful permanent resident status, with fee, 
immediately subsequent to the granting of lawful temporary resident 
status. Any application received prior to the alien's becoming eligible 
for adjustment to permanent resident status will be administratively 
processed and held by the INS, but will not be considered filed until 
the beginning of the nineteenth month after the date the alien was 
granted temporary resident status as defined in Sec. 245a.2(s) of this 
chapter.
    (2) No application shall be denied for failure to timely apply 
before the end of 43 months from the date of actual approval of the 
temporary resident application.
    (3) The Service Center Director shall sua sponte reopen and 
reconsider without fee any application which was previously denied for 
late filing. No additional fee will be required for those applications 
which are filed during the twelve month extension period but prior to 
July 9, 1991.
    (b) Eligibility. Any alien who has been lawfully admitted for 
temporary resident status under section 245A(a) of the Act, such status 
not having been terminated, may apply for adjustment of status of that 
of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien:
    (1) Applies for such adjustment anytime subsequent to the granting 
of temporary resident status but on or before the end of 43 months from 
the date of actual approval of the termporary resident application. The 
alien need not be physically present in the United States at the time of 
application; however, the alien must establish continuous residence in 
the United States in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section and must be physically present in the United States at 
the time of interview and/or processing for permanent resident status 
(ADIT processing);
    (2) Establishes continuous residence in the United States since the 
date the alien was granted such temporary residence status. An alien 
shall be regarded as having resided continuously in the United States 
for the purpose of this part if, at the time of applying for adjustment 
from temporary to permanent resident status, or as of the date of 
eligibility for permanent residence, whichever is later, no single 
absence from the United States has exceeded thirty (30) days, and the 
aggregate of all absences has not exceeded ninety (90) days between the 
date of approval of the temporary resident application, Form I-687 (not 
the ``roll-back'' date) and the date the alien applied or became 
eligible for permanent resident status, whichever is later, unless the 
alien can establish that due to emergent reasons or circumstances beyond 
his or her control, the return to the United States could not be 
accomplished within the time period(s) allowed. A single absence from 
the United States of more than 30 days, and aggregate absences of more 
than 90 days during the period for which continuous residence is 
required for adjustment to permanent residence, shall break the 
continuity of such residence, unless the temporary resident can 
establish to the satisfaction of the district director or the Director 
of the Regional Processing Facility that he or she did not, in fact, 
abandon his or her residence in the United States during such period;
    (3) Is admissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section; and has not been 
convicted of any felony, or three or more misdemeanors; and
    (4)(i)(A) Can demonstrate that the alien meets the requirements of 
section 312 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (relating 
to minimal understanding of ordinary English and a knowledge and 
understanding of the history and government of the United States); or
    (B) Is satisfactorily pursuing a course of study recognized by the 
Attorney General to achieve such an understanding of English and such a 
knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United 
States.
    (ii) The requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section must be 
met by each applicant. However, these requirements shall be waived 
without formal

[[Page 495]]

application for persons who, as of the date of application or the date 
of eligibility for permanent residence under this part, whichever date 
is later, are:
    (A) Under 16 years of age; or
    (B) 65 years of age or older; or
    (C) Over 50 years of age who have resided in the United States for 
at least 20 years and submit evidence establishing the 20-year 
qualification requirement. Such evidence must be submitted pursuant to 
the requirements contained in Section 245a.2(d)(3) of this chapter; or
    (D) Developmentally disabled as defined at Sec. 245a.1(v) of this 
chapter. Such persons must submit medical evidence concerning their 
developmental disability; or
    (E) Physically unable to comply. The physical disability must be of 
a nature which renders the applicant unable to acquire the four language 
skills of speaking, understanding, reading, and writing English in 
accordance with the criteria and precedence established in OI 
312.1(a)(2)(iii) (Interpretations). Such persons must submit medical 
evidence concerning their physical disability.
    (iii)(A) Literacy and basic citizenship skills may be demonstrated 
for purposes of complying with paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section 
by:
    (1) Speaking and understanding English during the course of the 
interview for permanent resident status. An applicant's ability to read 
and write English shall be tested by excerpts from one or more parts of 
the Federal Textbooks on Citizenship at the elementary literacy level. 
The test of an applicant's knowledge and understanding of the history 
and form of government of the United States shall be given in the 
English language. The scope of the testing shall be limited to subject 
matter covered in the revised (1987) Federal Textbooks on Citizenship or 
other approved training material. The test questions shall be selected 
from a list of 100 standardized questions developed by the Service. In 
choosing the subject matter and in phrasing questions, due consideration 
shall be given to the extent of the applicant's education, background, 
age, length of residence in the United States, opportunities available 
and efforts made to acquire the requisite knowledge, and any other 
elements or factors relevant to an appraisal of the adequacy of his or 
her knowledge and understanding; or
    (2) By passing a standardized section 312 test (effective 
retroactively as of November 7, 1988) such test being given in the 
English language by the Legalization Assistance Board with the 
Educational Testing Service (ETS) or the California State Department of 
Education with the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System 
(CASAS). The scope of the test is based on the 1987 edition of the 
Federal Textbooks on Citizenship series written at the elementary 
literacy level. An applicant may evidence passing of the standardized 
section 312 test by submitting the approved testing organization's 
standard notice of passing test results at the time of filing Form I-
698, subsequent to filing the application but prior to the interview, or 
at the time of the interview. The test results may be independently 
verified by INS, if necessary.
    (B) An applicant who fails to pass the English literacy and/or the 
U.S. history and government tests at the time of the interview, shall be 
afforded a second opportunity after six (6) months (or earlier, at the 
request of the applicant) to pass the tests, submit evidence of passing 
an INS approved section 312 standardized examination or submit evidence 
of fulfillment of any one of the ``satisfactorily pursuing'' 
alternatives listed at Sec. 245a.1(s) of this chapter. The second 
interview shall be conducted prior to the denial of the application for 
permanent residence and may be based solely on the failure to pass the 
basic citizenship skills requirements. An applicant whose period of 
eligibility expires prior to the end of the six-month re-test period, 
shall still be accorded the entire six months within which to be re-
tested.
    (iv) To satisfy the English language and basic citizenship skills 
requirements under the ``satisfactorily pursuing'' standard as defined 
at Sec. 245a.1(s) of this chapter the applicant must submit evidence of 
such satisfactory pursuit in the form of a ``Certificate of Satisfactory 
Pursuit'' (Form I-699) issued by

[[Page 496]]

the designated school or program official attesting to the applicant's 
satisfactory pursuit of the course of study as defined at 
Sec. 245a.1(s)(1) and (4) of this chapter; or a high school diploma or 
general educational development diploma (GED) under Sec. 245a.1(s)(2) of 
this chapter; or certification on letterhead stationery from a state 
recognized, accredited learning institution under Sec. 245a.1(s)(3) of 
this chapter; or evidence of having passed the IRCA Test for Permanent 
Residency under Sec. 245a.1(s)(5) of this chapter. Such applicants shall 
not then be required to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of 
Sec. 245a.3(b)(4)(i)(A) of this chapter in order to be granted lawful 
permanent residence provided they are otherwise eligible. Evidence of 
``Satisfactory Pursuit'' may be submitted at the time of filing Form I-
698, subsequent to filing the application but prior to the interview, or 
at the time of the interview (the applicant's name and A90M number must 
appear on any such evidence submitted). An applicant need not 
necessarily be enrolled in a recognized course of study at the time of 
application for permanent residency.
    (v) Enrollment in a recognized course of study as defined in 
Sec. 245a.3(b)(5) and issuance of a ``Certificate of Satisfactory 
Pursuit'' must occur subsequent to May 1, 1987.
    (5) A course of study in the English language and in the history and 
government of the United States shall satisfy the requirement of 
paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section if the course materials for such 
instruction include textbooks published under the authority of section 
346 of the Act, and it is
    (i) Sponsored or conducted by: (A) An established public or private 
institution of learning recognized as such by a qualified state 
certifying agency; (B) An institution of learning approved to issue 
Forms I-20 in accordance with Sec. 214.3 of this chapter; (C) A 
qualified designated entity within the meaning of section 245A(c)(2) of 
the Act, in good-standing with the Service; or (D) Is certified by the 
district director in whose jurisdiction the program is conducted, or is 
certified by the Director of the Outreach Program nationally.
    (ii) A program seeking certification as a course of study recognized 
by the Attorney General under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(D) of this section 
shall file Form I-803, Petition for Attorney General Recognition to 
Provide Course of Study for Legalization: Phase II, with the Director of 
Outreach for national level programs or with the district director 
having jurisdiction over the area in which the school or program is 
located. In the case of local programs, a separate petition must be 
filed with each district director when a parent organization has schools 
or programs in more than one INS district. A petition must identify by 
name and address those schools or programs included in the petition. No 
fee shall be required to file Form I-803;
    (A) The Director of Outreach and the district directors may approve 
a petition where they have determined that (1) a need exists for a 
course of study in addition to those already certified under 
Sec. 245a.3(b)(5)(i) (A), (B), or (C); and/or (2) of this chapter the 
petitioner has historically provided educational services in English and 
U.S. history and government but is not already certified under 
Sec. 245a.3(b)(5)(i)(A), (B), or (C); and (3) of this chapter the 
petitioner is otherwise qualified to provide such course of study;
    (B) Upon approval of the petition the Director of Outreach and 
district directors shall issue a Certificate of Attorney General 
Recognition on Form I-804 to the petitioner. If the petition is denied, 
the petitioner shall be notified in writing of the decision therefor. No 
appeal shall lie from a denial of Form I-803, except that in such case 
where the petitions of a local, cross-district program are approved in 
one district and denied in another within the same State, the petitioner 
may request review of the denied petition by the appropriate Regional 
Commissioner. The Regional Commissioner shall then make a determination 
in this case;
    (C) Each district director shall compile and maintain lists of 
programs approved under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(D) of this section within 
his or her jurisdiction. The Director of Outreach shall compile and 
maintain lists of approved national level programs.
    (6) Notice of participation. All courses of study recognized under 
Sec. 245a.3(b)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this

[[Page 497]]

chapter which are already conducting or will conduct English and U.S. 
history and government courses for temporary residents must submit a 
Notice of Participation to the district director in whose jurisdiction 
the program is conducted. Acceptance of ``Certificates of Satisfactory 
Pursuit'' (Form I-699) shall be delayed until such time as the course 
provider submits the Notice of Participation, which notice shall be in 
the form of a letter typed on the letterhead of the course provider (if 
available) and include the following:
    (i) The name(s) of the school(s)/program(s).
    (ii) The complete addresses and telephone numbers of sites where 
courses will be offered, and class schedules.
    (iii) The complete names of persons who are in charge of conducting 
English and U.S. history and government courses of study.
    (iv) A statement that the course of study will issue ``Certificates 
of Satisfactory Pursuit'' to temporary resident enrollees according to 
INS regulations.
    (v) A list of designated officials of the recognized course of study 
authorized to sign ``Certificates of Satisfactory Pursuit'', and samples 
of their original signatures.
    (vi) A statement that if a course provider charges a fee to 
temporary resident enrollees, the fee will not be excessive.
    (vii) Evidence of recognition under 8 CFR 245a.3(b)(5)(i)(A), (B), 
or (C) (e.g., certification from a qualified state certifying agency; 
evidence of INS approval for attendance by nonimmigrant students, such 
as the school code number, or the INS identification number from the QDE 
cooperative agreement).

The course provider shall notify the district director, in writing, of 
any changes to the information contained in the Notice of Participation 
subsequent to its submission within ten (10) days of such change.

A Certificate of Attorney General Recognition to Provide Course of Study 
for Legalization (Phase II), Form I-804, shall be issued to course 
providers who have submitted a Notice of Participation in accordance 
with the provisions of this section by the distict director. A Notice of 
Participation deficient in any way shall be returned to the course 
provider to correct the deficiency. Upon the satisfaction of the 
district director that the deficiency has been corrected, the course 
provider shall be issued Form I-804. Each district director shall 
compile and maintain lists of recognized courses within his or her 
district.
    (7) Fee structure. No maximum fee standard will be imposed by the 
Attorney General. However, if it is believed that a fee charged is 
excessive, this factor alone will justify non-certification of the 
course provider by INS as provided in Sec. 245a.3(b)(10) and/or (12) of 
this section. Once fees are established, any change in fee without prior 
approval of the district director or the Director of Outreach may 
justify de-certification. In determining whether or not a fee is 
excessive, district directors and the Director of Outreach shall 
consider such factors as the means of instruction, class size, 
prevailing wages of instructors in the area of the program, and 
additional costs such as rent, materials, utilities, insurance, and 
taxes. District directors and the Director of Outreach may also seek the 
assistance of various Federal, State and local entities as the need 
arises (e.g., State Departments of Education) to determine the 
appropriateness of course fees.
    (8) The Citizenship textbooks to be used by applicants for lawful 
permanent residence under section 245A of the Act shall be distributed 
by the Service to appropriate representatives of public schools. These 
textbooks may otherwise be purchased from the Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, and are 
also available at certain public institutions.
    (9) Maintenance of Student Records. Course providers conducting 
courses of study recognized under Sec. 245a.3(b)(5) of this chapter 
shall maintain for each student, for a period of three years from the 
student's enrollment, the following information and documents:
    (i) Name (as copied exactly from the I-688A or I-688);
    (ii) A-number (90 million series);
    (iii) Date of enrollment;
    (iv) Attendance records;
    (v) Assessment records;

[[Page 498]]

    (vi) Photocopy of signed ``Certificate of Satisfactory Pursuit'' 
issued to the student.
    (10) Issuance of ``Certificate of Satisfactory Pursuit'' (I-699). 
(i) Each recognized course of study shall prepare a standardized 
certificate that is signed by the designated official. The Certificate 
shall be issued to an applicant who has attended a recognized course of 
study for at least 40 hours of a minimum of 60-hour course as 
appropriate for his or her ability level, and is demonstrating progress 
according to the performance standards of the English and U.S. history 
and government course prescribed. Such standards shall conform with the 
provisions of Sec. 245a.1(s) of this chapter.
    (ii) The district director shall reject a certificate if it is 
determined that the certificate is fraudulent or was fraudulently 
issued.
    (iii) The district director shall reject a Certificate if it is 
determined that the course provider is not complying with INS 
regulations. In the case of non-compliance, the district director will 
advise the course provider in writing of the specific deficiencies and 
give the provider thirty (30) days within which to correct such 
deficiencies.
    (iv) District directors will accept Certificates from course 
providers once it is determined that the deficiencies have been 
satisfactorily corrected.
    (v) Course providers which engage in fraudulent activities or fail 
to conform with INS regulations will be removed from the list of INS 
approved programs. INS will not accept Certificates from these 
providers.
    (vi) Certificates may be accepted if a program is cited for 
deficiencies or decertified at a later date and no fraud was involved.
    (vii) Certificates shall not be accepted from a course provider that 
has been decertified unless the alien enrolled in and had been issued a 
certificate prior to the decertification, provided that no fraud was 
involved.
    (viii) The appropriate State agency responsbile for SLIAG funding 
shall be notified of all decertifications by the district director.
    (11) Designated official. (i) The designated official is the 
authorized person from each recognized course of study whose signature 
appears on all ``Certificates of Satisfactory Pursuit'' issued by that 
course;
    (ii) The designated official must be a regularly employed member of 
the school administration whose office is located at the school and 
whose compensation does not come from commissions for recruitment of 
foreign students;
    (iii)(A) The head of the school system or school, the director of 
the Qualified Designated Entity, the head of a program approved by the 
Attorney General, or the president or owner of other institutions 
recognized by the Attorney General must specify a designated official. 
Such designated official may not delegate this designation to any other 
person. Each school or institution may have up to three (3) designated 
officials at any one time. In a multi-campus institution, each campus 
may have up to three (3) designated officials at any one time;
    (B) Each designated official shall have read and otherwise be 
familiar with the ``Requirements and Guidelines for Courses of Study 
Recognized by the Attorney General''. The signature of a designated 
official shall affirm the official's compliance with INS regulations;
    (C) The name, title, and sample signature of each designated 
official for each recognized course of study shall be on file with the 
district director in whose jurisdiction the program is conducted.
    (12) Monitoring by INS. (i) INS Outreach personnel in conjunction 
with the district director shall monitor the course providers in each 
district in order to:

the service provider before any site visit is conducted.
    (iii) If it is determined that a course provider is not performing 
according to the standards established in either Sec. 245a.3(b)(10) or 
(12) of this chapter, the district director shall institute 
decertification proceedings. Notice of Intent to Decertify shall be 
provided to the course provider. The course provider has 30 days within 
which to correct performance according to standards established. If 
after the 30 days, the district director is not satisfied that the basis 
for decertification has been overcome, the course provider will be 
decertified. The appropriate State agency shall be notified in 
accordance with Sec. 245a.3(b)(10)(viii) of this chapter. A copy of the 
notice of decertification shall be sent to the State agency.
    (13) Courses of study recognized by the Attorney General as defined 
at Sec. 245a.3(b)(5) of this chapter shall provide certain standards for 
the selection of teachers. Since some programs may be in locations where 
selection of qualified staff is limited, or where budget constraints 
restrict options, the following list of qualities for teacher selection 
is provided as guidance. Teacher selections should include as many of 
the following qualities as possible:

for permanent resident status under section 245A(b)(1) of the Act by the 
end of 43 months from the date of actual approval of the temporary 
resident application.
    (4) An alien who was not previously granted temporary resident 
status under section 245A(a) of the Act.
    (5) An alien whose temporary resident status has been terminated 
under Sec. 245a.2(u) of this chapter
    (d) Filing the application. The provisions of part 211 of this 
chapter relating to the documentary requirements for immigrants shall 
not apply to an applicant under this part.
    (1) The application must be filed on Form I-698. Form I-698 must be 
accompanied by the correct fee and documents specified in the 
instructions. The application will be mailed to the director having 
jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence.
    (2) Certification of documents. The submission of original documents 
is not required at the time of filing Form I-698. A copy of a document 
submitted in support of Form I-698 filed pursuant to section 245A(b) of 
the Act and this part may be accepted, though unaccompanied by the 
original, if the copy is certified as true and complete by
    (i) An attorney in the format prescribed in Sec. 204.2(j)(1) of this 
chapter; or
    (ii) An alien's representative in the format prescribed in 
Sec. 204.2(j)(2) of this chapter; or
    (iii) A qualified designated entity (QDE) in good standing as 
defined in Sec. 245a.1(r) of this chapter, if the copy bears a 
certification by the QDE in good-standing, typed or rubber-stamped in 
the following language:

    I certify that I have compared this copy with its original and it is 
a true and complete copy.

Signed:_________________________________________________________________
Date:___________________________________________________________________
Name:___________________________________________________________________
QDE in good-standing representative
Name of QDE in good-standing:___________________________________________
Address of QDE in good-standing:________________________________________
INS-QDE Cooperative Agreement Number:___________________________________

    (iv) Authentication. Certification of documents must be 
authenticated by

[[Page 500]]

an original signature. A facsimile signature on a rubber stamp will not 
be acceptable.
    (v) Original documents. Original documents must be presented when 
requested by the Service. Official government records, employment or 
employment-related records maintained by employers, unions, or 
collective bargaining organizations, medical records, school records 
maintained by a school or school board or other records maintained by a 
party other than the applicant which are submitted in evidence must be 
certified as true and complete by such parties and must bear their seal 
or signature or the signature and title of persons authorized to act in 
their behalf. At the discretion of the district director and/or the 
Regional Processing Facility director, original documents may be kept 
for forensic examination.
    (3) A separate application (I-698) must be filed by each eligible 
applicant. All fees required by Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter must be 
submitted in the exact amount in the form of a money order, cashier's 
check or certified bank check. No personal checks or currency will be 
accepted. Fees will not be waived or refunded under any circumstances.
    (4) Applicants who filed for temporary resident status prior to 
December 1, 1987, are required to submit the results of a serologic test 
for HIV virus on Form I-693, ``Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking 
Adjustment of Status'', completed by a designated civil surgeon, unless 
the serologic test for HIV was performed and the results were submitted 
on Form I-693 when the applicant filed for temporary resident status. 
Applicants who did submit an I-693 reflecting a serologic test for HIV 
was performed prior to December 1, 1987, must submit evidence of this 
fact when filing the I-698 application in order to be relieved from the 
requirement of submitting another I-693. If such evidence is not 
available, applicants may note on their I-698 application their prior 
submission of the results of the serologic test for HIV. This 
information shall then be verified at the Regional Processing Facility. 
Applicants having to submit an I-693 pursuant to this section are not 
required to have a complete medical examination. All HIV-positive 
applicants shall be advised that a waiver of the ground of excludability 
under section 212(a)(6) of the Act is available and shall be provided 
the opportunity to apply for the waiver. To be eligible for the waiver, 
the applicant must establish that:
    (i) The danger to the public health of the United States created by 
the alien's admission to the United States is minimal,
    (ii) The possibility of the spread of the infection created by the 
alien's admission to the United States is minimal, and
    (iii) There will be no cost incurred by any government agency 
without prior consent of that agency. Provided these criteria are met, 
the waiver may be granted only for humanitarian purposes, to assure 
family unity, or when the granting of such a waiver is in the public 
interest in accordance with Sec. 245a.3(g)(2) of this chapter.
    (5) If necessary, the validity of an alien's temporary resident card 
(I-688) will be extended in increments of one (1) year until such time 
as the decision on an alien's properly filed application for permanent 
residence becomes final.
    (6) An application lacking the proper fee or incomplete in any way 
shall be returned to the applicant with request for the proper fee, 
correction, additional information, and/or documentation. Once an 
application has been accepted by the Service and additional information 
and/or documentation is required, the applicant shall be sent a notice 
to submit such information and/or documentation. In such case the 
application Form I-698 shall be retained at the RPF. If a response to 
this request is not received within 60 days, a second request for 
correction, additional information, and/or documentation shall be made. 
If the second request is not complied with by the end of 43 months from 
the date the application for temporary residence, Form I-687, was 
approved the application for permanent residence will be adjudicated on 
the basis of the existing record.
    (e) Interview. Each applicant regardless of age, must appear at the 
appropriate Service office and must be fingerprinted for the purpose of

[[Page 501]]

issuance of Form I-551. Each applicant shall be interviewed by an 
immigration officer, except that the adjudicative interview may be 
waived for a child under 14, or when it is impractical because of the 
health or advanced age of the applicant. An applicant failing to appear 
for the scheduled interview may, for good cause, be afforded another 
interview. Where an applicant fails to appear for two scheduled 
interviews, his or her application shall be held in abeyance until the 
end of 43 months from the date the application for temporary residence 
was approved and adjudicated on the basis of the existing record.
    (f) Numerical limitations. The numerical limitations of sections 201 
and 202 of the Act do not apply to the adjustment of aliens to lawful 
permanent resident status under section 245A(b) of the Act.
    (g) Applicability of exclusion grounds--(1) Grounds of exclusion not 
to be applied. The following paragraphs of section 212(a) of the Act 
shall not apply to applicants for adjustment of status from temporary 
resident to permanent resident status: (14) workers entering without 
labor certification; (20) immigrants not in possession of valid entry 
documents; (21) visas issued without compliance of section 203; (25) 
illiterates; and (32) graduates of non-accredited medical schools.
    (2) Waiver of grounds of excludability. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the Service may waive any provision of 
section 212(a) of the Act only in the case of individual aliens for 
humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when the granting of 
such a waiver is otherwise in the public interest. In any case where a 
provision of section 212(a) of the Act has been waived in connection 
with an alien's application for lawful temporary resident status under 
section 245A(a) of the Act, no additional waiver of the same ground of 
excludability will be required when the alien applies for permanent 
resident status under section 245A(b)(1) of the Act. In the event that 
the alien was excludable under any provision of section 212(a) of the 
Act at the time of temporary residency and failed to apply for a waiver 
in connection with the application for temporary resident status, or 
becomes excludable subsequent to the date temporary residence was 
granted, a waiver of the ground of excludability, if available, will be 
required before permanent resident status may be granted.
    (3) Grounds of exclusion that may not be waived. Notwithstanding any 
other provisions of the Act the following provisions of section 212(a) 
of the Act may not be waived by the Attorney General under paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section:
    (i) Paragraphs (9) and (10) (criminals);
    (ii) Paragraph (15) (public charge) except for an alien who is or 
was an aged, blind, or disabled individual (as defined in section 
1614(a)(1) of the Social Security Act);
    (iii) Paragraph (23) (narcotics), except for a single offense of 
simple possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana;
    (iv) Paragraphs (27) (prejudicial to the public interest), (28) 
(communists), and (29) (subversives);
    (v) Paragraph (33) (participated in Nazi persecution).
    (4) Determination of Likely to become a public charge and Special 
Rule. Prior to use of the special rule for determination of public 
charge, paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, an alien must first be 
determined to be excludable under section 212(a)(15) of the Act. If the 
applicant is determined to be likely to become a public charge, he or 
she may still be admissible under the terms of the Special Rule.
    (i) In determining whether an alien is likely to become a public 
charge financial responsibility of the alien is to be established by 
examining the totality of the alien's circumstances at the time of his 
or her application for legalization. The existence or absence of a 
particular factor should never be the sole criteria for determining if 
an alien is likely to become a public charge. The determination of 
financial responsibility should be a prospective evaluation based on the 
alien's age, health, income, and vocation.
    (ii) The Special Rule for determination of public charge, paragraph 
(g)(4)(iii) of this section, is to be applied only after an initial 
determination that the alien is inadmissible

[[Page 502]]

under the provisions of section 212(a)(15) of the act.
    (iii) Special Rule. An alien who has a consistent employment history 
which shows the ability to support himself or herself even though his or 
her income may be below the poverty level is not excludable under 
paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section. The alien's employment history 
need not be continuous in that it is uninterrupted. It should be 
continuous in the sense that the alien shall be regularly attached to 
the workforce, has an income over a substantial period of the applicable 
time, and has demonstrated the capacity to exist on his or her income 
without recourse to public cash assistance. The Special Rule is 
prospective in that the Service shall determine, based on the alien's 
history, whether he or she is likely to become a public charge. Past 
acceptance of public cash assistance within a history of consistent 
employment will enter into this decision. The weight given in 
considering applicability of the public charge provisions will depend on 
many factors, but the length of time an applicant has received public 
cash assistance will constitute a significant factor. It is not 
necessary to file a waiver in order to apply the Special Rule for 
Determination of Public Charge.
    (5) Public cash assistance and criminal history verification. 
Declarations by an applicant that he or she has not been the recipient 
of public cash assistance and/or has not had a criminal record are 
subject to a verification of facts by the Service. The applicant must 
agree to fully cooperate in the verification process. Failure to assist 
the Service in verifying information necessary for proper adjudication 
may result in denial of the application.
    (h) Departure. An applicant for adjustment to lawful permanent 
resident status under section 245A(b)(1) of the Act who was granted 
lawful temporary resident status under section 245A(a) of the Act, shall 
be permitted to return to the United States after such brief and casual 
trips abroad, as long as the alien reflects a continuing intention to 
adjust to lawful permanent resident status. However, such absences from 
the United States must not exceed the periods of time specified in 
Sec. 245a.3(b)(2) of this chapter in order for the alien to maintain 
continuous residence as specified in the Act.
    (i) Decision. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the 
decision, and, if the application is denied, of the reason therefor. 
Applications for permanent residence under this chapter will not be 
denied at local INS offices (districts, suboffices, and legalization 
offices) until the entire record of proceeding has been reviewed. An 
application will not be denied if the denial is based on adverse 
information not previously furnished to the Service by the alien without 
providing the alien an opportunity to rebut the adverse information and 
to present evidence in his or her behalf. If inconsistencies are found 
between information submitted with the adjustment application and 
information previously furnished to the Service, the applicant shall be 
afforded the opportunity to explain discrepancies or rebut any adverse 
information. A party affected under this part by an adverse decision is 
entitled to file an appeal on Form I-694. If an application is denied, 
work authorization will be granted until a final decision has been 
rendered on an appeal or until the end of the appeal period if no appeal 
is filed. An applicant whose appeal period has ended is no longer 
considered to be an Eligible Legalized Alien for the purposes of the 
administration of State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants (SLIAG) 
funding. An alien whose application is denied will not be required to 
surrender his or her temporary resident card (I-688) until such time as 
the appeal period has tolled, or until expiration date of the I-688, 
whichever date is later. After exhaustion of an appeal, an applicant who 
believes that the grounds for denial have been overcome may submit 
another application with fee, provided that the application is submitted 
within his or her eligibility period.
    (j) Appeal process. An adverse decision under this part may be 
appealed to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative 
Appeals Unit) the appellate authority designated in Sec. 103.1(f)(2). 
Any appeal shall be submitted to the Regional Processing Facility with 
the required fee within thirty (30)

[[Page 503]]

days after service of the Notice of Denial in accordance with the 
procedures of Sec. 103.3(a) of this chapter. An appeal received after 
the thirty (30) day period has tolled will not be accepted. The thirty 
(30) day period for submitting an appeal begins three days after the 
notice of denial is mailed. If a review of the Record of Proceeding 
(ROP) is requested by the alien or his or her legal representative and 
an appeal has been properly filed, an additional thirty (30) days will 
be allowed for this review from the time the Record of Proceeding is 
photocopied and mailed. A brief may be submitted with the appeal form or 
submitted up to thirty (30) calendar days from the date of receipt of 
the appeal form at the Regional Processing Facility. Briefs filed after 
submission of the appeal should be mailed directly to the Regional 
Processing Facility. For good cause shown, the time within which a brief 
supporting an appeal may be submitted may be extended by the Director of 
the Regional Processing Facility.
    (k) Motions. The Regional Processing Facility director may reopen 
and reconsider any adverse decision sua sponte. When an appeal to the 
Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit) has 
been filed, the INS director of the Regional Processing Facility may 
issue a new decision that will grant the benefit which has been 
requested. The director's new decision must be served on the appealing 
party within forty-five (45) days of receipt of any briefs and/or new 
evidence, or upon expiration of the time allowed for the submission of 
any briefs.
    (l) Certifications. The Regional Processing Facility director or 
district director may, in accordance with Sec. 103.4 of this chapter, 
certify a decision to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations 
(Administrative Appeals Unit) when the case involves an unusually 
complex or novel question of law or fact. The decision on an appealed 
case subsequently remanded back to either the Regional Processing 
Facility director or the district director will be certified to the 
Administrative Appeals Unit.
    (m) Date of adjustment to permanent residence. The status of an 
alien whose application for permanent resident status is approved shall 
be adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident as of the date of 
filing of the application for permanent residence or the eligibility 
date, whichever is later. For purposes of making application to petition 
for naturalization, the continuous residence requirements for 
naturalization shall begin as of the date the alien's status is adjusted 
to that of a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence under this 
part.
    (n) Limitation on access to information and confidentiality. (1) No 
person other than a sworn officer or employee of the Department of 
Justice or bureau of agency thereof, will be permitted to examine 
individual applications. For purposes of this part, any individual 
employed under contract by the Service to work in connection with the 
Legalization Program shall be considered an employee of the Department 
of Justice or bureau or agency thereof.
    (2) No information furnished pursuant to an application for 
permanent resident status under this section shall be used for any 
purpose except: (i) To make a determination on the application; or (ii) 
for the enforcement of the provisions encompassed in section 245A(c)(6) 
of the Act, except as provided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section.
    (3) If a determination is made by the Service that the alien has, in 
connection with his or her application, engaged in fraud or willful 
misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, knowingly provided 
a false writing or document in making his or her application, knowingly 
made a false statement or representation, or engaged in any other 
activity prohibited by section 245A(c)(6) of the Act, the Service shall 
refer the matter to the United States Attorney for prosecution of the 
alien and/or of any person who created or supplied a false writing or 
document for use in an application for adjustment of status under this 
part.
    (4) Information contained in granted legalization files may be used 
by the Service at a later date to make a decision (i) On an immigrant 
visa petition or other status filed by the applicant under section 
204(a) of the Act; (ii) On a naturalization application submitted

[[Page 504]]

by the applicant; (iii) For the preparation of reports to Congress under 
section 404 of IRCA, or; (iv) For the furnishing of information, at the 
discretion of the Attorney General, in the same manner and circumstances 
as census information may be disclosed by the Secretary of Commerce 
under section 8 of title 13, Unites States Code.
    (o) Rescission. Rescission of adjustment of status under 245a shall 
occur under the guidelines established in section 246 of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 245a.4  Adjustment to lawful resident status of certain nationals of countries for which extended voluntary departure has been made available.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section: (1) Act means the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Immigration Reform 
and Control Act of 1986.
    (2) Service means the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
    (3) Resided continuously means that the alien shall be regarded as 
having resided continuously in the United States if, at the time of 
filing of the application for temporary resident status:
    (i) No single absence from the United States has exceeded 45 days, 
and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded 180 days between July 
21, 1984, through the date the application for temporary resident status 
is filed, unless the alien can establish that due to emergent reasons, 
his or her return to the United States could not be accomplished within 
the time period allowed;
    (ii) The alien was maintaining residence in the United States; and
    (iii) The alien's departure from the United States was not based on 
an order of deportation.

An alien who has been absent from the United States in accordance with 
the Service's advance parole procedures shall not be considered as 
having interrupted his or her continuous residence as required at the 
time of filing an application. An alien who, after appearing for a 
scheduled interview to obtain an immigrant visa at a Consulate or 
Embassy in Canada or Mexico but who subsequently is not issued an 
immigrant visa and who is paroled back into the United States pursuant 
to the stateside criteria program, shall be considered as having resided 
continuously.
    (4) Continous residence means that the alien shall be regarded as 
having resided continously in the United States if, at the time of 
applying for adjustment from temporary residence to permanent resident 
status: No single absence from the United States has exceeded 30 days, 
and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded 90 days between the 
date on which lawful temporary resident status was granted and the date 
permanent resident status was applied for, unless the alien can 
establish that due to emergent reasons or extenuating circumstances 
beyond his or her control, the return to the United States could not be 
accomplished within the time period(s) allowed. A single absence from 
the United States of more than 30 days, and aggregate absences of more 
than 90 days during the period for which continuous residence is 
required for adjustment to permanent resident status, shall break the 
continuity of such residence unless the temporary resident can establish 
to the satisfaction of the district director that he or she did not, in 
fact, abandon his or her residence in the United States during such 
period.
    (5) To make a determination means obtaining and reviewing all 
information required to adjudicate an application for the benefit sought 
and making a decision thereon. If fraud, willful misrepresentation or 
concealment of a material fact, knowingly providing a false writing or 
document, knowingly making a false statement or representation, or any 
other activity prohibited by the Act is established during the process 
of making the determination on the application, the Service shall refer 
the matter to the United States Attorney for prosecution of the alien or 
of any person who created or supplied a false writing or document for 
use in an application for adjustment of status under this part.
    (6) Continuous physical presence means actual continuous presence in 
the United States since December 22, 1987,

[[Page 505]]

until filing of any application for adjustment of status. Aliens who 
were outside of the United States after enactment may apply for 
temporary residence if they reentered prior to March 21, 1988, provided 
they meet the continuous residence requirements, and are otherwise 
eligible for legalization.
    (7) Brief, casual, and innocent means a departure authorized by the 
Service (advance parole) subsequent to March 21, 1988, for not more than 
30 days for legitimate emergency or humanitarian purposes unless a 
further period of authorized departure has been granted in the 
discretion of the district director or a departure was beyond the 
alien's control.
    (8) Brief and casual means temporary trips abroad as long as the 
alien establishes a continuing intention to adjust to lawful permanent 
resident status. However, such absences must not exceed the specific 
periods of time required in order to maintain continuous residence.
    (9) Certain nationals of countries for which extended voluntary 
departure has been made available on the basis of a nationality group 
determination at any time during the 5-year period ending on November 1, 
1987 is limited to nationals of Poland, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and 
Uganda.
    (10) Public cash assistance means income or need-based monetary 
assistance to include, but not limited to, supplemental security income 
received by the alien through federal, state, or local programs designed 
to meet subsistence levels. It does not include assistance in kind, such 
as food stamps, public housing, or other non-cash benefits, nor does it 
include work related compensation or certain types of medical assistance 
(Medicare, Medicaid, emergency treatment, services to pregnant women or 
children under 18 years of age, or treatment in the interest of public 
health).
    (11) Designated entity means any state, local, church, community, 
farm labor organization, voluntary organization, association of 
agricultural employers or individual determined by the Service to be 
qualified to assist aliens in the preparation of applications for 
legalization status.
    (12) Through the passage of time means through the expiration date 
of the nonimmigrant permission to remain in the United States, including 
any extensions and/or change of status.
    (13) Prima facie eligibility means eligibility is established if the 
applicant presents a completed I-687 and specific factual information 
which in the absence of rebuttal will establish a claim of eligibility 
under this part.
    (b) Application for temporary residence--(1) Application for 
temporary residence. (i) An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, 
Ethiopia, or Afghanistan who has resided continuously in the United 
States since prior to July 2l, 1984, and who believes that he or she 
meets the eligibility requirements of section 245A of the Act must make 
application within the 21-month period beginning on March 21, 1988, and 
ending on December 22, 1989.
    (ii) An alien who fails to file an application for adjustment of 
status to that of a temporary resident under Sec. 245A.4 of this part 
during the time period, will be statutorily ineligible for such 
adjustment of status.
    (2) Eligibility (i) The following categories of aliens who are not 
otherwise excludable under section 212(a) of the Act are eligible to 
apply for status to that of a person admitted for temporary residence:
    (A) An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or 
Afghanistan, (other than an alien who entered as a nonimmigrant) who 
establishes that he or she entered the United States prior to July 21, 
1984, and who has thereafter resided continuously in the United States, 
and who has been physically present in the United States from December 
22, 1987, until the date of filing the application.
    (B) An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or 
Afghanistan, and establishes that he or she entered the United States as 
a nonimmigrant prior to July 21, 1984, and whose period of authorized 
admission expired through the passage of time prior to January 21, 1985, 
and who has thereafter resided continuously in the United States, and 
who has been physically present in the United States from December 22, 
1987, until the date of filing the application.

[[Page 506]]

    (C) An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or 
Afghanistan, and establishes that he or she entered the United States as 
a nonimmigrant prior to July 21, 1984, and who applied for asylum prior 
to July 21, 1984, and who has thereafter resided continuously in the 
United States, and who has been physically present in the United States 
from December 22, 1987, until the date of filing the application.
    (D) An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or 
Afghanistan, who would otherwise be eligible for temporary resident 
status and who establishes that he or she resided continuously in the 
United States prior to July 21, 1984, and who subsequently reentered the 
United States as a nonimmigrant in order to return to an unrelinquished 
residence. An alien described in this paragraph must have received a 
waiver of 212(a)(19) as an alien who entered the United States by fraud.
    (E) An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or 
Afghanistan, and was a nonimmigrant who entered the United States in the 
classification A, A-1, A-2, G, G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4, for Duration of 
Status (D/S), and whose qualifying employment terminated or who ceased 
to be recognized by the Department of State as being entitled to such 
classification prior to January 21, 1985, and who thereafter continued 
to reside in the United States.
    (F) An alien who is a national of Poland, Uganda, Ethiopia, or 
Afghanistan, and who was a nonimmigrant who entered the United States as 
an F, F-1, or F-2 for Duration of Status (D/S), and who completed a full 
course of studies, including practical training (if any), and whose time 
period to depart the United States after completion of studies expired 
prior to January 21, 1985, and who has thereafter continued to reside in 
the United States. Those students placed in a nunc pro tunc retroactive 
student status which would otherwise preclude their eligibility for 
legalization under this section, must present evidence that they had 
otherwise terminated their status during the requisite time period. A 
dependent F-2 alien otherwise eligible who was admitted into the United 
States with a specific time period, as opposed to duration of status, 
documented on Service Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record that extended 
beyond July 21, 1984 is considered eligible if the principal F-1 alien 
is found eligible.
    (3) Ineligible aliens. (i) An alien who has been convicted of a 
felony, or three or more misdemeanors.
    (ii) An alien who has assisted in the persecution of any person or 
persons on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a 
particular social group, or political opinion.
    (iii) An alien excludable under the provisions of section 212(a) of 
the Act whose grounds of excludability may not be waived.
    (4) Documentation. Evidence to support an alien's eligibility for 
temporary residence status shall include documents establishing proof of 
identity, proof of nationality, proof of residence, and proof of 
financial responsibility, as well as photographs, a completed 
fingerprint card (Form FD-258), and a completed medical report of 
examination (Form I-693). All documentation submitted will be subject to 
Service verification. Applications submitted with unverifiable 
documentation may be denied. Failure by an applicant to authorize 
release to INS of information protected by the Privacy Act and/or 
related laws in order for INS to adjudicate a claim may result in denial 
of the benefit sought. Acceptable supporting documents for the four 
categories of documentation are discussed as follows:
    (i) Proof of identity. Evidence to establish identity is listed 
below in descending order of preference:
    (A) Passport;
    (B) Birth certificate;
    (C) Any national identity document from the alien's country of 
origin bearing photo and fingerprint;
    (D) Driver's license or similar document issued by a state if it 
contains a photo;
    (E) Baptismal Record/Marriage Certificate; or
    (F) Affidavits.
    (ii) Proof of nationality. Evidence to establish nationality is 
listed as follows:
    (A) Passport;
    (B) Birth certificate;

[[Page 507]]

    (C) Any national identity document from the alien's country of 
origin bearing photo and fingerprint;
    (D) Other credible documents, including those created by, or in the 
possession of the INS, or any other documents (excluding affidavits) 
that, when taken singly, or together as a whole, establish the alien's 
nationality.
    (iii) Assumed names--(A) General. In cases where an applicant claims 
to have met any of the eligibility criteria under an assumed name, the 
applicant has the burden of proving that the applicant was in fact the 
person who used that name. The applicant's true identity is established 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this 
section. The assumed name must appear in the documentation provided by 
the applicant to establish eligibility. To meet the requirement of this 
paragraph, documentation must be submitted to prove the common identity, 
i.e., that the assumed name was in fact used by the applicant.
    (B) Proof of common identity. The most persuasive evidence is a 
document issued in the assumed name which identifies the applicant by 
photograph, fingerprint, or detailed physical description. Other 
evidence which will be considered are affidavit(s) by a person or 
persons other than the applicant, made under oath, which identify the 
affiant by name and address, state the affiant's relationship to the 
applicant and the basis of the affiant's knowledge of the applicant's 
use of the assumed name. Affidavits accompanied by a photograph which 
has been identified by the affiant as the individual known to the 
affiant under the assumed name in question will carry greater weight.
    (iv) Proof of residence. Evidence to establish proof of continuous 
residence in the United States during the requisite period of time may 
consist of any combination of the following:
    (A) Past employment records, which may consist of pay stubs, W-2 
Forms, certification of the filing of Federal income tax returns on IRS 
Form 6166, a state verification of the filing of state income tax 
returns, letters from employer(s) or, if the applicant has been in 
business for himself or herself, letters from banks and other firms with 
whom he or she has done business. In all of the above, the name of the 
alien and the name of the employer or other interested organizations 
must appear on the form or letter, as well as relevant dates. Letters 
from employers should be on employer letterhead stationery, if the 
employer has such stationery, and must include:
    (1) Alien's address at the time of employment;
    (2) Exact period of employment;
    (3) Periods of layoff;
    (4) Duties with the company;
    (5) Whether or not the information was taken from official company 
records; and
    (6) Where records are located, whether the Service may have access 
to the records.

If the records are unavailable, an affidavit form letter stating that 
the alien's employment records are unavailable and why such records are 
unavailable may be accepted in lieu of paragraphs (b)(4)(iv)(A)(5) and 
(6) of this section. This affidavit form letter shall be signed, 
attested to by the employer under penalty of perjury, and shall state 
the employer's willingness to come forward and give testimony if 
requested.
    (B) Utility bills (gas, electric, phone, etc.) receipts, or letters 
from companies showing the dates during which the applicant received 
service are acceptable documentation.
    (C) School records (letters, report cards, etc.) from the schools 
that the applicant or his or her children have attended in the United 
States must show the name of school and periods of school attendance.
    (D) Hospital or medical records showing treatment or hospitalization 
of the applicant or his or her children must show the name of the 
medical facility or physician and the date(s) of the treatment or 
hospitalization.
    (E) Attestations by churches, unions, or other organizations as to 
the applicant's residence by letter which:
    (1) Identify applicant by name;
    (2) Are signed by an official (whose title is shown);
    (3) Show inclusive dates of membership;
    (4) State the address where applicant resided during membership 
period;

[[Page 508]]

    (5) Include the seal of the organization impressed on the letter or 
the letterhead of the organization, if the organization has letterhead 
stationery;
    (6) Establish how the author knows the applicant; and
    (7) Establish the origin of the information being attested to.
    (F) Additional documents to support the applicant's claim may 
include:
    (1) Money order receipts for money sent into or out of the country;
    (2) Passport entries;
    (3) Birth certificates of children born in the United States;
    (4) Bank books with dated transactions;
    (5) Letters or correspondence between applicant and other person or 
organization;
    (6) Social Security card;
    (7) Selective Service card;
    (8) Automobile license receipts, title, vehicle registration, etc.;
    (9) Deeds, mortgages, contracts to which applicant has been a party;
    (10) Tax receipts;
    (11) Insurance policies, receipts, or letters; and
    (12) Any other relevant document.
    (v) Proof of financial responsibility. An applicant for adjustment 
of status under this part is subject to the provisions of section 
212(a)(15) of the Act relating to excludability of aliens likely to 
become public charges. Generally, the evidence of employment submitted 
under paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this section will serve to demonstrate 
the alien's financial responsibility during the documented period(s) of 
employment. If the alien's period(s) of residence in the United States 
include significant gaps in employment or if there is reason to believe 
that the alien may have received public assistance while employed, the 
alien may be required to provide proof that he or she has not received 
public cash assistance. An applicant for residence who is determined 
likely to become a public charge and is unable to overcome this 
determination after application of the Special Rule under paragraph 
(b)(11)(iv)(C) of this section will be denied adjustment. The burden of 
proof to demonstrate the inapplicability of this provision of law lies 
with the applicant who may provide:
    (A) Evidence of a history of employment (i.e., employment letter, W-
2 forms, income tax returns, etc.);
    (B) Evidence that he/she is self-supporting (i.e., bank statements, 
stocks, other assets, etc.); or
    (C) Form I-134. Affidavit of Support, completed by a spouse on 
behalf of the applicant and/or children of the applicant or a parent in 
behalf of children which guarantees complete or partial financial 
support. Acceptance of the Affidavit of Support shall be extended to 
other family members in unusual family circumstances.

Generally, the evidence of employment submitted under paragraph 
(b)(4)(iv)(A) of this section will serve to demonstrate the alien's 
financial responsibility during the documented period(s) of employment. 
If the alien's period(s) of residence in the United States include 
significant gaps in employment or if there is reason to believe that the 
alien may have received public assistance while employed, the alien may 
be required to provide proof that he or she has not received public cash 
assistance. An applicant for residence who is likely to become a public 
charge will be denied adjustment.
    (vi) Burden of proof. An alien applying for adjustment of status 
under this part has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the 
evidence that he or she has resided in the United States for the 
requisite periods, is admissible to the United States under the 
provisions of section 245A of the Act, and is otherwise eligible for 
adjustment of status under this section. The inference to be drawn from 
the documentation provided shall depend on the extent of the 
documentation, its credibility and amenability to verification.
    (vii) Evidence. The sufficiency of all evidence produced by the 
applicant will be judged according to its probative value and 
credibility. To meet his or her burden of proof, an applicant must 
provide evidence of eligibility apart from his or her own testimony. In 
judging the probative value and credibility of the evidence submitted, 
greater weight will be given to the submission of original 
documentation.
    (5) Filing of application. (i) The application must be filed on Form 
I-687 at an office of a designated entity or at a

[[Page 509]]

Service office within the jurisdiction of the district where the 
applicant resides. If the application is filed with a designated entity, 
the alien must have consented to having the designated entity forward 
the application to the Service office. In the case of applications filed 
at a Service office, the district director may, at his or her 
discretion:
    (A) Require the applicant to file the application in person; or
    (B) Require the applicant to file the application by mail; or
    (C) Permit the filing of applications whether by mail or in person.

The applicant must appear for a personal interview at the Service office 
as scheduled. If the applicant is 14 years of age or older, the 
application must be accompanied by a completed Form FD-258 (Applicant 
Card).
    (ii) At the time of the interview, whenever possible, original 
documents must be submitted except the following: Official government 
records; employment or employment-related records maintained by 
employers, union, or collective bargaining organizations; medical 
records; school records maintained by a school or school board; or other 
records maintained by a party other than the applicant. Copies of 
records maintained by parties other than the applicant which are 
submitted in evidence must be certified as true and correct by such 
parties and must bear their seal or signature or the signature and title 
of persons authorized to act in their behalf. If at the time of the 
interview the return of the original document is desired by the 
applicant, the document must be accompanied by notarized copies or 
copies certified true and correct by a qualified designated entity or by 
the alien's representative in the format prescribed in Sec. 204.2(j)(1) 
or (2) of this chapter. At the discretion of the district director, 
original documents, even if accompanied by certified copies, may be 
temporarily retained for forensic examination by the Document Analysis 
Unit at the Regional Processing Facility having jurisdiction over the 
Service office to which the documents were submitted.
    (iii) A separate application (I-687) must be filed by each eligible 
applicant. All fees required by Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter must be 
submitted in the exact amount in the form of a money order, cashier's 
check, or certified bank check, made payable to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. No personal checks or currency will be accepted. 
Fees will not be waived or refunded under any circumstances.
    (6) Filing date of application. The date the alien submits a 
completed application to a Service office or designated entity shall be 
considered the filing date of the application, provided that in the case 
of an application filed at a designated entity the alien has consented 
to having the designated entity forward the application to the Service 
office having jurisdiction over the location of the alien's residence. 
Designated entities are required to forward completed applications to 
the appropriate Service office within 60 days of receipt.
    (7) Selective Service registration. At the time of filing an 
application under this section, male applicants over the age of 17 and 
under the age of 26, are required to be registered under the Military 
Selective Service Act. An applicant shall present evidence that he has 
previously registered under that Act in the form of a letter of 
acknowledgement from the Selective Service System, or such alien shall 
present a completed and signed Form SSS-1 at the time of filing Form I-
687 with the Immigration and Naturalization Service or a designated 
entity. Form SSS-1 will be forwarded to the Selective Service System by 
the Service.
    (8) Continuous residence. (i) For the purpose of this Act, an 
applicant for temporary residence status shall be regarded as having 
resided continuously in the United States if, at the time of filing of 
the application:
    (A) No single absence from the United States has exceeded 45 days, 
and the aggregate of all absences has not exceeded 180 days between July 
2l, 1984, through the date the application for temporary resident status 
is filed, unless the alien can establish that due to emergent reasons, 
his or her return to the United States could not be accomplished within 
the time period allowed;

[[Page 510]]

    (B) The alien was maintaining a residence in the United States; and
    (C) The alien's departure from the United States was not based on an 
order of deportation.
    (ii) An alien who has been absent from the United States in 
accordance with the Service's advance parole procedures shall not be 
considered as having interrupted his or her continuous residence as 
required at the time of filing an application under this section.
    (9) Medical examination. (i) An applicant under this part shall be 
required to submit to an examination by a designated civil surgeon at no 
expense to the government. The designated civil surgeon shall report on 
the findings of the mental and physical condition of the applicant and 
the determination of the alien's immunization status on Form I-693, 
``Medical Examination of Aliens Seeking Adjustment of Status, (Pub. L. 
99-603)''. Results of the medical examination must be presented to the 
Service at the time of interview and shall be incorporated into the 
record. Any applicant certified under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) or 
(5) of section 212(a) of the Act may appeal to a Board of Medical 
Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as provided in section 234 of 
the Act and part 235 of this chapter.
    (ii) All applicants who file for temporary resident status are 
required to include the results of a serological test for the HIV virus 
on the I-693. All HIV-positive applicants shall be advised that a waiver 
is available and shall be provided with the opportunity to apply for a 
waiver.
    (10) Interview. Each applicant, regardless of age, must appear at 
the appropriate Service office and must be fingerprinted for the purpose 
of issuance of an employment authorization document and Form I-688. Each 
applicant shall be interviewed by an immigration officer, except that 
the interview may be waived for a child under 14 years of age, or when 
it is impractical because of the health or advanced age of the 
applicant.
    (11) Applicability of exclusion grounds--(i) Grounds of exclusion 
not to be applied. Paragraphs (14), (workers entering without labor 
certification); (20), (immigrants not in possession of a valid entry 
document); (21), (visas issued without compliance with section 203); 
(25), (illiterates); and (32) (graduates of non-accredited medical 
schools) of section 212(a) of the Act shall not apply to applicants for 
temporary resident status.
    (ii) Waiver of grounds of exclusion. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(11)(iii) of this section, the Attorney General may waive any other 
provision of section 212(a) of the Act only in the case of individual 
aliens for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when the 
granting of such a waiver is in the public interest. If an alien is 
excludable on grounds which may be waived as set forth in this 
paragraph, he or she shall be advised of the procedures for applying for 
a waiver of grounds of excludability on Form I-690. When an application 
for waiver of grounds of excludability is filed jointly with an 
application for temporary residence under this section, it shall be 
accepted for processing at the Service office. If an application for 
waiver of grounds of excludability is submitted after the alien's 
preliminary interview at the Service office, it shall be forwarded to 
the appropriate Regional Processing Facility. All applications for 
waivers of grounds of excludability must be accompanied by the correct 
fee in the exact amount. All fees for applications filed in the United 
States must be in the form of a money order, cashier's check, or bank 
check. No personal checks or currency will be accepted. Fees will not be 
waived or refunded under any circumstances. An application for waiver of 
grounds of excludability under this part shall be approved or denied by 
the director of the Regional Processing Facility in whose jurisdiction 
the alien's application for adjustment of status was filed except that 
in cases involving clear statutory ineligibility or fraud, such 
application may be denied by the district director in whose jurisdiction 
the application is filed, and in cases returned to a Service office for 
re-interview, such application may be approved at the discretion of the 
district director. The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, 
if the application is denied, of the reason therefore. Appeal from an 
adverse decision under this part may be taken by

[[Page 511]]

the applicant on Form I-694 within 30 days after the service of the 
notice only to the Service's Administrative Appeals Unit pursuant to the 
provisions of section 103.3(a) of this chapter.
    (iii) Grounds of exclusion that may not be waived. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of the Act, the following provisions of section 
212(a) may not be waived by the Attorney General under paragraph 
(b)(11)(ii) of this section:
    (A) Paragraphs (9) and (10) (criminals);
    (B) Paragraph (23) (narcotics) except for a single offense of simple 
possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana;
    (C) Paragraphs (27) (prejudicial to the public interest), (28) 
(communist), and (29) (subversive);
    (D) Paragraph (33) (participated in Nazi persecution).
    (iv) Determination of Likely to become a public charge and the 
special rule. (A) Prior to use of the special rule for determination of 
public charge, an alien must first be determined to be excludable under 
section 212(a)(15) of the Act. If the applicant is determined to be 
likely to become a public charge, he or she may still be admissible 
under the terms of the Special Rule.
    (B) In determining whether an alien is likely to become a public 
charge, financial responsibility of the alien is to be established by 
examining the totality of the alien's circumstances at the time of his 
or her application for legalization. The existence or absence of a 
particular factor should never be the sole criterion for determining if 
an alien is likely to become a public charge. The determination of 
financial responsibility should be a prospective evaluation based on the 
alien's age, health, income and vocation.
    (C) An alien who has a consistent employment history which shows the 
ability to support himself or herself even though his or her income may 
be below the poverty level may be admissible under this section. The 
alien's employment history need not be continuous in that it is 
uninterrupted. It should be continuous in the sense that the alien shall 
be regularly attached to the workforce, has an income over a substantial 
period of the applicable time, and has demonstrated the capacity to 
exist on his or her income without recourse to public cash assistance. 
The Special Rule is prospective in that the Service shall determine, 
based on the alien's history, whether he or she is likely to become a 
public charge. Past acceptance of public cash assistance within a 
history of consistent employment will enter into this decision. The 
weight given in considering applicability of the public charge 
provisions will depend on many factors, but the length of time an 
applicant has received public cash assistance will constitute a 
significant factor. It is not necessary to file a waiver in order to 
apply the Special Rule for Determination of Public Charge.
    (v) Public assistance and criminal history verification. 
Declarations by an applicant that he or she has not been the recipient 
of public cash assistance and/or has not had a criminal record are 
subject to a verification of facts by the Service. The applicant must 
agree to fully cooperate in the verification process. Failure to assist 
the Service in verifying information necessary for the adjudication of 
the application may result in a denial of the application.
    (12) Continuous physical presence since December 22, 1987. (i) An 
alien applying for adjustment to temporary resident status must 
establish that he or she has been continuously physically present in the 
United States since December 22, 1987. Aliens who were outside of the 
United States on the date of enactment or departed the United States 
after enactment may apply for legalization if they reentered prior to 
March 21, 1988, and meet the continuous residence requirements and are 
otherwise eligible for legalization.
    (ii) A brief, casual and innocent absence means a departure 
authorized by the Service (advance parole) subsequent to March 21, 1988, 
of not more than thirty (30) days for legitimate emergency or 
humanitarian purposes unless a further period of authorized departure 
has been granted in the discretion of the district director or a 
departure was beyond the alien's control.
    (13) Departure. (i) During the time period from the date that an 
alien's application establishing prima facie eligibility for temporary 
resident status is reviewed at a Service office and the date status as a 
temporary resident is

[[Page 512]]

granted, the alien applicant can be readmitted to the United States 
provided his or her departure was authorized under the Service's advance 
parole provisions contained in Sec. 212.5(e) of this chapter.
    (ii) An alien whose application for temporary resident status has 
been approved may be admitted to the United States upon return as a 
returning temporary resident provided he or she:
    (A) Is not under deportation proceedings, such proceedings having 
been instituted subsequent to the approval of temporary resident status. 
A temporary resident alien will not be considered deported if that alien 
departs the United States while under an outstanding order of 
deportation issued prior to the approval of temporary resident status;
    (B) Has not been absent from the United States for more than 30 days 
on the date application for admission is made;
    (C) Has not been absent from the United States for an aggregate 
period of more than 90 days since the date the alien was granted lawful 
temporary resident status;
    (D) Presents Form I-688;
    (E) Presents himself or herself for inspection; and
    (F) Is otherwise admissible.
    (iii) The periods of time in paragraphs (b)(13)(ii)(B) and (C) of 
this section may be waived at the discretion of the Attorney General in 
cases where the absence from the United States was due merely to a brief 
and casual trip abroad due to emergent or extenuating circumstances 
beyond the alien's control.
    (14) Employment and travel authorization--(i) General. Authorization 
for employment and travel abroad for temporary resident status 
applicants under this section may be granted only by a Service office. 
INS district directors will determine the Service location for the 
completion of processing travel documentation. In the case of an 
application which has been filed with a designated entity, employment 
authorization may be granted by the Service only after the application 
has been properly received at the Service office.
    (ii) Employment and travel authorization prior to the granting of 
temporary resident status. (A) Permission to travel abroad and accept 
employment may be granted to the applicant after an interview has been 
conducted in connection with an application establishing prima facie 
eligibility for temporary resident status. Permission to travel abroad 
may be granted in emergent circumstances in accordance with the 
Service's advance parole provisions contained in Sec. 212.5(e) of this 
chapter after an interview has been conducted in connection with an 
application establishing prima facie eligibility for temporary resident 
status.
    (B) If an appointment cannot be scheduled within 30 days, 
authorization to accept employment will be granted, valid until the 
scheduled appointment date. The appointment letter will be endorsed with 
the temporary employment authorization. An employment authorization 
document will be given to the applicant after an interview has been 
completed by an immigration officer unless a formal denial is issued by 
a Service office. This temporary employment authorization will be 
restricted to six-months duration, pending final determination on the 
application for temporary resident status.
    (iii) Employment and travel authorization upon grant of temporary 
resident status. Upon grant of an application for adjustment to 
temporary resident status by a Regional Processing Facility, the 
processing facility will forward a notice of approval to the alien at 
his or her last known address, or to his or her legal representative. 
The alien will be required to return to the appropriate INS office, 
surrender the I-688A or employment authorization document previously 
issued, and obtain Form I-688, Temporary Resident Card, authorizing 
employment and travel abroad.
    (iv) Revocation of employment authorization upon denial of temporary 
resident status. Upon denial of an application for adjustment to 
temporary resident status, the alien will be notified that if a timely 
appeal is not submitted, employment authorization shall be automatically 
revoked on the final day of the appeal period. An applicant whose appeal 
period has ended is no longer considered to be an Eligible Legalized

[[Page 513]]

Alien for the purposes of the administration of State Legalization 
Impact Assistance Grants (SLIAG) funding.
    (15) Decision. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the 
decision. If the application is denied, the reason(s) for the decision 
shall be provided to the applicant. An appeal from an adverse decision 
under this part may be taken by the applicant on Form I-694.
    (16) Appeal process. An adverse decision under this part may be 
appealed to the Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative 
Appeals Unit), the appellate authority designated in Sec. 103.1(f)(2). 
Any appeal shall be submitted to the Regional Processing Facility (RPF) 
with the required fee within 30 days after service of the Notice of 
Denial in accordance with the procedures of Sec. 103.3(a) of this 
chapter. An appeal received after the 30-day period will not be 
accepted. The 30-day period for submission of an appeal begins three 
days after the Notice of Denial is mailed as provided in Sec. 103.5a(b) 
of this Act. If a review of the Record of Proceeding (ROP) is requested 
by the alien or his or her legal representative and an appeal has been 
properly filed, an additional 30 days will be allowed for this review 
beginning at the time the ROP is mailed. A brief may be submitted with 
the appeal form or submitted up to 30 calendar days from the date of 
receipt of the appeal form at the RPF. Briefs filed after submission of 
the appeal should be mailed directly to the RPF. For good cause shown, 
the time within which a brief supporting an appeal may be submitted may 
be extended by the Director of the Regional Processing Facility.
    (17) Motions. The Regional Processing Facility director may sua 
sponte reopen and reconsider any adverse decision. When an appeal to the 
Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit) has 
been filed, the INS director of the Regional Processing Facility may 
issue a new decision granting the benefit which has been requested. The 
director's new decision must be served on the appealing party within 45 
days of receipt of any briefs and/or new evidence, or upon expiration of 
the time allowed for the submission of any briefs. Motions to reopen a 
proceeding or reconsider a decision shall not be considered under this 
part.
    (18) Certifications. The Regional Processing Facility director may, 
in accordance with Sec. 103.4 of this chapter, certify a decision to the 
Associate Commissioner, Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit) when 
the case involves an unusually complex or novel question of law or fact. 
The decision on an appealed case subsequently remanded to the Regional 
Processing Facility director will be certified to the Administrative 
Appeals Unit.
    (19) Date of adjustment to temporary residence. The status of an 
alien whose application for temporary resident status is approved shall 
be adjusted to that of a lawful temporary resident as of the date 
indicated on the application fee receipt issued at the Service office.
    (20) Termination of temporary resident status--(i) Termination of 
temporary resident status (General). The status of an alien lawfully 
admitted for temporary residence under Sec. 245a.4 of this part may be 
terminated at any time. It is not necessary that a final order of 
deportation be entered in order to terminate temporary resident status. 
The temporary resident status may be terminated upon the occurrence of 
any of the following:
    (A) It is determined that the alien was ineligible for temporary 
residence under Sec. 245a.4 of this part;
    (B) The alien commits an act which renders him or her inadmissible 
as an immigrant unless a waiver is obtained, as provided in this part;
    (C) The alien is convicted of any felony, or three or more 
misdemeanors;
    (D) The alien fails to file for adjustment of status from temporary 
resident to permanent resident within 31 months of the date he or she 
was granted status as a temporary resident.
    (ii) Procedure. Termination of an alien's status will be made only 
on notice to the alien sent by certified mail directed to his or her 
last known address, and, if applicable, to his or her representative. 
The alien must be given an opportunity to offer evidence in opposition 
to the grounds alleged for termination of his or her status. Evidence in 
opposition must be submitted within 30 days after the service of the 
Notice of Intent to Terminate. If the alien's

[[Page 514]]

status is terminated, the director of the Regional Processing Facility 
shall notify the alien of the decision and the reason for the 
termination, and further notify the alien that any Service Form issued 
to the alien authorizing employment and/or travel abroad, or any Form I-
688, Temporary Resident Card previously issued to the alien will be 
declared void by the director of the Regional Processing Facility within 
30 days if no appeal of the termination decision is filed within that 
period. The alien may appeal the decision to the Associate Commissioner, 
Examinations (Administrative Appeals Unit). Any appeal along with the 
required fee, shall be filed with the Regional Processing Facility 
within 30 days after the service of the notice of termination. If no 
appeal is filed within that period, the official Service document shall 
be deemed void, and must be surrendered without delay to an immigration 
officer or to the issuing office of the Service.
    (iii) Termination not construed as rescission under section 246. For 
the purposes of this part the phrase termination of status of an alien 
granted lawful temporary residence under this section shall not be 
construed to necessitate a rescission of status as described in section 
246 of the Act, and the proceedings required by the regulations issued 
thereunder shall not apply.
    (iv) Return to unlawful status after termination. Termination of the 
status of any alien previously adjusted to lawful temporary residence 
shall act to return such alien to the status held prior to the 
adjustment, and render him or her amenable to exclusion or deportation 
proceedings under sections 236 or 242 of the Act, as appropriate.
    (21) Ineligibility for immigration benefits. An alien whose status 
is adjusted to that of a lawful temporary resident under Sec. 245a.4 of 
this part is not entitled to submit a petition pursuant to section 
203(a)(2), nor is such alien entitled to any other benefit or 
consideration accorded under the Act to aliens lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence.
    (22) Declaration of intending citizen. An alien who has been granted 
the status of temporary resident under Sec. 245a.4 of this part may 
assert a claim of discrimination on the basis of citizenship status 
under section 274B of the Act only if he or she has previously filed 
Form I-772 (Declaration of Intending Citizen) after being granted such 
status. The Declaration of Intending Citizen is not required as a basis 
for filing a petition for naturalization; nor shall it be regarded as a 
right to United States citizenship; nor shall it be regarded as evidence 
of a person's status as a resident.
    (23) Limitation on access to information and confidentiality. (i) No 
person other than a sworn officer or employee of the Department of 
Justice or bureau or agency thereof, will be permitted to examine 
individual applications. For purposes of this part, any individual 
employed under contract by the Service to work in connection with the 
Legalization Program shall be considered an employee of the Department 
of Justice or bureau or agency thereof.
    (ii) No information furnished pursuant to an application for 
temporary or permanent resident status under this section shall be used 
for any purpose except:
    (A) To make a determination on the application; or,
    (B) for the enforcement of the provisions encompassed in section 
245A(c)(6) of the Act, except as provided in paragraph (b)(23)(iii) of 
this section.
    (iii) If a determination is made by the Service that the alien has, 
in connection with his or her application, engaged in fraud or willful 
misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, knowingly provided 
a false writing or document in making his or her application, knowingly 
made a false statement or representation, or engaged in any other 
activity prohibited by section 245A(c)(6) of the Act, the Service shall 
refer the matter to the United States Attorney for prosecution of the 
alien or of any person who created or supplied a false writing or 
document for use in an application for adjustment of status under this 
part.
    (iv) Information contained in granted legalization files may be used 
by the Service at a later date to make a decision on an immigrant visa 
petition (or

[[Page 515]]

other status petition) filed by the applicant under section 204(a), or 
for naturalization applications submitted by the applicant.
    (c) Adjustment from temporary to permanent resident status. The 
provisions of Sec. 245a.3 of this part shall be applied to aliens 
adjusting to permanent residence under this part.

part 2.

    Source: 62 FR 10385, Mar. 6, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 246.1  Notice.

    If it appears to a district director that a person residing in his 
or her district was not in fact eligible for the adjustment of status 
made in his or her case, a proceeding shall be commenced by the personal 
service upon such person of a notice of intent to rescind which shall 
inform him or her of the allegations upon which it is intended to 
rescind the adjustment of his or her status. In such a proceeding the 
person shall be known as the respondent. The notice shall also inform 
the respondent that he or she may submit, within thirty days from the 
date of service of the notice, an answer in writing under oath setting 
forth reasons why such rescission shall not be made, and that he or she 
may, within such period, request a hearing before an immigration judge 
in support of, or in lieu of, his or her written answer. The respondent 
shall further be informed that he or she may have the assistance of or 
be represented by counsel or representative of his or her choice 
qualified under part 292 of this chapter, at no expense to the 
Government, in the preparation of his or her answer or in connection 
with his or her hearing, and that he or she may present such evidence in 
his or her behalf as may be relevant to the rescission.


<R05>
Sec. 246.2  Allegations admitted; no answer filed; no hearing requested.

    If the answer admits the allegations in the notice, or if no answer 
is filed within the thirty-day period, or if no hearing is requested 
within such period, the district director shall rescind the adjustment 
of status previously granted, and no appeal shall lie from his decision.


<R05>
Sec. 246.3  Allegations contested or denied; hearing requested.

    If, within the prescribed time following service of the notice 
pursuant to Sec. 246.1, the respondent has filed an answer which 
contests or denies any allegation in the notice, or a hearing is 
requested, a hearing pursuant to Sec. 246.5 shall be conducted by an 
immigration judge, and the requirements contained

[[Page 517]]

in Secs. 240.3, 240.4, 240.5, 240.6, 240.7, and 240.9 of this chapter 
shall be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 246.4  Immigration judge's authority; withdrawal and substitution.

    In any proceeding conducted under this part, the immigration judge 
shall have authority to interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the 
respondent and other witnesses, to present and receive evidence, to 
determine whether adjustment of status shall be rescinded, to make 
decisions thereon, including an appropriate order, and to take any other 
action consistent with applicable provisions of law and regulations as 
may be appropriate to the disposition of the case. Nothing contained in 
this part shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred on 
immigration judges by the Act. The immigration judge assigned to conduct 
a hearing shall, at any time, withdraw if he or she deems himself or 
herself disqualified. If a hearing has begun but no evidence has been 
adduced other than the notice and answer, if any, pursuant to 
Secs. 246.1 and 246.2, or if an immigration judge becomes unavailable to 
complete his or her duties within a reasonable time, or if at any time 
the respondent consents to a substitution, another immigration judge may 
be assigned to complete the case. The new immigration judge shall 
familiarize himself or herself with the record in the case and shall 
state for the record that he or she is familiar with the record in the 
case.


<R05>
Sec. 246.5  Hearing.

    (a) Service counsel. The Government shall be represented at the 
hearing by a Service counsel who shall have authority to present 
evidence, and to interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the respondent 
and other witnesses. The Service counsel is authorized to appeal from a 
decision of the immigration judge pursuant to Sec. 246.7 and to move for 
reopening or reconsideration pursuant to Sec. 3.23 of this chapter.
    (b) Opening. The immigration judge shall advise the respondent of 
the nature of the proceeding and the legal authority under which it is 
conducted; advise the respondent of his or her right to representation, 
at no expense to the Government, by counsel or representative of his or 
her own choice qualified under part 292 of this chapter and require him 
or her to state then and there whether he or she desires representation; 
advise the respondent that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity 
to examine and object to the evidence against him or her, to present 
evidence in his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses 
presented by the Government; place the respondent under oath; read the 
allegations in the notice to the respondent and explain them in 
nontechnical language, and enter the notice and respondent's answer, if 
any, as exhibits in the record.
    (c) Pleading by respondent. The immigration judge shall require the 
respondent to state for the record whether he or she admits or denies 
the allegations contained in the notice, or any of them, and whether he 
or she concedes that his or her adjustment of status should be 
rescinded. If the respondent admits all of the allegations and concedes 
that the adjustment of status in his or her case should be rescinded 
under the allegations set forth in the notice, and the immigration judge 
is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain, he or she may 
determine that rescission as alleged has been established by the 
respondent's admissions. The allegations contained in the notice shall 
be taken as admitted when the respondent, without reasonable cause, 
fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 246.6  Decision and order.

    The decision of the immigration judge may be oral or written. The 
formal enumeration of findings is not required. The order shall direct 
either that the proceeding be terminated or that the adjustment of 
status be rescinded. Service of the decision and finality of the order 
of the immigration judge shall be in accordance with, and as stated in 
Secs. 240.13 (a) and (b) and 240.14 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 246.7  Appeals.

    Pursuant to 8 CFR part 3, an appeal shall lie from a decision of an 
immigration judge under this part to the Board of Immigration Appeals. 
An appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the

[[Page 518]]

mailing of a written decision or the stating of an oral decision. The 
reasons for the appeal shall be specifically identified in the Notice of 
Appeal (Form EOIR 26); failure to do so may constitute a ground for 
dismissal of the appeal by the Board.


<R05>
Sec. 246.8  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 246.9  Surrender of Form I-551.

    A respondent whose status as a permanent resident has been rescinded 
in accordance with section 246 of the Act and this part, shall, upon 
demand, promptly surrender to the district director having 
administrative jurisdiction over the office in which the action under 
this part was taken, the Form I-551 issued to him or her at the time of

Sec. 247.1  Scope of part.

    The provisions of this part apply to an alien who is lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence and has an occupational status which, 
if he were seeking admission to the United States, would entitle him to 
a nonimmigrant status under paragraph (15)(A) or (15)(G) of section 
101(a) of the Act, and to his immediate family; also, an alien who was 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence and has an occupational status 
which, if he were seeking admission to the United States, would entitle 
him to a nonimmigrant status under paragraph (15)(E) of section 101(a) 
of the Act, and to his spouse and children.

[22 FR 9801, Dec. 6, 1957]


<R05>
Sec. 247.11  Notice.

    If it appears to a district director that an alien residing in his 
district, who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence, has an 
occupational status described in section 247 of the Act, he shall cause 
a notice on Form I-509 to be served on such alien by personal service 
informing him that it is proposed to adjust his status, unless the alien 
requests that he be permitted to retain his status as a resident alien 
and executes and files with such district director a Form I-508 (Waiver 
of Rights, Privileges, Exemptions and Immunities) and, if a French 
national receiving salary from the French Republic, Form I-508F 
(election as to tax exemption under the Convention between the United 
States and the French Republic), within 10 days after service of the 
notice, or the alien, within such 10-day period, files with the district 
director a written answer under oath setting forth reasons why his 
status should not be adjusted. The notice shall also advise the person 
that he may, within such period and upon his request have an opportunity 
to appear in person, in support or in lieu of his written answer, before 
an immigration officer designated for that purpose. The person shall 
further be advised that he may have the assistance of counsel without 
expense to the Government of the United States in the preparation of his 
answer or in connection with such personal appearance, and may examine 
the evidence upon which it is proposed to base such adjustment.

<R05>
Sec. 247.12  Disposition of case.

    (a) Allegations admitted or no answer filed. If the waiver Form I-
508 and, if applicable, Form I-508F is not filed by the alien within the 
time prescribed, and the answer admits the allegations in the notice, or 
no answer is filed, the district director shall place a notation on the 
notice describing the alien's adjusted nonimmigrant status and shall 
cause a set of Forms I-94 to be prepared evidencing the nonimmigrant 
classification to which the alien has been adjusted and no appeal shall 
lie from such decision. Form I-94A shall be delivered to the alien and 
shall constitute notice to him of such adjustment. The alien's 
nonimmigrant status shall be for such time, under such conditions, and 
subject to such regulations as are applicable to the particular 
nonimmigrant status granted and shall be subject to

[[Page 519]]

such other terms and conditions, including the exaction of bond as the 
district director may deem appropriate.
    (b) Answer filed; personal appearance. Upon receipt of an answer 
asserting a defense to the allegations made in the notice without 
requesting a personal appearance, or if a personal appearance is 
requested or directed, the case shall be assigned to an immigration 
officer. Pertinent evidence, including testimony of witnesses, shall be 
incorporated in the record. The immigration officer shall prepare a 
report summarizing the evidence and containing his findings and 
recommendation. The record, including the report and recommendation of 
the immigration officer, shall be forwarded to the district director who 
caused the notice to be served. The district director shall note on the 
report of the immigration officer whether he approves or disapproves the 
recommendation of the immigration officer. If the decision of the 
district director is that the matter be terminated, the alien shall be 
informed of such decision. If the decision of the district director is 
that the status of the alien should be adjusted to that of a 
nonimmigrant, his decision shall provide that unless the alien, within 
10 days of receipt of notification of such decision, requests permission 
to retain his status as an immigrant and files with the district 
director Form I-508 and, if applicable, Form I-508F, the alien's 
immigrant status be adjusted to that of a nonimmigrant. The alien shall 
be informed of such decision and of the reasons therefor, and of his 
right to appeal in accordance with the provisions of part 103 of this 
chapter. If the alien does not request that he be permitted to retain 
status and file the Form I-508 and, if applicable, Form I-508F within 
the period provided therefor, the district director, without further 
notice to the alien, shall cause a set of Forms I-94 to be prepared 
evidencing the nonimmigrant classification to which the alien has been 
adjusted. Form I-94A shall be delivered to the alien. The alien's 
nonimmigrant status shall be for such time, under such conditions, and 
subject to such regulations as are applicable to the particular 
nonimmigrant status created and shall be subject to such other terms and 
conditions, including the exaction of bond, as the district director may 
deem appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 248.1  Eligibility.

    (a) General. Except for those classes enumerated in Sec. 248.2, any 
alien lawfully admitted to the United States as

[[Page 520]]

a nonimmigrant, including an alien who acquired such status pursuant to 
section 247 of the Act, who is continuing to maintain his nonimmigrant 
status, may apply to have his nonimmigrant classification changed to any 
nonimmigrant classification other than that of a fiancee or fiance under 
section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act, or as an alien in transit under 
section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act.
    (b) Timely filing and maintenance of status. A change of status may 
not be approved for an alien who failed to maintain the previously 
accorded status or whose status expired before the application or 
petition was filed, except that failure to file before the period of 
previously authorized status expired may be excused in the discretion of 
the Service, and without separate application, where it is demonstrated 
at the time of filing that:
    (1) The failure to file a timely application was due to 
extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or 
petitioner, and the Service finds the delay commensurate with the 
circumstances;
    (2) The alien has not otherwise violated his or her nonimmigrant 
status;
    (3) The alien remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and
    (4) The alien is not the subject of removal proceedings under 8 CFR 
part 240.
    (c) Change of nonimmigrant classification to that of a nonimmigrant 
student. A nonimmigrant applying for a change to classification as a 
student under sections 101(a)(15)(F)(i) or 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act 
is not considered ineligible for such a change solely because the 
applicant may have started attendance at school before the application 
was submitted. The district director shall deny an application for a 
change to classification as a student under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of 
the Act if the applicant intends to pursue the course of study solely in 
order to qualify for a subsequent change of nonimmigrant classification 
to that of an alien temporary worker under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the 
Act. Furthermore, an alien may not change from classification as a 
student under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) of the Act to that of a student 
under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the Act.
    (d) Application for change of nonimmigrant classification from that 
of a student under section 101(a)(15)(M)(i) to that described in section 
101(a)(15)(H). A district director shall deny an application for change 
of nonimmigrant classification from that of an M-1 student to that of an 
alien temporary worker under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act if the 
education or training which the student received while an M-1 student 
enables the student to meet the qualifications for temporary worker 
classification under section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act.
    (e) Change of nonimmigrant classification to that as described in 
section 101(a)(15)(N). An application for change to N status shall not 
be denied on the grounds the applicant is an intending immigrant. Change 
of status shall be granted for three years not to exceed termination of 
eligibility under section 101(a)(15)(N) of the Act. Employment 
authorization pursuant to section 274(A) of the Act may be granted to an 
alien accorded nonimmigrant status under section 101(a)(15)(N) of the 
Act. Employment authorization is automatically terminated when the alien 
changes status or is no longer eligible for classification under section 
101(a)(15)(N) of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 248.2  Ineligible classes.

    The following categories of aliens are not eligible to change their 
nonimmigrant status under section 248 of the Act:
    (a) Any alien in immediate and continuous transit through the United 
States without a visa;
    (b) Any alien classified as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15) 
(C), (D), (K), or (S) of the Act;
    (c) Any alien admitted as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(J) 
of the Act, or who acquired such status after admission in order to 
receive graduate medical education or training, whether or not the alien 
was subject to, received a waiver of, or fulfilled

[[Page 521]]

the two-year foreign residence requirement of section 212(e) of the Act. 
This restriction shall not apply when the alien is a foreign medical 
graduate who was granted a waiver under section 212(e)(iii) of the Act 
pursuant to a request made by a State Department of Public Health (or 
its equivalent) under Pub. L. 103-416, and the alien complies with the 
terms and conditions imposed on the waiver under section 214(k) of the 
Act and the implementing regulations at Sec. 212.7(c)(9) of this 
chapter. A foreign medical graduate who was granted a waiver under Pub. 
L. 103-416 and who does not fulfill the requisite 3-year employment 
contract or otherwise comply with the terms and conditions imposed on 
the waiver is ineligible to apply for change of status to any other 
nonimmigrant classification; and
    (d) Any alien classified as a nonimmigrant under section 
101(a)(15)(J) of the Act (other than an alien described in paragraph (c) 
of this section) who is subject to the foreign residence requirement of 
section 212(e) of the Act and who has not received a waiver of the 
residence requirement, except when the alien applies to change to a 
classification under section 101(a)(15)(A) or (G) of the Act.
    (e) Any alien admitted as a visitor under the visa waiver provisions 
of Sec. 212.1(e) of this chapter.
    (f) Any alien admitted as a Visa Waiver Pilot Program visitor under 
the provisions of section 217 of the Act and part 217 of this chapter.

of an alien as an E-1, E-2, H-1A, H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, 
P-1, P-2, P-3, Q, R-1, or TC nonimmigrant, must, where the alien is 
already in the U.S. and does not currently hold such status, apply for a 
change of status on Form I-129. The form must be filed with the fee 
required in Sec. 103.7 of this chapter and the initial evidence 
specified in Sec. 214.2 of this chapter and on the petition form. 
Dependents holding derivative status may be included in the petition if 
the form is for only one worker. In all other cases, dependents of the 
worker should file on Form I-539.
    (b) Change of status on Form I-539. Any nonimmigrant who desires a 
change of status to any nonimmigrant classification, other than those 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section, or to E-1 or E-2 classification 
as the spouse or child of a principal E-1 or E-2, must apply for a 
change of status on Form I-539. The application must be filed with the 
fee required in Sec. 103.7 of this chapter and any initial evidence 
specified in the applicable provisions of Sec. 214.2 of this chapter, 
and on the application form. More than one person may be included in an 
application where the co-applicants are all members of a single family 
group and either all hold the same nonimmigrant status or one holds a 
nonimmigrant status and the co-applicants are his or her spouse and/or 
children who hold derivative nonimmigrant status based on the 
principal's nonimmigrant status.
    (c) Special provisions for change of nonimmigrant classification to, 
or from, a position classified under section 101(a)(15) (A) or (G) of 
the Act. Each application for change of nonimmigrant classification to, 
or from, a position classified under section 101(a)(15)(A) or (G) must 
be filed on Form I-539 and be accompanied by a Form I-566, completed and 
endorsed in accordance with the instructions on that form. If the 
Department of State recommends against the change, the application shall 
be denied. An application for a change of classification by a principal 
alien in a position classified A-1, A-2, G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 shall be 
processed without fee. Members of the principal alien's immediate family 
who are included on the principal alien's application shall also be 
processed without fee.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Change of classification not required. The following do not need 
to request a change of classification:
    (1) An alien classified as a visitor for business under section 
101(a)(15)(B) of the Act who intends to remain in the United States 
temporarily as a visitor for pleasure during the period of authorized 
admission; or

[[Page 522]]

    (2) An alien classified under sections 101(a)(15)(A) or 
101(a)(15)(G) of the Act as a member of the immediate family of a 
principal alien classified under the same section, or an alien 
classified under section 101(a)(15) (E), (F), (H), (I), (J), (L), or (M) 
of the Act as the spouse or child who accompanied or followed to join a 
principal alien who is classified under the same section, to attend 
school in the United States, as long as the immediate family member, 
spouse or child continues to be qualified for and maintains the status 
under which the family member, spouse or child is classified.
    (f) Approval of application. If the application is granted, the 
applicant shall be notified of the decision and granted a new period of 
time to remain in the United States without the requirement of filing a 
separate application and paying a separate fee for an extension of stay. 
The applicant's nonimmigrant status under his new classification shall 
be subject to the terms and conditions applicable generally to such 
classification and to such other additional terms and conditions, 
including exaction of bond, which the district director deems 
appropriate to the case.
    (g) Denial of application. When the application is denied, the 
applicant shall be notified of the decision and the reasons for the 
denial. There is no appeal from the denial of the application under this 
chapter.
    (h) Change to S nonimmigrant classification. An eligible state or 
federal law enforcement agency (``LEA''), which shall include a state or 
federal court or a United States Attorney's Office, may seek to change 
the nonimmigrant classification of a nonimmigrant lawfully admitted to 
the United States, except those enumerated in Sec. 248.2 of this 
chapter, to that of an alien witness or informant pursuant to section 
101(a)(15)(S) of the Act by filing with the Assistant Attorney General, 
Criminal Division, Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant 
Status, with the appropriate fee, and Form I-854, Inter-Agency Alien 
Witness and Informant Record, with attachments establishing eligibility 
for the change of nonimmigrant classification.
    (1) If the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, certifies 
the request for S nonimmigrant classification in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in 8 CFR 214.2(t), the Assistant Attorney General 
shall forward the LEA's request on Form I-854 with Form I-539 to the 
Commissioner. No request for change of nonimmigrant classification to S 
classification may proceed to the Commissioner unless it has first been 
certified by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division.
    (2) In the event the Commissioner decides to deny an application to 
change nonimmigrant classification to S nonimmigrant classification, the 
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, and the relevant LEA 
shall be notified in writing to that effect. The Assistant Attorney 
General, Criminal Division, shall concur in or object to that decision. 
Unless the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, objects within 
7 days, he or she shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision. In 
the event of an objection by the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal 
Division, the matter will be expeditiously referred to the Deputy 
Attorney General for a final resolution. In no circumstances shall the 
alien or the relevant LEA have a right of appeal from any decision to 
deny.

Sec. 249.2  Application.

    (a) Jurisdiction. An application by an alien, other than an arriving 
alien, who has been served with a notice to appear or warrant of arrest 
shall be considered only in proceedings under 8 CFR part 240. In any 
other case, an alien who believes he or she meets the eligibility 
requirements of section 249 of the Act shall apply to the district 
director having jurisdiction over his or her place of residence. The 
application shall be made on Form I-485 and shall be accompanied by Form 
G-325A, which shall be considered part of the application. The 
application shall also be accompanied by documentary evidence 
establishing continuous residence in the United States since prior to 
January 1, 1972, or since entry and prior to July 1, 1924. All documents 
must be submitted in accordance with Sec. 103.2(b) of this chapter. 
Documentary evidence may include any records of official or personal 
transactions or recordings of events occurring during the period of 
claimed residence. Affidavits of credible witnesses may also be 
accepted. Persons unemployed and unable to furnish evidence in their own 
names may furnish evidence in the names of parents or other persons with 
whom they have been living, if affidavits of the parents or other 
persons are submitted attesting to the residence. The numerical 
limitations of sections 201 and 202 of the Act shall not apply.
    (b) Decision. The applicant shall be notified of the decision and, 
if the application is denied, of the reasons therefor. If the 
application is granted, a Form I-551, showing that the applicant has 
acquired the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence, shall not be issued until the applicant surrenders any other 
document in his or her possession evidencing compliance with the alien 
registration requirements of former or existing law. No appeal shall lie 
from the denial of an application by the district director. However, an 
alien, other than an arriving alien, may renew the denied application in 
proceedings under 8 CFR part 240.

    An applicant who alleged entry and residence since prior to July 1,

of the application because evidence of continuous residence prior to 
July 1, 1924, was not submitted, may have his case reopened and 
reconsidered pursuant to Sec. 103.5 of this chapter. Upon the submission 
of satisfactory evidence, a record of admission as of the date of 
alleged entry may be created.

Sec. 251.1  Arrival manifests and lists.

    (a) Vessels--(1) General. The master or agent of every vessel 
arriving in the United States from a foreign place or an outlying 
possession of the United States shall present to the immigration officer 
at the port where the immigration inspection is performed a manifest of 
all crewmen on board on Form I-418, Passenger List and Crew List, in 
accordance with the instructions contained thereon.
    (2) Longshore work notations. The master or agent of the vessel 
shall indicate in writing immediately below the name of the last alien 
listed on the Form I-418 whether or not crewmen aboard the vessel will 
be used to perform longshore work at any United States port before the 
vessel departs the United States.
    (i) If no longshore work will be performed, no further notation 
regarding longshore work is required.
    (ii) If longshore work will be performed, the master or agent shall 
note which exception listed in section 258 of the Act permits the work. 
The exceptions are:
    (A) The hazardous cargo exception;
    (B) The prevailing practice exception in accordance with a port's 
collective bargaining agreements;
    (C) The prevailing practice exception at a port where there is no 
collective bargaining agreement, but for which the vessel files an 
attestation;
    (D) The prevailing practice exception for automated vessels; and
    (E) The reciprocity exception.
    (iii) If longshore work will be performed under the hazardous cargo 
exception, the vessel must either be a tanker or be transporting dry 
bulk cargo that qualifies as hazardous. All tankers qualify for the 
hazardous cargo exception, except for a tanker that has been gas-freed 
to load non-hazardous dry bulk commodities.
    (A) To invoke the exception for tankers, the master or agent shall 
note on the manifest that the vessel is a qualifying tanker.
    (B) If the vessel is transporting dry bulk hazardous cargo, the 
master or agent shall note on the manifest that the vessel's dry bulk 
cargo is hazardous and shall show the immigration officer the dangerous 
cargo manifest that is signed by the master or an authorized 
representative of the owner, and that under 46 CFR 148.02 must be kept 
in a conspicuous place near the bridge house.
    (iv) If longshore work will be performed under the prevailing 
practice exception, the master or agent shall note on the manifest each 
port at which longshore work will be performed under this exception. 
Additionally, for each port the master or agent shall note either that:
    (A) The practice of nonimmigrant crewmen doing longshore work is in 
accordance with all collective bargaining agreements covering 30 percent 
or more of the longshore workers in the port;
    (B) The port has no collective bargaining agreement covering 30 
percent or more of the longshore workers in the port and an attestation 
has been filed with the Secretary of Labor;
    (C) An attestation that was previously filed is still valid and the 
vessel continues to comply with the conditions stated in that 
attestation; or
    (D) The longshore work consists of operating an automated, self-
unloading conveyor belt or a vacuum-actuated system.
    (v) If longshore work will be performed under the reciprocity 
exception, the master or agent shall note on the manifest that the work 
will be done under the reciprocity exception, and will note the 
nationality of the vessel's registry and the nationality or 
nationalities of the holders of a majority of the ownership interest in 
the vessel.

[[Page 525]]

    (3) Exception for certain Great Lakes vessels. (i) A manifest shall 
not be required for a vessel of United States, Canadian, or British 
registry engaged solely in traffic on the Great Lakes or the St. 
Lawrence River and connecting waterways, herein designated as a Great 
Lakes vessel, unless:
    (A) The vessel employs nonimmigrant crewmen who will do longshore 
work at a port in the United States; or
    (B) The vessel employs crewmen of other than United States, 
Canadian, or British citizenship.
    (ii) In either situation, the master shall note the manifest in the 
manner prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (iii) After submission of a manifest on the first voyage of a 
calendar year, a manifest shall not be required on subsequent arrivals 
unless a nonimmigrant crewman of other than Canadian or British 
citizenship is employed on the vessel who was not aboard and listed on 
the last prior manifest, or a change has occurred regarding the 
performance of longshore work in the United States by nonimmigrant 
crewmen, or a change has occurred in the exception that the master or 
agent of the vessel wishes to invoke which was not noted on the last 
prior manifest.
    (4) The master or agent of a vessel that only bunkers at a United 
States port en route to another United States port shall annotate Form 
I-418 presented at the onward port to indicate the time, date, and place 
of bunkering.
    (5) If documentation is required to support an exception, as 
described in Sec. 258.2 of this chapter, it must accompany the manifest.
    (b) Aircraft. The captain or agent of every aircraft arriving in the 
United States from a foreign place or from an outlying possession of the 
United States, except an aircraft arriving in the United States directly 
from Canada on a flight originating in that country, shall present to 
the immigration officer at the port where the inspection is performed a 
manifest on United States Customs Service Form 7507 or on the 
International Civil Aviation Organization's General Declaration of all 
the alien crewmembers on board, including alien crewmembers who are 
returning to the United States after taking an aircraft of the same line 
from the United States to a foreign place or alien crewmembers who are 
entering the United States as passengers solely for the purpose of 
taking an aircraft of the same line from the United States to a foreign 
port. The captain or agent of an aircraft that only refuels at the 
United States en route to another United States port must annotate the 
manifest presented at the onward port to indicate the time, date, and 
place of refueling. The surname, given name, and middle initial of each 
alien crewman listed also shall be shown on the manifest. In addition, 
the captain or agent of the aircraft shall indicate the total number of 
United States citizen crewmembers and total number of alien crewmembers.
    (c) Additional documents. The master, captain, or agent shall 
prepare as a part of the manifest, when one is required for presentation 
to an immigration officer, a completely executed set of Forms I-95, 
Conditional Landing Permit, for each nonimmigrant alien crewman on 
board, except:
    (1) A Canadian or British citizen crewman serving on a vessel plying 
solely between Canada and the United States; or
    (2) A nonimmigrant crewman who is in possession of an unmutilated 
Form I-184, Alien Crewman Landing Permit and Identification Card, or an 
unmutilated Form I-95 with space for additional endorsements previously 
issued to him or her as a member of the crew of the same vessel or an 
aircraft of the same line on his or her last prior arrival in the United 
States, following which he or she departed from the United States as a 
member of the crew of the same vessel or an aircraft of the same line.

Sec. 251.2  Notification of illegal landings.

    As soon as discovered, the master or agent of any vessel from which 
an alien crewman has illegally landed or deserted in the United States 
shall inform the immigration officer in charge of the port where the 
illegal landing or desertion occurred, in writing, of the name, 
nationality, passport number

[[Page 526]]

and, if known, the personal description, circumstances and time of such 
illegal landing or desertion of such alien crewman, and furnish any 
other information and documents that might aid in his or her 
apprehension, including any passport surrendered pursuant to 
Sec. 252.1(d) of this chapter. Failure to file notice of illegal landing 
or desertion and to furnish any surrendered passport within 24 hours of 
the time of such landing or desertion becomes known shall be regarded as 
lack of compliance with section 251(d) of the Act.

directly to some foreign place or outlying possession of the United 
States, except when a manifest is not required pursuant to

[[Page 527]]


<R05>
Sec. 252.1  Examination of crewmen.

    (a) Detention prior to examination. All persons employed in any 
capacity on board any vessel or aircraft arriving in the United States 
shall be detained on board the vessel or at the airport of arrival by 
the master or agent of such vessel or aircraft until admitted or 
otherwise permitted to land by an officer of the Service.
    (b) Classes of aliens subject to examination under this part. The 
examination of every nonimmigrant alien crewman arriving in the United 
States shall be in accordance with this part except that the following 
classes of persons employed on vessels or aircraft shall be examined in 
accordance with the provisions of 8 CFR parts 235 and 240:
    (1) Canadian or British citizen crewmen serving on vessels plying 
solely between Canada and the United States; or
    (2) Canadian or British citizen crewmen of aircraft arriving in a 
State of the United States directly from Canada on flights originating 
in that country. The crew of a vessel arriving at a United States port 
that may not require inspection by or clearance from the United States 
Customs Service is, nevertheless, subject to examination under this 
part; however, the master of such a vessel is not required to present 
Form I-95 for any crewman who is not an applicant for a conditional 
landing permit.
    (c) Requirements for landing permits. Every alien crewman applying 
for landing privileges in the United States must make his or her 
application in person before an immigration officer, present whatever 
documents are required, be photographed and fingerprinted as the 
district director may require, and establish to the satisfaction of the 
immigration officer that he or she is not inadmissible under any 
provision of the law and is entitled clearly and beyond doubt to landing 
privileges in the United States.
    (d) Authorization to land. The immigration officer in his discretion 
may grant an alien crewman authorization to land temporarily in the 
United States for: (1) Shore leave purposes during the period of time 
the vessel or aircraft is in the port of arrival or other ports in the 
United States to which it proceeds directly without touching at a 
foreign port or place, not exceeding 29 days in the aggregate, if the 
immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends to depart on 
the vessel on which he arrived or on another aircraft of the same 
transportation line, and the crewman's passport is surrendered for safe 
keeping to the master of the arriving vessel, or (2) the purpose of 
departing from the United States as a crewman on a vessel other than the 
one on which he arrived, or departing as a passenger by means of other 
transportation, within a period of 29 days, if the immigration officer 
is satisfied that the crewman intends to depart in that manner, that 
definite arrangements for such departure have been made, and the 
immigration officer has consented to the pay off or discharge of the 
crewman from the vessel on which he arrived. A crewman granted a 
conditional permit to land under section 252(a)(1) of the Act and 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section is required to depart with his vessel 
from its port of arrival and from each other port in the United States 
to which it thereafter proceeds coastwise without touching at a foreign 
port or place; however, he may rejoin his vessel at another port in the 
United States before it touches at a foreign port or place if he has 
advance written permission from the master or agent to do so.
    (e) Conditional permits to land. Unless the crewman is in possession 
of Form I-184 and is landed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the 
immigration officer shall give to each alien nonimmigrant crewman 
permitted to land a copy of the Form I-95 presented by the crewman, 
endorsed to show the date and place of admission and the type of 
conditional landing permit.
    (f) Change of status. An alien nonimmigrant crewman landed pursuant 
to the provisions of this part shall be ineligible for any extension of 
stay or for a change of nonimmigrant classification under part 248 of 
this chapter. A crewman admitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
may, if still maintaining status, apply for a conditional landing permit 
under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The application shall not be 
approved unless an application

[[Page 528]]

on Form I-408, filed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, has been 
approved authorizing the master or agent of the vessel on which the 
crewman arrived to pay off or discharge the crewman and unless evidence 
is presented by the master or agent of the vessel to which the crewman 
will be transferred that a specified position on that vessel has been 
authorized for him or that satisfactory arrangements have been completed 
for the repatriation of the alien crewman. If the application is 
approved, the crewman shall be given a new Form I-95 endorsed to show 
landing authorized under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the period 
necessary to accomplish his scheduled reshipment, which shall not exceed 
29 days from the date of his landing, upon surrendering any conditional 
landing permit previously issued to him on Form I-95.
    (g) Refusal of conditional landing permit. When an alien crewman is 
refused a conditional landing permit for any reason, the Form I-95 
presented by him at time of examination shall be endorsed ``Permission 
to land temporarily at all U.S. ports is refused'' and the Form I-95 
shall be given to the master or agent of the vessel or aircraft and, in 
the case of vessels, the alien crewman's name shall be listed on the 
Form I-410 delivered to the master of the vessel upon completion of the 
examination of the crew. If an alien crewman who has been refused a 
conditional landing permit is in possession of Form I-184, the Form I-
184 shall be lifted by the examining immigration officer and, except in 
the case of an alien crewman who is refused a conditional landing permit 
solely because he is not in possession of a valid passport or visa, the 
Form I-184 shall be voided. In the case of an alien crewman refused a 
conditional landing permit because he is not in possession of a valid 
passport or visa, the Form I-184 shall be delivered to the master or 
agent of the vessel with instructions to return it to the alien crewman 
after the vessel has departed from the United States.
    (h) Authorization to pay off or discharge an alien crewman. 
Application to pay off or discharge an alien crewman, except an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence, shall be made by the owner, 
agent, consignee, charterer, master, or commanding officer of the vessel 
or aircraft on which the alien crewman arrived on Form I-408 filed with 
the immigration officer having jurisdiction over the area in which the 
vessel or aircraft is located at the time of application. The applicant 
shall be notified of the decision, and, if the application is denied, of 
the reasons therefor. There shall be no appeal from the denial of an 
application on Form I-408.

<R05>
Sec. 252.2  Revocation of conditional landing permits; removal.

    (a) Revocation and removal while vessel is in the United States. A 
crewman whose landing permit is subject to revocation pursuant to 
section 252(b) of the Act may be taken into custody by any immigration 
officer without a warrant of arrest and be transferred to the vessel of 
arrival, if the vessel is in any port in the United States and has not 
departed foreign since the crewman was issued his or her conditional 
landing permit. Detention and removal of the crewman shall be at the 
expense of the transportation line on which the crewman arrived. Removal 
may be effected on the vessel of arrival or, if the master of the vessel 
has requested in writing, by alternate means if removal on the vessel of 
arrival is impractical.
    (b) Revocation and removal after vessel has departed the United 
States. A crewman who was granted landing privileges prior to April 1, 
1997, and who has not departed foreign on the vessel of arrival, or on 
another vessel or aircraft if such permission was granted pursuant to 
Sec. 252.1(f), is subject to removal proceedings under section 240 of 
the Act as an alien deportable pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of 
the Act. A crewman who was granted landing privileges on or after April 
1, 1997, and who has not departed foreign on the vessel of arrival, or 
on another vessel or aircraft if such permission was granted pursuant to 
Sec. 252.1(f), shall be

[[Page 529]]

removed from the United States without a hearing, except as provided in 
Sec. 208.2(b)(1) of this chapter. In either case, if the alien is 
removed within 5 years of the date of landing, removal of the crewman 
shall be at the expense of the owner of the vessel. In the case of a 
crewman ordered removed more than 5 years after the date of landing, 
removal shall be at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement 
of the Act.

Sec. 252.3  Great Lakes vessels and tugboats arriving in the United States from Canada; special procedures.

    (a) United States vessels and tugboats. An immigration examination 
shall not be required of any crewman aboard a Great Lakes vessel of 
United States registry or a tugboat of United States registry arriving 
from Canada at a port of the United States who has been examined and 
admitted by an immigration officer as a member of the crew of the same 
vessel or tugboat or of any other vessel or tugboat of the same company 
during the current calendar year.
    (b) Canadian or British vessels or tugboats. An alien crewman need 
not be presented for inspection if the alien crewman:
    (1) Serves aboard a Great Lakes vessel of Canadian or British 
registry or aboard a tugboat of Canadian or British registry arriving at 
a United States port-of-entry from Canada;
    (2) Seeks admission for a period of less than 29 days;
    (3) Has, during the current calendar year, been inspected and 
admitted by an immigration officer as a member of the crew of the same 
vessel or tugboat, or of any other vessel or tugboat of the same 
company;
    (4) Is either a British or Canadian citizen or is in possession of a 
valid Form I-95 previously issued to him or her as a member of the crew 
of the same vessel or tugboat, or of any other vessel or tugboat of the 
same company;
    (5) Does not request or require landing privileges in the United 
States beyond the time the vessel or tugboat will be in port; and,
    (6) Will depart to Canada with the vessel or tugboat.

Sec. 252.4  Permanent landing permit and identification card.

    A Form I-184 is valid until revoked. It shall be revoked when an 
immigration officer finds that the crewman is in the United States in 
willful violation of the terms and conditions of his or her permission 
to land, or that he or she is inadmissible to the United States. On 
revocation, the Form I-184 shall be surrendered to an immigration 
officer. No appeal shall lie from the revocation of Form I-184.

Sec. 252.5  Special procedures for deserters from Spanish or Greek ships of war.

    (a) General. Under E.O. 11267 of January 19, 1966 (31 FR 807) and 28 
CFR 0.109, and E.O. 11300 of August 17, 1966, (31 FR 11009), and 28 CFR 
0.110, the Commissioner and immigration officers (as defined in 
Sec. 103.1(j) of this chapter) are designated as ``competent national 
authorities'' on the part of the United States within the meaning of 
Article XXIV of the 1903 Treaty of Friendship and General Relations 
between the United States and Spain (33 Stat. 2105, 2117), and ``local 
authorities'' and ``competent officers'' on the part of the United 
States within the meaning of Article XIII of the Convention between the 
United States and Greece (33 Stat. 2122, 2131).
    (b) Application for restoration. On application of a Consul General, 
Consul, Vice-Consul, or Consular-Agent of the Spanish or Greek 
Government, made in writing pursuant to Article XXIV of the treaty, or 
Article XIII of the Convention, respectively, stipulating for the 
restoration of crewmen deserting, stating that the person named therein 
has deserted from a ship of war of that government, while in any port of 
the United States, and on proof by the exhibition of the register, crew 
list, or official documents of the vessel, or a copy or extract 
therefrom, duly certified, that the person named belonged, at the time 
of desertion, to the crew of such vessel, such person shall be taken

[[Page 530]]

into custody by any immigration officer without a warrant of arrest. 
Written notification of charges shall be served on the alien when he or 
she is taken into custody or as soon as practical thereafter.
    (c) Examination. Within a reasonable period of time after the 
arrest, the alien shall be accorded an examination by the district 
director, acting district director, or the deputy district director 
having jurisdiction over the place of arrest. The alien shall be 
informed that he or she may have the assistance of or be represented by 
a counsel or representative of his or her choice qualified under 8 CFR 
part 292 without expense to the Government, and that he or she may 
present such evidence in his or her behalf as may be relevant to this 
proceeding. If, upon the completion of such examination, it is 
determined that:
    (1) The individual sought by the Spanish or Greek authorities had 
deserted from a Spanish or Greek ship of war in a United States port;
    (2) The individual actually arrested and detained is the person 
sought;
    (3) The individual is not a citizen of the United States; and
    (4) The individual had not previously been arrested for the same 
cause and set at liberty because he or she had been detained for more 
than 3 months, or more than 2 months in the case of a deserter from a 
Greek ship of war, from the day of his or her arrest without the Spanish 
or Greek authorities having found an opportunity to send him or her 
home, the individual shall be served with a copy of the findings, from 
which no appeal shall lie, and be surrendered forthwith to the Spanish 
or Greek authorities if they are prepared to remove him or her from the 
United States. On written request of the Spanish or Greek authorities, 
the individual shall be detained, at their expense, for a period not 
exceeding 3 months or 2 months, respectively, from the day of arrest to 
afford opportunity to arrange for his or her departure from the United 
States.
    (d) Timely departure not effected. If the Spanish authorities delay 
in sending the individual home for more than 3 months, or if the Greek 
authorities delay in sending the individual home for more than 2 months, 
from the day of his or her arrest, the individual shall be dealt with as 
any other alien unlawfully in the United States under the removal 
provisions of the Act, as amended.
    (e) Commission of crime. If the individual has committed any crime 
or offense in the United States, he or she shall not be placed at the 
disposal of the consul until after the proper tribunal having 
jurisdiction in his or her case shall have pronounced sentence, and such 
sentence shall have been executed.

<R05>
Sec. 253.1  Parole.

    (a) General. When a crewman is paroled into the United States 
pursuant to the provisions of this part under the provisions of section 
212(d)(5) of the Act, he shall be given Form I-94, reflecting the terms 
of parole. A notice on Form I-259 shall be served upon the agent, and, 
if available, upon the owner and master or commanding officer of the 
vessel or aircraft, which shall specify the purpose of the parole and 
the conditions under which the alien crewman is paroled into the United 
States. The Form I-259 shall also specify the Service office to which 
the alien crewman is to be presented for inspection upon termination of 
the parole. The guarantee of payment for medical and other related 
expenses required by section 253 of the Act shall be executed by the 
owner, agent, consignee, commanding officer or master on Form I-510.
    (b) Afflicted crewman. Any alien crewman afflicted with 
feeblemindedness, insanity, epilepsy, tuberculosis in any form, leprosy, 
or any dangerous contagious disease, or an alien crewman suspected of 
being so afflicted shall upon arrival at the first port of call in the 
United States, be paroled to the

[[Page 531]]

medical institution designated by the district director in whose 
district the port is located, in the custody (other than during the 
period of time he is in such medical institution) of the agent of the 
vessel or aircraft on which such alien arrived in the United States and 
at the expense of the transportation line for a period initially not to 
exceed thirty days, for treatment and observation, under the provisions 
of section 212(d)(5) of the Act. Unless the Public Health Surgeon at the 
first port certifies that such parole be effected immediately for 
emergent reasons, the district director may defer execution of parole to 
a subsequent port of the United States to which the vessel or aircraft 
will proceed, if facilities not readily available at the first port are 
readily available at such subsequent port of call. Notice to remove an 
afflicted alien crewman shall be served by the examining immigration 
officer upon the master or agent of the vessel or aircraft on Form I-259 
and shall specify the date when and the place to which such alien 
crewman shall be removed and the reasons therefor.
    (c) Disabled crewman. Any alien crewman who becomes disabled in any 
port of the United States, whom the master or agent of the vessel or 
aircraft is obliged under foreign law to return to another country, may 
be paroled into the United States under the provisions of section 
212(d)(5) of the Act for the period of time and under the conditions set 
by the district director in whose district the port is located, in the 
custody of the agent of the vessel or aircraft for the purpose of 
passing through the United States and transferring to another vessel or 
aircraft for departure to such foreign country, by the most direct and 
expeditious route.
    (d) Shipwrecked or castaway seamen or airmen. A shipwrecked or 
castaway alien seaman or airman who is rescued by or transferred at sea 
to a vessel or aircraft destined directly for the United States and who 
is brought to the United States on such vessel or aircraft other than as 
a member of its crew shall be paroled into the United States under the 
provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the period of time and 
under the conditions set by the district director in whose district the 
port is located, in the custody of the appropriate foreign consul or the 
agent of the aircraft or vessel which was wrecked or from which such 
seaman or airman was removed, for the purpose of treatment or 
observation in a hospital, if such is required, and for departure to the 
appropriate foreign country by the most direct and expeditious route.
    (e) Medical treatment or observation. Any alien crewman denied a 
conditional landing permit or whose conditional landing permit issued 
under Sec. 252.1(d)(1) of this chapter is revoked may, upon the request 
of the master or agent, be paroled into the United States under the 
provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act in the custody of the agent 
of the vessel or aircraft and at the expense of the transportation line 
for medical treatment or observation.
    (f) Crewman, stowaway, or alien removable under section 235(c) 
alleging persecution. Any alien crewman, stowaway, or alien removable 
under section 235(c) of the Act who alleges that he or she cannot return 
to his or her country of nationality or last habitual residence (if not 
a national of any country) because of fear of persecution in that 
country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a 
particular social group, or political opinion, is eligible to apply for 
asylum or withholding of removal under 8 CFR part 208. Service officers 
shall take particular care to ensure that the provisions of 
Sec. 208.5(b) of this chapter regarding special duties toward aliens 
aboard certain vessels are closely followed.
    (g) Other crewmen. In the discretion of the district director, any 
alien crewman not within the purview of paragraphs (b) through (f) of 
this section may for other emergent reasons or for reasons deemed 
strictly in the public interest be paroled into the United States under 
the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the period of time 
and under the conditions set by the district director having 
jurisdiction over the area where the alien crewman is located.

Sec. 253.2  Termination of parole.

    (a) General. At the expiration of the period of parole authorized by 
the district director, or when the purpose of the parole has been 
served, whichever is earlier, the agent upon whom the relating Form I-
259 was served as provided in Sec. 253.1, shall present the alien 
crewman for inspection to an immigration officer at the Service office 
specified in the Form I-259. If the agent cannot present the alien 
crewman, the agent shall immediately submit a report of the reasons 
therefor to the district director. The district director shall take such 
further action as the circumstances may require. If the vessel or 
aircraft on which the alien crewman arrived in the United States is 
still in the United States when he is presented for inspection, he shall 
be treated as an applicant for a conditional landing permit and his case 
shall be dealt with in the same manner as any other applicant for a 
conditional landing permit. If the vessel or aircraft on which the alien 
crewman arrived in the United States departed before he was presented 
for inspection, the agent shall be directed by means of written notice 
on Form I-259 to arrange for the removal of the alien crewman from the 
United States, and if such alien crewman thereafter departs voluntarily 
from the United States within the time specified by the district 
director, such departure shall not be considered a deportation within 
the meaning of this section.
    (b) Revocation of parole. When an immigration officer has reason to 
believe that an alien crewman paroled into the United States pursuant to 
the provisions of Sec. 253.1 has violated the conditions of parole, the 
immigration officer may take such alien crewman into custody without a 
warrant of arrest. Following such action, the alien crewman shall be 
accorded, without undue delay, an examination by another immigration 
officer. If it is determined on the basis of such examination that the 
individual detained is an alien crewman who was paroled into the United 
States pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 253.1 and that he has violated 
the conditions of the parole or has remained in the United States beyond 
the period authorized by the district director, the district director 
shall cause to be served upon the alien crewman a written notice that 
his parole has been revoked, setting forth the reasons for such action. 
If the vessel or aircraft upon which the alien crewman arrived in the 
United States is still in the United States, the alien crewman shall be 
delivered to that vessel or aircraft and Form I-259 shall be served upon 
the master or commanding officer of the vessel or aircraft directing 
that the alien crewman be detained on board the vessel or aircraft and 
deported from the United States. A copy of Form I-259 shall also be 
served on the agent for the vessel or aircraft. If the vessel or 
aircraft upon which the alien crewman arrived in the United States has 
departed from the United States, the agent or owner of the vessel or 
aircraft shall be directed by means of a notice on Form I-259 to effect 
the deportation of the alien crewman from the United States. Pending 
deportation, the alien crewman shall be continued in custody, unless the 
district director authorizes his release on parole under such 
conditions, including the posting of a suitable bond, as the district 
director may prescribe.

work, other than the activities allowed in particular circumstances 
under Sec. 258.2 (a)(2), (b), or (c) of this part, shall be subject to a 
fine under section 251(d) of the Act.
    (b) Port defined. For purposes of this section, the term port means 
a geographic area, either on a seacoast, lake, river, or other navigable 
body of water, which contains one or more publicly or privately owned 
terminals, piers, docks, or maritime facilities, which is commonly 
regarded as a port by other government maritime related agencies, such 
as the Maritime Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 258.2  Exceptions.

    Any master or agent who uses nonimmigrant crewmen to perform 
longshore work at any United States port under the exceptions provided 
for in paragraphs (a)(2), (b), or (c) of this section must so indicate 
on the crew manifest and shall note under which exception the work will 
be performed.
    (a) Hazardous cargo. (1) The term longshore work does not include 
the loading and unloading of any cargo for which the Secretary of 
Transportation has prescribed regulations under authority contained in 
chapter 37 of title 46, United States Code, section 311 of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act, section 4106 of the Oil Pollution Act of 
1990, or section 105 or 106 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation 
Act.
    (2) In order to invoke the hazardous cargo exception for safety and 
environmental protection, the master or agent shall note on the manifest 
that the vessel is a qualifying tanker or carries hazardous dry bulk 
cargo.
    (i) All tankers qualify for the hazardous cargo exception, including 
parcel tankers, except for a tanker that has been gas-freed to transport 
non-hazardous dry bulk commodities.
    (ii) In order for a vessel to qualify for the hazardous cargo 
exception as a dry bulk hazardous cargo carrier, the master or agent 
must show the immigration officer the dangerous cargo manifest that is 
required by Coast Guard regulation 46 CFR 148.02-3(a) to be kept near 
the bridge house.
    (b) Prevailing practice exception. (1) Nonimmigrant crewmen may 
perform longshore work under this exception if:
    (i) There is in effect in the local port one or more collective 
bargaining agreements, each covering at least 30 percent of the persons 
performing longshore work at the port, and each of which permits the 
longshore activity to be performed by the nonimmigrant crewman, or
    (ii) There is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in the 
local port covering at least 30 percent of the persons performing 
longshore work at the port, and the employer of the crewmen has filed an 
attestation with the Secretary of Labor that the Secretary of Labor has 
accepted.
    (2) Documentation to be presented under the prevailing practice 
exception. (i) If the master or agent states on the manifest, Form I-
418, that nonimmigrant crewmen will perform longshore work at a port 
under the prevailing practice exception as permitted by all collective 
bargaining agreements covering 30 percent or more of the persons 
performing longshore work at the port, then the master or agent must 
present to the examining immigration officer an affidavit from the local 
stevedore. The stevedore or a union representative of the employees' 
association must state on the affidavit that all bargaining agreements 
covering 30 percent or more of the longshore workers at the port allow 
nonimmigrant crewmen either to perform all longshore work or to perform 
those specified longshore activities that crewmen on the vessel intend 
to perform.
    (ii) Where there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect at 
a port covering at least 30 percent of the persons who do longshore 
work, and the master or agent states on the manifest that nonimmigrant 
crewmen will perform such work under the prevailing practice exception, 
then the master or agent shall present a copy of the notification 
received from the Secretary of

[[Page 534]]

Labor that the attestation required for this exception has been 
accepted.
    (iii) When an unanticipated emergency occurs, the master or agent of 
a vessel may file an attestation with the Secretary of Labor up to the 
date on which crewmen perform longshore work.
    (A) If, because of an unanticipated emergency, crewmen on a vessel 
perform longshore work under the prevailing practice exception at a 
port, a revised manifest shall be submitted together with complete 
documentation, as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, 
within 14 days of the longshore work having been done. Failure to 
present the required documentation may result in a fine under section 
251 of the Act.
    (B) All documents submitted after inspection shall be sent to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service seaport office that inspected the 
vessel.
    (iv) Attestations are valid for one year from the date of filing and 
cover nonimmigrant crewmen landing during that period if the master or 
agent states on the manifest that the vessel's crew continue to comply 
with the conditions in the attestation. When the vessel's master or 
agent intends to use a previously accepted attestation that is still 
valid, the master or agent shall submit a copy of the notification from 
the Secretary of Labor that the attestation was accepted and shall note 
on the manifest that the vessel continues to comply with the conditions 
of the attestation.
    (3) Use of automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated 
system on a vessel. An automated self-unloading conveyor belt or a 
vacuum-actuated system may be operated by a nonimmigrant crewman under 
the prevailing practice exception when no collective bargaining 
agreement at the local port prevents it. The master or agent is not 
required to file an attestation for nonimmigrant crewmen to perform such 
activity in such a circumstance unless the Secretary of Labor has 
determined that such activity is not the prevailing practice at that 
port, and has publicized this finding. When invoking this exception, the 
master or agent of the vessel shall annotate the manifest that the 
longshore work consists of operating a self-unloading conveyor belt or a 
vacuum-actuated system on the vessel under the prevailing practice 
exception.
    (4) Sanctions upon notification by the Secretary of Labor. If the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service is notified by the Secretary of 
Labor that an entity has either misrepresented facts in its attestation 
or has failed to meet a condition attested to, then the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service will take the necessary steps to prevent the 
landing of vessels owned or chartered by the offending entity in 
accordance with section 258(c)(E)(i) of the Act. The Service may also 
impose a sanction as provided in that section, including the prohibition 
of any vessel owned or chartered by the violating entity from landing at 
any United States port for up to one year.
    (5) The three variations of the prevailing practice exception--
collective bargaining agreement, attestation process, and automated 
equipment--are port specific. If a vessel is to use nonimmigrant crewmen 
to perform longshore work under the prevailing practice exception, the 
appropriate documentation required under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section must be presented for each port at which the longshore work will 
be performed.
    (c) Reciprocity exception. Nonimmigrant crewmen may perform 
longshore work in a United States port under this exception if:
    (1) The vessel on which the crewmen serve is registered in a country 
that does not prohibit crewmen aboard United States vessels from 
performing longshore work, or a specified longshore activity, when 
United States vessels land in that country, as determined by the 
Secretary of State; and
    (2) The master or agent presents an affidavit from the crewmen's 
employer or the vessel's owner that a majority of the ownership interest 
in the vessel is held by nationals of a country or countries that do not 
prohibit such longshore activity by crewmen aboard United States vessels 
when they land in those countries.
    (d) Vessels that qualify for multiple exceptions. A vessel that 
qualifies for more than one exception under this

[[Page 535]]

section may invoke the exception that the master or agent chooses.
    (e) Lack of documentation required by an exception. If a vessel 
invokes an exception to the prohibition against nonimmigrant crewmen 
performing longshore work, but lacks any documentation required to 
accompany the manifest when invoking the exception, then the vessel's 
crewmen shall not perform longshore work. If the longshore work is 
performed despite the lack of documentation that the immigration officer 
has noted on the Form I-410, then the vessel is subject to fine under 
section 251(d) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 258.3  Action upon arrival.

    (a) The master or agent of the vessel shall state on the manifest at 
the first port of entry:
    (1) Whether or not nonimmigrant crewmen aboard the vessel will 
perform longshore work at any port before departing the United States; 
and
    (2) If nonimmigrant crewmen will perform longshore work, which 
exception in section 258 of the Act permits them to do so.
    (b) If nonimmigrant crewmen will perform longshore work, the master 
or agent of the vessel shall present with the manifest any documentation 
required by 8 CFR 258.2 for the exception invoked.
    (c) If, at the time of inspection, the master or agent fails to 
present the documentation required for the exception invoked, then the 
vessel is prohibited from using nonimmigrant crewmen to perform 
longshore work. If crewmen aboard the vessel perform longshore work 
despite the prohibition, the vessel is subject to fine under section 
251(d) of the Act.
    (d) The examining immigration officer shall give the master or agent 
a Receipt for Crew List, Form I-410, on which the officer shall note 
whether or not nonimmigrant crewmen will do longshore work at any port 
of call and, if so, under which exception. The officer shall also note 
which documentation supporting the exception accompanied the manifest, 
and any failure to present documentation which failure would prohibit 
crewmen from performing longshore work under the exception that the 
vessel invoked.
    (e) If a vessel's crewmen perform longshore activity not sanctioned 
by an exception but performed to prevent the imminent destruction of 
goods or property; severe damage to vessels, docks, or real estate; 
possible environmental contamination; or possible injury or death to a 
person, a concise report of the incident shall be made within 14 days of 
the incident to the Immigration and Naturalization Service seaport 
office that performed the inspection. If the Service agrees that the 
situation was one of imminent danger requiring immediate action, no fine 
will be imposed for the performance of a longshore activity in this 
isolated instance.
    (f) Failure to deliver true and complete information on the manifest 
or any documentation required to support an exception may result in a 
fine against the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer 
under section 251(d) of the Act.

    (e) Fingerprinting waiver. (1) Fingerprinting is waived for 
nonimmigrant aliens admitted as foreign government officials and 
employees; international organization representatives, officers and 
employees; NATO representatives, officers and employees, and holders of 
diplomatic visas while they maintain such nonimmigrant status. 
Fingerprinting is also waived for other nonimmigrant aliens, while they 
maintain nonimmigrant status, who are nationals of countries which do 
not require fingerprinting of United States citizens temporarily 
residing therein.
    (2) Fingerprinting is waived for every nonimmigrant alien not 
included in paragraph (e)(1) of this section who departs from the United 
States within one year of his admission, provided he maintains his 
nonimmigrant status during that time; each such alien not previously 
fingerprinted shall apply therefor at once if he remains in the United 
States in excess of one year.
    (3) Every nonimmigrant alien not previously fingerprinted shall 
apply therefor at once upon his failure to maintain his nonimmigrant 
status.
    (f) Registration and fingerprinting of certain nonimmigrants. 
Notwithstanding the provisions included in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) 
of this section, the Attorney General may designate, by a comprehensive 
public notice in the Federal Register, that certain nonimmigrants of 
specific countries are required to be registered and fingerprinted upon 
arrival in the United States. This requirement shall not apply to those 
nonimmigrants applying for admission to the United States under section 
101(a)(15)(A) or 101(a)(15)(G) of the Immigration and

[[Page 538]]

Nationality Act. Those aliens so designated by the Attorney General who 
apply for admission to the United States shall be registered on Form I-
94 (Arrival/Departure Record), and may be fingerprinted on Form FD-258 
(Fingerprint Chart), and photographed by the Service at the Port-of-
Entry where the aliens apply for admission to the United States.
    (g) Registration and fingerprinting of children who reach age 14. 
Within 30 days after reaching the age of 14, any alien in the United 
States not exempt from alien registration under the act and this chapter 
shall present himself to a Service office for registration in accordance 
with section 262(b) of the Act, and for fingerprinting unless 
fingerprinting is waived pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. He 
shall submit Form I-90 if he is a lawful permanent resident. If such 
alien is a lawful permanent resident of the United States and is 
temporarily absent from the United States when he reaches the age of 14, 
he shall comply with the foregoing within 30 days of his return to the 
United States. The alien, if a lawful permanent resident of the United 
States, shall surrender his prior evidence of alien registration and 
shall be issued Form I-551 bearing a photograph submitted by him in 
accordance with the instructions on Form I-90. In the case of an alien 
who is not a lawful permanent resident, the alien's Form I-94 or I-95 
shall be noted to show that he has been registered and the date of 
registration.
    (h) Temporary evidence of registration. Form I-94, appropriately 
endorsed, may be issued as temporary evidence of registration and lawful 
admission for permanent residence to a lawful permanent resident alien 
who is departing temporarily from the United States and has applied on 
Form I-90 for issuance of Form I-551, if the district director is unable 
to issue and deliver the Form I-551 prior to the alien's contemplated 
return to the United States. The alien shall surrender such Form I-94 to 
the Service upon receipt of Form I-551.
    (i) Copy of Form I-94. An attorney or representative as defined in 
Sec. 1.1 of this chapter who is representing an alien before the Service 
or the Board may make and retain, solely for information purposes, a 
copy of the Form I-94 (Arrival-Departure Record) issued to and in the 
possession of the alien. Such copy shall not be used for any other 
purpose.

letters, figures, or marks, matters which may be used to fulfill any 
requirement of the Act. The term ``document'' includes, but is not

other accompanying document or material;
    Entity means any legal entity, including, but not limited to, a

Sec. 270.2  Enforcement procedures.

    (a) Procedures for the filing of complaints. Any person or entity 
having knowledge of a violation or potential violation of section 274C 
of the Act may submit a signed, written complaint to the Service office 
having jurisdiction over the business or residence of the potential 
violator or the location where the violation occurred. The signed, 
written complaint must contain sufficient information to identify both 
the complainant and the alleged violator, including their names and 
addresses. The complaint should also contain detailed factual 
allegations relating to the potential violation including the date, time 
and place of the alleged violation and the specific act or conduct 
alleged to constitute a violation of the Act. Written complaints may be 
delivered either by mail to the appropriate Service office or by 
personally appearing before any immigration officer at a Service office.
    (b) Investigation. When the Service receives complaints from a third 
party in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, it shall 
investigate only those complaints which, on their face, have a 
substantial probability of validity. The Service may also conduct 
investigations for violations on its own initiative, and without having 
received a written complaint. If it is determined after investigation 
that the person or entity has violated section 274C of the Act, the 
Service may issue and serve upon the alleged violator a Notice of Intent 
to Fine.
    (c) Issuance of a subpoena. Service officers shall have reasonable 
access to examine any relevant evidence of any person or entity being 
investigated. The Service may issue subpoenas pursuant to its authority 
under sections 235(a) and 287 of the Act, in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in Sec. 287.4 of this chapter.
    (d) Notice of Intent to Fine. The proceeding to assess 
administrative penalties under section 274C of the Act is commenced when 
the Service issues a Notice of Intent to Fine. Service of this notice 
shall be accomplished by personal service pursuant to Sec. 103.5a(a)(2) 
of this chapter. Service is effective upon receipt, as evidenced by the 
certificate of service or the certified mail return receipt. The person 
or entity identified in the Notice of Intent to Fine shall be known as 
the respondent. The Notice of Intent to Fine may be issued by an officer 
defined in Sec. 242.1 of this chapter or by an INS port director 
designated by his or her district director.
    (e) Contents of the Notice of Intent to Fine. (1) The Notice of 
Intent to Fine shall contain the basis for the charge(s) against the 
respondent, the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated, and 
the monetary amount of the penalty the Service intends to impose.
    (2) The Notice of Intent to Fine shall provide the following 
advisals to the respondent:
    (i) That the person or entity has the right to representation by 
counsel of

[[Page 543]]

his or her own choice at no expense to the government;
    (ii) That any statement given may be used against the person or 
entity;
    (iii) That the person or entity has the right to request a hearing 
before an administrative law judge pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554-557, and 
that such request must be filed with INS within 60 days from the service 
of the Notice of Intent to Fine; and
    (iv) That if a written request for a hearing is not timely filed, 
the Service will issue a final order from which there is no appeal.
    (f) Request for hearing before an administrative law judge. If a 
respondent contests the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Fine, the 
respondent must file with the INS, within 60 days of the Notice of 
Intent to Fine, a written request for a hearing before an administrative 
law judge. Any written request for a hearing submitted in a foreign 
language must be accompanied by an English language translation. A 
request for hearing is deemed filed when it is either received by the 
Service office designated in the Notice of Intent to Fine, or addressed 
to such office, stamped with the proper postage, and postmarked within 
the 60-day period. In computing the 60-day period prescribed by this 
section, the day of service of the Notice of Intent to Fine shall not be 
included. In the request for a hearing, the respondent may, but is not 
required to, respond to each allegation listed in the Notice of Intent 
to Fine. A respondent may waive the 60-day period in which to request a 
hearing before an administrative law judge and ask that the INS issue a 
final order from which there is no appeal. Prior to execution of the 
waiver, a respondent who is not a United States citizen will be advised 
that a waiver of a section 274C hearing will result in the issuance of a 
final order and that the respondent will be excludable and/or deportable 
from the United States pursuant to the Act.
    (g) Failure to file a request for hearing. If the respondent does 
not file a written request for a hearing within 60 days of service of 
the Notice of Intent to Fine, the INS shall issue a final order from 
which there shall be no appeal.
    (h) Issuance of the final order. A final order may be issued by an 
officer defined in Sec. 242.1 of this chapter, by an INS port director 
designated by his or her district director, or by the Director of the 
INS National Fines Office.
    (i) Service of the final order--(1) Generally. Service of the final 
order shall be accomplished by personal service pursuant to 
Sec. 103.5a(a)(2) of this chapter. Service is effective upon receipt, as 
evidenced by the certificate of service or the certified mail return 
receipt.
    (2) Alternative provisions for service in a foreign country. When 
service is to be effected upon a party in a foreign country, it is 
sufficient if service of the final order is made: (i) In the manner 
prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that country 
in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction; or
    (ii) As directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter 
rogatory, when service in either case is reasonably calculated to give 
actual notice; or
    (iii) When applicable, pursuant to Sec. 103.5a(a)(2) of this 
chapter.

Service is effective upon receipt of the final order. Proof of service 
may be made as prescribed by the law of the foreign country, or, when 
service is pursuant to Sec. 103.5a(a)(2) of this chapter, as evidenced 
by the certificate of service or the certified mail return receipt.
    (j) Declination to file charges for document fraud committed by 
refugees at the time of entry. The Service shall not issue a Notice of 
Intent to Fine for acts of document fraud committed by an alien pursuant 
to direct departure from a country in which the alien has a well-founded 
fear of persecution or from which there is a significant danger that the 
alien would be returned to a country in which the alien would have a 
well-founded fear of persecution, provided that the alien has presented 
himself or herself without delay to an INS officer and shown good cause 
for his or her illegal entry or presence. Other acts of document fraud 
committed by such an alien may result in the issuance of a Notice of 
Intent to Fine and the imposition of civil money penalties.

<R05>
Sec. 270.3  Penalties.

    (a) Criminal penalties. Nothing in section 274C of the Act shall be 
construed to diminish or qualify any of the penalties available for 
activities prohibited by this section but proscribed as well in title 
18, United States Code.
    (b) Civil penalties. A person or entity may face civil penalties for 
a violation of section 274C of the Act. Civil penalties may be imposed 
by the Service or by an administrative law judge for violations under 
section 274C of the Act. The Service may charge multiple violations of 
section 274C of the Act in a single Notice of Intent to Fine, and may 
impose separate penalties for each such unlawful act in a single 
proceeding or determination. However, in determining whether an offense 
is a first offense or a subsequent offense, a finding of more than one 
violation in the course of a single proceeding or determination will be 
counted as a single offense.
    (1) A respondent found by the Service or an administrative law judge 
to have violated section 274C of the Act shall be subject to an order:
    (i) To cease and desist from such behavior; and
    (ii) To pay a civil penalty according to the following schedule:
    (A) First offense. Not less than $250 and not more than $2,000 for 
each fraudulent document or each proscribed activity described in 
section 274C (a)(1)-(a)(4) of the Act, or
    (B) Subsequent offenses. Not less than $2,000 and not more than 
$5,000 for each fraudulent document or each proscribed activity 
described in section 274C (a)(1)-(a)(4) of the Act.
    (2) Where an order is issued to a respondent composed of distinct, 
physically separate subdivisions each of which provides separately for 
the hiring, recruiting, or referring for a fee for employment (without 
reference to the practices of, and not under the common control of or 
common control with, another subdivision), each subdivision shall be 
considered a separate person or entity.

and operators have acted diligently in taking adequate steps to prevent 
the unlawful entry of aliens into the United States. Such measures may 
include but are not necessarily limited to fencing, barricades, 
lighting, or security guards. If the district director determines that 
preventive measures are inadequate, he or she shall advise the owners or 
operators in writing, citing the reasons for such determination. If the 
owners or operators believe the requirements of the district director to 
be excessive or unnecessary, they may request that the Regional 
Commissioner having jurisdiction over the location where the facility is 
located, review the district director's requirements. The Regional 
Commissioner shall advise the owners or operators in writing of the 
results of his or her review.
    (c) Preventive measures and certification. Upon a determination by 
the district director that reasonable and adequate preventive measures 
have been taken by the owners and operators, he or she shall certify

described in section 271(a), so long as the facility or method utilized 
is maintained in the condition in which approved and certified.

the location where the facility is located, in his or her discretion, 
may at any time, conduct an inspection of said facility to determine if 
any violation is occurring. If the facility is found to be not in 
compliance, said certification will be revoked.

<R05>
Sec. 273.1  General.

    In any fines case in which a fine is imposed under section 273 of 
the Act involving an alien brought to the United States after December 
24, 1994, the carrier may seek a reduction, refund, or waiver of fine, 
as provided for by section 273(e) of the Act, in accordance with this 
part. The provisions of section 273(e) of the Act and of this part do 
not apply to any fine imposed under any provision other than section 273 
(a)(1) and (b) of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 273.2  Definition.

    As used in this part, the term Carrier means an individual or 
organization engaged in transporting passengers or goods for hire to the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 273.3  Screening procedures.

    (a) Applicability. The terms and conditions contained in paragraph 
(b) of this section apply to those owners, operators, or agents of 
carriers which transport passengers to the United States.
    (b) Procedures at ports of embarkation. At each port of embarkation 
carriers shall take reasonable steps to prevent the boarding of 
improperly documented aliens destined to the United States by taking the 
following steps:
    (1) Screening of passengers by carrier personnel prior to boarding 
and examination of their travel documents to ensure that:
    (i) The passport or travel document presented is not expired and is 
valid for entry into the United States;
    (ii) The passenger is the rightful holder; and
    (iii) If the passenger requires a visa, the visa is valid for the 
holder and any other accompanying passengers named in the passport.
    (2) Refusing to board any passenger determined to be improperly 
documented. Failure to refuse boarding when advised to do so by a 
Service or Consular Officer may be considered by the Service as a factor 
in its evaluation of applications under Sec. 273.5.
    (3) Implementing additional safeguards such as, but not necessarily 
limited to, the following:
    (i) For instances in which the carrier suspects fraud, assessing the 
adequacy of the documents presented by asking additional, pertinent 
questions or by taking other appropriate steps to corroborate the 
identity of passengers, such as requesting secondary information.
    (ii) Conducting a second check of passenger documents, when 
necessary at high-risk ports of embarkation, at the time of boarding to 
verify that all passengers are properly documented consistent with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This includes a recheck of documents 
at the final foreign port of embarkation for all passengers, including 
those originally boarded at a prior stop or who are being transported to 
the United States under the Transit Without Visa (TWOV) or 
International-to-International (ITI) Programs.
    (iii) Providing a reasonable level of security during the boarding 
process so that passengers are unable to circumvent any carrier document 
checks.


<R05>
Sec. 273.4  Demonstration by carrier that screening requirements were met.

    (a) To be eligible to apply for reduction, refund, or waiver of a 
fine, the carrier shall provide evidence that it

[[Page 546]]

screened all passengers on the conveyance for the instant flight or 
voyage in accordance with the procedures listed in Sec. 273.3.
    (b) The Service may, at any time, conduct an inspection of a 
carrier's document screening procedures at ports of embarkation to 
determine compliance with the procedures listed in Sec. 273.3, to the 
extent permitted by the local competent authority responsible for port 
access or security. If necessary, the carrier shall use its good offices 
to obtain this permission from the local authority. If the carrier's 
port of embarkation operation is found not to be in compliance, the 
carrier will be notified by the Service that it will not be eligible for 
refund, reduction, or waiver of fines under section 273(e) of the Act 
unless the carrier can establish that lack of compliance was beyond the 
carrier's control.


<R05>
Sec. 273.5  General criteria used for reduction, refund, or waiver of fines.

    (a) Upon application by the carrier, the Service shall determine 
whether circumstances exist which would justify a reduction, refund, or 
waiver of fines pursuant to section 273(e) of the Act.
    (b) Applications for reduction, refund, or waiver of fine under 
section 273(e) of the Act shall be made in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in 8 CFR 280.12 and 8 CFR 280.51.
    (c) In determining the amount of the fine reduction, refund, or 
waiver, the Service shall consider:
    (1) The effectiveness of the carrier's screening procedures;
    (2) The carrier's history of fines violations, including fines, 
liquidated damages, and user fee payment records; and,
    (3) The existence of any extenuating circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 273.6  Memorandum of Understanding.

    (a) Carriers may apply to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) with the Service for an automatic reduction, refund, or waiver of 
fines imposed under section 273 of the Act.
    (b) Carriers signatory to an MOU will not be required to apply for 
reduction, refund, or waiver of fines in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in 8 CFR 280.12 and 8 CFR 280.51, but will follow procedures as 
set forth in the MOU.
    (c) Carriers signatory to an MOU will have fines reduced, refunded, 
or waived according to performance standards enumerated in the MOU or as 
determined by the Service.
    (d) Carriers signatory to an MOU are not precluded from seeking 
additional reduction, refund, or waiver of fines in accordance with the 
procedures outlined in 8 CFR 280.12 and 8 CFR 280.51.

forfeiture.
    (d) The term common carrier means an express carrier, a freight

in section 274(b) of the Act. A trailer shall be considered a vehicle if 
it is being towed or readily capable of being towed. An immobilized

from forfeiture the mere existence of a community property interest 
without proof of financial contribution to the purchase of a conveyance 
will not be deemed a property interest.
    (o) The term record means an arrest for a related crime followed by 
a conviction, except that a single arrest and conviction and the 
expiration of any sentence imposed as a result of the conviction, all of 
which occurred more than ten years prior to the date a claimant acquired 
a property interest in the seized or forfeited conveyance, is not 
considered a record; provided that two convictions of related crimes 
shall always be considered a record regardless of when the convictions 
occurred; and provided that the regional commissioner may consider as 
constituting a record an arrest for a related crime or series of arrests 
for related crimes in which the charge or charges were subsequently

(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section apply to the seized conveyance, that 
seized conveyance shall be returned to the owner as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this section; and if it is determined that the owner 
has established that paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies to the 
seized conveyance, that seized conveyance may be returned to the owner 
as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) At any time after seizure the regional commissioner may 
determine that it is in the best interests of justice not to pursue 
forfeiture of a seized conveyance which is otherwise subject to

Sec. 274.17  Restoration of proceeds or appraised value.

    (a) The regional commissioner shall not grant restoration of 
proceeds of sale or the appraised value of a conveyance placed in 
official use or otherwise disposed of according to law unless the 
petitioner establishes that the petitioner:
    (1) Did not know of the seizure prior to the declaration of 
forfeiture;
    (2) Was in such circumstances as prevented the petitioner from 
knowing thereof; and
    (3) Would otherwise have been granted the relief of remission of 
forfeiture.
    (b) A grant of restoration of proceeds of sale or the appraised 
value of a conveyance placed in official use or otherwise disposed of 
according to law must be conditioned upon:
    (1) Execution of an instrument by the petitioner holding the United 
States, its agents and employees, harmless from all claims which may 
result from the grant of restoration of proceeds of sale or the 
appraised value of a conveyance placed in official use or otherwise 
disposed of according to law; and
    (2) Any other terms or conditions as the regional commissioner 
determines to be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 274.18  Provisions applicable to particular situations.

    (a) A straw purchaser is a person who purchases in his own name a 
conveyance for another person, the real purchaser, who has a record or 
reputation. A lienholder-petitioner that knows, or has reason to 
believe, that a purchaser of a conveyance is a straw purchaser, must 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 274.15(a) of this part as to both the 
straw purchaser and the real purchaser to be eligible for a grant of 
remission of forfeiture. This provision applies where money is borrowed 
on the security of property held in the name of the straw purchaser for 
the real purchaser.
    (b) A petitioner engaged in the business of leasing conveyances must 
satisfy the requirements of Sec. 274.15(a) of this part as to all 
lessees and sublessees or other persons having any interest under a 
lease of the subject conveyance on the date of seizure of that 
conveyance to be eligible for a grant of remission of forfeiture.
    (c) In the consideration of a petition for relief from forfeiture 
the mere existence of a community property interest without proof of 
financial contribution to the purchase of a conveyance will not be 
deemed to have been a property interest in a seized and forfeited 
conveyance.
    (d) A petitioner that submits a petition for remission of forfeiture 
as a subrogee must satisfy the requirements of Sec. 274.15(a) of this 
part as to all prior possessors of the subrogated interest in the seized 
and forfeited conveyance to be eligible for a grant of remission of 
forfeiture.


<R05>
Sec. 274.19  Determinations on petitions; reconsideration.

    (a) Upon consideration of a petition for relief from forfeiture and 
all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure of a 
conveyance, the regional commissioner shall issue a written 
determination. In making that determination the regional commissioner 
shall presume that the evidence is sufficient to support forfeiture of 
the conveyance. No hearing shall be held on any petitions for relief 
from forfeiture under this part.
    (b) The regional commissioner may deny relief from forfeiture when 
there are unusual circumstances regarding a seizure which provide 
reasonable grounds for concluding that remission or mitigation of the 
forfeiture would be contrary to the interests of justice and would 
diminish the deterrent effect of section 274(b) of the Act, even if the 
petitioner has satisfactorily established compliance with the 
administrative conditions applicable to and eligibility for relief from 
forfeiture.
    (c) Relief from forfeiture shall not be granted to any petitioner 
who has a subordinate property interest to another petitioner until the 
petition of

[[Page 555]]

the petitioner with the superior property interest has been finally 
adjudicated nor until any claim or petition of the owner has been 
finally adjudicated.
    (d) The determination on a petition shall set forth either the 
conditions upon which relief has been granted and the procedures for 
obtaining possession of the forfeited conveyance or other relief 
granted; or the reasons for denial of relief from forfeiture and the 
procedures for requesting reconsideration. The determination on a 
petition shall be mailed to the petitioner or duly authorized counsel of 
the petitioner.
    (e) Any request for reconsideration of a denial of relief from 
forfeiture must be submitted to the regional commissioner within 10 days 
of receipt of the determination on the petition. Such request for 
reconsideration can only be based on evidence recently developed or not 
previously considered.
    (f) Only one request for reconsideration of a denial of relief from 
forfeiture shall be considered.


<R05>
Sec. 274.20  Compromise of judicial forfeiture proceedings.

    Judicial forfeiture proceedings commenced pursuant to section 274(b) 
of the Act and this part may be compromised by the United States 
Attorney only with the concurrence of the Director, Asset Forfeiture 
Office, Criminal Division, Department of Justice. In evaluating a 
compromise, the United States Attorney shall consider the probabilities 
for successfully prosecuting the judicial forfeiture proceedings and the 
terms of the compromise offer. The United States Attorney shall consult 
with the regional commissioner before recommending a compromise.

                    Subpart A--Employer Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 274a.1  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part--
    (a) The term unauthorized alien means, with respect to employment of 
an alien at a particular time, that the alien is not at that time 
either: (1) Lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or (2) authorized 
to be so employed by this Act or by the Attorney General;
    (b) The term entity means any legal entity, including but not 
limited to, a corporation, partnership, joint venture, governmental 
body, agency, proprietorship, or association;
    (c) The term hire means the actual commencement of employment of an 
employee for wages or other remuneration. For purposes of section 
274A(a)(4) of the Act and Sec. 274a.5 of this part, a hire occurs when a 
person or entity uses a contract, subcontract or exchange entered into, 
renegotiated or extended after November 6, 1986, to obtain the labor of 
an alien in the United States, knowing that the alien is an unauthorized 
alien;
    (d) The term refer for a fee means the act of sending or directing a 
person or transmitting documentation or information to another, directly 
or indirectly, with the intent of obtaining employment in the United 
States for such person, for remuneration whether on a retainer or 
contingency basis; however, this term does not include union hiring

[[Page 556]]

halls that refer union members or non-union individuals who pay union 
membership dues;
    (e) The term recruit for a fee means the act of soliciting a person, 
directly or indirectly, and referring that person to another with the 
intent of obtaining employment for that person, for remuneration whether 
on a retainer or contingency basis; however, this term does not include 
union hiring halls that refer union members or non-union individuals who 
pay union membership dues;
    (f) The term employee means an individual who provides services or 
labor for an employer for wages or other remuneration but does not mean 
independent contractors as defined in paragraph (j) of this section or 
those engaged in casual domestic employment as stated in paragraph (h) 
of this section;
    (g) The term employer means a person or entity, including an agent 
or anyone acting directly or indirectly in the interest thereof, who 
engages the services or labor of an employee to be performed in the 
United States for wages or other remuneration. In the case of an 
independent contractor or contract labor or services, the term employer 
shall mean the independent contractor or contractor and not the person 
or entity using the contract labor;
    (h) The term employment means any service or labor performed by an 
employee for an employer within the United States, including service or 
labor performed on a vessel or aircraft that has arrived in the United 
States and has been inspected, or otherwise included within the 
provisions of the Anti-Reflagging Act codified at 46 U.S.C. 8704, but 
not including duties performed by nonimmigrant crewmen defined in 
sections 101 (a)(10) and (a)(15)(D) of the Act. However, employment does 
not include casual employment by individuals who provide domestic 
service in a private home that is sporadic, irregular or intermittent;
    (i) The term State employment agency means any State government unit 
designated to cooperate with the United States Employment Service in the 
operation of the public employment service system;
    (j) The term independent contractor includes individuals or entities 
who carry on independent business, contract to do a piece of work 
according to their own means and methods, and are subject to control 
only as to results. Whether an individual or entity is an independent 
contractor, regardless of what the individual or entity calls itself, 
will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Factors to be considered in 
that determination include, but are not limited to, whether the 
individual or entity: supplies the tools or materials; makes services 
available to the general public; works for a number of clients at the 
same time; has an opportunity for profit or loss as a result of labor or 
services provided; invests in the facilities for work; directs the order 
or sequence in which the work is to be done and determines the hours 
during which the work is to be done. The use of labor or services of an 
independent contractor are subject to the restrictions in section 
274A(a)(4) of the Act and Sec. 274a.5 of this part;
    (k) The term pattern or practice means regular, repeated, and 
intentional activities, but does not include isolated, sporadic, or 
accidental acts;
    (l)(1) The term knowing includes not only actual knowledge but also 
knowledge which may fairly be inferred through notice of certain facts 
and circumstances which would lead a person, through the exercise of 
reasonable care, to know about a certain condition. Constructive 
knowledge may include, but is not limited to, situations where an 
employer:
    (i) Fails to complete or improperly completes the Employment 
Eligibility Verification Form, I-9;
    (ii) Has information available to it that would indicate that the 
alien is not authorized to work, such as Labor Certification and/or an 
Application for Prospective Employer; or
    (iii) Acts with reckless and wanton disregard for the legal 
consequences of permitting another individual to introduce an 
unauthorized alien into its work force or to act on its behalf.
    (2) Knowledge that an employee is unauthorized may not be inferred 
from an employee's foreign appearance or accent. Nothing in this 
definition should be interpreted as permitting an

[[Page 557]]

employer to request more or different documents than are required under 
section 274(b) of the Act or to refuse to honor documents tendered that 
on their face reasonably appear to be genuine and to relate to the 
individual.

Sec. 274a.2  Verification of employment eligibility.

    (a) General. This section states the requirements and procedures 
persons or entities must comply with when hiring, or when recruiting or 
referring for a fee, or when continuing to employ individuals in the 
United States. For purposes of complying with section 274A(b) of the Act 
and this section, all references to recruiters and referrers for a fee 
are limited to a person or entity who is either an agricultural 
association, agricultural employer, or farm labor contractor (as defined 
in section 3 of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection 
Act, 29 U.S.C. 1802). The Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification 
Form, has been designated by the Service as the form to be used in 
complying with the requirements of this section. The Form I-9 may be 
obtained in limited quantities at INS District Offices, or ordered from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, DC 20402. Employers may 
electronically generate blank Forms I-9, provided that: the resulting 
form is legible; there is no change to the name, content, or sequence of 
the data elements and instructions; no additional data elements or 
language are inserted; and the paper used meets the standards for 
retention and production for inspection specified under Sec. 274a.2(b). 
When copying or printing the Form I-9, the text of the two-sided form 
may be reproduced by making either double-sided or single-sided copies. 
Employers need only complete the Form I-9 for individuals who are hired 
after November 6, 1986 and continue to be employed after May 31, 1987. 
Employers shall have until September 1, 1987 to complete the Form I-9 
for individuals hired from November 7, 1986 through May 31, 1987. 
Recruiters and referrers for a fee need complete the Form I-9 only for 
those individuals who are recruited or referred and hired after May 31, 
1987. In conjunction with completing the Form I-9, an employer or 
recruiter or referrer for a fee must examine documents that evidence the 
identity and employment eligibility of the individual. The employer or 
recruiter or referrer for a fee and the individual must each complete an 
attestation on the Form I-9 under penalty of perjury.
    (b) Employment verification requirements--(1) Examination of 
documents and completion of Form I-9.
    (i) A person or entity that hires or recruits or refers for a fee an 
individual for employment must ensure that the individual properly:
    (A) Complete section 1--``Employee Information and Verification''--
on the Form I-9 at the time of hire; or if an individual is unable to 
complete the Form I-9 or needs it translated, someone may assist him or 
her. The preparer or translator must read the Form to the individual, 
assist him or her in completing Section 1--``Employee Information and 
Verification,'' and have the individual sign or mark the Form in the 
appropriate place. The preparer or translator must then complete the 
``Preparer/Translator Certification'' portion of the Form I-9; and
    (B) Present to the employer or the recruiter or referrer for a fee 
documentation as set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section 
establishing his or her identity and employment eligibility within the 
time limits set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (b)(1)(v) of this 
section.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, 
an employer, his or her agent, or anyone acting directly or indirectly 
in the interest thereof, must within three business days of the hire:
    (A) Physically examine the documentation presented by the individual 
establishing identity and employment eligibility as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section and ensure that the documents 
presented appear to be genuine and to relate to the individual; and
    (B) Complete section 2--``Employer Review and Verification''--of the 
Form I-9.
    (iii) An employer who hires an individual for employment for a 
duration

[[Page 558]]

of less than three business days must comply with paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section at the time of the hire. 
An employer may not accept a receipt, as described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(vi) of this section, in lieu of the required document if the 
employment is for less than three business days.
    (iv) A recruiter or referrer for a fee for employment must comply 
with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section within 
three business days of the date the referred individual is hired by the 
employer. Recruiters and referrers may designate agents to complete the 
employment verification procedures on their behalf including but not 
limited to notaries, national associations, or employers. If a recruiter 
or referrer designates an employer to complete the employment 
verification procedures, the employer need only provide the recruiter or 
referrer with a photocopy of the Form I-9.
    (v) The individual may present either an original document which 
establishes both employment authorization and identity, or an original 
document which establishes employment authorization and a separate 
original document which establishes identity. The identification number 
and expiration date (if any) of all documents must be noted in the 
appropriate space provided on the Form I-9.
    (A) The following documents, so long as they appear to relate to the 
individual presenting the document, are acceptable to evidence both 
identity and employment eligibility:
    (1) United States passport (unexpired or expired);

specific employer incident to status, an unexpired foreign passport with 
an Arrival-Departure Record, Form I-94, bearing the same name as the 
passport and containing an endorsement of the alien's nonimmigrant 
status, so long as the period of endorsement has not yet expired and the 
proposed employment is not in conflict with any restrictions or 
limitations identified on the Form I-94.
    (B) The following documents are acceptable to establish identity 
only:
    (1) For individuals 16 years of age or older:
    (i) A driver's license or identification card containing a 
photograph, issued by a state (as defined in section 101(a)(36) of the 
Act) or an outlying possession of the United States (as defined by

identity documents listed in paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) (1) or (2) of this 
section, who are being placed into employment by a nonprofit 
organization, association or as part of a rehabilitation program, may 
follow the procedures for establishing identity provided in this section 
for minors under the age of 18, substituting where appropriate, the term

addition to a parent or legal guardian, a representative from the 
nonprofit organization, association or rehabilitation program placing 
the individual into a position of employment, to fill out and sign in 
the appropriate section, the Form I-9. For purposes of this section the

State, Form FS-545;

    (vi) Special rules for receipts. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section, unless the individual indicates or the 
employer or recruiter or referrer for a fee has actual or constructive 
knowledge that the individual is not authorized to work, an employer or 
recruiter or referrer for a fee must accept a receipt for the 
application for a replacement document or a document described in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(vi)(B)((1) and (b)(1)(vi)(C)((1) of this section in 
lieu of the required document in order to comply with any requirement to

she is a lawful permanent resident and the individual:
    (1) Presents the arrival portion of Form I-94 containing an

    (2) Presents the Form I-551 within 180 days of the hire or, in the 
case of reverification, the date employment authorization expires; or
    (C) Form I-94 indicating refugee status. The individual indicates in 
section 1 of the Form I-9 that he or she is an alien authorized to work 
and the individual:
    (1) Presents the departure portion of Form I-94 containing an 
unexpired refugee admission stamp, which is designated for purposes of 
this section as a receipt for either the Form I-766 or a social security 
account number card that contains no employment restrictions; and
    (2) Presents, within 90 days of the hire or, in the case of 
reverification, the date employment authorization expires, either an 
unexpired Form I-766; or a social security account number card that 
contains no employment restrictions together with a document described 
under paragraph (b)(1)(v)(B) of this section.
    (vii) If an individual's employment authorization expires, the 
employer, recruiter or referrer for a fee must reverify on the Form I-9 
to reflect that the individual is still authorized to work in the United 
States; otherwise the individual may no longer be employed, recruited, 
or referred. Reverification on the Form I-9 must occur not later than 
the date work authorization expires. In order to reverify on the Form I-
9, the employee or referred individual must present a document that 
either shows continuing employment eligibility or is a new grant of work 
authorization. The employer or the recruiter or referrer for a fee must 
review this document, and if it appears to be genuine and to relate to 
the individual, reverify by noting the document's identification number 
and expiration date on the Form I-9.
    (viii) An employer will not be deemed to have hired an individual 
for employment if the individual is continuing in his or her employment 
and has a reasonable expectation of employment at all times.
    (A) An individual is continuing in his or her employment in one of 
the following situations:
    (1) An individual takes approved paid or unpaid leave on account of 
study, illness or disability of a family member, illness or pregnancy, 
maternity or paternity leave, vacation, union business, or other 
temporary leave approved by the employer;
    (2) An individual is promoted, demoted, or gets a pay raise;
    (3) An individual is temporarily laid off for lack of work;
    (4) An individual is on strike or in a labor dispute;
    (5) An individual is reinstated after disciplinary suspension for 
wrongful termination, found unjustified by any court, arbitrator, or 
administrative body, or otherwise resolved through reinstatement or 
settlement;
    (6) An individual transfers from one distinct unit of an employer to 
another distinct unit of the same employer; the employer may transfer 
the individual's Form I-9 to the receiving unit;
    (7) An individual continues his or her employment with a related, 
successor, or reorganized employer, provided that the employer obtains 
and maintains from the previous employer records and Forms I-9 where 
applicable. For this purpose, a related, successor, or reorganized 
employer includes:
    (i) The same employer at another location;
    (ii) An employer who continues to employ some or all of a previous 
employer's workforce in cases involving a corporate reorganization, 
merger, or sale of stock or assets;
    (iii) An employer who continues to employ any employee of another 
employer's workforce where both employers belong to the same multi-
employer association and the employee continues to work in the same 
bargaining unit under the same collective bargaining agreement. For 
purposes of this subsection, any agent designated to complete and 
maintain the Form I-9 must record the employee's date of hire and/or 
termination each time the employee is hired and/or terminated by an 
employer of the multi-employer association; or
    (8) An individual is engaged in seasonal employment.
    (B) The employer who is claiming that an individual is continuing in 
his or her employment must also establish that the individual expected 
to resume employment at all times and that the individual's expectation 
is reasonable.

[[Page 561]]

Whether an individual's expectation is reasonable will be determined on 
a case-by-case basis taking into consideration several factors. Factors 
which would indicate that an individual has a reasonable expectation of 
employment include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) The individual in question was employed by the employer on a 
regular and substantial basis. A determination of a regular and 
substantial basis is established by a comparison of other workers who 
are similarly employed by the employer;
    (2) The individual in question complied with the employer's 
established and published policy regarding his or her absence;
    (3) The employer's past history of recalling absent employees for 
employment indicates a likelihood that the individual in question will 
resume employment with the employer within a reasonable time in the 
future;
    (4) The former position held by the individual in question has not 
been taken permanently by another worker;
    (5) The individual in question has not sought or obtained benefits 
during his or her absence from employment with the employer that are 
inconsistent with an expectation of resuming employment with the 
employer within a reasonable time in the future. Such benefits include, 
but are not limited to, severance and retirement benefits;
    (6) The financial condition of the employer indicates the ability of 
the employer to permit the individual in question to resume employment 
within a reasonable time in the future; or
    (7) The oral and/or written communication between employer, the 
employer's supervisory employees and the individual in question 
indicates that it is reasonably likely that the individual in question 
will resume employment with the employer within a reasonable time in the 
future.
    (2) Retention and Inspection of Form I-9. (i) Form I-9 must be 
retained by an employer or a recruiter or referrer for a fee for the 
following time periods:
    (A) In the case of an employer, three years after the date of the 
hire or one year after the date the individual's employment is 
terminated, whichever is later; or
    (B) In the case of a recruiter or referrer for a fee, three years 
after the date of the hire.
    (ii) Any person or entity required to retain Forms I-9 in accordance 
with this section shall be provided with at least three days notice 
prior to an inspection of the Forms I-9 by officers of the Service, the 
Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or 
the Departmet of Labor. At the time of inspection, Forms I-9 must be 
made available in their original form or on microfilm or microfiche at 
the location where the request for production was made. If Forms I-9 are 
kept at another location, the person or entity must inform the officer 
of the Service, the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair 
Employment Practices, or the Department of Labor of the location where 
the forms are kept and make arrangements for the inspection. Inspections 
may be performed at an INS office. A recruiter or referrer for a fee who 
has designated an employer to complete the employment verification 
procedures may present a photocopy of the Form I-9 in lieu of presenting 
the Form I-9 in its original form or on microfilm or microfiche, as set 
forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. Any refusal or delay in 
presentation of the Forms I-9 for inspection is a violation of the 
retention requirements as set forth in section 274A(b) (3) of the Act. 
No Subpoena or warrant shall be required for such inspection, but the 
use of such enforcement tools is not precluded. In addition, if the 
person or entity has not complied with a request to present the Forms I-
9, any Service officer listed in Sec. 287.4 of this chapter may compel 
production of the Forms I-9 and any other relevant documents by issuing 
a subpoena. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the Service's 
subpoena power under section 235(a) of the Act.
    (iii) The following standards shall apply to Forms I-9 presented on 
microfilm or microfiche submitted to an officer of the Service, the 
Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or 
the Department of Labor: Microfilm, when displayed on

[[Page 562]]

a microfilm reader (viewer) or reproduced on paper must exhibit a high 
degree of legibility and readability. For this purpose, legibility is 
defined as the quality of a letter or numeral which enables the observer 
to positively and quickly identify it to the exclusion of all other 
letters or numerals. Readability is defined as the quality of a group of 
letters or numerals being recognizable as words or whole numbers. A 
detailed index of all microfilmed data shall be maintained and arranged 
in such a manner as to permit the immediate location of any particular 
record. It is the responsibility of the employer, recruiter or referrer 
for a fee:
    (A) To provide for the processing, storage and maintenace of all 
microfilm, and
    (B) To be able to make the contents thereof available as required by 
law. The person or entity presenting the microfilm will make available a 
reader-printer at the examination site for the ready reading, location 
and reproduction of any record or records being maintained on microfilm. 
Reader-printers made available to an officer of the Service, the Special 
Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the 
Department of Labor shall provide safety features and be in clean 
condition, properly maintained and in good working order. The reader-
printers must have the capacity to display and print a complete page of 
information. A person or entity who is determined to have failed to 
comply with the criteria established by this regulation for the 
presentation of microfilm or microfiche to the Service, the Special 
Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices, or the 
Department of Labor, and at the time of the inspection does not present 
a properly completed Form I-9 for the employee, is in violation of 
section 274A(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Sec. 274a.2(b)(2).
    (3) Copying of documentation. An employer, or a recruiter or 
referrer for a fee may, but is not required to, copy a document 
presented by an individual solely for the purpose of complying with the 
verification requirements of this section. If such a copy is made, it 
must be retained with the Form I-9. The retention requirements in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section do not apply to the photocopies. The 
copying of any such document and retention of the copy does not relieve 
the employer from the requirement to fully complete section 2 of the 
Form I-9. An employer, recruiter or referrer for a fee should not, 
however, copy the documents only of individuals of certain national 
origins or citizenship statuses. To do so may violate section 274B of 
the Act.
    (4) Limitation on use of Form I-9. Any information contained in or 
appended to the Form I-9, including copies of documents listed in 
paragraph (c) of this section used to verify an individual's identity or 
employment eligibility, may be used only for enforcement of the Act and 
sections 1001, 1028, 1546, or 1621 of title 18, United States Code.
    (c) Employment verification requirements in the case of hiring an 
individual who was previously employed. (1) When an employer hires an 
individual whom that person or entity has previously employed, if the 
employer has previously completed the Form I-9 and complied with the 
verification requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section 
with regard to the individual, the employer may (in lieu of completing a 
new Form I-9) inspect the previously completed Form I-9 and:
    (i) If upon inspection of the Form I-9, the employer determines that 
the Form I-9 relates to the individual and that the individual is still 
eligible to work, that previously executed Form I-9 is sufficient for 
purposes of section 274A(b) of the Act if the individual is hired within 
three years of the date of the initial execution of the Form I-9 and the 
employer updates the Form I-9 to reflect the date of rehire; or
    (ii) If upon inspection of the Form I-9, the employer determines 
that the individual's employment authorization has expired, the employer 
must reverify on the Form I-9 in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(vii); 
otherwise the individual may no longer be employed.
    (2) For purposes of retention of the Form I-9 by an employer for a 
previously employed individual hired pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, the employer shall retain the Form I-9 for a period of 
three years

[[Page 563]]

commencing from the date of the initial execution of the Form I-9 or one 
year after the individual's employment is terminated, whichever is 
later.
    (d) Employment verification requirements in the case of recruiting 
or referring for a fee an individual who was previously recruited or 
referred. (1) When a recruiter or referrer for a fee refers an 
individual for whom that recruiter or referrer for a fee has previously 
completed a Form I-9 and complied with the verification requirements set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section with regard to the individual, 
the recruiter or referrer may (in lieu of completing a new Form I-9) 
inspect the previously completed Form I-9 and:
    (i) If upon inspection of the Form I-9, the recruiter or referrer 
for a fee determines that the Form I-9 relates to the individual and 
that the individual is still eligible to work, that previously executed 
Form I-9 is sufficient for purposes of section 274A(b) of the Act if the 
individual is referred within three years of the date of the initial 
execution of the Form I-9 and the recruiter or referrer for a fee 
updates the Form I-9 to reflect the date of rehire; or
    (ii) If upon inspection of the Form I-9, the recruiter or referrer 
determines that the individual's employment authorization has expired, 
the recruiter or referrer for a fee must reverify on the Form I-9 in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section; otherwise the 
individual may no longer be recruited or referred.
    (2) For purposes of retention of the Form I-9 by a recruiter or 
referrer for a previously recruited or referred individual pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the recruiter or referrer shall retain 
the Form I-9 for a period of three years from the date of the rehire.

Sec. 274a.6  State employment agencies.

    (a) General. Pursuant to sections 274A(a)(5) and 274A(b) of the Act, 
a state employment agency as defined in Sec. 274a.1 of this part may, 
but is not required to, verify identity and employment eligibility of 
individuals referred for employment by the agency. However, should a 
state employment agency choose to do so, it must:
    (1) Complete the verification process in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part provided that the individual 
may not present receipts in lieu of documents in order to complete the 
verification process as otherwise permitted by Sec. 274a.2(b)(1)(vi) of 
this part; and
    (2) Complete the verification process prior to referral for all 
individuals for whom a certification is required to be issued pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section.

[[Page 564]]

    (b) Compliance with the provisions of section 274A of the Act. A 
state employment agency which chooses to verify employment eligibility 
of individuals pursuant to Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part shall comply with 
all provisions of section 274A of the Act and the regulations issued 
thereunder.
    (c) State employment agency certification. (1) A state employment 
agency which chooses to verify employment eligibility pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section shall issue to an employer who hires an 
individual referred for employment by the agency, a certification as set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The certification shall be 
transmitted by the state employment agency directly to the employer, 
personally by an agency official, or by mail, so that it will be 
received by the employer within 21 business days of the date that the 
referred individual is hired. In no case shall the certification be 
transmitted to the employer from the state employment agency by the 
individual referred. During this period:
    (i) The job order or other appropriate referral form issued by the 
state employment agency to the employer, on behalf of the individual who 
is referred and hired, shall serve as evidence, with respect to that 
individual, of the employer's compliance with the provisions of section 
274A(a)(1)(B) of the Act and the regulations issued thereunder.
    (ii) In the case of a telephonically authorized job referral by the 
state employment agency to the employer, an appropriate annotation by 
the employer shall be made and shall serve as evidence of the job order. 
The employer should retain the document containing the annotation where 
the employer retains Forms I-9.
    (2) Job orders or other referrals, including telephonic 
authorizations, which are used as evidence of compliance pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall contain:
    (i) The name of the referred individual;
    (ii) The date of the referral;
    (iii) The job order number or other applicable identifying number 
relating to the referral;
    (iv) The name and title of the referring state employment agency 
official; and
    (v) The telephone number and address of the state employment agency.
    (3) A state employment agency shall not be required to verify 
employment eligibility or to issue a certification to an employer to 
whom the agency referred an individual if the individual is hired for a 
period of employment not to exceed 3 days in duration. Should a state 
agency choose to verify employment eligibility and to issue a 
certification to an employer relating to an individual who is hired for 
a period of employment not to exceed 3 days in duration, it must verify 
employment eligibility and issue certifications relating to all such 
individuals. Should a state employment agency choose not to verify 
employment eligibility or issue certifications to employers who hire, 
for a period not to exceed 3 days in duration, agency-referred 
individuals, the agency shall notify employers that, as a matter of 
policy, it does not perform verifications for individuals hired for that 
length of time, and that the employers must complete the identity and 
employment eligibility requirements pursuant to Sec. 274a.2(b) of this 
part. Such notification may be incorporated into the job order or other 
referral form utilized by the state employment agency as appropriate.
    (4) An employer to whom a state employment agency issues a 
certification relating to an individual referred by the agency and hired 
by the employer, shall be deemed to have complied with the verification 
requirements of Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part provided that the employer:
    (i) Reviews the identifying information contained in the 
certification to ensure that it pertains to the individual hired;
    (ii) Observes the signing of the certification by the individual at 
the time of its receipt by the employer as provided for in paragraph 
(d)(13) of this section;
    (iii) Complies with the provisions of Sec. 274a.2(b)(1)(vii) of this 
part by either:
    (A) Updating the state employment agency certification in lieu of 
Form I-9, upon expiration of the employment authorization date, if any, 
which was noted on the certification issued by the state employment 
agency pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section; or

[[Page 565]]

    (B) By no longer employing an individual upon expiration of his or 
her employment authorization date noted on the certification;
    (iv) Retains the certification in the same manner prescribed for 
Form I-9 in Sec. 274a.2(b)(2) of this part, to wit, three years after 
the date of the hire or one year after the date the individual's 
employment is terminated, whichever is later; and
    (v) Makes it available for inspection to officers of the Service or 
the Department of Labor, pursuant to the provisions of section 
274A(b)(3) of the Act, and Sec. 274a.2(b)(2) of this part.
    (5) Failure by an employer to comply with the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section shall constitute a violation of 
section 274A(a)(2) of the Act and shall subject the employer to the 
penalties contained in section 274A(e)(4) of the Act, and Sec. 274a.10 
of this part.
    (d) Standards for state employment agency certifications. All 
certifications issued by a state employment agency pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section shall conform to the following standards. They must:
    (1) Be issued on official agency letterhead;
    (2) Be signed by an appropriately designated official of the agency;
    (3) Bear a date of issuance;
    (4) Contain the employer's name and address;
    (5) State the name and date of birth of the individual referred;
    (6) Identify the position or type of employment for which the 
individual is referred;
    (7) Bear a job order number relating to the position or type of 
employment for which the individual is referred;
    (8) Identify the document or documents presented by the individual 
to the state employment agency for the purposes of identity and 
employment eligibility verification;
    (9) State the identifying number or numbers of the document or 
documents described in paragraph (d)(8) of this section;
    (10) Certify that the agency has complied with the requirements of 
section 274A(b) of the Act concerning verification of the identity and 
employment eligibility of the individual referred, and has determined 
that, to the best of the agency's knowledge, the individual is 
authorized to work in the United States;
    (11) Clearly state any restrictions, conditions, expiration dates or 
other limitations which relate to the individual's employment 
eligibility in the United States, or contain an affirmative statement 
that the employment authorization of the referred individual is not 
restricted;
    (12) State that the employer is not required to verify the 
individual's identity or employment eligibility, but must retain the 
certification in lieu of Form I-9;
    (13) Contain a space or a line for the signature of the referred 
individual, requiring the individual under penalty of perjury to sign 
his or her name before the employer at the time of receipt of the 
certification by the employer; and
    (14) State that counterfeiting, falsification, unauthorized issuance 
or alteration of the certification constitutes a violation of federal 
law pursuant to title 18, U.S.C. 1546.
    (e) Retention of Form I-9 by state employment agencies. A Form I-9 
utilized by a state employment agency in verifying the identity and 
employment eligibility of an individual pursuant to Sec. 274a.2(b) of 
this part must be retained by a state employment agency for a period of 
three years from the date that the individual was last referred by the 
agency and hired by an employer. A state employment agency may retain a 
Form I-9 either in its original form, or on microfilm or microfiche.
    (f) Retention of state employment agency certifications. A 
certification issued by a state employment agency pursuant to this 
section shall be retained:
    (1) By a state employment agency, for a period of three years from 
the date that the individual was last referred by the agency and hired 
by an employer, and in a manner to be determined by the agency which 
will enable the prompt retrieval of the information contained on the 
original certification for comparison with the relating Form I-9;
    (2) By the employer, in the original form, and in the same manner 
and location as the employer has designated for retention of Forms I-9, 
and for the

[[Page 566]]

period of time provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (g) State employment agency verification requirements in the case of 
an individual who was previously referred and certified. When a state 
employment agency refers an individual for whom the verification 
requirements have been previously complied with and a Form I-9 
completed, the agency shall inspect the previously completed Form I-9:
    (1) If, upon inspection of the Form, the agency determines that the 
Form I-9 pertains to the individual and that the individual remains 
authorized to be employed in the United States, no additional 
verification need be conducted and no new Form I-9 need be completed 
prior to issuance of a new certification provided that the individual is 
referred by the agency within 3 years of the execution of the initial 
Form I-9.
    (2) If, upon inspection of the Form, the agency determines that the 
Form I-9 pertains to the individual but that the individual does not 
appear to be authorized to be employed in the United States based on 
restrictions, expiration dates or other conditions annotated on the Form 
I-9, the agency shall not issue a certification unless the agency 
follows the updating procedures pursuant to Sec. 274a.2(b)(1)(vii) of 
this part; otherwise the individual may no longer be referred for 
employment by the state employment agency.
    (3) For the purposes of retention of the Form I-9 by a state 
employment agency pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, for an 
individual previously referred and certified, the state employment 
agency shall retain the Form for a period of 3 years from the date that 
the individual is last referred and hired.
    (h) Employer verification requirements in the case of an individual 
who was previously referred and certified. When an employer rehires an 
individual for whom the verification and certification requirements have 
been previously complied with by a state employment agency, the employer 
shall inspect the previously issued certification.
    (1) If, upon inspection of the certification, the employer 
determines that the certification pertains to the individual and that 
the individual remains authorized to be employed in the United States, 
no additional verification need be conducted and no new Form I-9 or 
certification need be completed provided that the individual is rehired 
by the employer within 3 years of the issuance of the initial 
certification, and that the employer follows the same procedures for the 
certification which pertain to Form I-9, as specified in 
Sec. 274a.2(c)(1)(i) of this part.
    (2) If, upon inspection of the certification, the employer 
determines that the certification pertains to the individual but that 
the certification reflects restrictions, expiration dates or other 
conditions which indicate that the individual no longer appears 
authorized to be employed in the United States, the employer shall 
verify that the individual remains authorized to be employed and shall 
follow the updating procedures for the certification which pertain to 
Form I-9, as specified in Sec. 274a.2(c)(1)(ii) of this part; otherwise 
the individual may no longer be employed.
    (3) For the purposes of retention of the certification by an 
employer pursuant to this paragraph for an individual previously 
referred and certified by a state employment agency and rehired by the 
employer, the employer shall retain the certification for a period of 3 
years after the date that the individual is last hired, or one year 
after the date the individual's employment is terminated, whichever is

provisions alleged to have been violated.
    (d) Notice of Intent to Fine. The proceeding to assess 
administrative penalties under section 274A of the Act is commenced when

Sec. 274a.10  Penalties.

    (a) Criminal penalties. Any person or entity which engages in a 
pattern or practice of violations of subsection (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2) of 
the Act shall be fined not more than $3,000 for each unauthorized alien, 
imprisoned for not more than six months for the entire pattern or 
practice, or both, notwithstanding the provisions of any other Federal 
law relating to fine levels.
    (b) Civil penalties. A person or entity may face civil penalties for 
a violation of section 274A of the Act. Civil penalties may be imposed 
by the Service or an administrative law judge for violations under 
section 274A of the Act. In determining the level of the penalties that 
will be imposed, a finding of more than one violation in the course of a 
single proceeding or determination will be counted as a single offense. 
However, a single offense will include penalties for each unauthorized 
alien who is determined to have been knowingly hired or recruited or 
referred for a fee.
    (1) A respondent found by the Service or an administrative law judge 
to have knowingly hired, or to have knowingly recruited or referred for 
a fee, an unauthorized alien for employment in the United States or to 
have knowingly continued to employ an unauthorized alien in the United 
States, shall be subject to the following order:
    (i) To cease and desist from such behavior;
    (ii) To pay a civil fine according to the following schedule:
    (A) First offense--not less than $250 and not more than $2,000 for 
each unauthorized alien, or
    (B) Second offense--not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000 
for each unauthorized alien; or
    (C) More than two offenses--not less than $3,000 and not more than 
$10,000 for each unauthorized alien; and
    (iii) To comply with the requirements of section 274a.2(b) of this 
part,

[[Page 569]]

and to take such other remedial action as is appropriate.
    (2) A respondent determined by the Service (if a respondent fails to 
request a hearing) or by an administrative law judge to have failed to 
comply with the employment verification requirements as set forth in 
Sec. 274a.2(b) of this part, shall be subject to a civil penalty in an 
amount of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000 for each 
individual with respect to whom such violation occurred. In determining 
the amount of the penalty, consideration shall be given to:
    (i) The size of the business of the employer being charged;
    (ii) The good faith of the employer;
    (iii) The seriousness of the violation;
    (iv) Whether or not the individual was an unauthorized alien; and
    (v) The history of previous violations of the employer.
    (3) Where an order is issued with respect to a respondent composed 
of distinct, physically separate subdivisions which do their own hiring, 
or their own recruiting or referring for a fee for employment (without 
reference to the practices of, and under the control of, or common 
control with another subdivision) the subdivision shall be considered a 
separate person or entity.
    (c) Enjoining pattern or practice violations. If the Attorney 
General has reasonable cause to believe that a person or entity is 
engaged in a pattern or practice of employment, recruitment or referral 
in violation of section 274A(a)(1)(A) or (2) of the Act, the Attorney 
General may bring civil action in the appropriate United States District 
Court requesting relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, 
restraining order, or other order against the person or entity, as the 
Attorney General deems necessary.

is precluded from such classification solely because the employee is not 
a national of the country of the airline's nationality or because there 
is no treaty of commerce and navigation in effect between the United 
States and the country of the airline's nationality.
    (18) An alien against whom a final order of deportation or removal 
exists and who is released on an order of supervision under the 
authority contained in section 241(a)(3) of the Act may be granted 
employment authorization in the discretion of the district director only 
if the alien cannot be removed due to the refusal of all countries

alien, or because the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or 
contrary to the public interest. Additional factors which may be 
considered by the district director in adjudicating the application for 
employment authorization include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (i) The existence of economic necessity to be employed;
    (ii) The existence of a dependent spouse and/or children in the 
United States who rely on the alien for support; and
    (iii) The anticipated length of time before the alien can be removed 
from the United States.

accordance with the procedures set forth in part 244 of this chapter.
    (20) Any alien who has filed a completed legalization application 
pursuant to section 210 of the Act (and part 210 of this chapter).

when an administrative appeal is pending) and shall expire on a 
specified date.
    (21) A principal nonimmigrant witness or informant in S 
classification, and qualified dependent family members.
    (22) Any alien who has filed a completed legalization application

Employment authorization shall be granted in increments not exceeding 1 
year during the period the application is pending (including any period 
when an administrative appeal is pending) and shall expire on a 
specified date.
    (d) Basic criteria to establish economic necessity. Title 45--Public 
Welfare, Poverty Guidelines, 45 CFR 1060.2 should be used as the basic 
criteria to establish

[[Page 575]]

eligibility for employment authorization when the alien's economic 
necessity is identified as a factor. The alien shall submit an 
application for employment authorization listing his or her assets, 
income, and expenses as evidence of his or her economic need to work. 
Permission to work granted on the basis of the alien's application for 
employment authorization may be revoked under Sec. 274a.14 of this 
chapter upon a showing that the information contained in the statement 
was not true and correct.

Sec. 274a.12(c)(8), shall file a Form I-765 with the director having 
jurisdiction over applicant's residence, or the director having 
jurisdiction over the port of entry at which the alien applies, or with 
such other Service office as the Commissioner may designate. The 
approval of applications filed under Sec. 274a.12(c) of this part, 
except for Sec. 274a.12(c)(8), shall be within the discretion of the 
director or such other officer as the Commissioner may designate. Where 
economic necessity has been identified as a factor, the alien must 
provide information regarding his or her assets, income, and expenses in 
accordance with instructions on Form I-765.
    (2) An initial Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) 
for asylum applicants under 274a.12(c)(8) of this part shall be filed in 
accordance with instructions on or attached to Form I-765 with the 
appropriate Service Center or with such other Service office as the 
Commissioner may designate. The applicant also must submit a copy of the 
underlying application for asylum or withholding of deportation, 
together with evidence that the application has been filed in accordance 
with Secs. 208.3 and 208.4 of this chapter. An application for an 
initial employment authorization or for a renewal of employment 
authorization filed in relation to a pending claim for asylum shall be 
adjudicated in accordance with Sec. 208.7 of this chapter. An 
application for renewal or replacement of employment authorization 
submitted in relation to a pending claim for asylum, as provided in 
Sec. 208.7 of this chapter, shall be filed, with fee or application for 
waiver of such fee, in accordance with the instructions on or attached 
to Form I-765 with the appropriate Service Center or with such other 
Service office as the Commissioner may designate.
    (b) Approval of application. If the application is granted, the

for employment authorization under Sec. 274a.12(c)(8), which is governed 
by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and Sec. 274a.12(c)(9) in so far as 
it is governed by Sec. 245.13(j) of this chapter. Failure to complete 
the adjudication within 90 days will result in the grant of an 
employment authorization document for a period not to exceed 240 days. 
Such authorization shall be subject to any conditions noted on the 
employment authorization document. However, if the director adjudicates 
the application prior to the expiration date of the interim employment 
authorization and denies the individual's employment authorization 
application, the interim employment authorization

granted under this section shall automatically terminate as of the date 
of the director's adjudication and denial.

Sec. 274a.14  Termination of employment authorization.

    (a) Automatic termination of employment authorization. (1) 
Employment authorization granted under Sec. 274a.12(c) of this chapter 
shall automatically terminate upon the occurrence of one of the 
following events:
    (i) The expiration date specified by the Service on the employment 
authorization document is reached;
    (ii) Exclusion or deportation proceedings are instituted (however, 
this shall not preclude the authorization of employment pursuant to 
Sec. 274a.12(c) of this part where appropriate); or
    (iii) The alien is granted voluntary departure.
    (2) Termination of employment authorization pursuant to this 
paragraph does not require the service of a notice of intent to revoke; 
employment authorization terminates upon the occurrence of any event 
enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    However, automatic revocation under this section does not preclude 
reapplication for employment authorization under Sec. 274.12(c) of this 
part.
    (b) Revocation of employment authorization--(1) Basis for revocation 
of employment authorization. Employment authorization granted under 
Sec. 274a.12(c) of this chapter may be revoked by the district director:
    (i) Prior to the expiration date, when it appears that any condition 
upon which it was granted has not been met or no longer exists, or for 
good cause shown; or
    (ii) Upon a showing that the information contained in the 
application is not true and correct.
    (2) Notice of intent to revoke employment authorization. When a 
district director determines that employment authorization should be 
revoked prior to the expiration date specified by the Service, he or she 
shall serve written notice of intent to revoke the employment 
authorization. The notice will cite the reasons indicating that 
revocation is warranted. The alien will be granted a period of fifteen 
days from the date of service of the notice within which to submit 
countervailing evidence. The decision by the district director shall be 
final and no appeal shall lie from the decision to revoke the 
authorization.
    (c) Automatic termination of temporary employment authorization 
granted prior to June 1, 1987. (1) Temporary employment authorization 
granted prior to June 1, 1987, pursuant to 8 CFR 274a.12(c) 
(Sec. 109.1(b) contained in the 8 CFR edition revised as of January 1, 
1987), shall automatically terminate on the date specified by the 
Service on the document issued to the alien, or on December 31, 1996, 
whichever is earlier. Automatic termination of temporary employment 
authorization does not preclude a subsequent application for temporary 
employment authorization.
    (2) A document issued by the Service prior to June 1, 1987, that 
authorized temporary employment authorization for any period beyond 
December 31, 1996, is null and void pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. The alien shall be issued a new employment authorization 
document upon application to the Service if the alien is eligible for 
temporary employment authorization pursuant to 274A.12(c).
    (3) No notice of intent to revoke is necessary for the automatic 
termination of temporary employment authorization pursuant to this part.

Sec. 280.1  Notice of intention to fine; administrative proceedings not exclusive.

    Whenever a district director or the Associate Commissioner for 
Examinations, or the Director for the National Fines Office has reason 
to believe that any person has violated any of the provisions of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act and has thereby become liable to the 
imposition of an administrative fine under the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, he shall cause a Notice of Intention to Fine, Form I-
79, to be served as provided in this part. Nothing in this subchapter 
shall affect, restrict, or prevent the institution of a civil suit, in 
the discretion of the Attorney General, under the authority contained in 
section 280 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

<R05>
Sec. 280.2  Special provisions relating to aircraft.

    In any case in which the imposition of a fine is predicated upon an 
alleged violation of a regulation promulgated under authority of section 
239 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the procedure prescribed in 
this part shall be followed and the aircraft involved shall not be 
granted clearance pending determination of the question of liability to 
the payment of any fine, or while the fine remains unpaid; but clearance 
may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the 
deposit of a sum sufficient to cover such fine or of a bond with 
sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof, approved by the 
Commisioner. If the alleged violation was by the owner or person in 
command of the aircraft, the penalty provided for shall be a lien 
against the aircraft, which, except as provided in Sec. 280.21, shall be 
seized by the district director or by an immigration officer designated 
by the district director, and placed in the custody of the customs 
officer who is in charge of the port of entry or customs station nearest 
the place of seizure. If the owner or owners of the airport at which 
such aircraft is located are the owners of the seized aircraft, the 
aircraft shall be removed to another suitable place for storage if 
practicable.

Sec. 280.3  Departure of vessel or aircraft prior to denial of clearance.

    If any vessel or aircraft which is subject to the imposition of a 
fine shall have departed from the United States prior to the denial of 
clearance by the district director of customs and such vessel or 
aircraft is subsequently found in the United States, a Notice of 
Intention to Fine, Form I-79, shall be served as provided in this part, 
if such form has not been previously served for the same violation. 
Clearance of such vessel or aircraft shall be withheld by the district 
director of customs, and the procedure prescribed in this part shall be 
followed to the same extent and in the same manner as though the vessel 
or aircraft had not departed from the United States. Aircraft subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 280.2, which shall have departed from the United 
States prior to the time of seizure could be effected, shall be subject 
to all of the provisions of this part, if subsequently found in the 
United States, to the same extent as though it had not departed from the 
United States.

which remits $10,000 or more in fees in any one calendar quarter, shall

accepted accounting principles of their respective countries. These 
reports from the independent accountants are to be submitted for receipt 
by the Assistant Commissioner, Financial Management no later than ninety 
(90) days after the close of the fiscal year of each remitter. Each 
remitter, which does not retain an independent accountant or which does 
not remit $10,000 or more in any one calendar quarter, shall certify 
under oath on each statement submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section that they have complied with the applicable statutes and 
regulations.
    (f) The Commissioner reserves the right to conduct an independent 
audit of any collector or remitter not providing the report or 
certification required pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section or 
based upon other information

[[Page 584]]

indicating non-compliance in order to assure the accuracy of the 
remittances of fees collected and remitted and compliance with the 
applicable statutes and regulations.
    (g) In order to enforce compliance with the provisions of this part, 
the Commissioner may issue a subpoena requiring the production of 
records, evidence, and witnesses pursuant to the procedures set forth in

to movements of persons effecting illegal entry into the United States: 
Provided, That whenever in the opinion of a district director a distance

such district director shall forward a complete report with respect to 
the matter to the Commissioner, who may, if he determines that such

provision of the laws administered or enforced by the Service, he or she 
shall immediately initiate an investigation to determine all the 
pertinent facts and circumstances and shall take such further action as 
he or she deems necessary. In no case shall this investigation prejudice

    (a) Examination. An alien arrested without a warrant of arrest under 
the authority contained in section 287(a)(2) of the Act will be examined 
by an officer other than the arresting officer. If no other qualified 
officer is readily available and the taking of the alien before another 
officer would entail unnecessary delay, the arresting officer, if the 
conduct of such examination is a part of the duties assigned to him or 
her, may examine the alien.
    (b) Determination of proceedings. If the examining officer is 
satisfied that

[[Page 587]]

there is prima facie evidence that the arrested alien was entering, 
attempting to enter, or is present in the United States in violation of 
the immigration laws, the examining officer will refer the case to an 
immigration judge for further inquiry in accordance with 8 CFR parts 
235, 239, or 240, order the alien removed as provided for in section 
235(b)(1) of the Act and Sec. 235.3(b) of this chapter, or take whatever 
other action may be appropriate or required under the laws or 
regulations applicable to the particular case.
    (c) Notifications and information. Except in the case of an alien 
subject to the expedited removal provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A) of 
the Act, an alien arrested without warrant and placed in formal 
proceedings under section 238 or 240 of the Act will be advised of the 
reasons for his or her arrest and the right to be represented at no 
expense to the Government. The examining officer will provide the alien 
with a list of the available free legal services provided by 
organizations and attorneys qualified under 8 CFR part 3 and 
organizations recognized under Sec. 292.2 of this chapter that are 
located in the district where the hearing will be held. The examining 
officer shall note on Form I-862 that such a list was provided to the 
alien. The officer will also advise the alien that any statement made 
may be used against him or her in a subsequent proceeding.
    (d) Custody procedures. Unless voluntary departure has been granted 
pursuant to subpart C of 8 CFR part 240, a determination will be made 
within 24 hours of the arrest whether the alien will be continued in 
custody or released on bond or recognizance and whether a notice to 
appear and warrant of arrest as prescribed in 8 CFR parts 236 and 239 
will be issued.

    (a) Detainers in general. Detainers are issued pursuant to sections 
236 and 287 of the Act and this chapter. Any authorized Service official 
may at any time issue a Form I-247, Immigration Detainer-Notice of 
Action, to any other Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. A 
detainer serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the 
Service seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that 
agency, for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien. The 
detainer is a request that such agency advise the Service, prior to 
release of the alien, in order for the Service to arrange to assume 
custody, in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either 
impracticable or impossible.
    (b) Authority to issue detainers. The following officers are 
authorized to issue detainers:
    (1) Border patrol agents, including aircraft pilots;
    (2) Special agents;
    (3) Deportation officers;
    (4) Immigration inspectors;
    (5) Adjudications officers;
    (6) Supervisory and managerial personnel who are responsible for 
supervising the activities of those officers listed in this paragraph;

    (7) Immigration officers who need the authority to issue detainers 
under section 287(d)(3) of the Act in order to effectively accomplish 
their individual missions and who are designated individually or as a 
class, by the Commissioner.
    (c) Availability of records. In order for the Service to accurately 
determine the propriety of issuing a detainer, serving a notice to 
appear, or taking custody of an alien in accordance with this section, 
the criminal justice agency requesting such action or informing the 
Service of a conviction or act that renders an alien inadmissible or 
removable under any provision of law shall

[[Page 594]]

provide the Service with all documentary records and information 
available from the agency that reasonably relates to the alien's status 
in the United States, or that may have an impact on conditions of 
release.
    (d) Temporary detention at Service request. Upon a determination by 
the Service to issue a detainer for an alien not otherwise detained by a 
criminal justice agency, such agency shall maintain custody of the alien 
for a period not to exceed 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
holidays in order to permit assumption of custody by the Service.
    (e) Financial responsibility for detention. No detainer issued as a 
result of a determination made under this chapter shall incur any fiscal 
obligation on the part of the Service, until actual assumption of 
custody by the Service, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section.

reasonable grounds to believe that such force is necessary.
    (iii) A designated immigration officer shall always use the minimum 
non-deadly force necessary to accomplish the officer's mission and shall 
escalate to a higher level of non-deadly force only when such higher 
level of force is warranted by the actions, apparent intentions, and 
apparent capabilities of the suspect, prisoner, or assailant.
    (iv) The following immigration officers who have successfully

the designated immigration officer or other persons from the present 
danger of death or serious bodily harm.
    (iii) The following immigration officers who have successfully

individual missions and who are designated, individually or as a class, 
by the Commissioner with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General.
    (b) Interrogation and detention not amounting to arrest. (1) 
Integration is questioning designed to elicit specific information. An 
immigration officer, like any other person, has the right to ask 
questions of anyone as long as the immigration officer does not restrain 
the freedom of an individual, not under arrest, to walk away.
    (2) If the immigration officer has a reasonable suspicion, based on 
specific articulable facts, that the person being questioned is, or is 
attempting to be, engaged in an offense against the United States or is 
an alien illegally in the United States, the immigration officer may 
briefly detain the person for questioning.
    (3) Information obtained from this questioning may provide the basis 
for a subsequent arrest, which must be effected only by a designated 
immigration officer, as listed in Sec. 287.5(c). The conduct of arrests 
is specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Conduct of arrests--(1) Authority. Only designated immigration 
officers are authorized to make an arrest. The list of designated 
immigration officers varies depending on the type of arrest as listed in 
Sec. 287.5(c)(1) through (c)(5).
    (2) General procedures. (i) An arrest shall be made only when the 
designated immigration officer has reason to believe that the person to 
be arrested has committed an offense against the United States or is an 
alien illegally in the United States.
    (ii) A warrant of arrest shall be obtained whenever possible prior 
to the arrest.
    (iii) At the time of the arrest, the designated immigration officer 
shall, as soon as it is practical and safe to do so:
    (A) Identify himself or herself as an immigration officer who is 
authorized to execute an arrest; and
    (B) State that the person is under arrest and the reason for the 
arrest.
    (iv) With respect to an alien arrested and administratively charged 
with being in the United States in violation of law, the arresting 
officer shall adhere to the procedures set forth in Sec. 287.3 if the 
arrest is made without a warrant, and to the procedures set forth in 
Sec. 242.2(c)(2) of this chapter if the arrest is made with a warrant.
    (v) With respect to a person arrested and charged with a criminal 
violation of the laws of the United States, the arresting officer shall 
advise the person of the appropriated rights as required by law at the 
time of the arrest, or as soon thereafter as practicable. It is the duty 
of the immigration officer to assure that the warnings are given in a 
language the subject understands, and that the subject acknowledges that 
the warnings are understood. The fact that a person has been advised of 
his or her rights shall be documented on appropriate Service forms and 
made a part of the arrest record.
    (vi) Every person arrested and charged with a criminal violation of 
the laws of the United States shall be brought without unnecessary delay 
before a United States magistrate judge, a United States district judge 
or, if necessary, a judicial officer empowered in accordance with 18 
U.S.C. 3041 to commit persons charged with such crimes. Accordingly, the 
immigration officer shall contact an Assistant United States Attorney to 
arrange for an initial appearance.
    (vii) The use of threats, coercion, or physical abuse by the 
designated immigration officer to induce a suspect to waive his or her 
rights or to make a statement is prohibited.
    (d) Transportation--(1) Vehicle transportation. All persons will be 
transported in a manner that ensures the safety of the persons being 
transported. When persons arrested or detained are being transported by 
vehicle, each person will be searched as thoroughly as circumstances 
permit before being placed in the vehicle. The person being transported 
shall not be handcuffed to the frame or any part of the moving vehicle 
or an object in the moving vehicle. The person being transported shall 
not be left unattended during transport unless the immigration officer 
needs to perform a law enforcement function.

[[Page 596]]

    (2) Airline transportation. The escorting officer(s) must abide by 
all Federal Aviation Administration and airline carrier rules and 
regulations pertaining to weapons and the transportation of prisoners.
    (e) Vehicular pursuit. (1) A vehicular pursuit is an active attempt 
by a designated immigration officer, as listed in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, in a designated pursuit vehicle to apprehend fleeing 
suspects who are attempting to avoid apprehension. A designated pursuit 
vehicle is defined as a vehicle equipped with emergency lights and 
siren, placed in or on the vehicle, that emit audible and visual signals 
in order to warn others that emergency law enforcement activities are in 
progress.
    (2) The following immigration officers who have successfully 
completed basic immigration law enforcement training are hereby 
authorized and designated to initiate a vehicular pursuit:
    (i) Border patrol agents, including aircraft pilots;
    (ii) Supervisory personnel who are responsible for supervising the 
activities of those officers listed above; and
    (iii) Immigration officers who need the authority to initiate a 
vehicular pursuit in order to effectively accomplish their individual 
mission and who are designated, individually or as a class, by the 
Commissioner.
    (f) Site inspections. (1) Site inspections are Service enforcement 
activities undertaken to locate and identify aliens illegally in the 
United States, or aliens engaged in unauthorized employment, at 
locations where there is a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable 
facts, that such aliens are present.
    (2) An immigration officer may not enter into the non-public areas 
of a business, a residence including the curtilage of such residence, or 
a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation, except as provided in 
section 287(a)(3) of the Act, for the purpose of questioning the 
occupants or employees concerning their right to be or remain in the 
United States unless the officer has either a warrant or the consent of 
the owner or other person in control of the site to be inspected. When 
consent to enter is given, the immigration officer must note on the 
officer's report that consent was given and, if possible, by whom 
consent was given. If the immigration officer is denied access to 
conduct a site inspection, a warrant may be obtained.
    (3) Adequate records must be maintained noting the results of every 
site inspection, including those where no illegal aliens are located.
    (4) Nothing in this section prohibits an immigration officer from 
entering into any area of a business or other activity to which the 
general public has access or onto open fields that are not farms or 
other outdoor agricultural operations without a warrant, consent, or any 
particularized suspicion in order to question any person whom the 
officer believes to be an alien concerning his or her right to be or 
remain in the United States.

Sec. 287.11  Pre-enrolled Access Lane.

    (a) Pre-enrolled Access Lane (PAL). A PAL is a designated traffic 
lane located at a Service checkpoint, which, when in operation, may be 
used exclusively by enrolled participants and their passengers in 
vehicles authorized by the Service to pass through the checkpoint.
    (b) General requirements for Pre-enrolled Access Lane Program. (1) 
Participation in the Pre-enrolled Access Lane program is wholly 
voluntary and failure to apply or denial of an application does not 
prevent any person from passing through the checkpoint in the regular 
traffic lanes.
    (2) Only United States citizens and members of the classes of aliens 
which the Commissioner of the Service or her delegates determine to be 
eligible may enroll in the PAL program. To participate in the PAL 
program, an applicant must have a permanent or temporary residence in 
the United States, and must agree to furnish all information requested 
on the application.
    (3) The applicant must agree to all terms and conditions required 
for use of a Pre-enrolled Access Lane. Immigration, criminal justice 
information, and law enforcement records and databases will be checked 
to assist in determining the applicant's eligibility. The Service may 
require applicants to submit fingerprints, and the Service may provide 
those fingerprints to Federal, State, and local government agencies for 
the purpose of determining eligibility to participate in the PAL 
program.
    (4) Any vehicle used in a Pre-enrolled Access Lane must have current 
approval from the Service for use in the PAL program.

[[Page 598]]

    (5) Enrolled participants may be issued an identification document 
showing authorization to participate in the PAL program, and, if such a 
document is issued, participants must have it in their possession 
whenever using the PAL. In addition, alien participants must be in 
possession of a valid form constituting evidence of alien registration 
pursuant to Sec. 264.1(b) of this chapter at all times while using the 
PAL.
    (6) The Service will install any and all equipment, decals, devices, 
technology, or methodology it deems necessary on registered vehicles to 
ensure that only authorized persons and vehicles use the PAL.
    (7) All devices, decals, or other equipment, methodology, or 
technology used to identify persons or vehicles using a Pre-enrolled 
Access Lane remain the property of the United States Government at all 
times and must be surrendered upon request of the Service. Enrolled 
participants must abide by the terms set forth by the Service for use of 
any device, decal, or other equipment, methodology, or technology. If a 
vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of, it is the responsibility of 
the enrolled participant to remove or obliterate any identifying decal 
or other authorization for participation in the PAL program before or at 
the time of sale or disposal unless otherwise notified by the Service. 
If the Service installs an electronic transmitter or similar device on 
the vehicle, the enrolled participant must have that device removed by 
the Service at the PAL enrollment center prior to sale or disposal of an 
authorized vehicle.
    (8) Enrolled participants in the PAL program may carry passengers 
who are not enrolled in the program in their authorized vehicles in the 
PAL as long as all passengers are United States citizens, lawful 
permanent residents of the United States, or rightful holders of valid 
nonimmigrant United States visas.
    (c) Application. (1) Application for Pre-enrolled Access Lane 
participation shall be made on Form I-866, Application--Checkpoint Pre-
enrolled Access Lane.
    (2) Each person wishing to enroll in the Pre-enrolled Access Lane 
program must submit a separate application.
    (3) Applications must be supported by documents establishing 
identity, United States citizenship or lawful immigration status in the 
United States, a valid driver's license, and vehicle registration for 
all vehicles being registered. The Service may require additional 
documentation where appropriate to substantiate information provided on 
the application, as well as written permission from the vehicle owner to 
use any vehicle not owned by the applicant in the PAL.
    (4) Each person filing an application may be required to present 
himself or herself for an interview at a time and place designated by 
the Service prior to approval of the application.
    (5) The Service may inspect any vehicle that a PAL applicant desires 
to register for use in the PAL to ensure that it does not present 
evidence of having been used or prepared to be used to smuggle aliens or 
controlled substances, and the Service must approve all vehicles prior 
to use in the PAL. The Service may prohibit the use of certain types of 
vehicles in the PAL for reasons of safety and law enforcement.
    (6) An application may be denied by the Chief Patrol Agent having 
jurisdiction over the PAL enrollment center where the application is 
filed. Written notice of the decision on the application shall be given 
to the applicant or mailed by ordinary mail to the applicant's last 
known address. There is no appeal from a denial, but denial is without 
prejudice to reapplying for this program. Re-applications following 
denial or revocation of the privilege to participate in the PAL program 
will not be considered by the Service until 90 days after the date of 
denial or revocation.
    (7) Registration in the PAL program is limited to individuals who 
the Service has determined present a low risk of using the PAL for 
unlawful purposes. Criteria that will be considered in the decision to 
approve or deny the application include the following: lawful presence 
in the United States, criminal history and/or evidence of criminality, 
employment, residency, prior immigration history, possession

[[Page 599]]

of a valid driver's license, vehicle type, registration, and inspection.
    (8) Applications approved by the Service will entitle the authorized 
person and the authorized vehicle to use the PAL for 2 years from the 
date of approval of the application or until authorization is revoked, 
whichever occurs first.
    (d) Acknowledgments and agreements. By signing and submitting the 
Form I-866 each applicant acknowledges and agrees to all of the 
conditions for participation in the PAL program and the statements on 
the Form I-866.
    (e) Violation of conditions of a Pre-enrolled Access Lane and 
Revocation. An enrolled participant who violates any condition of the 
PAL program, or any applicable law or regulation, or who is otherwise 
determined by an immigration officer to be ineligible to participate in 
the PAL program, may have his or her authorization and the authorization 
of his or her vehicle(s) revoked by the Chief Patrol Agent with 
jurisdiction over the PAL enrollment center where the application is 
filed and may be subject to other applicable sanctions, such as criminal 
and/or civil penalties, removal, and/or possible seizure of goods and/or 
vehicles. If an authorized vehicle is sold, stolen, or otherwise 
disposed of, authorization to use that vehicle in the PAL is 
automatically revoked. Within 24 hours of when an authorized vehicle is 
stolen, or within 7 days of when such vehicle is sold, or otherwise 
disposed of or the license plates are changed, enrolled participants 
must give, in person or by facsimile transmission, written notice of 
such occurrence to the PAL enrollment center at which their application 
was filed. Failure to do so will result in the automatic revocation of 
the authorization to use the PAL of the person who registered such 
vehicle in the PAL program. Unless revocation is automatic, the Service 
will give notice of revocation to the enrolled PAL participant or mail 
it by ordinary mail to his or her last known address. However, written 
notification is not necessary prior to revocation of the privilege to 
participate in the PAL program. There is no appeal from the revocation 
of an authorization to participate in the PAL program.
    (f) No benefits or rights conferred. This section does not, is not 
intended to, shall not be construed to, and may not be relied upon to 
confer any immigration benefit or status to any alien or create any 
rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable in law or equity by any 
party in any matter.

Sec. 292.2  Organizations qualified for recognition; requests for recognition; withdrawal of recognition; accreditation of representatives; roster.

    (a) Qualifications of organizations. A non-profit religious, 
charitable, social service, or similar organization established in the 
United States and recognized as such by the Board may designate a 
representative or representatives to practice before the Service alone 
or the Service and the Board (including practice before the Immigration 
Court). Such organization must establish to the satisfaction of the 
Board that:
    (1) It makes only nominal charges and assesses no excessive 
membership dues for persons given assistance; and
    (2) It has at its disposal adequate knowledge, information and 
experience.
    (b) Requests for recognition. An organization having the 
qualifications prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section may file an 
application for recognition on a Form G-27 directly with the Board, 
along with proof of service of a copy of the application on the district 
director having jurisdiction over the area in which the organization is 
located. The district director, within 30 days from the date of service, 
shall forward to the Board a recommendation for approval or disapproval 
of the application and the reasons therefor, or request a specified 
period of time in which to conduct an investigation or otherwise obtain 
relevant information regarding the applicant. The district director 
shall include proof of service of a copy of such recommendation or 
request on the organization. The organization shall have 30 days in 
which to file a response with the Board to a recommendation by a 
district director that is other than favorable, along with proof of 
service of a copy of such

[[Page 602]]

response on the district director. If the Board approves a request for 
time to conduct an investigation, or in its discretion remands the 
application to the district director for further information, the 
organization shall be advised of the time granted for such purpose. The 
Service shall promptly forward the results of any investigation or 
inquiry to the Board, along with its recommendations for approval or 
disapproval and the reasons therefor, and proof of service of a copy of 
the submission on the organization. The organization shall have 30 days 
from the date of such service to file a response with the Board to any 
matters raised therein, with proof of service of a copy of the response 
on the district director. Requests for extensions of filing times must 
be submitted in writing with the reasons therefor and may be granted by 
the Board in its discretion. Oral argument may be heard before the Board 
in its discretion at such date and time as the Board may direct. The 
organization and Service shall be informed by the Board of the action 
taken regarding an application. Any recognized organization shall 
promptly notify the Board of any changes in its name, address, or public 
telephone number.
    (c) Withdrawal of recognition. The Board may withdraw the 
recognition of any organization which has failed to maintain the 
qualifications required by Sec. 292.2(a). Withdrawal of recognition may 
be accomplished in accordance with the following procedure:
    (1) The Service, by the district director within whose jurisdiction 
the organization is located, may conduct an investigation into any 
organization it believes no longer meets the standards for recognition.
    (2) If the investigation establishes to the satisfaction of the 
district director that withdrawal proceedings should be instituted, he 
shall cause a written statement of the grounds upon which withdrawal is 
sought to be served upon the organization, with notice to show cause why 
its recognition should not be withdrawn. The notice will call upon the 
organization to appear before a special inquiry officer for a hearing at 
a time and place stated, not less than 30 days after service of the 
notice.
    (3) The special inquiry officer shall hold a hearing, receive 
evidence, make findings of fact, state his recommendations, and forward 
the complete record to the Board.
    (4) The organization and the Service shall have the opportunity of 
appearing at oral argument before the Board at a time specified by the 
Board.
    (5) The Board shall consider the entire record and render its 
decision. The order of the Board shall constitute the final disposition 
of the proceedings.
    (d) Accreditation of representatives. An organization recognized by 
the Board under paragraph (b) of this section may apply for 
accreditation of persons of good moral character as its representatives. 
An organization may apply to have a representative accredited to 
practice before the Service alone or the Service and the Board 
(including practice before immigration judges). An application for 
accreditation shall fully set forth the nature and extent of the 
proposed representative's experience and knowledge of immigration and 
naturalization law and procedure and the category of accreditation 
sought. No individual may submit an application on his or her own 
behalf. An application shall be filed directly with the Board, along 
with proof of service of a copy of the application on the district 
director having jurisdiction over the area in which the requesting 
organization is located. The district director, within 30 days from the 
date of service, shall forward to the Board a recommendation for 
approval or disapproval of the application and the reasons therefor, or 
request a specified period of time in which to conduct an investigation 
or otherwise obtain relevant information regarding the applicant. The 
district director shall include proof of service of a copy of such 
recommendation or request on the organization. The organization shall 
have 30 days in which to file a response with the Board to a 
recommendation by a distrct director that is other than favorable, with 
proof of service of a copy of such response on the district director. If 
the Board approves a request for time to conduct an investigation, or in 
its discretion remands the application to the district director for 
further information, the organization shall be

[[Page 603]]

advised of the time granted for such purpose. The district director 
shall promptly forward the results of any investigation or inquiry to 
the Board, along with a recommendation for approval or disapproval and 
the reasons therefor, and proof of service of a copy of the submission 
on the organization. The organization shall have 30 days from the date 
of service to file a response with the Board to any matters raised 
therein, with proof or service of a copy of the response on the district 
director. Requests for extensions of filing times must be submitted in 
writing with the reasons therefor and may be granted by the Board in its 
discretion. Oral argument may be heard before the Board in its 
discretion at such date and time as the Board may direct. The Board may 
approve or disapprove an application in whole or in part and shall 
inform the organization and the district director of the action taken 
with regard to an application. The accreditation of a representative 
shall be valid for a period of three years only; however, the 
accreditation shall remain valid pending Board consideration of an 
application for renewal of accreditation if the application is filed at 
least 60 days before the third anniversary of the date of the Board's 
prior accreditation of the representative. Accreditation terminates when 
the Board's recognition of the organization ceases for any reason or 
when the representative's employment or other connection with the 
organization ceases. The organization shall promptly notify the Board of 
such changes.
    (e) Roster. The Board shall maintain an alphabetical roster of 
recognized organizations and their accredited representatives. A copy of 
the roster shall be furnished to the Commissioner and he shall be 
advised from time to time of changes therein.

    (a) Grounds. The Immigration Judge, Board, or Attorney General may 
suspend or bar from further practice before the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review or the Service, or may take other appropriate 
disciplinary action against, an attorney or representative if it is 
found that it is in the public interest to do so. Appropriate 
disciplinary sanctions may include disbarment, suspension, reprimand or 
censure, or such other sanction as deemed appropriate. The suspension, 
disbarment, or imposition of other appropriate disciplinary action 
against an attorney or representative who is within one or more of the 
following categories shall be deemed to be in the public interest, for 
the purposes of this part, but the enumeration of the following 
categories does not constitute the exclusive grounds for discipline in 
the public interest:
    (1) Who charges or receives, either directly or indirectly, any fee 
or compensation for services which may be deemed to be grossly excessive 
in relation to the services performed, or who, being an accredited 
representative of an organization recognized under Sec. 1.1(j) of this 
chapter, charges or receives either directly or indirectly any fee or 
compensation for services rendered to any person, except that an 
accredited representative of such an organization may be regularly 
compensated by the organization of which he is an accredited 
representative;
    (2) Who, with intent to defraud or deceive, bribes, attempts to 
bribe, coerces, or attempts to coerce, by any means whatsoever, any 
person, including a party to a case, or an officer or employee of the 
Service or Board, to commit an act or to refrain from performing an act 
in connection with any case;
    (3) Who willfully misleads, misinforms, or deceives an officer or 
employee of the Department of Justice concerning any material and 
relevant fact in connection with a case;
    (4) Who willfully deceives, misleads, or threatens any party to a 
case concerning any matter relating to the case;
    (5) Who solicits practice in any unethical or unprofessional manner, 
including but not limited to, the use of runners.
    (6) Who represents, as an associate, any person who, known to him, 
solicits practice in any unethical or unprofessional manner, including, 
but not

[[Page 604]]

limited to, the use of runners, or advertising his availability to 
handle immigration, naturalization, or nationality matters;
    (7) Who has been temporarily suspended, and such suspension is still 
in effect, or permanently disbarred, from practice in any court, 
Federal, State (including the District of Columbia), territorial, or 
insular;
    (8) Who is temporarily suspended, and such suspension is still in 
effect, or permanently disbarred, from practice in a representative 
capacity before any executive department, board, commission, or other 
governmental unit, Federal, State (including the District of Columbia), 
territorial, or insular;
    (9) Who, by use of his name, personal appearance, or any device, 
aids and abets any person to practice during the period of his 
suspension or disbarment, such suspension or disbarment being known to 
him;
    (10) Who willfully made false and material statements or 
representations with respect to his qualifications or authority to 
represent others in any case;
    (11) Who engages in contumelious or otherwise obnoxious conduct with 
respect to a case in which he acts in a representative capacity, which 
in the opinion of the Board, would constitute cause for suspension or 
disbarment if the case was pending before a court, or which, in such a 
judicial proceeding, would constitute a contempt of court;
    (12) Who, having been furnished with a copy of any portion of the 
record in a case, willfully fails to surrender such copy upon final 
disposition of the case or upon demand, or willfully and without 
authorization makes and retains a copy of the material furnished;
    (13) Who has been convicted of a felony, or, having been convicted 
of any crime is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of more than one 
year; or
    (14) Who has falsely certified a copy of a document as being a true 
and complete copy of an original.
    (15) Who has engaged in frivolous behavior in a proceeding before an 
Immigration Judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or any other 
administrative appellate body under title II of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act.
    (i) An attorney or representative engages in frivolous behavior when 
he or she knows or reasonably should have known that his or her actions 
lack an arguable basis in law or in fact, or are taken for an improper 
purpose, such as to cause unnecessary delay. Actions that, if taken 
improperly, may be subject to discipline include, but are not limited 
to, the making of an argument on any factual or legal question, the 
submission of an application for discretionary relief, the filing of a 
motion, or the filing of an appeal. The signature of an attorney or an 
accredited representative on any filing, application, motion, appeal, 
brief, or other paper constitutes certification by the signer that the 
signer has read the filing, application, motion, appeal, brief, or other 
paper, and that, to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and 
belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the document is well grounded 
in fact, is warranted by existing law or by a good faith argument for 
the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and is not 
interposed for any improper purpose;
    (ii) The imposition of disciplinary action for frivolous behavior 
under this section in no way limits the Board's authority summarily to 
dismissal an appeal pursuant to 8 CFR 3.1(d)(1-a).
    (b) Procedure--(1) Non-Service attorneys and accredited 
representatives--(i) Investigation of charges. Complaints regarding the 
conduct of attorneys and representatives practicing before the Service 
or the Executive Office for Immigration Review pursuant to 8 CFR 292.1 
shall be investigated by the Service.
    (ii) Service and filing of charges. If an investigation establishes, 
to the satisfaction of the Service, that disciplinary proceedings should 
be instituted, the General Counsel of the Service shall cause a copy of 
written charges to be served upon the attorney/representative either by 
personal service or by registered mail. The General Counsel shall also 
file the written charges with the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge 
immediately after service of the charges upon the attorney/
representative.
    (iii) Service and filing of answer. The attorney/representative 
shall answer the charges, in writing, within thirty (30) days after the 
date of service, and

[[Page 605]]

shall file the answer with the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge. 
Failure of the attorney/representative to answer the written charges in 
a timely manner shall constitute an admission that the facts and legal 
statements in the written charges are correct. The attorney/
representative shall also serve a copy of the answer on the General 
Counsel. Proof of service on the opposing party must be included with 
all documents filed.
    (iv) Hearing. The Chief Immigration Judge shall designate an 
Immigration Judge to hold a hearing and render a decision in the matter. 
The designated Immigration Judge shall notify the attorney/
representative and the Service as to the time and the place of the 
hearing. At the hearing, the attorney/representative may be represented 
by an attorney at no expense to the Government and the Service shall be 
represented by an attorney. At the hearing, the attorney/representative 
shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine and object to the 
evidence presented by the Service, to present evidence on his or her own 
behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Service. The 
Service shall bear the burden of proving the grounds for disciplinary 
action by clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence. The record of the 
hearing shall conform to the requirements of 8 CFR 242.15.
    (v) Decision. The Immigration Judge shall consider the record and 
render a decision in the case, including that the evidence presented 
does not sufficiently prove grounds for disciplinary action or that 
disciplinary action is justified. If the Immigration Judge finds that 
the evidence presented does sufficiently prove grounds for disciplinary 
action, the appropriate sanction shall be ordered. If the Immigration 
Judge orders a suspension, the Immigration Judge shall set an amount of 
time for the suspension.
    (vi) Appeal. Either party may appeal the decision of the Immigration 
Judge to the Board. The appeal must be filed within ten (10) days from 
the date of the decision, if oral, or thirteen (13) days from the date 
of mailing of the decision, if written. The appeal must be filed with 
the Immigration Court holding the hearing. If an appeal is not filed in 
a timely manner, or if the appeal is waived, the decision of the 
Immigration Judge is final. If a case is appealed in a timely manner, 
the Board shall consider the record and render a decision. Receipt of 
briefs and the hearing of oral argument shall be at the discretion of 
the Board. The Board's decision shall be final except when a case is 
certified to the Attorney General pursuant to 8 CFR 3.1(h).
    (2) Service attorneys. Complaints regarding the frivolous behavior 
of Service attorneys within the scope of Sec. 292.3(a)(15) shall be 
directed to, and investigated by, the Office of Professional 
Responsibility of the Department of Justice. If disciplinary action is 
warranted, it shall be administered pursuant to the attorney 
disciplinary procedures of the Department of Justice.

<R05>
Sec. 292.4  Appearances.

    (a) An appearance shall be filed on the appropriate form by the 
attorney or representative appearing in each case. During Immigration 
Judge or Board proceedings, withdrawal and/or substitution of counsel is 
permitted only in accordance with Secs. 3.16 and 3.36 respectively. 
During proceedings before the Service, substitution may be permitted 
upon the written withdrawal of the attorney or representative of record, 
or upon notification of the new attorney or representative. When an 
appearance is made by a person acting in a representative capacity, his 
or her personal appearance or signature shall constitute a 
representation that under the provisions of this chapter he or she is 
authorized and qualified to represent. Further proof of authority to act 
in a representative capacity may be required. A notice of appearance 
entered in application or petition proceedings must be signed by the 
applicant or petitioner to authorize representation in order for the 
appearance to be recognized by the Service.
    (b) Availability of records. During the time a case is pending, and 
except as otherwise provided in Sec. 103.2(b) of this

[[Page 606]]

chapter, a party to a proceeding or his attorney or representative shall 
be permitted to examine the record of proceeding in a Service office. He 
may, in conformity with Sec. 103.10 of this chapter, obtain copies of 
Service records or information therefrom and copies of documents or 
transcripts of evidence furnished by him. Upon request, he may in 
addition, be loaned a copy of the testimony and exhibits contained in 
the record of proceeding upon giving his receipt for such copies and 
pledging that it will be surrendered upon final disposition of the case 
or upon demand. If extra copies of exhibits do not exist, they shall not 
be furnished free on loan; however, they shall be made available for 
copying or purchase of copies as provided in Sec. 103.10 of this 
chapter.

Sec. 292.5  Service upon and action by attorney or representative of record.

    (a) Representative capacity. Whenever a person is required by any of 
the provisions of this chapter to give or be given notice; to serve or 
be served with any paper other than a warrant of arrest or a subpoena; 
to make a motion; to file or submit an application or other document; or 
to perform or waive the performance of any act, such notice, service, 
motion, filing, submission, performance, or waiver shall be given by or 
to, served by or upon, made by, or requested of the attorney or 
representative of record, or the person himself if unrepresented.
    (b) Right to representation. Whenever an examination is provided for 
in this chapter, the person involved shall have the right to be 
represented by an attorney or representative who shall be permitted to 
examine or cross-examine such person and witnesses, to introduce 
evidence, to make objections which shall be stated succinctly and 
entered on the record, and to submit briefs. Provided, that nothing in 
this paragraph shall be construed to provide any applicant for admission 
in either primary or secondary inspection the right to representation, 
unless the applicant for admission has become the focus of a criminal 
investigation and has been taken into custody.

for which interest shall be computed, the day on which the cash was 
deposited, or the day which cash deposited in the postal savings system 
ceased to accrue interest, shall not be

Sec. 299.4  Reproduction of Public Use Forms by public and private entities.

    (a) Duplication requirements. All forms required for applying for a 
specific benefit in compliance with the immigration and naturalization 
regulations, including those which have been made available for purchase 
by the Superintendent of Documents as listed in Sec. 299.3, may be 
printed or otherwise reproduced. Such reproduction must be by an 
appropriate duplicating process

[[Page 612]]

and at the expense of the public or private entity. Forms printed or 
reproduced by public or private entities shall be:
    (1) In black ink or dye that will not fade or ``feather'' within 20 
years, and
    (2) Conform to the officially printed forms currently in use with 
respect to:
    (i) Size,
    (ii) Wording and language,
    (iii) Arrangement, style and size of type, and
    (iv) Paper specifications.
    (b) Requirements for electronic generation. Public or private 
entities may electronically generate forms required for applying for a 
specific benefit, in compliance with the immigration and naturalization 
regulations, at their own expense. This includes forms that have been 
made available for purchase by the Superintendent of Documents, as 
listed in Sec. 299.3 provided that each form satisfies the following 
requirements:
    (1) An electronic reproduction must be complete, containing all 
questions which appear on the official form. The wording and punctuation 
of all data elements and identifying information must match exactly. No 
data elements may be added or deleted. The sequence and format for each 
item on the form must be replicated to mirror the authorized agency 
form. Each item must be printed on the same page in the same location. 
Likewise, multiple-part sets may be printed as single sheets provided 
that the destination of the carbon copy is clearly identified on the 
bottom of the form. Private entities must reproduce forms on the same 
colored paper that is used on the official form. In the case of the Form 
I-20 A-B/I-20ID, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) 
Student Status--For Academic and Language Students, private entities may 
generate this form in single-page format rather than double-sided 
format, provided that the student's name, school, and date of birth is 
printed in a shaded box on the top of page 4 of the form, using the same 
type size and font style as the body of the form.
    (2) The final form must match the design, format, and dimensions of 
the official form. All blocks must remain the same size and lines must 
remain the same length. No variations will be permissible.
    (3) The final form must be approved for use by the Director, Policy 
Directives and Instructions Branch. The form should be mailed to the 
address listed in paragraph (e) of this section for approval.
    (c) The accuracy of electronically generated forms is the 
responsibility of the private entities. Changes to existing forms, as 
announced by the Service, must be promptly incorporated into the private 
entity software program application. Deviations from the aforementioned 
standards may result in the return or denial of the applicant's 
application/petition for a particular benefit.
    (d) Electronic printers that provide for near-letter-quality 
documents should be used to generate electronic forms. Dot matrix 
printers that are only capable of producing draft quality documents 
should not be used for form generation, but may be used for the entry of 
data in a preprinted form where appropriate.
    (e) Any form with poor print quality or other defect which renders 
it illegible, difficult to read, or displays added or missing data 
elements, will be rejected by the Service. Any problems regarding the 
acceptability of a specific electronic version of a particular Service 
form may be brought to the attention of the Director, Policy Directives 
and Instructions Branch, 425 ``I'' Street, NW., Room 5307, Washington, 
DC 20536, telephone number (202) 514-3048.

    The Service shall accept an application for naturalization from an 
applicant who is subject to a continuous residence requirement under 
section 316(a) or 319(a) of the Act as much as three months before the 
date upon which the applicant would otherwise satisfy such continuous 
residence requirement in the State or Service district where residence 
is to be established for naturalization purposes. At the time of 
examination on the application, the applicant will be required to prove 
that he or she satisfies the residence requirements for the residence 
reflected in the application.


<R05>
Sec. 310.3  Administration of the oath of allegiance.

    (a) An applicant for naturalization may elect, at the time of filing 
of, or at the examination on, the application, to have the oath of 
allegiance and renunciation under section 337(a) of the Act administered 
in a public ceremony conducted by the Service or by any court described 
in section 310(b) of the Act, subject to section 310(b)(1)(B) of the 
Act.
    (b) The jurisdiction of all such courts specified to administer the 
oath of allegiance shall extend only to those persons who are resident 
within the respective jurisdictional limits of such courts, except as 
otherwise provided in section 316(f)(2) of the Act. Persons who 
temporarily reside within the jurisdictional limits of a court in order 
to pursue an application properly filed pursuant to section 319(b), 
322(c), 328(a), or 329 of the Act or section 405 of the Immigration Act 
of 1990 are not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction provisions of 
section 310(b)(1)(B) of the Act.
    (c)(1) A court that wishes to exercise exclusive jurisdiction to 
administer the oath of allegiance for the 45-day period specified in 
section 310(b)(1)(B) of the Act shall notify, in writing, the district 
director of the Service office having jurisdiction over the place in

[[Page 617]]

which the court is located, of the court's intent to exercise such 
exclusive jurisdiction.
    (2) At least 60 days prior to the holding of any oath administration 
ceremony referred to in Sec. 337.8 of this chapter, the clerk of court 
shall give written notice to the appropriate district director of the 
time, date, and place of such ceremony and of the number of persons who 
may be accommodated.
    (d) A court that has notified the Service pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section shall have exclusive authority to administer the 
oath of allegiance to persons residing within its jurisdiction for a 
period of 45 days beginning on the date that the Service notifies the 
clerk of court of the applicant's eligibility for naturalization. Such 
exclusive authority shall be effective only if on the date the Service 
notifies the clerk of court of the applicant's eligibility, the court 
has notified the Service of the day or days during such 45-day period on 
which the court has scheduled oath administration ceremonies available 
to the applicant. The Service must submit the notification of the 
applicant's eligibility to the clerk of court within 10 days of the 
approval of the application pursuant to Sec. 337.8 of this chapter.
    (e) Waiver of exclusive authority. A court exercising exclusive 
authority to administer the oath of allegiance pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section may waive such exclusive authority when it is determined 
by the court that the Service failed to notify the court within a 
reasonable time prior to a scheduled oath ceremony of the applicant's 
eligibility such that it is impractical for the applicant to appear at 
that ceremony. The court shall notify the district director in writing 
of the waiver of exclusive authority as it relates to a specific 
applicant, and the Service shall promptly notify the applicant. The 
Service shall then arrange for the administration of the oath of 
allegiance pursuant to Sec. 337.2 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 312.1  Literacy requirements.

    (a) General. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, no person shall be naturalized as a citizen of the United 
States upon his or her own application unless that person can 
demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including an 
ability to read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage in the English 
language.
    (b) Exceptions. The following persons need not demonstrate an 
ability to read, write and speak words in ordinary usage in the English 
language:
    (1) A person who, on the date of filing of his or her application 
for naturalization, is over 50 years of age and has been living in the 
United States for periods totalling at least 20 years subsequent to a 
lawful admission for permanent residence;
    (2) A person who, on the date of filing his or her application for 
naturalization, is over 55 years of age and has been living in the 
United States for periods totalling at least 15 years subsequent to a 
lawful admission for permanent residence; or
    (3) The requirements of paragraph(a) of this section shall not apply 
to any person who is unable, because of a medically determinable 
physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments which has 
lasted or is expected to last at least 12 months, to demonstrate an 
understanding of the English language as noted in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The loss of any cognitive abilities based on the direct effects 
of the illegal use of drugs will not be considered in determining 
whether a person is unable to demonstrate an understanding of the 
English language. For purposes of this paragraph, the term medically 
determinable means an impairment that results from anatomical, 
physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by 
medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques to 
have resulted in functioning so impaired as to render an individual 
unable to demonstrate an understanding of the English language as 
required by this section, or that renders the individual unable to 
fulfill the requirements for English proficiency, even with reasonable 
modifications to the methods of determining English proficiency, as 
outlined in paragraph(c) of this section.
    (c) Literacy examination--(1) Verbal skills. The ability of an 
applicant to speak English shall be determined by a designated examiner 
from the applicant's answers to questions normally asked in the course 
of the examination.
    (2) Reading and writing skills. Except as noted in Sec. 312.3, an 
applicant's ability to read and write English shall be tested using 
excerpts from one or more parts of the Service authorized Federal 
Textbooks on Citizenship written at the elementary literacy level, 
Service publications M-289 and M-291. These textbooks may be purchased 
from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, 
Washington, DC 20402, and are available at certain public educational 
institutions. An applicant's writing sample shall be retained in the 
applicant's Service file.

<R05>
Sec. 312.2  Knowledge of history and government of the United States.

    (a) General. No person shall be naturalized as a citizen of the 
United States upon his or her own application unless

[[Page 619]]

that person can demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the 
fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of 
government, of the United States. A person who is exempt from the 
literacy requirement under Sec. 312.1(b) (1) and (2) must still satisfy 
this requirement.
    (b) Exceptions. (1) The requirements of paragraph(a) of this section 
shall not apply to any person who is unable to demonstrate a knowledge 
and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the 
principles and form of government of the United States because of a 
medically determinable physical or mental impairment, that already has 
or is expected to last at least 12 months. The loss of any cognitive 
skills based on the direct effects of the illegal use of drugs will not 
be considered in determining whether an individual may be exempted. For 
the purposes of this paragraph the term medically determinable means an 
impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological 
abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and 
laboratory diagnosis techniques to have resulted in functioning so 
impaired as to render an individual to be unable to demonstrate the 
knowledge required by this section or that renders the individuals 
unable to participate in the testing procedures for naturalization, even 
with reasonable modifications.
    (2) Medical certification. All persons applying for naturalization 
and seeking an exception from the requirements of Sec. 312.1(a) and 
paragraph(a) of this section based on the disability exceptions must 
submit Form N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions, to 
be completed by a medical doctor licensed to practice medicine in the 
United States or a clinical psychologist licensed to practice psychology 
in the United States (including the United States territories of Guam, 
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands). Form N-648 must be submitted as an 
attachment to the applicant's Form N-400, Application for 
Naturalization. These medical professionals shall be experienced in 
diagnosing those with physical or mental medically determinable 
impairments and shall be able to attest to the origin, nature, and 
extent of the medical condition as it relates to the disability 
exceptions noted under Sec. 312.1(b)(3) and paragraph(b)(1) of this 
section. In addition, the medical professionals making the disability 
determination must sign a statement on the Form N-648 that they have 
answered all the questions in a complete and truthful manner, that they 
(and the applicant) agree to the release of all medical records relating 
to the applicant that may be requested by the Service and that they 
attest that any knowingly false or misleading statements may subject the 
medical professional to the penalties for perjury pursuant to title 18, 
United Stated Code, Section 1546 and to civil penalties under section 
274C of the Act. The Service also reserves the right to refer the 
applicant to another authorized medical source for a supplemental 
disability determination. This option shall be invoked when the Service 
has credible doubts about the veracity of a medical certification that 
has been presented by the applicant. An affidavit or attestation by the 
applicant, his or her relatives, or guardian on his or her medical 
condition is not a a sufficient medical attestation for purposes of 
satisfying this requirement.
    (c) History and government examination--(1) Procedure. The 
examination of an applicant's knowledge of the history and form of 
government of the United States shall be given orally by a designated 
examiner in the English language unless:
    (i) The applicant is exempt from the English literacy requirement 
under Sec. 312.1(b), in which case the examination may be conducted in 
the applicant's native language with the assistance of an interpreter 
selected in accordance with Sec. 312.4 of this part, but only if the 
applicant's command of spoken English is insufficient to conduct a valid 
examination in English;
    (ii) The applicant is required to satisfy and has satisfied the 
English literacy requirement under Sec. 312.1(a), but the officer 
conducting the examination determines that an inaccurate or incomplete 
record of the examination would result if the examination on technical 
or complex issues were conducted in English. In such a case the 
examination may be conducted in the

[[Page 620]]

applicant's native language, with the assistance of an interpreter 
selected in accordance with Sec. 312.4;
    (iii) The applicant has met the requirements of Sec. 312.3.
    (2) Scope and substance. The scope of the examination shall be 
limited to subject matters covered in the Service authorized Federal 
Textbooks on Citizenship except for the identity of current 
officeholders. In choosing the subject matters, in phrasing questions 
and in evaluating responses, due consideration shall be given to the 
applicant's education, background, age, length of residence in the 
United States, opportunities available and efforts made to acquire the 
requisite knowledge, and any other elements or factors relevant to an 
appraisal of the adequacy of the applicant's knowledge and 
understanding.

Sec. 312.3  Standardized citizenship testing.

    (a)(1) An applicant for naturalization may satisfy the reading and 
writing requirements of Sec. 312.1 and the knowledge requirements of 
Sec. 312.2 by passing, within one (1) year preceding the date on which 
he or she files an application for naturalization, or at any time 
subsequent to filing an application but prior to a final determination 
on the application, a standardized citizenship test given by an entity 
authorized by the Service to conduct such a test.
    (2) The applicant must still demonstrate his or her ability to speak 
and understand English in accordance with Sec. 312.1(c)(1). An applicant 
who passes a standardized citizenship test may submit evidence of 
passage of the test either with the submission of the application, at 
the examination on the application, or at the time of the second 
examination provided in Sec. 312.5(a). Any evidence of passage submitted 
by the applicant shall be subject to independent verification by the 
Service with the test provider.
    (3) An applicant who passes a standardized citizenship test as 
provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for naturalization shall 
not be reexamined at the Service naturalization interview on his or her 
ability to read and write English or on his or her knowledge of the 
history and form of government of the United States, unless the 
examining officer has reasonable cause to believe, subsequent to 
verification of the applicant's test results with the authorized testing 
entity, that the applicant's test results were obtained English may not 
be the sole reason for finding that the test results were obtained 
through fraud or misrepresentation. The Applicant's inability to speak 
English may not be the sole reason for finding that the test results 
were botained through fraud or misrepresentation. A written record of 
the officer's determination shall be made in the record of the 
application including the response from the testing entity concerning 
the applicant's test.
    (4) An applicant who has failed a standardized citizenship test will 
not be prejudiced by that failure during an examination conducted by the 
Service under Secs. 312.1 and 312.2, and may continue to pursue the 
application with the Service as if the applicant had never taken the 
standardized test.
    (b) An applicant who has obtained lawful permanent resident alien 
status pursuant to section 245A of the Act, and who, at that time 
demonstrated English language proficiency in reading and writing, and 
knowledge of the government and history of the United States through 
either an examination administered by the Service or a standardized 
section 312 test authorized by the Service for use with Legalization 
applicants as provided in section 245A(b)(1)(D)(iii) of the Act, will 
not be reexamined on those skills at the time of the naturalization 
interview. However, such applicant must still establish eligibility for 
naturalization through testimony in the English language.

<R05>
Sec. 312.4  Selection of interpreter.

    An interpreter to be used under Sec. 312.2 may be selected either by 
the applicant or by the Service. However, the Service reserves the right 
to disqualify an interpreter provided by the applicant in

[[Page 621]]

order to ensure the integrity of the examination. Where the Service 
disqualifies an interpreter, the Service must provide another 
interpreter for the applicant in a timely manner. If rescheduling of the 
interview is required, then a new date shall be set as soon as 
practicable so as not to delay unduly the adjudication of the 
application. The officer who disqualifies an interpreter shall make a 
written record of the reason(s) for disqualification as part of the 
record of the application.

[60 FR 6651, Feb. 3, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 312.5  Failure to meet educational and literacy requirements.

    (a) An applicant for naturalization who fails the English literacy 
or history and government test at the first examination will be afforded 
a second opportunity to pass the test(s) within 90 days after the first 
examination during the pendency of the application.
    (b) If an applicant who receives notice of the second scheduled 
examination date fails to appear without good cause for that second 
examination without prior notification to the Service, the applicant 
will be deemed to have failed this second examination. Before an 
applicant may request a postponement of the second examination to a date 
that is more than 90 days after the initial examination, the applicant 
must agree in writing to waive the requirement under section 336 of the 
Act that the Service must render a determination on the application 
within 120 days from the initial interview, and instead to permit the 
Service to render a decision within 120 days from the second interview.

    (b) Exemptions. Despite membership in or affiliation with an 
organization covered by Sec. 313.2, an applicant may be

[[Page 623]]

naturalized if the applicant establishes that such membership or 
affiliation is or was:
    (1) Involuntary:
    (2) Without awareness of the nature or the aims of the organization, 
and was discontinued if the applicant became aware of the nature or aims 
of the organization;
    (3) Terminated prior to the attainment of age sixteen by the 
applicant, or more than ten years prior to the filing of the application 
for naturalization;
    (4) By operation of law; or
    (5) Necessary for purposes of obtaining employment, food rations, or 
other essentials of living.
    (c) Awareness and participation--(1) Exemption applicable. The 
exemption under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be found to apply 
only to an applicant whose participation in the activities of an 
organization covered under Sec. 313.2 was minimal in nature, and who 
establishes that he or she was unaware of the nature of the organization 
while a member of the organization.
    (2) Exemptions inapplicable. The exemptions under paragraphs (b)(4) 
and (b)(5) of this section will not apply to any applicant who served as 
a functionary of an organization covered under Sec. 313.2, or who was 
aware of and believed in the organization's doctrines.
    (d) Essentials of living--(1) Exemption applicable. The exemption 
under paragraph (b)(5) of this section may be found to apply only to an 
applicant who can demonstrate:
    (i) That membership in the covered organization was necessary to 
obtain the essentials of living like food, shelter, clothing, 
employment, and an education, which were routinely available to the rest 
of the population--for purposes of this exemption, higher education will 
qualify as an essential of living only if the applicant can establish 
the existence of special circumstances which convert the need for higher 
education into a need as basic as the need for food or employment: and,
    (ii) That he or she participated only to the minimal extent 
necessary to receive the essential of living.
    (2) Exemption inapplicable. The exemption under paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section will not be applicable to an applicant who became a member 
of an organization covered under 313.2 to receive certain benefits:
    (i) Without compulsion from the governing body of the relevant 
country; or
    (ii) Which did not qualify as essentials of living.


<R05>
Sec. 313.4  Procedure.

    In all cases in which the applicant claims membership or affiliation 
in any of the organizations covered by Sec. 313.2, the applicant shall 
attach to the application a detailed written statement describing such 
membership or affiliation, including the periods of membership or 
affiliation, whether the applicant held any office in the organization, 
and whether membership or affiliation was voluntary or involuntary. If 
the applicant alleges that membership or affiliation was involuntary, or 
that one of the other exemptions in Sec. 313.3 applies, the applicant's 
statement shall set forth the basis of that allegation.

315.3  Evidence.
315.4  Exemption treaties.

    Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1103, 1443.

    Source: 56 FR 50483, Oct. 7, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 315.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Exemption from military service means either:
    (1) A permanent exemption from induction into the Armed Forces or 
the National Security Training Corps of the United States for military 
training or military service; or
    (2) The release or discharge from military training or military 
service in the Armed Forces or in the National Security Training Corps 
of the United States.

[[Page 624]]

    Induction means compulsory entrance into military service of the 
United States whether by conscription or, after being notified of a 
pending conscription, by enlistment.
    Treaty national means an alien who is a national of a country with 
which the United States has a treaty relating to the reciprocal 
exemption of aliens from military training or military service.


<R05>
Sec. 315.2  Ineligibility and exceptions.

    (a) Ineligibility. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, any alien who has requested, applied for, and obtained an 
exemption from military service on the ground that he or she is an alien 
shall be ineligible for approval of his or her application for 
naturalization as a citizen of the United States.
    (b) Exceptions. The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section 
does not apply to an alien who establishes by clear and convincing 
evidence that:
    (1) At the time that he or she requested an exemption from military 
service, the applicant had no liability for such service even in the 
absence of an exemption;
    (2) The applicant did not request or apply for the exemption from 
military service, but such exemption was automatically granted by the 
United States government;
    (3) The exemption from military service was based upon a ground 
other than the applicant's alienage;
    (4) In claiming an exemption from military service, the applicant 
did not knowingly and intentionally waive his or her eligibility for 
naturalization because he or she was misled by advice from a competent 
United States government authority, or from a competent authority of the 
government of his or her country of nationality, of the consequences of 
applying for an exemption from military service and was, therefore, 
unable to make an intelligent choice between exemption and citizenship;
    (5) The applicant applied for and received an exemption from 
military service on the basis of alienage, but was subsequently inducted 
into the Armed Forces, or the National Security Training Corps, of the 
United States; however, an applicant who voluntarily enlists in and 
serves in the Armed Forces of the United States, after applying for and 
receiving an exemption from military service on the basis of alienage, 
does not satisfy this exception to paragraph (a) of this section;
    (6) Prior to requesting the exemption from military service:
    (i) The applicant was a treaty national who had served in the armed 
forces of the country of which he or she was a national; however, a 
treaty national who did not serve in the armed forces of the country of 
nationality prior to requesting the exemption from military service does 
not satisfy this exception to paragraph (a) of this section;
    (ii) The applicant served a minimum of eighteen months in the armed 
forces of a nation that was a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization at the time of the applicant's service; or
    (iii) The applicant served a minimum of twelve months in the armed 
forces of a nation that was a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization at the time of the applicant's service, provided that the 
applicant applied for registration with the Selective Service 
Administration after September 28, 1971; or
    (7) The applicant is applying for naturalization pursuant to section 
329 of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 315.3  Evidence.

    (a) The records of the Selective Service System and the military 
department under which the alien served shall be conclusive evidence of 
whether the alien was relieved or discharged from liability for military 
service because he or she was an alien.
    (b) The regulations of the Selective Service Administration and its 
predecessors will be controlling with respect to the requirement to 
register for, and liability for, service in the Armed Forces of the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 315.4  Exemption treaties.

    (a) The following countries currently have effective treaties 
providing reciprocal exemption of aliens from military service:

Argentina (Art. X, 10 Stat. 1005, 1009, effective 1853)

Switzerland (Art. II, 11 Stat. 587, 589, effective 1850)

    (b) The following countries previously had treaties providing for 
reciprocal exemption of aliens from military service:

[56 FR 50484, Oct. 7, 1991, as amended at 58 FR 49912, Sept. 24, 1993; 
60 FR 6651, Feb. 3, 1995]


<R05>

    Except as provided in Sec. 316.5, the applicant shall file an 
application for naturalization with the Service office having

applicant may be required to submit evidence of residence for at least 
three months immediately preceding the filing of the application in the 
State or Service district in which the applicant files the application. 
For purposes of this section, the applicant's residence in a State where

jurisdictional requirement of residence in any one of those districts.


<R05>

    (a) The applicant shall apply for naturalization by filing:

<R05>
Sec. 316.5  Residence in the United States.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise specified, for purposes of this 
chapter, including Sec. 316.2 (a)(3), (a)(5), and (a)(6), an alien's 
residence is the same as that alien's domicile, or principal actual 
dwelling place, without regard to the alien's intent, and the duration 
of an alien's residence in a particular location is measured from the 
moment the alien first establishes residence in that location.
    (b) Residences in specific cases--(1) Military personnel. For 
applicants who are serving in the Armed Forces of the United States but 
who do not qualify for naturalization under part 328 of this chapter, 
the applicant's residence shall be:
    (i) The State or Service District where the applicant is physically 
present for at least three months, immediately preceding the filing of 
an application for naturalization, or immediately preceding the 
examination on the application if the application was filed early 
pursuant to section 334(a) of the Act and the three month period falls 
within the required period of residence under section 316(a) or 319(a) 
of the Act;
    (ii) The location of the residence of the applicant's spouse and/or 
minor child(ren); or

[[Page 627]]

    (iii) The applicant's home of record as declared to the Armed Forces 
at the time of enlistment and as currently reflected in the applicant's 
military personnel file.
    (2) Students. An applicant who is attending an educational 
institution in a State or Service District other than the applicant's 
home residence may apply for naturalization:
    (i) Where that institution is located; or
    (ii) In the State of the applicant's home residence if the applicant 
can establish that he or she is financially dependent upon his or her 
parents at the time that the application is filed and during the 
naturalization process.
    (3) Commuter aliens. An applicant who is a commuter alien, as 
described in Sec. 211.5 of this chapter, must establish a principal 
dwelling place in the United States with the intention of permanently 
residing there, and must thereafter acquire the requisite period of 
residence before eligibility for naturalization may be established. 
Accordingly, a commuter resident alien may not apply for naturalization 
until he or she has actually taken up permanent residence in the United 
States and until such residence has continued for the required statutory 
period. Such an applicant bears the burden of providing evidence to that 
effect.
    (4) Residence in multiple states. If an applicant claims residence 
in more than one State, the residence for purposes of this part shall be 
determined by reference to the location from which the annual federal 
income tax returns have been and are being filed.
    (5) Residence during absences of less than one year. (i) An 
applicant's residence during any absence of less than one year shall 
continue to be the State or Service district where the applicant last 
resided at the time of the applicant's departure abroad.
    (ii) Return to the United States. If, upon returning to the United 
States, an applicant returns to the State or Service district where the 
applicant last resided, the applicant will have complied with the 
continuous residence requirement specified in Sec. 316.2(a)(5) when at 
least three months have elapsed, including any part of the applicant's 
absence, from the date on which the applicant first established that 
residence. If the applicant establishes residence in a State or Service 
district other than the one in which he or she last resided, the 
applicant must complete three months at that new residence to be 
eligible for naturalization.
    (c) Disruption of continuity of residence--(1) Absence from the 
United States--(i) For continuous periods of between six (6) months and 
one (1) year. Absences from the United States for continuous periods of 
between six (6) months and one (1) year during the periods for which 
continuous residence is required under Sec. 316.2 (a)(3) and (a)(6) 
shall disrupt the continuity of such residence for purposes of this part 
unless the applicant can establish otherwise to the satisfaction of the 
Service. This finding remains valid even if the applicant did not apply 
for or otherwise request a nonresident classification for tax purposes, 
did not document an abandonment of lawful permanent resident status, and 
is still considered a lawful permanent resident under immigration laws. 
The types of documentation which may establish that the applicant did 
not disrupt the continuity of his or her residence in the United States 
during an extended absence include, but are not limited to, evidence 
that during the absence:
    (A) The applicant did not terminate his or her employment in the 
United States;
    (B) The applicant's immediate family remained in the United States;
    (C) The applicant retained full access to his or her United States 
abode; or
    (D) The applicant did not obtain employment while abroad.
    (ii) For period in excess of one (1) year. Unless an applicant 
applies for benefits in accordance with Sec. 316.5(d), absences from the 
United States for a continuous period of one (1) year or more during the 
period for which continuous residence is required under Sec. 316.2 
(a)(3) and (a)(5) shall disrupt the continuity of the applicant's 
residence. An applicant described in this paragraph who must satisfy a 
five-year statutory residence period may file an application for 
naturalization four years and one day following the date of the 
applicant's return to the United States to

[[Page 628]]

resume permanent residence. An applicant described in this paragraph who 
must satisfy a three-year statutory residence period may file an 
application for naturalization two years and one day following the date 
of the applicant's return to the United States to resume permanent 
residence.
    (2) Claim of nonresident alien status for income tax purposes after 
lawful admission as a permanent resident. An applicant who is a lawfully 
admitted permanent resident of the United States, but who voluntarily 
claims nonresident alien status to qualify for special exemptions from 
income tax liability, or fails to file either federal or state income 
tax returns because he or she considers himself or herself to be a 
nonresident alien, raises a rebuttable presumption that the applicant 
has relinquished the privileges of permanent resident status in the 
United States.
    (3) Removal and return. Any departure from the United States while 
under an order of removal (including previously issued orders of 
exclusion or deportation) terminates the applicant's status as a lawful 
permanent resident and, therefore, disrupts the continuity of residence 
for purposes of this part.
    (4) Readmission after a deferred inspection or exclusion proceeding. 
An applicant who has been readmitted as a lawful permanent resident 
after a deferred inspection or by the immigration judge during exclusion 
proceedings shall satisfy the residence and physical presence 
requirements under Sec. 316.2 (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) in the 
same manner as any other applicant for naturalization.
    (d) Application for benefits with respect to absences; appeal--(1) 
Preservation of residence under section 316(b) of the Act. (i) An 
application for the residence benefits under section 316(b) of the Act 
to cover an absence from the United States for a continuous period of 
one year or more shall be submitted to the Service on Form N-470 with 
the required fee, in accordance with the form's instructions. The 
application may be filed either before or after the applicant's 
employment commences, but must be filed before the applicant has been 
absent from the United States for a continuous period of one year.
    (ii) An approval of Form N-470 under section 316(b) of the Act shall 
cover the spouse and dependent unmarried sons and daughters of the 
applicant who are residing abroad as members of the applicant's 
household during the period covered by the application. The notice of 
approval, Form N-472, shall identify the family members so covered.
    (iii) An applicant whose Form N-470 application under section 316(b) 
of the Act has been approved, but who voluntarily claims nonresident 
alien status to qualify for special exemptions from income tax 
liability, raises a rebuttable presumption that the applicant has 
relinquished a claim of having retained lawful permanent resident status 
while abroad. The applicant's family members who were covered under 
section 316(b) of the Act and who were listed on the applicant's Form N-
472 will also be subject to the rebuttable presumption that they have 
relinquished their claims to lawful permanent resident status.
    (2) Preservation of residence under section 317 of the Act. An 
application for the residence and physical presence benefits of section 
317 of the Act to cover any absences from the United States, whether 
before or after December 24, 1952, shall be submitted to the Service on 
Form N-470 with the required fee, in accordance with the form's 
instructions. The application may be filed either before or after the 
applicant's absence from the United States or the performance of the 
functions or services described in section 317 of the Act.
    (3) Approval, denial, and appeal. The applicant under paragraphs 
(d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section shall be notified of the Service's 
disposition of the application on Form N-472. If the application is 
denied, the Service shall specify the reasons for the denial, and shall 
inform the applicant of the right to appeal in accordance with the 
provisions of part 103 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 316.10  Good moral character.

    (a) Requirement of good moral character during the statutory period. 
(1) An applicant for naturalization bears the burden of demonstrating 
that, during the statutorily prescribed period, he or she has been and 
continues to be a person of good moral character. This includes the 
period between the examination and the administration of the oath of 
allegiance.
    (2) In accordance with section 101(f) of the Act, the Service shall 
evaluate claims of good moral character on a case-by-case basis taking 
into account the elements enumerated in this section and the standards 
of the average citizen in the community of residence. The Service is not 
limited to reviewing the applicant's conduct during the five years 
immediately preceding the filing of the application, but may take into 
consideration, as a basis for its determination, the applicant's conduct 
and acts at any time prior to that period, if the conduct of the 
applicant during the statutory period does not reflect that there has 
been reform of character from an earlier period or if the earlier 
conduct and acts appear relevant to a determination of the applicant's 
present moral character.
    (b) Finding of a lack of good moral character. (1) An applicant 
shall be found to lack good moral character, if the applicant has been:
    (i) Convicted of murder at any time; or
    (ii) Convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 
101(a)(43) of the Act on or after November 29, 1990.
    (2) An applicant shall be found to lack good moral character if 
during the statutory period the applicant:
    (i) Committed one or more crimes involving moral turpitude, other 
than a purely political offense, for which the applicant was convicted, 
except as specified in section 212(a)(2)(ii)(II) of the Act;
    (ii) Committed two or more offenses for which the applicant was 
convicted and the aggregate sentence actually imposed was five years or 
more, provided that, if the offense was committed outside the United 
States, it was not a purely political offense;
    (iii) Violated any law of the United States, any State, or any 
foreign country relating to a controlled substance, provided that the 
violation was not a single offense for simple possession of 30 grams or 
less of marijuana;
    (iv) Admits committing any criminal act covered by paragraphs (b)(2) 
(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section for which there was never a formal 
charge, indictment, arrest, or conviction, whether committed in the 
United States or any other country;
    (v) Is or was confined to a penal institution for an aggregate of 
180 days pursuant to a conviction or convictions (provided that such 
confinement was not outside the United States due to a conviction 
outside the United States for a purely political offense);
    (vi) Has given false testimony to obtain any benefit from the Act, 
if the testimony was made under oath or affirmation and with an intent 
to obtain an immigration benefit; this prohibition applies regardless of 
whether the information provided in the false testimony was material, in 
the sense that if given truthfully it would have rendered ineligible for 
benefits either the applicant or the person on whose behalf the 
applicant sought the benefit;
    (vii) Is or was involved in prostitution or commercialized vice as 
described in section 212(a)(2)(D) of the Act;
    (viii) Is or was involved in the smuggling of a person or persons 
into the United States as described in section 212(a)(6)(E) of the Act;
    (ix) Has practiced or is practicing polygamy;
    (x) Committed two or more gambling offenses for which the applicant 
was convicted;
    (xi) Earns his or her income principally from illegal gambling 
activities; or
    (xii) Is or was a habitual drunkard.
    (3) Unless the applicant establishes extenuating circumstances, the 
applicant shall be found to lack good moral character if, during the 
statutory period, the applicant:
    (i) Willfully failed or refused to support dependents;
    (ii) Had an extramarital affair which tended to destroy an existing 
marriage; or

[[Page 630]]

    (iii) Committed unlawful acts that adversely reflect upon the 
applicant's moral character, or was convicted or imprisoned for such 
acts, although the acts do not fall within the purview of Sec. 316.10(b) 
(1) or (2).
    (c) Proof of good moral character in certain cases--(1) Effect of 
probation or parole. An applicant who has been on probation, parole, or 
suspended sentence during all or part of the statutory period is not 
thereby precluded from establishing good moral character, but such 
probation, parole, or suspended sentence may be considered by the 
Service in determining good moral character. An application will not be 
approved until after the probation, parole, or suspended sentence has 
been completed.
    (2) Full and unconditional executive pardon--(i) Before the 
statutory period. An applicant who has received a full and unconditional 
executive pardon prior to the beginning of the statutory period is not 
precluded by Sec. 316.10(b)(1) from establishing good moral character 
provided the applicant demonstrates that reformation and rehabilitation 
occurred prior to the beginning of the statutory period.
    (ii) During the statutory period. An applicant who receives a full 
and unconditional executive pardon during the statutory period is not 
precluded by Sec. 316.10(b)(2) (i) and (ii) from establishing good moral 
character, provided the applicant can demonstrate that extenuating and/
or exonerating circumstances exist that would establish his or her good 
moral character.
    (3) Record expungement--(i) Drug offenses. Where an applicant has 
had his or her record expunged relating to one of the narcotics offenses 
under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and section 241(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 
that applicant shall be considered as having been ``convicted'' within 
the meaning of Sec. 316.10(b)(2)(ii), or, if confined, as having been 
confined as a result of ``conviction'' for purposes of 
Sec. 316.10(b)(2)(iv).
    (ii) Moral turpitude. An applicant who has committed or admits the 
commission of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude during the 
statutory period is precluded from establishing good moral character, 
even though the conviction record of one such offense has been expunged.

<R05>
Sec. 316.11  Attachment to the Constitution; favorable disposition towards the good order and happiness.

    (a) General. An applicant for naturalization must establish that 
during the statutorily prescribed period, he or she has been and 
continues to be attached to the principles of the Constitution of the 
United States and favorably disposed toward the good order and happiness 
of the United States. Attachment implies a depth of conviction which 
would lead to active support of the Constitution. Attachment and 
favorable disposition relate to mental attitude, and contemplate the 
exclusion from citizenship of applicants who are hostile to the basic 
form of government of the United States, or who disbelieve in the 
principles of the Constitution.
    (b) Advocacy of peaceful change. At a minimum, the applicant shall 
satisfy the general standard of paragraph (a) of this section by 
demonstrating an acceptance of the democratic, representational process 
established by the Constitution, a willingness to obey the laws which 
may result from that process, and an understanding of the means for 
change which are prescribed by the Constitution. The right to work for 
political change shall be consistent with the standards in paragraph (a) 
of this section only if the changes advocated would not abrogate the 
current Government and establish an entirely different form of 
government.
    (c) Membership in the Communist Party or any other totalitarian 
organization. An applicant who is or has been a member of or affiliated 
with the Communist Party or any other totalitarian organization shall be 
ineligible for naturalization, unless the applicant's membership meets 
the exceptions in sections 313 and 335 of the Act and Sec. 313.4 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 316.12  Applicant's legal incompetency during statutory period.

    (a) General. An applicant who is legally competent at the time of 
the examination on the naturalization application and of the 
administration of the

[[Page 631]]

oath of allegiance may be admitted to citizenship, provided that the 
applicant fully understands the purpose and responsibilities of the 
naturalization procedures.
    (b) Legal incompetence. Naturalization is not precluded if, during 
part of the statutory period, the applicant was legally incompetent or 
confined to a mental institution.
    (1) There is a presumption that the applicant's good moral 
character, attachment, and favorable disposition which existed prior to 
the period of legal incompetency continued through that period. The 
Service may, however, consider an applicant's actions during a period of 
legal incompetence, as evidence tending to rebut this presumption.
    (2) If the applicant has been declared legally incompetent, the 
applicant has the burden of establishing that legal competency has been 
restored. The applicant shall submit legal and medical evidence to 
determine and establish the claim of legal competency.
    (3) The applicant shall bear the burden of establishing that any 
crimes committed, regardless of whether the applicant was convicted, 
occurred while the applicant was declared legally incompetent.


<R05>
Sec. 316.13  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 316.14  Adjudication--examination, grant, denial.

    (a) Examination. The examination on an application for 
naturalization shall be conducted in accordance with Section 335 of the 
Act.
    (b) Determination--(1) Grant or denial. Subject to supervisory 
review, the employee of the Service who conducts the examination under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall determine whether to grant or deny 
the application, and shall provide reasons for the determination, as 
required under section 335(d) of the Act.
    (2) Appeal. An applicant whose application for naturalization has 
been denied may request a hearing, which shall be carried out in 
accordance with section 336 of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 319.1  Persons living in marital union with United States citizen spouse.

    (a) Eligibility. To be eligible for naturalization under section 
319(a) of the Act, the spouse of a United States citizen must establish 
that he or she:
    (1) Has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the United 
States;
    (2) Has resided continuously within the United States, as defined 
under Sec. 316.5 of this chapter, for a period of at least three years 
after having been lawfully admitted for permanent residence;
    (3) Has been living in marital union with the citizen spouse for the 
three years preceding the date of examination on the application, and 
the spouse has been a United States citizen for the duration of that 
three year period;
    (4) Has been physically present in the United States for periods 
totaling at least 18 months;
    (5) Has resided, as defined in Sec. 316.5 of this chapter, for at 
least 3 months immediately preceding the filing of the application, or 
immediately preceding the examination on the application if the 
application was filed early pursuant to section 334(a) of the Act and 
the three month period falls within the required period of residence 
under section 316(a) or 319(a) of the Act, in the State or Service 
district having jurisdiction over the alien's actual place of residence 
and in which the alien has filed the application;
    (6) Has resided continuously within the United States from the date 
of application for naturalization until the time of admission to 
citizenship;
    (7) For all relevant periods under this paragraph, has been and 
continues to be a person of good moral character, attached to the 
principles of the Constitution of the United States, and favorably 
disposed toward the good order and happiness of the United States; and

[[Page 635]]

    (8) Has complied with all other requirements for naturalization as 
provided in part 316 of this chapter, except for those contained in 
Sec. 316.2 (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this chapter.
    (b) Marital union--(1) General. An applicant lives in marital union 
with a citizen spouse if the applicant actually resides with his or her 
current spouse. The burden is on the applicant to establish, in each 
individual case, that a particular marital union satisfies the 
requirements of this part.
    (2) Loss of Marital Union--(i) Divorce, death or expatriation. A 
person is ineligible for naturalization as the spouse of a United States 
citizen under section 319(a) of the Act if, before or after the filing 
of the application, the marital union ceases to exist due to death or 
divorce, or the citizen spouse has expatriated. Eligibility is not 
restored to an applicant whose relationship to the citizen spouse 
terminates before the applicant's admission to citizenship, even though 
the applicant subsequently marries another United States citizen.
    (ii) Separation--(A) Legal separation. Any legal separation will 
break the continuity of the marital union required for purposes of this 
part.
    (B) Informal separation. Any informal separation that suggests the 
possibility of marital disunity will be evaluated on a case-by-case 
basis to determine whether it is sufficient enough to signify the 
dissolution of the marital union.
    (C) Involuntary separation. In the event that the applicant and 
spouse live apart because of circumstances beyond their control, such as 
military service in the Armed Forces of the United States or essential 
business or occupational demands, rather than because of voluntary legal 
or informal separation, the resulting separation, even if prolonged, 
will not preclude naturalization under this part.
    (c) Physical presence in the United States. In the event that the 
alien spouse has never been in the United States, eligibility under this 
section is not established even though the alien spouse resided abroad 
in marital union with the citizen spouse during the three year period.

[56 FR 50488, Oct. 7, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 319.2  Person whose United States citizen spouse is employed abroad.

    (a) Eligibility. To be eligible for naturalization under section 
319(b) of the Act, the alien spouse of a United States citizen must:
    (1) Establish that his or her citizen spouse satisfies the 
requirements under section 319(b)(1) of the Act, including that he or 
she is regularly stationed abroad. For purposes of this section, a 
citizen spouse is regularly stationed abroad if he or she proceeds 
abroad, for a period of not less than one year, pursuant to an 
employment contract or orders, and assumes the duties of employment;
    (2) At the time of examination on the application for 
naturalization, be present in the United States pursuant to a lawful 
admission for permanent residence;
    (3) At the time of naturalization, be present in the United States;
    (4) Declare in good faith, upon naturalization before the Service, 
an intention:
    (i) To reside abroad with the citizen spouse; and
    (ii) To take up residence within the United States immediately upon 
the termination of the citizen spouse's employment abroad;
    (5) Be a person of good moral character, attached to the principles 
of the Constitution of the United States, and favorably disposed toward 
the good order and happiness of the United States; and
    (6) Comply with all other requirements for naturalization as 
provided in part 316 of this chapter, except for those contained in 
Sec. 316.2(a)(3) through (a)(6) of this chapter.
    (b) Alien spouse's requirement to depart abroad immediately after 
naturalization. An alien spouse seeking naturalization under section 
319(b) of the Act must:
    (1) Establish that he or she will depart to join the citizen spouse 
within 30 to 45 days after the date of naturalization;
    (2) Notify the Service immediately of any delay or cancellation of 
the citizen spouse's assignment abroad; and
    (3) Notify the Service immediately if he or she is unable to reside 
with the citizen spouse because the citizen spouse is employed abroad in 
an area of

[[Page 636]]

hostilities where dependents may not reside.
    (c) Loss of marital union due to death, divorce, or expatriation of 
the citizen spouse. A person is ineligible for naturalization as the 
spouse of a United States citizen under section 319(b) of the Act if, 
before or after the filing of the application, the marital union ceases 
to exist due to death or divorce, or the citizen spouse has expatriated. 
Eligibility is not restored to an applicant whose relationship to the 
citizen spouse terminates before the applicant's admission into 
citizenship, even though the applicant subsequently marries another 
United States citizen.

<R05>
Sec. 319.3  Surviving spouses of United States citizens who died during a period of honorable service in an active duty status in the Armed Forces of the United

319(d) of the Act, the surviving spouse of a United States citizen must:

honorable service in an active duty status in the Armed Forces of the 
United States;

citizen spouse, in accordance with Sec. 319.1(b), at the time of that 
spouse's death;
    (3) At the time of examination on the application for 
naturalization, reside in the United States pursuant to a lawful 
admission for permanent residence;

    Whenever it appears that an applicant for naturalization may be 
unable, because of sickness or other disability, to appear for the 
initial examination on the application or for any subsequent interview, 
the district director shall cause an investigation to be conducted to 
determine the circumstances surrounding the sickness or disability. The

so, the district director shall designate another place where the 
applicant may appear for the requisite naturalization proceedings.

    (2) By Service. The Service may amend, at any time, an application 
for naturalization when in receipt of information that clearly indicates 
that a clerical error has occurred.
    (3) Amendment procedure. Any amendment will be limited to the 
correction of clerical errors arising from oversight or omission. If the 
amendment is approved, the amended application shall be filed with the 
original application for naturalization.
    (b) Substantive amendments. Any substantive amendments which affect 
the jurisdiction or the decision on the merits of the application will 
not be authorized. When the Service is in receipt of any information 
that would indicate that an application for naturalization should not 
have been granted on the merits, the Service may institute proceedings 
to reopen the application before admission to citizenship, or to revoke 
the naturalization of a person who has been admitted to citizenship, in 
accordance with section 340 of the Act and Sec. 335.5 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 335.2  Examination of applicant.

    (a) General. Subsequent to the filing of an application for 
naturalization, each applicant shall appear in person before a Service 
officer designated to conduct examinations pursuant to Sec. 332.1 of 
this chapter. The examination shall be uniform throughout the United 
States and shall encompass all factors relating to the applicant's 
eligibility for naturalization. The applicant may request the presence 
of an attorney or representative who has filed an appearance in 
accordance with part 292 of this chapter.
    (b) Completion of criminal background checks before examination. The 
Service will notify applicants for naturalization to appear before a 
Service officer for initial examination on the naturalization 
application only after the Service has received a definitive response 
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that a full criminal background 
check of an applicant has been completed. A definitive response that a 
full criminal background check on an applicant has been completed 
includes:
    (1) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that an 
applicant does not have an administrative or a criminal record;
    (2) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that an 
applicant has an administrative or a criminal record; or
    (3) Confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that two 
properly prepared fingerprint cards (Form FD-258) have been determined 
unclassifiable for the purpose of conducting a criminal background check 
and have been rejected.
    (c) Procedure. Prior to the beginning of the examination, the 
Service officer shall make known to the applicant the official capacity 
in which the officer is conducting the examination. The applicant shall 
be questioned, under oath or affirmation, in a setting apart from the 
public. Whenever necessary, the examining officer shall correct written 
answers in the application for naturalization to conform to the oral 
statements made under oath or affirmation. The

[[Page 654]]

Service officer shall maintain, for the record, brief notations of the 
examination for naturalization. At a minimum, the notations shall 
include a record of the test administered to the applicant on English 
literacy and basic knowledge of the history and government of the United 
States. The Service officer may have a stenographic, mechanical, 
electronic, or videotaped transcript made, or may prepare an affidavit 
covering the testimony of the applicant. The questions to the applicant 
shall be repeated in different form and elaborated, if necessary, until 
the officer conducting the examination is satisfied that the applicant 
either fully understands the questions or is unable to understand 
English. The applicant and the Service shall have the right to present 
such oral or documentary evidence and to conduct such cross-examination 
as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (d) Witnesses. Witnesses, if called, shall be questioned under oath 
or affirmation to discover their own credibility and competency, as well 
as the extent of their personal knowledge of the applicant and his or 
her qualifications to become a naturalized citizen.
    (1) Issuance of subpoenas. Subpoenas requiring the attendance of 
witnesses or the production of documentary evidence, or both, may be 
issued by the examining officer upon his or her own volition, or upon 
written request of the applicant or his or her attorney or 
representative. Such written request shall specify, as nearly as 
possible, the relevance, materiality, and scope of the testimony or 
documentary evidence sought and must show affirmatively that the 
testimony or documentary evidence cannot otherwise be produced. The 
examining officer shall document in the record his or her refusal to 
issue a subpoena at the request of the applicant.
    (2) Service of subpoenas. Subpoenas shall be issued on Form I-138, 
and a record shall be made of service. The subpoena may be served by any 
person over 18 years of age, not a party to the case, designated to make 
such service by the district director.
    (3) Witness fees. Mileage and fees for witnesses subpoenaed under 
this section shall be paid by the party at whose instance the subpoena 
is issued, at rates allowed and under conditions prescribed by the 
Service. Before issuing a subpoena, the officer may require the deposit 
of an amount adequate to cover the fees and mileage involved.
    (4) Failure to appear. If the witness subpoenaed neglects or refuses 
to testify or to produce documentary evidence as directed by the 
subpoena, the district director shall request that the United States 
Attorney for the proper district report such neglect or refusal to any 
District Court of the United States, and file a motion in such court for 
an order directing the witness to appear and to testify and produce the 
documentary evidence described in the subpoena.
    (5) Extraterritorial testimony. The testimony of a witness may be 
taken outside the United States. The witness's name and address shall be 
sent to the Service office abroad which has jurisdiction over the 
witness's residence. The officer taking the statement shall be given 
express instructions regarding any aspect of the case which may require 
special development or emphasis during the interrogation of the witness.
    (e) Record of examination. At the conclusion of the examination, all 
corrections made on the application form and all supplemental material 
shall be consecutively numbered and listed in the space provided on the 
applicant's affidavit contained in the application form. The affidavit 
must then be subscribed and sworn to, or affirmed, by the applicant and 
signed by the Service officer. The affidavit shall be executed under the 
following oath (or affirmation): ``I swear (affirm) and certify under 
penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that I 
know that the contents of this application for naturalization subscribed 
by me, and the evidence submitted with it, are true and correct to the 
best of my knowledge and belief.'' Evidence received by the officer 
shall be placed into the record for determination of the case. All 
documentary or written evidence shall be properly identified and 
introduced into the record as exhibits by number, unless read into the 
record. A deposition or

[[Page 655]]

statement taken by a Service officer during the initial examination or 
any subsequent examination shall be included as part of the record on 
the application.
    (f) Use of interpreter. If the use of an interpreter is authorized 
pursuant to Sec. 312.4 of this chapter, the examining officer shall note 
on the application the use and identity of any interpreter. If the 
Service officer is proficient in the applicant's native language, the 
Service officer may conduct the examination in that language with the 
consent of the applicant.

Sec. 335.3  Determination on application; continuance of examination.

    (a) The Service officer shall grant the application if the applicant 
has complied with all requirements for naturalization under this 
chapter. A decision to grant or deny the application shall be made at 
the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of 
the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization under 
Sec. 335.2. The applicant shall be notified that the application has 
been granted or denied and, if the application has been granted, of the 
procedures to be followed for the administration of the oath of 
allegiance pursuant to part 337 of this chapter.
    (b) Rather than make a determination on the application, the Service 
officer may continue the initial examination on an application for one 
reexamination, to afford the applicant an opportunity to overcome 
deficiencies on the application that may arise during the examination. 
The officer must inform the applicant in writing of the grounds to be 
overcome or the evidence to be submitted. The applicant shall not be 
required to appear for a reexamination earlier than 60 days after the 
first examination. However, the reexamination on the continued case 
shall be scheduled within the 120-day period after the initial 
examination, except as otherwise provided under Sec. 312.5(b) of this 
chapter. If the applicant is unable to overcome the deficiencies in the 
application, the application shall be denied pursuant to Sec. 336.1 of 
this chapter.

    In the event that an application is denied, the record of the 
examination on the application for naturalization, including the 
executed and corrected application form and supplements, affidavits, 
transcripts of testimony, documents, and other evidence, shall be 
submitted to the Service officer designated in Sec. 332.1 of this 
chapter to conduct hearings on denials of applications for 
naturalization in accordance with part 336 of this chapter. The record 
of the examination shall be used for examining the petitioner and 
witnesses, if required to properly dispose of issues raised in the 
matter.

<R05>
Sec. 335.5  Receipt of derogatory information after grant.

    In the event that the Service receives derogatory information 
concerning an applicant whose application has already been granted as 
provided in Sec. 335.3(a) of this chapter, but who has not yet taken the 
oath of allegiance as provided in part 337 of this chapter, the Service 
shall remove the applicant's name from any list of granted applications 
or of applicants scheduled for administration of the oath of allegiance, 
until such time as the matter can be resolved. The Service shall notify 
the applicant in writing of the receipt of the specific derogatory 
information, with a motion to reopen the previously adjudicated 
application, giving the applicant 15 days to respond. If the applicant 
overcomes the derogatory information, the application will be granted 
and the applicant will be scheduled for administration of the oath of 
allegiance. Otherwise the motion to reopen will be granted and the 
application will be denied pursuant to Sec. 336.1 of this chapter.

Sec. 335.6  Failure to appear for examination.

    (a) An applicant for naturalization shall be deemed to have 
abandoned his or her application if he or she fails to appear for the 
examination pursuant to Sec. 335.3 and fails to notify the Service of 
the reason for non-appearance within 30 days of the scheduled 
examination. Such notification shall be in writing and contain a request 
for rescheduling of the examination. In the absence of a timely 
notification, the Service may administratively close the application 
without making a decision on the merits.
    (b) An applicant may reopen an administratively closed application 
by submitting a written request to the Service within one (1) year from 
the date the application was closed. Such reopening shall be without 
additional fee. The date of the request for reopening shall be the date 
of filing of the application for purposes of determining eligibility for 
naturalization.
    (c) If the applicant does not request reopening of an 
administratively closed application within one year from the date the 
application was closed, the Service will consider that application to 
have been abandoned, and shall dismiss the application without further 
notice to the applicant.

    An applicant for naturalization who has appeared for the examination 
on his or her application as provided in Sec. 335.2 shall be considered 
as failing to prosecute such application if he or she, without good 
cause being shown, either failed to excuse an absence from a 
subsequently required appearance, or fails to provide within a 
reasonable period of time such documents, information, or testimony 
deemed by the Service to be necessary to establish his or her 
eligibility for naturalization. The Service shall deliver notice of all 
such requests for appearance or supporting evidence, in writing, to the 
applicant either in person or to the applicant's last known address. In 
the event that the applicant fails to respond within 30 days of the date 
of notification, the Service shall adjudicate the application on the 
merits pursuant to Sec. 336.1 of this chapter.

consent to the withdrawal, the application for naturalization shall be 
adjudicated on its merits.

<R05>
Sec. 335.11  Preliminary examinations on petitions for naturalization filed prior to October 1, 1991.

    (a) When held. Continued preliminary examinations shall be held on 
petitions for naturalization filed prior to October 1, 1991 when it is 
determined that further testimony is needed for the designated examiner 
to prepare a recommendation to the court consistent with Sec. 335.12. 
The examinations shall be open to the public.
    (b) Conduct of examination. Preliminary examinations shall be held 
before an employee of the Service designated by the district director to 
conduct such proceedings and to make findings and recommendations 
thereon to the naturalization court, who shall be known as the 
``designated examiner.'' The petitioner and his or her witnesses and the 
witnesses produced on behalf of the Government shall be present. The 
designated examiner shall, prior to the commencement of the examination, 
make known to the petitioner his or her official capacity and that of 
any other officer of the Service who may participate in the proceeding. 
The designated examiner shall have before him or her the entire record 
of the preliminary interrogation, including the petitioner's application 
to file a petition for naturalization (Form N-400) and any other 
evidence or data that may be relevant or material to the inquiry. All 
testimony taken at the examination shall be under oath or affirmation 
administered by the designated examiner. The designated examiner may 
interrogate the petitioner and witnesses produced in behalf of the 
petitioner or the Government, and present evidence touching upon the 
petitioner's admissibility to citizenship. He shall regulate the course 
of the examination, rule upon applications for the issuance of subpoenas 
and issue such subpoenas in proper cases, grant or deny continuances, 
and rule on all objections to the introduction of evidence, which 
rulings shall be entered on the record. Evidence held by the designated 
examiner to be inadmissible shall nevertheless be received into the 
record subject to the ruling of the court. The petitioner and the 
Government shall have the right to present such oral or documentary 
evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a 
full and true disclosure of the facts. If the petitioner is not 
represented by an attorney or representative, the designated examiner 
shall assist the petitioner in the introduction of all evidence 
available in his or her behalf. All documentary or written evidence 
shall be properly identified and introduced into the record as exhibits 
by number, unless read into the record.
    (c) Assignment of examining officer at preliminary examination. The 
district director may in his or her discretion assign an employee of the 
Service to act as examining officer at the preliminary examination. Such 
employee shall examine and cross-examine witnesses produced in behalf of 
the Government or the petitioner and present evidence pertinent to the 
petitioner's admissibility to citizenship. The designated examiner may 
take such part in the interrogation of the petitioner and witnesses and 
the introduction of evidence as he or she may deem necessary.
    (d) Stenographic reporting of proceedings; mechanical recording 
equipment. A stenographer shall be in attendance whenever, in the 
opinion of the designated examiner, such attendance is desirable, and in 
every case to which an examining officer is assigned. The stenographer 
shall record verbatim the entire proceedings, including the oaths 
administered and rulings on objections, but shall not record arguments 
in support of objections, or statements made off the record with the 
consent of the petitioner. The stenographer shall certify that the 
transcribed minutes constitute a complete and accurate record of the 
examination. Whenever, in the opinion of the designated examiner the use 
of mechanical recording equipment in lieu of a stenographer is deemed 
desirable, the proceedings may be recorded by such equipment.
    (e) Issuance of subpoenas; attendance and mileage fees. Subpenas 
requiring the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary 
evidence, or both, may be issued by the designated examiner, upon his or 
her own volition

[[Page 658]]

or upon written application of the petitioner or his or her attorney or 
representative, the examining officer, or the Service. Such written 
application shall specify, as nearly as may be, the relevance, 
materiality, and scope of the testimony or documentary evidence sought 
and show affirmatively that the testimony or documentary evidence cannot 
otherwise be produced. Subpenas shall be issued on Form I-138 and due 
record shall be made of their service. The subpoena may be served by any 
person over 18 years of age, not a party to the case, designated to make 
such service by the district director. Mileage and fees for witnesses 
subpoenaed under this section shall be paid by the party at whose 
instance the subpoena is issued at rates allowed and under conditions 
prescribed by the naturalization court in which the petition is pending. 
Before issuing a subpoena the designated examiner may require a deposit 
of an amount adequate to cover the fees and mileage involved. If the 
witness subpoenaed neglects or refuses to testify or produce documentary 
evidence as directed by the subpoena, the district director shall 
request the United States Attorney for the proper district to report 
such neglect or refusal to any court exercising naturalization 
jurisdiction and to file a motion in such court for an order directing 
the witness to appear and testify and to produce the documentary 
evidence described in the subpoena.
    (f) Briefs. At the conclusion of the preliminary examination the 
petitioner or his or her attorney or representative, and the examining 
officer if one was assigned, may submit briefs in support of arguments 
made or issues raised at the examination.
    (g) Representation by attorney or representative; absence of 
representative; advice to petitioner. The petitioner may be represented 
by an attorney or representative who has filed an appearance in 
accordance with part 292 of this chapter. If at any stage of the 
preliminary examination it appears to the designated examiner that he or 
she may recommend denial of the petition, or granting thereof with the 
facts to be presented to the court, he or she shall advise the 
petitioner of his or her right to be represented by an attorney or 
representative. A continuance of the examination shall be granted upon 
the petitioner's motion for the purpose of obtaining an attorney or 
representative. The petitioner's attorney or a representative shall be 
permitted to be present at all times during the preliminary examination 
or at any subsequent examinations and the petitioner shall not in any 
such examination or subsequent examinations be interrogated in the 
absence of his or her attorney or representative, unless the petitioner 
waives such appearance. The attorney or a representative shall be 
permitted to offer evidence to meet any evidence presented or adduced by 
the Government or the designated examiner. A petitioner who is not 
represented by an attorney or a representative shall be entitled to all 
the benefits and the privileges provided for in this section.

Sec. 335.12  Recommendations on petitions for naturalization of the designated examiner and regional administrator; notice.

    As soon as practicable after conclusion of the preliminary 
examination on a petition for naturalization filed prior to October 1, 
1991, the designated examiner shall prepare an appropriate 
recommendation to the court. If the recommendation is for denial, or for 
granting with the facts to be presented to the court, the designated 
examiner shall prepare a memorandum summarizing the evidence, and 
setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law, and his or her 
recommendation. No evidence dehors the record or evidence not admissible 
in judicial proceedings under recognized rules of evidence shall be 
considered in the preparation of the memorandum. The memorandum shall be 
submitted before final hearing to the regional operations liaison 
officer, in those cases or classes of cases designated by him or her, 
for review and recommendation. If the regional operations liaison 
officer does not agree with the recommendation of the designated 
examiner, he or she shall prepare an appropriate memorandum, with 
findings of fact, conclusions of

[[Page 659]]

law, and the recommendation of the Service, subject to review and 
approval by the Commissioner in those cases or classes of cases 
designated by him or her, for presentation to the court with the 
designated examiner's memorandum. In the preparation of memoranda, 
designated examiners and regional operations liaison officers shall be 
bound by the interpretations and rulings by the Attorney General or the 
Commissioner on Questions of law.

Sec. 335.13  Notice of recommendation on petitions for naturalization of designated examiner.

    (a) Recommendation that petition be denied. When the designated 
examiner proposes to recommend denial of the petition filed prior to 
October 1, 1991, the petitioner or his or her attorney or representative 
shall be notified thereof and furnished a copy of the designated 
examiner's memorandum. The notice shall be given in conjunction with 
notification of the date, place, and time of holding the final hearing. 
The notice shall be sent by certified mail, with return receipt 
requested, after any review made by the regional administrator.
    (b) Recommendation that petition be granted. When the designated 
examiner proposes to recommend granting of the petition filed prior to 
October 1, 1991 and to present the facts and issues to the court, the 
petitioner or his or her attorney or representative shall be notified of 
the recommendation and furnished a copy of the designated examiner's 
memorandum prior to the date of the hearing, and after any review made 
by the regional administrator.
    (c) Disagreement between recommendations of designated examiner and 
the regional administrator. In those cases reviewed by the regional 
administrator in which his or her views and recommendations do not agree 
with those of the designated examiner, the notice required by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section shall also advise the petitioner of the 
recommendation of the regional administrator and that both 
recommendations will be presented to the court. There shall also be 
enclosed with such notice a copy of the regional administrator's 
memorandum.
    (d) Briefs. If the petitioner intends to file a brief or memorandum 
at the final hearing, he or she shall furnish a copy thereof to the 
Service office from which the notice on Form N-425 emanated at least 5 
days prior to the date of the final hearing. Failure to do so will 
result in a motion for a continuance if deemed essential for the proper 
presentation of the Government's case.

<R05>
Sec. 336.1  Denial after section 335 examination.

    (a) After completing all examination procedures contained in part 
335 of this chapter and determining to deny an application for 
naturalization, the Service shall serve a written notice of denial upon 
an applicant for naturalization no later than 120 days after the date of 
the applicant's first examination on the application.
    (b) A notice of denial shall be prepared in a written, narrative 
format, and shall recite, in clear concise language, the pertinent facts 
upon which the determination was based, the specific legal section or 
sections applicable to the finding of ineligibility, and the conclusions 
of law reached by the examining officer in rendering the decision. Such 
notice of denial shall also contain a specific statement of the 
applicant's right either to accept the determination of the examining 
officer, or request a hearing before an immigration officer.
    (c) Service of the notice of denial may be made in person or by 
certified

[[Page 660]]

mail to the applicant's last known address, or upon the attorney or 
representative of record as provided in part 292 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 336.2  Hearing before an immigration officer.

    (a) The applicant, or his or her authorized representative, may 
request a hearing on the denial of the applicant's application for 
naturalization by filing a request with the Service within thirty days 
after the applicant receives the notice of denial under Sec. 336.1.
    (b) Upon receipt of a timely request for a hearing, the Service 
shall schedule a review hearing before an immigration officer, within a 
reasonable period of time not to exceed 180 days from the date upon 
which the appeal is filed. The review shall be with an officer other 
than the officer who conducted the original examination under section 
335 of the Act or who rendered the Service determination upon which the 
hearing is based, and who is classified at a grade level equal to or 
higher than the grade of the examining officer. The reviewing officer 
shall have the authority and discretion to review the application for 
naturalization, to examine the applicant, and either to affirm the 
findings and determination of the original examining officer or to 
redetermine the original decision of the Service in whole or in part. 
The reviewing officer shall also have the discretion to review any 
administrative record which was created as part of the examination 
procedures as well as Service files and reports. He or she may receive 
new evidence or take such additional testimony as may be deemed relevant 
to the applicant's eligibility for naturalization or which the applicant 
seeks to provide. Based upon the complexity of the issues to be reviewed 
or determined, and upon the necessity of conducting further examinations 
with respect to essential naturalization requirements, such as literacy 
or civics knowledge, the reviewing immigration officer may, in his or 
her discretion, conduct a full de novo hearing or may utilize a less 
formal review procedure, as he or she deems reasonable and in the 
interest of justice.
    (c) Improperly filed request for hearing--(1) Request for hearing 
filed by a person or entity not entitled to file.
    (i) Rejection without refund of filing fee. A request for hearing 
filed by a person or entity who is not entitled to file such a request 
must be rejected as improperly filed. In such a case, any filing fee 
that the Service has accepted will not be refunded.
    (ii) Request for hearing by attorney or representative without 
proper Form G-28. If a request for hearing is filed by an attorney or 
representative without a properly executed Notice of Entry of Appearance 
as Attorney or Representative (Form G-28) entitling that person to file 
the request for hearing, the appeal will be considered as improperly 
filed. In such a case, any filing fee that the Service has accepted will 
not be refunded regardless of the action taken. The reviewing official 
shall ask the attorney or representative to submit Form G-28 to the 
official's office within 15 days of the request. If Form G-28 is not 
submitted within the time allowed, the official may, on his or her own 
motion, under Sec. 103.5(a)(5)(i) of this chapter, make a new decision 
favorable to the affected party without notifying the attorney or 
representative. The request for hearing may be considered properly filed 
as of its original filing date if the attorney or representative submits 
a properly executed Form G-28 entitling that person to file the request 
for hearing.
    (2) Untimely request for hearing--(i) Rejection without refund of 
filing fee. A request for hearing which is not filed within the time 
period allowed must be rejected as improperly filed. In such a case, any 
filing fee that the Service has accepted will not be refunded.
    (ii) Untimely request for hearing treated as motion. If an untimely 
request for hearing meets the requirements of a motion to reopen as 
described in Sec. 103.5(a)(2) of this chapter or a motion to reconsider 
as described in Sec. 103.5(a)(3) of this chapter, the request for 
hearing must be treated as a motion, and a decision must be made on the 
merits of the case.

<R05>
Sec. 336.9  Judicial review of denial determinations on applications for naturalization.

    (a) General. The provisions in part 310 of this chapter shall 
provide the sole and exclusive procedures for requesting judicial review 
of final determinations on applications for naturalization made pursuant 
to section 336(a) of the Act and the provisions of this chapter by the 
Service on or after October 1, 1991.
    (b) Filing a petition. Under these procedures an applicant shall 
file a petition for review in the United States District Court having 
jurisdiction over his or her place of residence, in accordance with 
chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code, within a period of not more 
than 120 days after the Service's final determination. The petition for 
review shall be brought against the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, and service of the petition for review shall be made upon the 
Attorney General of the United States, and upon the official in charge 
of the Service office where the hearing was held pursuant to Sec. 336.2.
    (c) Standard of review. The review will be de novo, and the court 
will make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court may 
also conduct, at the request of the petitioner, a hearing de novo on the 
application for naturalization.
    (d) Exhaustion of remedies. A Service determination denying an 
application for naturalization under section 335(a) of the Act shall not 
be subject to judicial review until the applicant has exhausted those 
administrative remedies available to the applicant under section 336 of 
the Act. Every petition for judicial review shall state whether the 
validity of the final determination to deny an application for 
naturalization has been upheld in any prior administrative proceeding 
and, if so, the nature and date of such proceeding and the forum in 
which such proceeding took place.

Sec. 337.1  Oath of allegiance.

    (a) Form of oath. Except as otherwise provided in the Act and after 
receiving notice from the district director that such applicant is 
eligible for naturalization pursuant to Sec. 335.3 of this chapter, an 
applicant for naturalization shall, before being admitted to 
citizenship, take in a public ceremony held within the United States the 
following oath of allegiance, to a copy of which the applicant shall 
affix his or her signature:

    I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce 
and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, 
state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject 
or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of 
the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; 
that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear 
arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I 
will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United 
States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national 
importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I 
take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose 
of evasion; so help me God.


    (b) Alteration of form of oath; affirmation in lieu of oath. In 
those cases in which a petitioner or applicant for naturalization is 
exempt from taking the oath prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section 
in its entirety, the inapplicable clauses shall be deleted and the oath 
shall be taken in such altered form. When a petitioner or applicant for 
naturalization, by reason of religious training and belief (or 
individual interpretation thereof), or for other reasons of good 
conscience, cannot take the

[[Page 662]]

oath prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section with the words ``on 
oath'' and ``so help me God'' included, the words ``and solemnly 
affirm'' shall be substituted for the words ``on oath,'' the words ``so 
help me God'' shall be deleted, and the oath shall be taken in such 
modified form. Any reference to `oath of allegiance' in this chapter is 
understood to mean equally `affirmation of allegiance' as described in 
this paragraph.
    (c) Obligations of oath. A petitioner or applicant for 
naturalization shall, before being naturalized, establish that it is his 
or her intention, in good faith, to assume and discharge the obligations 
of the oath of allegiance, and that his or her attitude toward the 
Constitution and laws of the United States renders him or her capable of 
fulfilling the obligations of such oath.
    (d) Renunciation of title or order of nobility. A petitioner or 
applicant for naturalization who has borne any hereditary title or has 
been of any of the orders of nobility in any foreign state shall, in 
addition to taking the oath of allegiance prescribed in paragraph (a) of 
this section, make under oath or affirmation in public an express 
renunciation of such title or order of nobility, in the following form:
    (1) I further renounce the title of (give title or titles) which I 
have heretofore held; or
    (2) I further renounce the order of nobility (give the order of 
nobility) to which I have heretofore belonged.

Sec. 337.2  Oath administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or an Immigration Judge.

    (a) Public ceremony. An applicant for naturalization who has elected 
to have his or her oath of allegiance administered by the Service or an 
Immigration Judge and is not subject to the exclusive oath 
administration authority of an eligible court pursuant to section 310(b) 
of the Act shall appear in person in a public ceremony, unless such 
appearance is specifically excused under the terms and conditions set 
forth in this part. Such ceremony shall be held at a time and place 
designated by the Service or the Executive Office for Immigration Review 
within the United States and within the jurisdiction where the 
application for naturalization was filed, or into which the application 
for naturalization was transferred pursuant to Sec. 335.9 of this 
chapter. Such ceremonies shall be conducted at regular intervals as 
frequently as necessary to ensure timely naturalization, but in all 
events at least once monthly where it is required to minimize 
unreasonable delays. Such ceremonies shall be presented in such a manner 
as to preserve the dignity and significance of the occasion. District 
directors shall ensure that ceremonies conducted by the Service in their 
districts, inclusive of those held by suboffice managers, are in keeping 
with the Model Plan for Naturalization Ceremonies. Organizations 
traditionally involved in activities surrounding the ceremony should be 
encouraged to participate in Service-administered ceremonies by local 
arrangement.
    (b) Authority to administer oath of allegiance. The authority of the 
Attorney General to administer the oath of allegiance shall be delegated 
to Immigration Judges and to the following officers of the Service: The 
Commissioner; district directors; deputy district directors; officers-
in-charge; assistant officers-in-charge; or persons acting in behalf of 
such officers due to their absence or because their positions are 
vacant. In exceptional cases where the district director or officer-in-
charge determines that it is appropriate for employees of a different 
rank to conduct ceremonies, the district director or officer-in-charge 
may make a request through the Commissioner to the Assistant 
Commissioner, Adjudications, for permission to delegate such authority. 
The request shall furnish the reasons for seeking exemption from the 
requirements of this paragraph. The Commissioner may delegate such 
authority to such other officers of the Service or the Department of 
Justice as he or she may deem appropriate.
    (c) Execution of questionnaire. Immediately prior to being 
administered the oath of allegiance, each applicant shall complete the 
questionnaire on Form N-445. Each completed Form N-445 shall be reviewed 
by an officer of the Service

[[Page 663]]

who may question the applicant regarding the information thereon. If 
derogatory information is revealed, the applicant's name shall be 
removed from the list of eligible persons as provided in Sec. 335.5 of 
this chapter and he or she shall not be administered the oath.

Sec. 337.3  Expedited administration of oath of allegiance.

    (a) An applicant may be granted an expedited oath administration 
ceremony by either the court or the Service upon demonstrating 
sufficient cause. In determining whether to grant an expedited oath 
administration ceremony, the court or the district director shall 
consider special circumstances of a compelling or humanitarian nature. 
Special circumstances may include but are not limited to:
    (1) The serious illness of the applicant or a member of the 
applicant's family;
    (2) Permanent disability of the applicant sufficiently 
incapacitating as to prevent the applicant's personal appearance at a 
scheduled ceremony;
    (3) The developmental disability or advanced age of the applicant 
which would make appearance at a scheduled ceremony inappropriate; or
    (4) Urgent or compelling circumstances relating to travel or 
employment determined by the court or the Service to be sufficiently 
meritorious to warrant special consideration.
    (b) Courts exercising exclusive authority may either hold an 
expedited oath administration ceremony or refer the applicant to the 
Service in order for either the Immigration Judge or the Service to 
conduct an oath administration ceremony, if an expedited judicial oath 
administration ceremony is impractical. The court shall inform the 
district director in writing of its decision to grant the applicant an 
expedited oath administration ceremony and that the court has 
relinquished exclusive jurisdiction as to that applicant.
    (c) All requests for expedited administration of the oath of 
allegiance shall be made in writing to either the court or the Service. 
Such requests shall contain sufficient information to substantiate the 
claim of special circumstances to permit either the court or the Service 
to properly exercise the discretionary authority to grant the relief 
sought. The court or the Service may seek verification of the validity 
of the information provided in the request. If the applicant submits a 
written request to the Service, but is awaiting an oath administration 
ceremony by a court pursuant to Sec. 337.8, the Service promptly shall 
provide the court with a copy of the request without reaching a decision 
on whether to grant or deny the request.

Sec. 337.7  Information and assignment of individuals under exclusive jurisdiction.

    (a) No later than at the time of the examination on the application 
pursuant to Sec. 335.2 of this chapter, an employee of the Service shall 
advise the applicant of his or her right to elect the site for the 
administration of the oath of allegiance, subject to the exclusive 
jurisdiction provision of Sec. 310.3(d) of this chapter. In order to 
assist the applicant in making an informed decision, the Service shall 
advise the applicant of the upcoming Immigration Judge or Service 
conducted and judicial ceremonies at which the applicant may appear, if 
found eligible for naturalization.
    (b) An applicant whose application has been approved by the Service 
who is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court pursuant to 
Sec. 310.2(d) of this chapter, shall be advised of the next available 
court ceremony and provided with a written notice to appear at that 
ceremony. If the applicant is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
more than one court exercising exclusive jurisdiction, the applicant 
will be informed of the upcoming ceremonies in each affected court. The 
applicant shall decide

[[Page 664]]

which court he or she wishes to administer the oath of allegiance.

Sec. 337.8  Oath administered by the courts.

    (a) Notification of election. An applicant for naturalization not 
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Sec. 310.2(d) of this chapter 
shall notify the Service at the time of the filing of, or no later than 
at the examination on, the application of his or her election to have 
the oath of allegiance administered in an appropriate court having 
jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence.
    (b) Certification of eligibility--(1) Exclusive jurisdiction. In 
those instances falling within the exclusive jurisdiction provision of 
section 310(b)(1)(B) of the Act, the Service shall notify the court of 
the applicant's eligibility for admission to United States citizenship 
by submitting to the clerk of court Form N-646 within ten (10) days of 
the approval of the application.
    (2) Non-exclusive jurisdiction. In those instances in which the 
applicant has elected to have the oath administered in a court ceremony, 
the Service shall notify the clerk of court, in writing, using Form N-
646, that the applicant has been determined by the Attorney General to 
be eligible for admission to United States citizenship upon taking the 
requisite oath of allegiance and renunciation in a public ceremony. If a 
scheduled hearing date is not available at the time of the notification, 
Form N-646 shall indicate that the applicant has not been scheduled for 
a ceremony and the applicant shall be informed in writing that the 
application has been approved but no ceremony date is yet available.
    (c) Preparation of lists. (1) At or prior to the oath administration 
ceremony the representative attending the ceremony shall submit to the 
court on Form N-647, in duplicate, lists of persons to be administered 
the oath of allegiance and renunciation. After the ceremony, and after 
any required amendments and notations have been made therein, the clerk 
of court shall sign the lists.
    (2) The originals of all court lists specified in this section shall 
be filed permanently in the court, and the duplicates returned by the 
clerk of court to the appropriate Service office for retention by such 
office. The same disposition shall be made of any list presented to, but 
not approved by, the court.
    (d) Personal representation of the government at oath administration 
ceremonies. An oath administration ceremony shall be attended by a 
representative of the Service, who shall review each applicant's 
completed questionnaire Form N-445. If necessary, the Service 
representative shall question the applicant regarding the information 
thereon. If the questioning reveals derogatory information, the 
applicant's name shall be removed from the list of eligible persons as 
provided in Sec. 335.5 of this chapter and the court shall not 
administer the oath to such applicant.
    (e) Written report in lieu of personal representation. If it is 
impracticable for a Service representative to be present at a judicial 
oath administration ceremony, written notice of that fact shall be given 
by the Service to the court. The applicants to be administered the oath 
shall be listed on the appropriate forms prescribed in paragraph (d) of 
this section. The forms, memoranda, and certificates of naturalization 
shall be transmitted to the clerk of court, who shall submit the 
appropriate lists to the court.
    (f) Withdrawal from court. An applicant for naturalization not 
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Sec. 310.3(d) of this chapter, 
who has elected to have the oath administered in a court oath ceremony, 
may, for good cause shown, request that his or her name be removed from 
the list of persons eligible to be administered the oath at a court oath 
ceremony and request that the oath be administered in a ceremony 
conducted by an Immigration Judge or the Service. Such request shall be 
in writing to the Service office which granted the application and shall 
cite the reasons for the request. The district director or officer-in-
charge shall consider the good cause shown and the best interests of the 
applicant in making a decision. If it is determined that the applicant 
shall be permitted to withdraw his or her name from the

[[Page 665]]

court ceremony, the Service shall give written notice to the court of 
the applicant's withdrawal, and the applicant shall be scheduled for the 
next available oath ceremony, conducted by an Immigration Judge or the 
Service, as if he or she had never elected the court ceremony.

<R05>
Sec. 337.9  Effective date of naturalization.

    (a) An applicant for naturalization shall be deemed a citizen of the 
United States as of the date on which the applicant takes the prescribed 
oath of allegiance, administered either by the Service or an Immigration 
Judge in an administrative ceremony or in a ceremony conducted by an 
appropriate court under Sec. 337.8 of this chapter.
    (b) When the taking of the oath is waived for a child pursuant to 
part 322 of this chapter, the child shall be deemed a citizen of the 
United States as of the date upon which the waiver was granted by the 
Service. The appearance of the child and the child's parent(s) at an 
oath ceremony, if the oath is waived under this paragraph, is not 
required. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as preventing the 
appearance of the child and parent(s) at an oath ceremony.

    An applicant who fails to appear without good cause for more than 
one oath administration ceremony for which he or she was duly notified 
shall be presumed to have abandoned his or her intent to be naturalized. 
Such presumption shall be regarded as the receipt of derogatory 
information, and the procedures contained in Sec. 335.5 of this chapter 
shall be followed.

administration ceremony pursuant to Sec. 337.8, the Service shall 
prepare the Certificate of Naturalization and forward it to the clerk of

delivery on the date the oath administration ceremony is conducted.
    (b) Execution of certificate. The certificate shall be issued to the 
applicant in his or her true, full, and correct name as it exists at the 
time of the administration of the oath of allegiance. The certificate 
shall show, under ``former nationality,'' the name of the applicant's 
last country of citizenship, as shown in the application and Service 
records, even though the applicant may be stateless at the time of 
admission to citizenship. Photographs shall be affixed to the 
certificate in the manner provided in part 333 of this chapter. The

authorized deputy, shall forward a copy of the order changing the 
applicant's name with the notifications required by part 339 of

[[Page 666]]

this chapter. The Certificate of Naturalization will be issued to the 
applicant in the name as changed.

[56 FR 50501, Oct. 7, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 338.3  Delivery of certificates.

    No Certificate of Naturalization will be delivered in any case in 
which the naturalized person has not surrendered his or her Permanent 
Resident Card to the Service. Upon a finding that the card is destroyed 
or otherwise unavailable, the district director may waive the surrender 
of the card and the Certificate of Naturalization shall then be 
delivered to the naturalized person.

[56 FR 50501, Oct. 7, 1991, as amended at 63 FR 70316, Dec. 21, 1998]

    If a child who has been admitted to citizenship under section 322 of 
the Act is unable to sign his or her name, the Certificate of 
Naturalization must be signed by the citizen parent who submitted the 
application for the child. The signature will read ``(name of 
naturalized child) by (signature of parent)''. A naturalized person 
whose application was signed in a foreign language may sign the 
certificate of naturalization in the same manner.

[56 FR 50501, Oct. 7, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 338.5  Correction of certificates.

    (a) Whenever a Certificate of Naturalization has been delivered 
which does not conform to the facts shown on the application for 
naturalization, or a clerical error was made in preparing the 
certificate, an application for issuance of a corrected certificate, 
Form N-565, without fee, may be filed by the naturalized person. The 
application shall be filed at the Service office having jurisdiction 
over the place of residence of the applicant.
    (b) If the certificate was originally issued by a clerk of court 
under a prior statute and the district director finds that a correction 
is justified and can be made without mutilating the certificate, he or 
she shall authorize the clerk of the issuing court, or his or her 
authorized deputy, on Form N-459, in duplicate, to make the necessary 
correction and to place a dated endorsement on the reverse of the 
certificate, over the clerk's or deputy's signature and the seal of the 
court, explaining the correction. The authorization shall be filed with 
the naturalization record of the court, the corrected certificate shall 
be returned to the naturalized person, and the duplicate Form N-459 
shall be endorsed to show the date and nature of the correction and 
endorsement made, and then returned to the district director. No fee 
shall be charged the naturalized person for the correction. The district 
director shall forward the duplicate endorsed authorization to the 
official Service file.
    (c) If the certificate was originally issued by the Service, and the 
district director finds that a correction was justified, the necessary 
correction shall be made to the certificate and a dated endorsement made 
on the reverse of the certificate, over the signature of the district 
director and the seal of the Department of Justice. A notation regarding 
the correction shall be placed on the Form N-565 which shall be 
forwarded to the Service file.
    (d) When a correction made pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section would or does result in mutilation of a certificate, the 
district director shall issue a replacement certificate on Form N-570 
and the surrendered certificate shall be destroyed.
    (e) The correction will not be deemed to be justified where the 
naturalized person later alleges that the name or date of birth which 
the applicant stated to be his or her correct name or date of birth at 
the time of naturalization was not in fact his or her name or date of 
birth at the time of the naturalization.

[[Page 667]]

taken and subscribed to the oath of allegiance, and a final order of 
citizenship has been signed by the court, a certificate of 
naturalization shall be issued in duplicate by the clerk of court on 
Form N-550 (rev. 11-1-87) or N-550C. If the court maintains 
naturalization records using the certificate stub, the certificates and

    (b) The certificate shall show under ``former nationality'' the name 
of the country of which the petitioner was last a citizen, as shown on 
the petition, even though the petitioner may have been stateless at the 
time of admission to citizenship. The clerk of court or the authorized 
deputy shall endorse the alien registration number on the certificate 
stub, or if using automation equipment, ensure it is part of the 
electronic database record. The clerk of court or the authorized deputy 
shall personally sign the certificate, and ensure that the essential 
facts from the certificate are on the stub or entered into the 
electronic database record. Both certificates and stubs shall be 
prepared in one operation unless an automated system is used. 
Photographs shall be affixed to the original and duplicate certificates 
in the manner prescribed in 8 CFR part 333.
    (c) The stub of the original certificate or the information recorded 
from the stub that is maintained on the electronic database shall be 
retained by the clerk of court. Courts using the certificate stub shall 
file and maintain the stub in a 3' x 5' card file container. The 
electronic record shall be maintained in an accessible database with a 
back-up system to ensure protection and integrity of data. The original 
certificate shall be delivered to the petitioner. The duplicate 
certificate shall not be separated from the stub, and shall be forwarded 
to the appropriate office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
with all other duplicate papers or records in accordance with 8 CFR part 
333.

    Whenever the name of a petitioner, whose petition for naturalization 
was filed prior to October 1, 1991, has been changed by order of a court 
as part of a naturalization, the clerk of court or his or her authorized 
deputy shall make the following endorsement on the front of the original 
and duplicate certificate of naturalization: ``Name changed by decree of 
court from ________, as part of the naturalization.'' inserting in full 
the original name of the petitioner. This notation will be inserted 
immediately following the year of naturalization. If the stubs are being 
kept as naturalization records, a similar notation will be made on the 
stubs of the original and duplicate certificates, an the stub of the 
original certificate will be signed by the petitioner in the name as 
changed. If the court is using an electronic database for naturalization 
recordkeeping, the name change information will be maintained in that 
database. The original certificate will be issued and the duplicate, 
with or without the stub, depending on the specific courts recordkeeping 
system, will be sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

PART 340--REVOCATION OF NATURALIZATION--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec
340.1  Reopening of a naturalization application by a district director 
          pursuant to section 340(h) of the Act.
340.2  Revocation proceedings pursuant to section 340(a) of the Act.
    Authority: 8 U.S.C. 1103, 1443.


<R05>
Sec. 340.1  Reopening of a naturalization application by a district director pursuant to section 340(h) of the Act.

    (a) Reopening general. On its own motion, the Service may reopen a 
naturalization proceeding and revoke naturalization in accordance with 
this section, if the Service obtains credible and probative evidence 
which:
    (1) Shows that the Service granted the application by mistake; or
    (2) Was not known to the Service Officer during the original 
naturalization proceeding; and--
    (i) Would have had a material effect on the outcome of the original 
naturalization; and
    (ii) Would have proven that:
    (A) The applicant's application was based on fraud or 
misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact; or
    (B) The applicant was not, in fact, eligible for naturalization.
    (b) Procedure for reopening of naturalization proceedings--(1) 
Jurisdiction. The district director under whose jurisdiction the 
applicant currently resides has jurisdiction to reopen proceedings under 
this section, except that notice of intent to reopen naturalization 
proceedings and to revoke naturalization must be served no later than 2 
years after the effective date of the order admitting a person to 
citizenship, as determined under Sec. 337.9 of this chapter. This 
section applies to any order admitting a person to citizenship with an 
effective date before, on, or after October 24, 1996.
    (2) Notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and to 
revoke naturalization. (i) If the district director determines that 
reopening a naturalization proceeding is warranted under paragraph (a) 
of this section, the district director shall prepare a written notice of 
intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and to revoke 
naturalization. The notice shall describe in clear and detailed language 
the grounds on which the district director intends to reopen the 
proceeding. The notice shall include all evidence which the district 
director believes warrants reopening of the proceeding. The notice shall 
advise the applicant of his or her

[[Page 670]]

right to submit a response to the notice and to request a hearing, as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (ii) The Service shall serve the notice of intent to reopen 
naturalization proceedings and to revoke naturalization upon the 
applicant by personal service, as described in Sec. 103.5a(a)(2) of this 
chapter. When personal service is accomplished by certified or 
registered mail, return receipt requested, but the notice is returned as 
undeliverable, the Service shall serve the notice again, using another 
one of the methods of personal service described in Sec. 103.5a(a)(2) of 
this chapter.
    (3) Applicant's opportunity to respond and to request hearing. (i) 
Within sixty (60) days of service of the notice of intent to reopen 
naturalization proceedings and to revoke naturalization, the applicant 
may submit a response to the Service. The response may include any 
statements and/or additional evidence the applicant wishes to present in 
response to the proposed grounds for reopening.
    (ii) The applicant may request a hearing on the notice of intent to 
reopen naturalization proceedings and to revoke naturalization before an 
immigration officer authorized to review naturalization applications 
under sections 310 and 335 of the Act. The applicant must submit a 
written request for a hearing together with any statements and/or 
additional evidence within sixty (60) days of service of this notice. 
The Service shall schedule a requested hearing as soon as practicable.
    (4) Withdrawal of application or failure to respond. (i) Upon 
receipt of the notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and 
to revoke naturalization, the applicant may submit a written statement 
admitting the facts which the district director alleges as grounds for 
reopening, and withdrawing the application for naturalization. The 
applicant shall sign the statement under oath or affirmation or shall 
certify the truth of the statement under penalty of perjury.
    (ii) If the applicant fails to submit a response to the notice of 
intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and to revoke naturalization 
within the period specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, that 
failure to respond will be deemed an admission of the stated grounds for 
reopening and revoking naturalization.
    (5) Right to counsel. The applicant may be represented at any time 
during reopening proceedings by an attorney or other representative 
qualified under part 292 of this chapter.
    (6) Burden of proof. Upon service of a notice of intent to reopen 
naturalization proceedings and to revoke naturalization, the applicant 
bears the burden of persuading the district director that, 
notwithstanding the evidence described in the notice, the applicant was 
eligible for naturalization at the time of the order purporting to admit 
the applicant to citizenship.
    (c) Record of reopened proceedings. The record shall include, but is 
not limited to:
    (1) The applicant's application for naturalization;
    (2) The Service's notice of intent to reopen naturalization 
proceedings and to revoke naturalization with proof of service to the 
applicant;
    (3) All evidence forming the basis for reopening the naturalization 
application;
    (4) The applicant's statement and/or evidence in response to the 
Service's notice and in support of the application; and
    (5) The record of the hearing, if a hearing was held.
    (d) Decision. (1) The district director shall render a written 
decision on the reopened naturalization application within 180 days of 
service of the notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and 
to revoke naturalization. The decision shall consist of findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and a final determination on the 
naturalization application. Notice of decision shall be served on the 
applicant or his or her attorney or representative, if applicable.
    (2) Referral for revocation suit. Rather than reopening a 
naturalization decision and revoking naturalization, the district 
director shall refer a case for revocation proceedings under Sec. 340.2 
if:
    (i) The applicant's answer to the notice of intent to reopen a 
naturalization proceeding and to revoke naturalization and any 
additional evidence

[[Page 671]]

that the applicant submits raises a genuine factual issue about the 
propriety of the applicant's naturalization, so that resolution of the 
factual issue will depend on the credibility of witnesses testifying 
under oath and subject to cross-examination; or
    (ii) After rendering a decision on the merits, the district director 
determines that the applicant had adequately rebutted the allegations 
made in the notice of intent to reopen naturalization proceedings and to 
revoke naturalization, but the district director thereafter obtains 
additional evidence of at least one of the grounds set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) Appeals. (1) The applicant may appeal an adverse decision under 
paragraph (d) of this section to the Office of Examinations, 
Administrative Appeals Unit. Any appeal shall be filed initially with 
the district director within thirty (30) days after service of the 
notice of decision. Such appeal shall be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 103.1 and Sec. 103.7 of this chapter, by filing the appeal on Form 
I-290B with the fee. Appeals received after the 30-day period may be 
subject to dismissal for failure to timely file.
    (2) If, within 45 days of the filing of a notice of appeal, the 
district director determines that the materials filed in support of the 
appeal adequately rebut the grounds for reopening, the district director 
may reconsider the decision to reopen the naturalization application and 
to revoke naturalization, and affirm the original decision naturalizing 
the applicant. In such a case, it is not necessary for the district 
director to forward the case to the Administrative Appeals Unit. If, 
after the district director affirms an original naturalization grant 
under this paragraph, the Service obtains additional evidence of the 
grounds set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Service may not 
bring a new motion to reopen the naturalization proceeding and to revoke 
naturalization, but may seek to revoke the applicant's naturalization 
only pursuant to section 340(a) of the Act.
    (f) Judicial review. If a decision of the Office of Examinations, 
Administrative Appeals Unit, is adverse to the applicant, the applicant 
may seek judicial review in accordance with section 310 of the Act.
    (g) Effect of final decision of denial upon applicant's status. (1) 
A final decision to reopen a naturalization proceeding and to revoke 
naturalization shall be effective as of the date of the original order 
purporting to admit the applicant to citizenship. The order purporting 
to admit the applicant to citizenship shall then have no legal effect.
    (2) A district director's decision to reopen naturalization 
proceedings and to revoke naturalization will be final, unless the 
applicant seeks administrative or judicial review within the period 
specified by law or regulation.
    (3) When a decision to reopen naturalization proceedings and to 
revoke naturalization becomes final, the district director shall order 
the applicant to surrender his or her certificate of naturalization. The 
district director shall then cancel the certificate of naturalization, 
and shall also notify the Department of State of the revocation of 
naturalization.
    (4) Notwithstanding the service of a notice of intent to reopen 
naturalization proceedings and to revoke naturalization, the applicant 
shall be considered to be a citizen of the United States until a 
decision to reopen proceedings and deny naturalization becomes final.
    (h) Applicant's request for reopening or modification of 
application. After having been granted naturalization and administered 
the oath of allegiance and renunciation, an applicant may move that the 
Service reopen his or her naturalization application for the purpose of 
amending the application in accordance with Sec. 334.5 of this chapter.

Sec. 340.2  Revocation proceedings pursuant to section 340(a) of the Act.

    (a) Recommendations for institution of revocation proceedings. 
Whenever it appears that any grant of naturalization may have been 
illegally procured or procured by concealment of a material fact or by 
willful misrepresentation, the facts shall be reported to the district 
director having jurisdiction over the naturalized person's last known 
place of residence in the United States. If the district director is 
satisfied that

[[Page 672]]

a prima facie case exists for revocation pursuant to section 340(a) of 
the Act, he or she shall report the facts in writing to the Regional 
Director, with a recommendation regarding the institution of revocation 
proceedings.
    (b) Recommendation for criminal prosecution. If it appears to the 
district director that a case described in paragraph (a) of this section 
or one in which a final decision has been reached under Sec. 340.1(g) is 
amenable to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 1425 for unlawful 
procurement of citizenship or naturalization, the district director may 
present such facts to the appropriate United States Attorney for 
possible criminal prosecution.
    (c) Reports. It shall be the responsibility of the district director 
to advise the Service office that originated the information upon which 
the revocation inquiry is based about the progress of the investigation, 
and report the findings of the inquiry as soon as practicable.

Sec. 341.2  Examination upon application.

    (a) Personal appearance of applicant and parent or guardian--(1) 
When testimony may be omitted. An application received at a Service 
office having jurisdiction over the applicant's residence may be 
processed without interview if accompanied by one of the following:
    (i) A Department of State Form FS-240 (Report of Birth Abroad of a 
Citizen of the United States);
    (ii) An unexpired United States passport issued initially for a full 
five/ten-year period to the applicant as a citizen of the United States, 
or
    (iii) The applicant's parent(s)' naturalization certificate(s).
    (2) Testimony required. Each applicant, when notified to do so, 
shall appear in person before an officer for examination under oath or 
affirmation upon the application. A person under 18 years of age must 
have a parent or guardian apply, appear, and testify for the applicant, 
unless one is unavailable and the district director is satisfied that 
the applicant is old enough to provide reliable testimony. The same rule 
will apply for incompetent applicants. At the examination the applicant 
and the acting parent or guardian, if necessary, shall present testimony 
and evidence pertinent to the claim to citizenship and shall have the 
right to review and rebut any adverse evidence on file, and to cross-
examine witnesses called by the Government.
    (b) Witness--(1) Personal appearance. A witness shall be called to 
testify under oath or affirmation at the district director's option only 
if that person's testimony is needed to prove a particular point, and 
only if alternative proof is unavailable or more difficult to produce 
than is the witness.
    (2) Substitution and waiver. When testimony is deemed necessary by 
the district director and the presentation of the person or persons 
through whom citizenship is claimed is precluded by

[[Page 673]]

reason of death, refusal to testify, unknown whereabouts, advanced age, 
mental or physical incapacity, or severe illness or infirmity, another 
witness or witnesses shall be produced. A substitute witness also may be 
produced in lieu of such person if such person is a member of the United 
States Armed Forces serving outside the United States in an area where 
his testimony could not be taken without imposing extreme hardship upon 
him, or without unduly delaying action on the application, and no issue 
is present which can be resolved only by this testimony.
    (c) Proof. The burden of proof shall be upon the claimant, or his 
parent or guardian if one is acting in his behalf, to establish the 
claimed citizenship by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (d) Assignment and authority of officer. A district director shall 
assign an officer of the Service to conduct the examination provided for 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The assigned officer shall 
have authority to administer oaths or affirmations; to present and 
receive evidence; to rule upon offers of proof; to take or cause to be 
taken depositions or interrogatories; to regulate the course of the 
examination; to examine and cross-examine all witnesses appearing in the 
proceedings; to grant or order continuances; to consider and rule upon 
objections to the introduction of evidence; to make a report and 
recommendation to the district director as to whether the application 
shall be granted or denied, and to take such other action as may be 
appropriate to the conduct of the examination and the disposition of the 
application.
    (e) Conduct of examination. The assigned officer shall, at the 
commencement of the examination of the claimant or the acting parent or 
guardian, advise them of their rights as set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(f) of this section, and shall interrogate them under oath or 
affirmation with regard to each assertion made in the application and 
any other matter pertinent to the claim to citizenship; in addition, 
when a witness is deemed necessary, he shall interrogate each witness 
with regard to pertinent matters within the personal knowledge of the 
witness, such as the relationship between the claimant and the citizen 
source or sources; the citizenship of the latter, and any possible 
expatriatory acts performed by the claimant and the citizen source or 
sources. He may, in his discretion, have a transcript made of the 
testimony. At the conclusion of the examination of the claimant or the 
action parent or guardian, all corrections made on the applications form 
shall be consecutively numbered and recorded in the space provided 
therefor in the form. The affidavit shall then be signed and sworn to or 
affirmed by the claimant or the acting parent or guardian; and the 
remainder of the affidavit completed and signed by the assigned officer.
    (f) Representation during proceedings. The claimant shall have the 
right to representation during the proceedings, as provided in part 292 
of this chapter, and such representative shall have the right to examine 
and cross-examine witnesses appearing in the proceedings; to introduce 
evidence; to object to the introduction of evidence, which objections 
shall be stated succinctly and entered on the record, and to submit 
briefs. If the claimant is not represented by an attorney or 
representative, the assigned officer shall assist him in the 
introduction of all evidence available in his behalf.
    (g) Assignment of additional officer. The district director may, in 
his discretion, assign an officer of the Service to examine and cross-
examine the applicant and any witnesses produced by the applicant or by 
the Government and present evidence pertinent to the applicant's claim 
to citizenship. The officer of the Service assigned to conduct the 
examination under this part may take such part in the proceedings as he 
may deem necessary.

application for a Certificate of Citizenship, the applicant shall be 
furnished the reasons for denial and advised of the right to appeal in

rejected and the applicant instructed to submit a motion for reopening 
or reconsideration in accordance with 8 CFR 103.5. The motion shall be 
accompanied by the rejected application and the fee specified in 8 CFR

incapacity or young age to understand the meaning thereof, he or she 
shall take and subscribe to the oath of renunciation and allegiance, 
prescribed by part 337 of this chapter, before a member of the Service 
within the United States. Thereafter, delivery of the certificate shall 
be made in the United States to the claimant or the acting parent or

return receipt requested.
    (b) Proof of Service. The post office return receipt, or the

Sec. 342.3  Allegations admitted; no answer filed; no personal appearance requested.

    If the answer admits all material allegations in the notice, or if 
no answer is filed within the 60-day period or any extension thereof and 
no personal appearance is requested within such period or periods, it 
shall be deemed to authorize the district director, without further 
notice to respondent, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice 
and to cancel the certificate, document, or record. No appeal shall lie 
from such decision. Written notice of the decision shall be served upon 
the respondent with demand for surrender of the certificate, document,

shall designate a naturalization examiner to consider the case. The 
respondent shall be notified that he may appear in person or through

Sec. 342.5  Conduct of examination.

    (a) Authority of naturalization examiner. The naturalization

subpoenas, present and receive evidence, rule upon offers of proof, take 
or cause depositions or interrogatories to be taken, regulate the course 
of the examination, take testimony of respondent and witnesses, grant 
continuances, consider and rule upon objections to the introduction of 
evidence, make recommendations to the district director as to whether 
cancellation shall be ordered or the proceedings terminated, and to take 
any other action as may be appropriate to the conduct and disposition of

his discretion, assign an officer of the Service to examine and cross-
examine the respondent and witnesses and to present evidence pertinent 
to the case. The naturalization examiner designated

under Sec. 342.4 may take such part in the proceedings as he may deem 
necessary.
    (c) Examination. The naturalization examiner designated under 
Sec. 342.4 shall, prior to commencement of the examination, make known

pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the nature of the 
proceedings, his right to representation by counsel, to examine or 
object to evidence against him, to present evidence in his own behalf, 
to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government, and shall read 
the allegations in the notice to respondent and, if necessary, explain 
them to him. The respondent shall be asked whether he admits or denies 
the material allegations in the notice, or any of them, and whether he 
concedes illegality or fraud. If respondent admits all the material 
allegations and that the certificate, document, or record was procured 
by fraud or illegality, and no issue of law or fact remains, the 
naturalization examiner may determine that fraud or illegality has been 
established on the basis of the respondent's admissions. The allegations 
in the notice shall be taken as admitted if respondent, without 
reasonable cause, fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance at 
the examination. The examination shall be recorded verbatim except for 
statements made off the record with the permission of the naturalization 
examiner.
    (d) Prior statements. The naturalization examiner assigned to 
consider the case may receive in evidence any oral or written statement 
which is material and relevant to any issue in the case previously made 
by the respondent or by any other person during any investigation, 
examination, hearing, trial, proceeding, or interrogation.

    If, after having been surrendered to the Department of State or to 
the Service, the certificate was lost, mutilated, or destroyed as a 
result of action by the Service or that Department, a replacement 
certificate may be issued in the name shown in the surrendered 
certificate without fee and without requiring the submission of Form N-
565. A surrendered certificate shall not be regarded as mutilated and a 
replacement shall not be issued solely because of holes made in it to 
accommodate a fastener, unless the citizen declines to accept the return 
of the surrendered certificate in that condition and insists upon 
issuance of a replacement. When it is desired that the replacement 
certificate be furnished in a name other than the one shown in the 
surrendered certificate, the regular application procedure with payment 
of fee must be followed.

Sec. 343b.2  Number of applications required.

    A special certificate of naturalization is delivered to one foreign

district director, without first interrogating the applicant, for 
issuance of the certificate. Interrogation of the applicant shall be 
conducted before the application is forwarded if he appears in person to 
file the application or if it is necessary in order to properly 
adjudicate the case. In that event the officer interviewing the 
applicant will complete the report on page 2 of Form N-565 before 
transmitting the application to the district director. In all other 
cases the interview shall take place at any time before the certificate 
is transmitted to the State Department (unless the applicant is abroad) 
and the report completed after the interview.

Sec. 343b.4  Applicant outside of United States.

    If the application is received by a Service officer stationed 
outside the United States, he shall, when practicable, interrogate the 
applicant before the application is forwarded to the district director 
in the United States having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of 
residence for issuance of the certificate. When such interrogation is 
not practicable, or is not conducted because the application is 
submitted directly to the Commissioner or a district director of the 
Service in the United States, the certificate may nevertheless be issued 
and the recommendation conditioned upon satisfactory interrogation by a 
State Department representative. When forwarding the certificate in such 
a case, the Secretary of State shall be informed that the applicant has 
not been interviewed, and requested to have his representative abroad 
interview the applicant regarding identity and possible expatriation. If 
identity is not established or if expatriation has occurred, the request 
shall be made that the certificate be returned to the Service.

    (a) General. Any alien or noncitizen national of the United States 
is eligible for posthumous United States citizenship who:
    (1) Served honorably in an active-duty status with the military, 
air, or naval forces of the United States during World War I, World War 
II, the Korean Hostilities, the Vietnam Hostilities, or in other periods

Order; and,
    (2) Died as a result of injury or disease incurred in or aggravated 
by service in the United States Armed Forces during a period of military 
hostilities listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Where the person 
died subsequent to separation from military service, the death must have 
resulted from an injury or disease that was sustained, acquired, or 
exacerbated during active-duty service in a qualifying period of 
military hostilities as specified in this part.
    (b) Qualifying enlistment. In conjunction with the qualifying 
service as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the decedent

specified in section 329(a) of the Act.
    (c) Character of military service. Where the character of military 
service is not certified as honorable by the executive department under 
which the person served, or where the person was dishonorably discharged 
or discharged under conditions other than honorable, such service shall 
not satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (d) Certification of eligibility. (1) The executive department under 
which the decedent served shall determine whether:
    (i) The decedent served honorably in an active-duty status;
    (ii) The separation from such service was under honorable 
conditions; and,
    (iii) The decedent died as a result of injury or disease incurred 
in, or aggravated by active duty service during a qualifying period of 
military hostilities.
    (2) The certification required by section 329A(c)(2) of the Act to 
prove military service and service-connected death shall be requested by 
the applicant on Form N-644, Application for Posthumous Citizenship. 
Form N-644 shall also be used to verify the decedent's place of 
induction, enlistment or reenlistment.


<R05>
Sec. 392.3  Application for posthumous citizenship.

    (a) Persons who may apply. (1) Only one person who is either the 
next-of-kin or another representative of the decedent shall be permitted 
to apply for posthumous citizenship on the decedent's behalf. A person 
who is a next-of-kin who wishes to apply for posthumous citizenship on 
behalf of the decedent, shall, if there is a surviving next-of-kin in 
the line of succession above him or her, be required to obtain 
authorization to make the application from all surviving next-of-kin in 
the line of succession above him or her. The authorization shall be in 
the form of an affidavit stating that the affiant authorizes the 
requester to apply for posthumous citizenship on behalf of

[[Page 682]]

the decedent. The affidavit must include the name and address of the 
affiant, and the relationship of the affiant to the decedent.
    (2) When there is a surviving next-of-kin, an application for 
posthumous citizenship shall only be accepted from a representative 
provided authorization has been obtained from all surviving next-of-kin. 
However, this requirement shall not apply to the executor or 
administrator of the decedent's estate. In the case of a service 
organization acting as a representative, authorization must also have 
been obtained from any appointed representative. A veterans service 
organization must submit evidence of recognition by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs.
    Once the Service has granted posthumous citizenship to a person, no 
subsequent applications on his or her behalf shall be approved, nor 
shall any additional original certificates be issued, except in the case 
of an application for issuance of a replacement certificate for one 
lost, mutiliated, or destroyed.
    (b) Filing of application. (1) An application for posthumous 
citizenship shall be submitted by mail on Form N-644, according to the 
instructions on the form, to the INS Service Center having jurisdiction 
over the applicant's state of residence. Persons residing outside the 
United States must mail their applications to any one of the four 
Service Centers.
    (2) Form N-644 must be accompanied by the appropriate fee specified 
by and remitted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 103.7 (a) and 
(b) of this chapter. The fee may not be waived or refunded. To 
facilitate the certification process, a legible copy of each of the 
following documents, if available, should be submitted with Form N-644:
    (i) DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active 
Duty;
    (ii) DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty/Military Death Certificate; 
or,
    (iii) Other military or State-issued death certificate.
    (c) Application period for requesting posthumous citizenship. Form 
N-644 shall be filed with the appropriate INS Service Center not later 
than March 5, 1992, or 2 years after the date of the person's death, 
whichever date is later.
    (d) Denial of application. When the application is denied, the 
applicant shall be notified of the decision and the reason(s) for 
denial. There is no appeal from the denial of an application under this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 392.4  Issuance of a certificate of citizenship.

    (a) Approval of application. If the application (Form N-644) is 
approved, the director of the Service Center shall issue a Certificate 
of Citizenship, Form N-645, to the applicant, in the name of the 
decedent.
    (b) Delivery of certificate. Delivery of the Certificate of 
Citizenship shall be made by registered mail to the address designated 
by the applicant. If the applicant resides outside the United States, 
the certificate shall be sent by registered mail to the Service office 
abroad, if one is located where delivery is to be made; otherwise, it 
shall be forwarded to the nearest American Embassy or Consulate.
    (c) Effective date of citizenship. Where the Service has approved an 
Application for Posthumous Citizenship (Form N-644), the decedent shall 
be considered a United States citizen as of the date of his or her 
death.
    (d) Ineligibility for immigration benefits. The granting of 
posthumous citizenship under section 329A of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Act, as amended, and issuance of a certificate under 
paragraph (a) of this section, shall not entitle the surviving spouse, 
parent, son, daughter, or other relative of the decedent to any benefit 
under any provision of the Act. Nor shall such grant make applicable the 
provisions of section 319(d) of the Act to the surviving spouse.
    (e) Replacement certificate. An application for a replacement 
Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-645) shall be made on Form N-565, 
Application for a New Naturalization or Citizenship Paper, for a lost, 
mutilated, or destroyed certificate. Form N-565 shall be completed 
according to the instructions on the form and submitted by mail with the 
appropriate fee to the INS Service Center having jurisdiction over the 
applicant's state of residence. Persons residing outside the United 
States must mail their application to the Service
