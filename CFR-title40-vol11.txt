                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2008), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

    Hazardous waste liquid fuel boiler means a boiler defined under 
Sec. 260.10 of this chapter that does not burn solid fuels and that 
burns hazardous waste at any time. Liquid fuel boiler includes boilers 
that only burn gaseous fuel.
    Hazardous waste residence time means the time elapsed from cutoff of 
the flow of hazardous waste into the combustor (including, for example, 
the time required for liquids to flow from the cutoff valve into the 
combustor) until solid, liquid, and gaseous materials from the hazardous 
waste (excluding residues that may adhere to combustion chamber surfaces 
and excluding waste-derived recycled materials

[[Page 11]]

such as cement kiln dust and internally recycled metals) exit the 
combustion chamber. For combustors with multiple firing systems whereby 
the residence time may vary for the firing systems, the hazardous waste 
residence time for purposes of complying with this subpart means the 
longest residence time for any firing system in use at the time of the 
waste cutoff.
    Hazardous waste solid fuel boiler means a boiler defined under Sec. 
260.10 of this chapter that burns a solid fuel and that burns hazardous 
waste at any time.
    Initial comprehensive performance test means the comprehensive 
performance test that is used as the basis for initially demonstrating 
compliance with the standards.
    In-line kiln raw mill means a hazardous waste burning cement kiln 
design whereby kiln gas is ducted through the raw material mill for 
portions of time to facilitate drying and heating of the raw material.
    Instantaneous monitoring for combustion system leak control means 
detecting and recording pressure, without use of an averaging period, at 
a frequency adequate to detect combustion system leak events from 
hazardous waste combustion.
    Monovent means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission 
control device (e.g. positive pressure fabric filter) that extends the 
length of the structure and has a width very small in relation to its 
length (i.e., length to width ratio is typically greater than 5:1). The 
exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a 
combination of such features.
    MTEC means maximum theoretical emissions concentration of metals or 
HCl/Cl, expressed as [micro]g/dscm, and is calculated by dividing the 
feedrate by the gas flowrate.
    New source means any affected source the construction or

    One-minute average means the average of detector responses 
calculated at least every 60 seconds from responses obtained at least 
every 15 seconds.
    Operating record means a documentation retained at the facility for 
ready inspection by authorized officials of all information required by 
the standards to document and maintain compliance with the applicable 
regulations, including data and information, reports, notifications, and

              Cement Kilns, and Lightweight Aggregate Kilns


<R05>
Sec. 63.1203  What are the standards for hazardous waste incinerators that are 

effective until compliance with the standards under Sec. 63.1219?

    (a) Emission limits for existing sources. You must not discharge or 
cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:

    (i) Emissions in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen; or
    (ii) Emissions in excess of 0.40 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen provided that the combustion gas temperature at the inlet to the 
initial particulate matter control device is 400 [deg]F or lower based 
on the average of the test run average temperatures. (For purposes of 
compliance, operation of a wet particulate control device is presumed to 
meet the 400 [deg]F or lower requirement);
    (2) Mercury in excess of 130 [micro]g/dscm corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen;
    (3) Lead and cadmium in excess of 240 [micro]g/dscm, combined

than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this 
section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by Sec. 
63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume 
during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored 
continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or
    (ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over 
an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous 
emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen,

    (i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, 
over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous 
emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather 
than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by Sec. 
63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume 
during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored 
continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or
    (ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over 
an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous 
emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen,

    (c) Destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) standard--(1) 99.99% 
DRE. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must 
achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each 
principle organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC 
from the following equation:

DRE = [1-(W<INF>out</INF> / W<INF>in</INF>)] x 100%

Where:

W<INF>in</INF> = mass feedrate of one principal organic hazardous 
constituent (POHC) in a waste feedstream; and
W<INF>out</INF> = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust 
emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.

    (2) 99.9999% DRE. If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes 
F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see Sec. 261.31 of this 
chapter), you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 
99.9999% for each principle organic hazardous constituent (POHC) that 
you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must 
demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to 
incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and 
dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the 
Administrator of your intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, 
F022, F023, F026, or F027.
    (3) Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs). (i) You must 
treat the Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) in the waste 
feed that you specify under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to the 
extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of 
the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste 
feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty 
of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and 
on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering 
the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.
    (d) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.
    (e) The provisions of this section no longer apply after any of the 
following dates, whichever occurs first:

[[Page 14]]

    (1) The date that your source begins to comply with Sec. 63.1219 by 
placing a Documentation of Compliance in the operating record pursuant 
to Sec. 63.1211(c);
    (2) The date that your source begins to comply with Sec. 63.1219 by 
submitting a Notification of Compliance pursuant to Sec. 63.1210(b); or

their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering the 
results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.
    (d) Cement kilns with in-line kiln raw mills--(1) General. (i) You 
must conduct performance testing when the raw mill is on-line and when 
the mill is off-line to demonstrate compliance with the emission 
standards, and you must establish separate operating parameter limits 
under Sec. 63.1209 for each mode of operation, except as provided by 
paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (ii) You must document in the operating record each time you change 
from one mode of operation to the alternate mode and begin complying 
with the operating parameter limits for that alternate mode of 
operation.
    (iii) You must calculate rolling averages for operating parameter 
limits as provided by Sec. 63.1209(q)(2).
    (iv) If your in-line kiln raw mill has dual stacks, you may assume 
that the dioxin/furan emission levels in the by-pass stack and the 
operating parameter limits determined during performance testing of the 
by-pass stack when the raw mill is off-line are the same as when the 
mill is on-line.
    (2) Emissions averaging. You may comply with the mercury, 
semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, and hydrochloric acid/chlorine 
gas emission standards on a time-weighted average basis under the 
following procedures:
    (i) Averaging methodology. You must calculate the time-weighted 
average emission concentration with the following equation:

C<INF>total</INF>={C<INF>mill-off</INF>x(T<INF>mill-off</INF>/
    (T<INF>mill-off</INF>+T<INF>mill-on</INF> 
    )){time} +{C<INF>mill-on</INF>x(T<INF>mill-on</INF> /
    (T<INF>mill-off</INF>+T<INF>mill-on</INF>)){time} 

Where:

C<INF>total</INF>=time-weighted average concentration of a regulated 
constituent considering both raw mill on time and off time;
C<INF>mill-off</INF>=average performance test concentration of regulated 
constituent with the raw mill off-line;
C<INF>mill-on</INF>=average performance test concentration of regulated 
constituent with the raw mill on-line;
T<INF>mill-off</INF>=time when kiln gases are not routed through the raw 
mill; and
T<INF>mill-on</INF>=time when kiln gases are routed through the raw 
mill.

    (ii) Compliance. (A) If you use this emission averaging provision, 
you must document in the operating record compliance with the emission 
standards on an annual basis by using the equation provided by paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (B) Compliance is based on one-year block averages beginning on the 
day you submit the initial notification of compliance.
    (iii) Notification. (A) If you elect to document compliance with one 
or more emission standards using this emission averaging provision, you 
must notify the Administrator in the initial comprehensive performance 
test plan submitted under Sec. 63.1207(e).
    (B) You must include historical raw mill operation data in the 
performance test plan to estimate future raw mill down-time and document 
in the performance test plan that estimated emissions and estimated raw 
mill down-time will not result in an exceedance of an emission standard 
on an annual basis.
    (C) You must document in the notification of compliance submitted 
under Sec. 63.1207(j) that an emission standard will not be exceeded 
based on the documented emissions from the performance test and 
predicted raw mill down-time.
    (e) Preheater or preheater/precalciner kilns with dual stacks--(1) 
General. You must conduct performance testing on each stack to 
demonstrate compliance with the emission standards, and you must 
establish operating parameter limits under Sec. 63.1209 for each stack, 
except as provided by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section for dioxin/
furan emissions testing and operating parameter limits for the by-pass 
stack of in-line raw mills.
    (2) Emissions averaging. You may comply with the mercury, 
semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, and hydrochloric acid/chlorine 
gas emission standards specified in this section on a gas flowrate-
weighted average basis under the following procedures:
    (i) Averaging methodology. You must calculate the gas flowrate-
weighted average emission concentration using the following equation:

C<INF>tot</INF> = {C<INF>main</INF> x (Q<INF>main</INF> /
    (Q<INF>main</INF> + Q<INF>bypass</INF>)){time}  + 
    {C<INF>bypass</INF>x(Q<INF>bypass</INF> / (Q<INF>main</INF> + 
    Q<INF>bypass</INF>)){time} 

Where:


[[Page 18]]


C<INF>tot</INF> = gas flowrate-weighted average concentration of the 
regulated constituent;
C<INF>main</INF> = average performance test concentration demonstrated 
in the main stack;
C<INF>bypass</INF> = average performance test concentration demonstrated 
in the bypass stack;
Q<INF>main</INF> = volumetric flowrate of main stack effluent gas; and
Q<INF>bypass</INF> = volumetric flowrate of bypass effluent gas.

    (ii) Compliance. (A) You must demonstrate compliance with the 
emission standard(s) using the emission concentrations determined from 
the performance tests and the equation provided by paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section; and
    (B) You must develop operating parameter limits for bypass stack and 
main stack flowrates that ensure the emission concentrations calculated 
with the equation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section do not exceed the 
emission standards on a 12-hour rolling average basis. You must include 
these flowrate limits in the Notification of Compliance.
    (iii) Notification. If you elect to document compliance under this 
emissions averaging provision, you must:
    (A) Notify the Administrator in the initial comprehensive 
performance test plan submitted under Sec. 63.1207(e). The performance 
test plan must include, at a minimum, information describing the 
flowrate limits established under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section; and
    (B) Document in the Notification of Compliance submitted under Sec. 
63.1207(j) the demonstrated gas flowrate-weighted average emissions that 
you calculate with the equation provided by paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section.
    (f) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) When you comply with the particulate matter requirements of

Sec. 63.1205  What are the standards for hazardous waste burning lightweight 

aggregate kilns that are effective until compliance with the standards under 

Sec. 63.1221?

    (a) Emission limits for existing sources. You must not discharge or 
cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:
    (1) For dioxins and furans:
    (i) Emissions in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen; or
    (ii) Rapid quench of the combustion gas temperature at the exit of 
the (last) combustion chamber (or exit of any waste heat recovery 
system) to 400 [deg]F or lower based on the average of the test run 
average temperatures. You must also notify in writing the RCRA authority 
that you are complying with this option;
    (2) Mercury in excess of 120 [micro]g/dscm corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen;
    (3) Lead and cadmium in excess of 250 [micro]g/dscm, combined

    (5) Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. (i) Carbon monoxide in excess 
of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average 
(monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), 
dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with 
this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon

[[Page 19]]

standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, you also must 
document that, during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test 
runs or their equivalent as provided by Sec. 63.1206(b)(7), 
hydrocarbons do not exceed 20 parts per million by volume during those 
runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a 
continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 
percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or
    (ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 20 parts per million by volume, over 
an hourly rolling average, dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and 
reported as propane;
    (6) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in excess of 600 parts per 
million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as hydrochloric acid 
equivalents, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and
    (7) Particulate matter in excess of 57 mg/dscm corrected to 7 
percent oxygen.
    (b) Emission limits for new sources. You must not discharge or cause 
combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain:
    (1) For dioxins and furans:
    (i) Emissions in excess of 0.20 ng TEQ/dscm corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen; or
    (ii) Rapid quench of the combustion gas temperature at the exit of 
the (last) combustion chamber (or exit of any waste heat recovery 
system) to 400 [deg]F or lower based on the average of the test run 
average temperatures. You must also notify in writing the RCRA authority 
that you are complying with this option;
    (2) Mercury in excess of 120 [micro]g/dscm corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen;
    (3) Lead and cadmium in excess of 43 [micro]g/dscm, combined 
emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
    (4) Arsenic, beryllium, and chromium in excess of 110 [micro]g/dscm, 
combined emissions, corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
    (5) Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. (i) Carbon monoxide in excess 
of 100 parts per million by volume, over an hourly rolling average 
(monitored continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), 
dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen. If you elect to comply with 
this carbon monoxide standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, you also must document that, 
during the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their 
equivalent as provided by Sec. 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not 
exceed 20 parts per million by volume during those runs, over an hourly 
rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous emissions 
monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and 
reported as propane; or
    (ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 20 parts per million by volume, over 
an hourly rolling average, dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and 
reported as propane;
    (6) Hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in excess of 600 parts per

equivalents, dry basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen; and
    (7) Particulate matter in excess of 57 mg/dscm corrected to 7 
percent oxygen.
    (c) Destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) standard--(1) 99.99% 
DRE. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must 
achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each 
principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC 
from the following equation:

DRE = [1--(W<INF>out</INF> / W<INF>in</INF>)] x 100%

Where:

W<INF>in</INF> = mass feedrate of one principal organic hazardous 
constituent (POHC) in a waste feedstream; and
W<INF>out</INF> = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust 
emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.

    (2) 99.9999% DRE. If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes 
F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see Sec. 261.31 of this 
chapter), you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 
99.9999% for each principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) that 
you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must 
demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to 
incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-dioxins and

[[Page 20]]

dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the 
Administrator of your intent to burn hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, 
F023, F026, or F027.
    (3) Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs). (i) You must 
treat the Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs) in the waste 
feed that you specify under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to the 
extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of 
the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste 
feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty 
of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and 
on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering 
the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.
    (d) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.
    (e) The provisions of this section no longer apply after any of the 
following dates, whichever occurs first:
    (1) The date that your source begins to comply with Sec. 63.1221 by 
placing a Documentation of Compliance in the operating record pursuant 
to Sec. 63.1211(c);
    (2) The date that your source begins to comply with Sec. 63.1221 by 
submitting a Notification of Compliance pursuant to Sec. 63.1210(b); or
    (3) The date for your source to comply with Sec. 63.1221 pursuant 
to Sec. 63.1206 and any extensions granted there under.

this subpart by the later of October 12, 2005 or the date the source 
starts operations, except as provided by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(B)(2) and 
(a)(1)(ii)(B)(3) of this section. The costs of retrofitting and 
replacement of equipment that is installed specifically to comply with 
this subpart, between April 20, 2004, and a source's compliance date, 
are not considered to be reconstruction costs.
    (2) For a standard under Sec. Sec. 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221 
that is more stringent than the standard proposed on April 20, 2004, you 
may achieve compliance no later than October 14, 2008, if you comply 
with the standard proposed on April 20, 2004, after October 12, 2005. 
This exception does not apply, however, to new or reconstructed area 
source hazardous waste combustors that become major sources after 
October 14, 2008. As provided by Sec. 63.6(b)(7), such sources must 
comply with the standards under Sec. Sec. 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221 
at startup.
    (3) Temporary particulate matter standard under Sec. 63.1220 for 
new cement kilns. You are not required to comply with the particulate 
matter standard specified under Sec. 63.1220(b)(7)(i) until EPA takes 
final action with regard to the particulate matter standard pursuant to 
reconsideration proceedings. If you start up a new or reconstructed 
hazardous waste burning cement kiln as defined by this subpart, you must 
not emit particulate matter in excess of 0.15 kg/Mg dry feed, as 
determined according to the requirements under Sec. 63.1204(b)(7)(i) 
through (iii).
    (2) Compliance date for solid fuel boilers, liquid fuel boilers, and 
hydrochloric acid production furnaces that burn hazardous waste for 
standards under Sec. Sec. 63.1216, 63.1217, and 63.1218. (i) Compliance 
date for existing sources. You must comply with the standards of this 
subpart no later than the compliance date, October 14, 2008, unless the 
Administrator grants you an extension of time under Sec. 63.6(i) or 
Sec. 63.1213.
    (ii) New or reconstructed sources. (A) If you commenced construction 
or reconstruction of your hazardous waste combustor after April 20, 
2004, you must comply with the new source emission standards of this 
subpart by the later of October 12, 2005, or the date the source starts 
operations, except as provided by paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section. The costs of retrofitting and replacement of equipment that is 
installed specifically to comply with this subpart, between April 20, 
2004, and a source's compliance date, are not considered to be 
reconstruction costs.
    (B) For a standard in the subpart that is more stringent than the 
standard proposed on April 20, 2004, you may achieve compliance no later 
than October 14, 2008, if you comply with the standard proposed on April 
20, 2004, after October 12, 2005. This exception does not apply, 
however, to new or reconstructed area source hazardous waste combustors 
that become major sources after October 14, 2008. As provided by Sec. 
63.6(b)(7), such sources must comply with this subpart at startup.
    (3) Early compliance. If you choose to comply with the emission 
standards of this subpart prior to the dates specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, your compliance date is the

[[Page 22]]

earlier of the date you postmark the Notification of Compliance under 
Sec. 63.1207(j)(1) or the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Compliance with standards--(1) Applicability. The emission 
standards and operating requirements set forth in this subpart apply at 
all times except:
    (i) During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction; and
    (ii) When hazardous waste is not in the combustion chamber (i.e., 
the hazardous waste feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period 
of time not less than the hazardous waste residence time) and you have 
documented in the operating record that you are complying with all 
otherwise applicable requirements and standards promulgated under 
authority of sections 112 (e.g., 40 CFR part 63, subparts LLL, DDDDD, 
and NNNNN) or 129 of the Clean Air Act in lieu of the emission standards 
under Sec. Sec. 63.1203, 63.1204, 63.1205, 63.1215, 63.1216, 63.1217, 
63.1218, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221; the monitoring and compliance 
standards of this section and Sec. Sec. 63.1207 through 63.1209, except 
the modes of operation requirements of Sec. 63.1209(q); and the 
notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of Sec. Sec. 
63.1210 through 63.1212.
    (2) Methods for determining compliance. The Administrator will 
determine compliance with the emission standards of this subpart as 
provided by Sec. 63.6(f)(2). Conducting performance testing under 
operating conditions representative of the extreme range of normal 
conditions is consistent with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
63.6(f)(2)(iii)(B) and 63.7(e)(1) to conduct performance testing under 
representative operating conditions.
    (3) Finding of compliance. The Administrator will make a finding 
concerning compliance with the emission standards and other requirements 
of this subpart as provided by Sec. 63.6(f)(3).
    (4) Extension of compliance with emission standards. The 
Administrator may grant an extension of compliance with the emission 
standards of this subpart as provided by Sec. Sec. 63.6(i) and 63.1213.
    (5) Changes in design, operation, or maintenance--(i) Changes that 
may adversely affect compliance. If you plan to change (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section) the design, operation, or 
maintenance practices of the source in a manner that may adversely 
affect compliance with any emission standard that is not monitored with 
a CEMS:
    (A) Notification. You must notify the Administrator at least 60 days 
prior to the change, unless you document circumstances that dictate that 
such prior notice is not reasonably feasible. The notification must 
include:
    (1) A description of the changes and which emission standards may be 
affected; and
    (2) A comprehensive performance test schedule and test plan under 
the requirements of Sec. 63.1207(f) that will document compliance with 
the affected emission standard(s);
    (B) Performance test. You must conduct a comprehensive performance 
test under the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.1207(f)(1) and (g)(1) to 
document compliance with the affected emission standard(s) and establish 
operating parameter limits as required under Sec. 63.1209, and submit 
to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance under Sec. Sec. 
63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d); and
    (C) Restriction on waste burning. (1) Except as provided by 
paragraph (b)(5)(i)(C)(2) of this section, after the change and prior to 
submitting the notification of compliance, you must not burn hazardous 
waste for more than a total of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of 
the Administrator) and only for the purposes of pretesting or 
comprehensive performance testing. Pretesting is defined at Sec. 
63.1207(h)(2)(i) and (ii).
    (2) You may petition the Administrator to obtain written approval to 
burn hazardous waste in the interim prior to submitting a Notification 
of Compliance for purposes other than testing or pretesting. You must 
specify operating requirements, including limits on operating 
parameters, that you determine will ensure compliance with the emission 
standards of this subpart based on available information. The 
Administrator will review, modify as necessary, and approve if warranted 
the interim operating requirements.
    (ii) Changes that will not affect compliance. If you determine that 
a change will not adversely affect compliance

[[Page 23]]

with the emission standards or operating requirements, you must document 
the change in the operating record upon making such change. You must 
revise as necessary the performance test plan, Documentation of 
Compliance, Notification of Compliance, and start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan to reflect these changes.
    (iii) Definition of ``change.'' For purposes of paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section, ``change'' means any change in design, operation, or 
maintenance practices that were documented in the comprehensive 
performance test plan, Notification of Compliance, or startup, shutdown, 
and malfunction plan.
    (6) Compliance with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission 
standards. This paragraph applies to sources that elect to comply with 
the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions standards of this subpart 
by documenting continuous compliance with the carbon monoxide standard 
using a continuous emissions monitoring system and documenting 
compliance with the hydrocarbon standard during the destruction and 
removal efficiency (DRE) performance test or its equivalent.
    (i) If a DRE test performed pursuant to Sec. 63.1207(c)(2) is 
acceptable as documentation of compliance with the DRE standard, you may 
use the highest hourly rolling average hydrocarbon level achieved during 
the DRE test runs to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. 
An acceptable DRE test is any test for which the data and results are 
determined to meet quality assurance objectives (on a site-specific 
basis) such that the results adequately demonstrate compliance with the 
DRE standard.
    (ii) If during this acceptable DRE test you did not obtain 
hydrocarbon emissions data sufficient to document compliance with the 
hydrocarbon standard, you must either:
    (A) Perform, as part of the performance test, an ``equivalent DRE 
test'' to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. An 
equivalent DRE test is comprised of a minimum of three runs each with a 
minimum duration of one hour during which you operate the combustor as 
close as reasonably possible to the operating parameter limits that you 
established based on the initial DRE test. You must use the highest 
hourly rolling average hydrocarbon emission level achieved during the 
equivalent DRE test to document compliance with the hydrocarbon 
standard; or
    (B) Perform a DRE test as part of the performance test.
    (7) Compliance with the DRE standard. (i) Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(7)(ii) and (b)(7)(iii) of this section:
    (A) You must document compliance with the Destruction and Removal 
Efficiency (DRE) standard under this subpart only once provided that you 
do not modify the source after the DRE test in a manner that could 
affect the ability of the source to achieve the DRE standard.
    (B) You may use any DRE test data that documents that your source 
achieves the required level of DRE provided:
    (1) You have not modified the design or operation of your source in 
a manner that could effect the ability of your source to achieve the DRE 
standard since the DRE test was performed; and,
    (2) The DRE test data meet quality assurance objectives determined 
on a site-specific basis.
    (ii) Sources that feed hazardous waste at locations other than the 
normal flame zone. (A) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of 
this section, if you feed hazardous waste at a location in the 
combustion system other than the normal flame zone, then you must 
demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard during each comprehensive 
performance test;
    (B)(1) A cement kiln that feeds hazardous waste at a location other 
than the normal flame zone need only demonstrate compliance with the DRE 
standard during three consecutive comprehensive performance tests 
provided that:
    (i) All three tests achieve the DRE standard in this subpart; and
    (ii) The design, operation, and maintenance features of each of the 
three tests are similar;
    (iii) The data in lieu restriction of Sec. 63.1207(c)(2)(iv) does 
not apply when complying with the provisions of paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) 
of this section;

[[Page 24]]

    (2) If at any time you change your design, operation, and 
maintenance features in a manner that could reasonably be expected to 
affect your ability to meet the DRE standard, then you must comply with 
the requirements of paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (iii) For sources that do not use DRE previous testing to document 
conformance with the DRE standard pursuant to Sec. 63.1207(c)(2), you 
must perform DRE testing during the initial comprehensive performance 
test.
    (8) Applicability of particulate matter and opacity standards during 
particulate matter CEMS correlation tests. (i) Any particulate matter 
and opacity standards of parts 60, 61, 63, 264, 265, and 266 of this 
chapter (i.e., any title 40 particulate or opacity standards) applicable 
to a hazardous waste combustor do not apply while you conduct 
particulate matter continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) 
correlation tests (i.e., correlation with manual stack methods) under 
the conditions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) through (vii) of this section.
    (ii) Any permit or other emissions or operating parameter limits or 
conditions, including any limitation on workplace practices, that are 
applicable to hazardous waste combustors to ensure compliance with any 
particulate matter and opacity standards of parts 60, 61, 63, 264, 265, 
and 266 of this chapter (i.e., any title 40 particulate or opacity 
standards) do not apply while you conduct particulate matter CEMS 
correlation tests under the conditions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) through 
(vii) of this section.
    (iii) For the provisions of this section to apply, you must:
    (A) Develop a particulate matter CEMS correlation test plan that 
includes the following information. This test plan may be included as 
part of the comprehensive performance test plan required under 
Sec. Sec. 63.1207(e) and (f):
    (1) Number of test conditions and number of runs for each test 
condition;
    (2) Target particulate matter emission level for each test 
condition;
    (3) How you plan to modify operations to attain the desired 
particulate matter emission levels; and
    (4) Anticipated normal particulate matter emission levels; and
    (B) Submit the test plan to the Administrator for approval at least 
90 calendar days before the correlation test is scheduled to be 
conducted.
    (iv) The Administrator will review and approve/disapprove the 
correlation test plan under the procedures for review and approval of 
the site-specific test plan provided by Sec. 63.7(c)(3)(i) and (iii). 
If the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the correlation test 
plan within the time period specified by Sec. 63.7(c)(3)(i), the plan 
is considered approved, unless the Administrator has requested 
additional information.
    (v) The particulate matter and opacity standards and associated 
operating limits and conditions will not be waived for more than 96 
hours, in the aggregate, for a correlation test, including all runs of 
all test conditions, unless more time is approved by the Administrator.
    (vi) The stack sampling team must be on-site and prepared to perform 
correlation testing no later than 24 hours after you modify operations 
to attain the desired particulate matter emissions concentrations, 
unless you document in the correlation test plan that a longer period of 
conditioning is appropriate.
    (vii) You must return to operating conditions indicative of 
compliance with the applicable particulate matter and opacity standards

or cause combustion gases to be emitted into the atmosphere that contain 
hydrocarbons in the by-pass duct in excess of 10 parts per million by 
volume, over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a 
continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 7 
percent oxygen, and reported as propane, at any time during the

    (ii) If construction of the kiln commenced after April 19, 1996 at a 
plant site where a cement kiln (whether burning hazardous waste or not) 
did not previously exist, hydrocarbons are limited to 50 parts per 
million by volume, over a 30-day block average (monitored continuously 
with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, corrected to 
7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane.
    (ii) Lightweight aggregate kilns that feed hazardous waste at a

[[Page 30]]

standards (lb/million Btu) under Sec. 63.1217.
    (iii) If the as-fired heating value of the hazardous waste is less 
than 10,000 Btu/lb, you are subject to the mass or volume emission 
concentration standards ([micro]gm/dscm or ppmv) under Sec. 63.1217.

    (2) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. (i) You are subject to 
the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan requirements of Sec. 
63.6(e)(3).
    (ii) If you elect to comply with Sec. Sec. 270.235(a)(1)(iii), 
270.235(a)(2)(iii), or 270.235(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter to address RCRA 
concerns that you minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction events (including releases from emergency 
safety vents):
    (A) The startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan must include a 
description of potential causes of malfunctions, including releases from 
emergency safety vents, that may result in significant releases of 
hazardous air pollutants, and actions the source is taking to minimize 
the frequency and severity of those malfunctions.
    (B) You must submit the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan to 
the Administrator for review and approval.
    (1) Approval procedure. The Administrator will notify you of 
approval or intention to deny approval of the startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan within 90 calendar days after receipt of the original 
request and within 60 calendar days after receipt of any supplemental 
information that you submit. Before disapproving the plan, the 
Administrator will notify you of the Administrator's intention to 
disapprove the plan together with:
    (i) Notice of the information and findings on which intended 
disapproval is based; and
    (ii) Notice of opportunity for you to present additional information 
to the Administrator before final action on disapproval of the plan. At 
the time the Administrator notifies you of intention to disapprove the 
plan, the Administrator will specify how much time you will have after 
being notified on the intended disapproval to submit additional 
information.
    (2) Responsibility of owners and operators. You are responsible for 
ensuring that you submit any supplementary and additional information 
supporting your plan in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to 
consider whether to approve the plan. Neither your submittal of the 
plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the plan, 
relieves you of the responsibility to comply with the provisions of this 
subpart.
    (C) Changes to the plan that may significantly increase emissions. 
(1) You must request approval in writing from the Administrator within 5 
days after

[[Page 31]]

making a change to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that may 
significantly increase emissions of hazardous air pollutants.
    (2) To request approval of such changes to the startup, shutdown, 
and malfunction plan, you must follow the procedures provided by 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section for initial approval of the 
plan.
    (iii) You must identify in the plan a projected oxygen correction 
factor based on normal operations to use during periods of startup and 
shutdown.
    (iv) You must record the plan in the operating record.
    (v) Operating under the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan. (A) 
Compliance with AWFCO requirements during malfunctions. (1) During 
malfunctions, the automatic waste feed cutoff requirements of Sec. 
63.1206(c)(3) continue to apply, except for paragraphs (c)(3)(v) and 
(c)(3)(vi) of this section. If you exceed a part 63, Subpart EEE, of 
this chapter emission standard monitored by a CEMS or COMs or operating 
limit specified under Sec. 63.1209, the automatic waste feed cutoff 
system must immediately and automatically cutoff the hazardous waste 
feed, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section. If 
the malfunction itself prevents immediate and automatic cutoff of the 
hazardous waste feed, however, you must cease feeding hazardous waste as 
quickly as possible.
    (2) Although the automatic waste feed cutoff requirements continue 
to apply during a malfunction, an exceedance of an emission standard 
monitored by a CEMS or COMS or operating limit specified under Sec. 
63.1209 is not a violation of this subpart if you take the corrective 
measures prescribed in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.
    (3) Excessive exceedances during malfunctions. For each set of 10 
exceedances of an emission standard or operating requirement while 
hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the 
hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous 
waste feed was cutoff) during a 60-day block period, you must:
    (i) Within 45 days of the 10th exceedance, complete an investigation 
of the cause of each exceedance and evaluation of approaches to minimize 
the frequency, duration, and severity of each exceedance, and revise the 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan as warranted by the evaluation 
to minimize the frequency, duration, and severity of each exceedance; 
and
    (ii) Record the results of the investigation and evaluation in the 
operating record, and include a summary of the investigation and 
evaluation, and any changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan, in the excess emissions report required under Sec. 63.10(e)(3).
    (B) Compliance with AWFCO requirements when burning hazardous waste 
during startup and shutdown. (1) If you feed hazardous waste during 
startup or shutdown, you must include waste feed restrictions (e.g., 
type and quantity), and other appropriate operating conditions and 
limits in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.
    (2) You must interlock the operating limits you establish under 
paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B)(1) of this section with the automatic waste feed 
cutoff system required under Sec. 63.1206(c)(3), except for paragraphs 
(c)(3)(v) and (c)(3)(vi) of this section.
    (3) When feeding hazardous waste during startup or shutdown, the 
automatic waste feed cutoff system must immediately and automatically 
cutoff the hazardous waste feed if you exceed the operating limits you 
establish under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B)(1) of this section, except as 
provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section.
    (4) Although the automatic waste feed cutoff requirements of this 
paragraph apply during startup and shutdown, an exceedance of an 
emission standard or operating limit is not a violation of this subpart 
if you comply with the operating procedures prescribed in the startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan.
    (3) Automatic waste feed cutoff (AWFCO)--(i) General. Upon the 
compliance date, you must operate the hazardous waste combustor with a 
functioning system that immediately and automatically cuts off the 
hazardous waste feed, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of 
this section:

[[Page 32]]

    (A) When any of the following are exceeded: Operating parameter 
limits specified under Sec. 63.1209; an emission standard monitored by 
a CEMS; and the allowable combustion chamber pressure;
    (B) When the span value of any CMS detector, except a CEMS, is met 
or exceeded;
    (C) Upon malfunction of a CMS monitoring an operating parameter 
limit specified under Sec. 63.1209 or an emission level; or
    (D) When any component of the automatic waste feed cutoff system 
fails.
    (ii) Ducting of combustion gases. During an AWFCO, you must continue 
to duct combustion gasses to the air pollution control system while 
hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., if the 
hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous 
waste feed cutoff system was activated).
    (iii) Restarting waste feed. You must continue to monitor during the 
cutoff the operating parameters for which limits are established under 
Sec. 63.1209 and the emissions required under that section to be 
monitored by a CEMS, and you must not restart the hazardous waste feed 
until the operating parameters and emission levels are within the 
specified limits.
    (iv) Failure of the AWFCO system. If the AWFCO system fails to 
automatically and immediately cutoff the flow of hazardous waste upon 
exceedance of a parameter required to be interlocked with the AWFCO 
system under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, you have failed to 
comply with the AWFCO requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 
If an equipment or other failure prevents immediate and automatic cutoff 
of the hazardous waste feed, however, you must cease feeding hazardous 
waste as quickly as possible.
    (v) Corrective measures. If, after any AWFCO, there is an exceedance 
of an emission standard or operating requirement, irrespective of 
whether the exceedance occurred while hazardous waste remained in the 
combustion chamber (i.e., whether the hazardous waste residence time has 
transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated), 
you must investigate the cause of the AWFCO, take appropriate corrective 
measures to minimize future AWFCOs, and record the findings and 
corrective measures in the operating record.
    (vi) Excessive exceedance reporting. (A) For each set of 10 
exceedances of an emission standard or operating requirement while 
hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the 
hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous 
waste feed was cutoff) during a 60-day block period, you must submit to 
the Administrator a written report within 5 calendar days of the 10th 
exceedance documenting the exceedances and results of the investigation 
and corrective measures taken.
    (B) On a case-by-case basis, the Administrator may require excessive 
exceedance reporting when fewer than 10 exceedances occur during a 60-
day block period.
    (vii) Testing. The AWFCO system and associated alarms must be tested 
at least weekly to verify operability, unless you document in the 
operating record that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset 
operations and that less frequent inspection will be adequate. At a 
minimum, you must conduct operability testing at least monthly. You must 
document and record in the operating record AWFCO operability test 
procedures and results.
    (viii) Ramping down waste feed. (A) You may ramp down the waste 
feedrate of pumpable hazardous waste over a period not to exceed one 
minute, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii)(B) of this section. 
If you elect to ramp down the waste feed, you must document ramp down 
procedures in the operating and maintenance plan. The procedures must 
specify that the ramp down begins immediately upon initiation of 
automatic waste feed cutoff and the procedures must prescribe a bona 
fide ramping down. If an emission standard or operating limit is 
exceeded during the ramp down, you have failed to comply with the 
emission standards or operating requirements of this subpart.
    (B) If the automatic waste feed cutoff is triggered by an exceedance 
of any of the following operating limits, you may not ramp down the 
waste feed cutoff: Minimum combustion chamber

[[Page 33]]

temperature, maximum hazardous waste feedrate, or any hazardous waste 
firing system operating limits that may be established for your 
combustor.
    (4) ESV openings--(i) Failure to meet standards. If an emergency 
safety vent (ESV) opens when hazardous waste remains in the combustion 
chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time has not expired) 
during an event other than a malfunction as defined in the startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan such that combustion gases are not 
treated as during the most recent comprehensive performance test (e.g., 
if the combustion gas by-passes any emission control device that was 
operating during the performance test), you must document in the 
operating record whether you remain in compliance with the emission 
standards of this subpart considering emissions during the ESV opening 
event.
    (ii) ESV operating plan. (A) You must develop an ESV operating plan, 
comply with the operating plan, and keep the plan in the operating 
record.
    (B) The ESV operating plan must provide detailed procedures for 
rapidly stopping the waste feed, shutting down the combustor, and 
maintaining temperature and negative pressure in the combustion chamber 
during the hazardous waste residence time, if feasible. The plan must 
include calculations and information and data documenting the 
effectiveness of the plan's procedures for ensuring that combustion 
chamber temperature and negative pressure are maintained as is 
reasonably feasible.
    (iii) Corrective measures. After any ESV opening that results in a 
failure to meet the emission standards as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) 
of this section, you must investigate the cause of the ESV opening, take 
appropriate corrective measures to minimize such future ESV openings, 
and record the findings and corrective measures in the operating record.
    (iv) Reporting requirements. You must submit to the Administrator a 
written report within 5 days of an ESV opening that results in failure 
to meet the emission standards of this subpart (as determined in 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) documenting the result of the 
investigation and corrective measures taken.
    (5) Combustion system leaks. (i) Combustion system leaks of 
hazardous air pollutants must be controlled by:
    (A) Keeping the combustion zone sealed to prevent combustion system 
leaks; or
    (B) Maintaining the maximum combustion zone pressure lower than 
ambient pressure using an instantaneous monitor; or
    (C) Upon prior written approval of the Administrator, an alternative 
means of control to provide control of combustion system leaks 
equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than ambient 
pressure; or
    (D) Upon prior written approval of the Administrator, other 
technique(s) which can be demonstrated to prevent fugitive emissions 
without use of instantaneous pressure limits; and
    (ii) You must specify in the performance test workplan and 
Notification of Compliance the method that will be used to control 
combustion system leaks. If you control combustion system leaks by 
maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than ambient pressure 
using an instantaneous monitor, you must also specify in the performance 
test workplan and Notification of Compliance the monitoring and 
recording frequency of the pressure monitor, and specify how the 
monitoring approach will be integrated into the automatic waste feed 
cutoff system.
    (6) Operator training and certification. (i) You must establish 
training programs for all categories of personnel whose activities may 
reasonably be expected to directly affect emissions of hazardous air 
pollutants from the source. Such persons include, but are not limited 
to, chief facility operators, control room operators, continuous 
monitoring system operators, persons that sample and analyze 
feedstreams, persons that manage and charge feedstreams to the 
combustor, persons that operate emission control devices, and ash and 
waste handlers. Each

[[Page 34]]

training program shall be of a technical level commensurate with the 
person's job duties specified in the training manual. Each commensurate 
training program shall require an examination to be administered by the 
instructor at the end of the training course. Passing of this test shall 
be deemed the ``certification'' for personnel, except that, for control 
room operators, the training and certification program shall be as 
specified in paragraphs (c)(6)(iii) through (c)(6)(vi) of this section.
    (ii) You must ensure that the source is operated and maintained at 
all times by persons who are trained and certified to perform these and 
any other duties that may affect emissions of hazardous air pollutants. 
A certified control room operator must be on duty at the site at all 
times the source is in operation.
    (iii) Hazardous waste incinerator control room operators must:
    (A) Be trained and certified under a site-specific, source-developed 
and implemented program that meets the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(6)(v) of this section; or
    (B) Be trained under the requirements of, and certified under, one 
of the following American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) 
standards: QHO-1-1994, QHO-1a-1996, or QHO-1-2004 (Standard for the 
Qualification and Certification of Hazardous Waste Incinerator 
Operators). If you elect to use the ASME program:
    (1) Control room operators must, prior to the compliance date, 
achieve provisional certification, and must submit an application to 
ASME and be scheduled for the full certification exam. Within one year 
of the compliance date, control room operators must achieve full 
certification;
    (2) New operators and operators of new sources must, before assuming 
their duties, achieve provisional certification, and must submit an 
application to ASME, and be scheduled for the full certification exam. 
Within one year of assuming their duties, these operators must achieve 
full certification; or
    (C) Be trained and certified under a State program.
    (iv) Control room operators of cement kilns, lightweight aggregate 
kilns, solid fuel boilers, liquid fuel boilers, and hydrochloric acid 
production furnaces must be trained and certified under:
    (A) A site-specific, source-developed and implemented program that 
meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section; or
    (B) A State program.
    (v) Site-specific, source developed and implemented training 
programs for control room operators must include the following elements:
    (A) Training on the following subjects:
    (1) Environmental concerns, including types of emissions;
    (2) Basic combustion principles, including products of combustion;
    (3) Operation of the specific type of combustor used by the 
operator, including proper startup, waste firing, and shutdown 
procedures;
    (4) Combustion controls and continuous monitoring systems;
    (5) Operation of air pollution control equipment and factors 
affecting performance;
    (6) Inspection and maintenance of the combustor, continuous 
monitoring systems, and air pollution control devices;
    (7) Actions to correct malfunctions or conditions that may lead to 
malfunction;
    (8) Residue characteristics and handling procedures; and
    (9) Applicable Federal, state, and local regulations, including 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration workplace standards; and
    (B) An examination designed and administered by the instructor; and
    (C) Written material covering the training course topics that may 
serve as reference material following completion of the course.
    (vi) To maintain control room operator qualification under a site-
specific, source developed and implemented training program as provided 
by paragraph (c)(6)(v) of this section, control room operators must 
complete an annual review or refresher course covering, at a minimum, 
the following topics:
    (A) Update of regulations;

[[Page 35]]

    (B) Combustor operation, including startup and shutdown procedures, 
waste firing, and residue handling;
    (C) Inspection and maintenance;
    (D) Responses to malfunctions or conditions that may lead to 
malfunction; and
    (E) Operating problems encountered by the operator.
    (vii) You must record the operator training and certification 
program in the operating record.
    (7) Operation and maintenance plan--(i) You must prepare and at all 
times operate according to an operation and maintenance plan that 
describes in detail procedures for operation, inspection, maintenance, 
and corrective measures for all components of the combustor, including 
associated pollution control equipment, that could affect emissions of 
regulated hazardous air pollutants.
    (ii) The plan must prescribe how you will operate and maintain the 
combustor in a manner consistent with good air pollution control 
practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels achieved 
during the comprehensive performance test.
    (iii) This plan ensures compliance with the operation and 
maintenance requirements of Sec. 63.6(e) and minimizes emissions of 
pollutants, automatic waste feed cutoffs, and malfunctions.
    (iv) You must record the plan in the operating record.
    (8) Bag leak detection system requirements. (i) If your combustor is 
equipped with a baghouse (fabric filter), you must continuously operate 
either:
    (A) A bag leak detection system that meets the specifications and 
requirements of paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section and you must comply 
with the corrective measures and notification requirements of paragraphs 
(c)(8)(iii) and (iv) of this section; or
    (B) A particulate matter detection system under paragraph (c)(9) of 
this section.
    (ii) Bag leak detection system specification and requirements. (A) 
The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to 
be capable of continuously detecting and recording particulate matter 
emissions at concentrations of 1.0 milligrams per actual cubic meter 
unless you demonstrate, under Sec. 63.1209(g)(1), that a higher 
detection limit would routinely detect particulate matter loadings 
during normal operations;
    (B) The bag leak detection system shall provide output of relative 
or absolute particulate matter loadings;
    (C) The bag leak detection system shall be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound an audible alarm when an increase in relative 
particulate loadings is detected over a preset level;
    (D) The bag leak detection system shall be installed and operated in 
a manner consistent with available written guidance from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency or, in the absence of such written 
guidance, the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations 
for installation, operation, and adjustment of the system;
    (E) The initial adjustment of the system shall, at a minimum, 
consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity 
(range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the 
alarm set points and the alarm delay time;
    (F) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the 
sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay 
time, except as detailed in the operation and maintenance plan required 
under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. You must not increase the 
sensitivity by more than 100 percent or decrease the sensitivity by more 
than 50 percent over a 365 day period unless such adjustment follows a 
complete baghouse inspection which demonstrates the baghouse is in good 
operating condition;
    (G) For negative pressure or induced air baghouses, and positive 
pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a 
stack, the bag leak detector shall be installed downstream of the 
baghouse and upstream of any wet acid gas scrubber; and
    (H) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm system may be shared among the detectors.
    (iii) Bag leak detection system corrective measures requirements. 
The operating and maintenance plan required by paragraph (c)(7) of this 
section must include a corrective measures plan that

[[Page 36]]

specifies the procedures you will follow in the case of a bag leak 
detection system alarm. The corrective measures plan must include, at a 
minimum, the procedures used to determine and record the time and cause 
of the alarm as well as the corrective measures taken to correct the 
control device malfunction or minimize emissions as specified below. 
Failure to initiate the corrective measures required by this paragraph 
is failure to ensure compliance with the emission standards in this 
subpart.
    (A) You must initiate the procedures used to determine the cause of 
the alarm within 30 minutes of the time the alarm first sounds; and
    (B) You must alleviate the cause of the alarm by taking the 
necessary corrective measure(s) which may include, but are not to be 
limited to, the following:
    (1) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken filter 
elements, or any other malfunction that may cause an increase in 
emissions;
    (2) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
    (3) Replacing defective bags or filter media, or otherwise repairing 
the control device;
    (4) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;
    (5) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system; or
    (6) Shutting down the combustor.
    (iv) Excessive exceedances notification. If you operate the 
combustor when the detector response exceeds the alarm set-point more 
than 5 percent of the time during any 6-month block time period, you 
must submit a notification to the Administrator within 30 days of the 
end of the 6-month block time period that describes the causes of the 
exceedances and the revisions to the design, operation, or maintenance 
of the combustor or baghouse you are taking to minimize exceedances. To 
document compliance with this requirement:
    (A) You must keep records of the date, time, and duration of each 
alarm, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a 
brief description of the cause of the alarm and the corrective action 
taken;
    (B) You must record the percent of the operating time during each 6-
month period that the alarm sounds;
    (C) In calculating the operating time percentage, if inspection of 
the fabric filter demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no 
alarm time is counted; and
    (D) If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as 
a minimum of 1 hour.
    (9) Particulate matter detection system requirements. If you 
combustor is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator or ionizing wet 
scrubber and you elect not to establish under Sec. 63.1209(m)(1)(iv) 
site-specific control device operating parameter limits that are linked 
to the automatic waste feed cutoff system under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, or your combustor is equipped with a fabric filter and you 
elect to use a particulate matter detection system pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(8)(i)(B) of this section, you must continuously operate a 
particulate matter detection system that meets the specifications and 
requirements of paragraphs (c)(9)(i) through (iii) of this section and 
you must comply with the corrective measures and notification 
requirements of paragraphs (c)(9)(iv) through (v) of this section.
    (i) Particulate matter detection system requirements. (A) The 
particulate matter detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of continuously detecting and recording 
particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 1.0 milligrams per 
actual cubic meter unless you demonstrate, under Sec. 63.1209(g)(1), 
that a higher detection limit would routinely detect particulate matter 
loadings during normal operations;
    (B) The particulate matter detector shall provide output of relative 
or absolute particulate matter loadings;
    (C) The particulate matter detection system shall be equipped with 
an alarm system that will sound an audible alarm when an increase in 
relative or absolute particulate loadings is detected over the set-point
    (D) You must install, operate, and maintain the particulate matter 
detection system in a manner consistent with the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(9) of this section and available written

[[Page 37]]

guidance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or, in the 
absence of such written guidance, the manufacturer's written 
specifications and recommendations for installation, operation, 
maintenance and quality assurance of the system;
    (E) You must include procedures for installation, operation, 
maintenance, and quality assurance of the particulate matter detection 
system in the site-specific continuous monitoring system test plan 
required under Sec. 63.8(e)(3) of this chapter.
    (F) Where multiple detectors are required to monitor multiple 
control devices, the system's instrumentation and alarm system may be 
shared among the detectors.
    (G) You must establish the alarm set-point as provided by either 
paragraph (c)(9)(ii) or paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Establishing the alarm set-point without extrapolation. (A) The 
alarm set-point is the average of the test run averages of the detector 
response achieved during the comprehensive performance test 
demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter emission standard.
    (B) During the comprehensive performance test, you may simulate 
emission concentrations at the upper end of the range of normal 
operations by means including feeding high levels of ash and detuning 
the emission control equipment.
    (C) You must comply with the alarm set-point on a 6-hour rolling 
average, updated each hour with a one-hour block average that is the 
average of the detector responses over each 15-minute block;
    (iii) Establishing the alarm set-point with extrapolation. You may 
extrapolate the average of the test run averages of the detector 
response achieved during the comprehensive performance test as provided 
by paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section to establish an alarm level 
after you approximate the correlation of the detector response to 
particulate matter concentration as prescribed by paragraph 
(c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section. You must comply with the extrapolated 
alarm set-point on a 6-hour rolling average, updated each hour with a 
one-hour block average that is the average of the detector responses 
over each 15-minute block.
    (A) You may extrapolate the detector response up to a particulate 
matter concentration that is 50% of the particulate matter emission 
standard or 125% of the highest particulate matter concentration used to 
develop the correlation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, 
whichever is greater. The extrapolated emission concentration must not 
exceed the particulate matter emission standard.
    (B) To establish an approximate correlation of the detector response 
to particulate matter emission concentrations, you should use as 
guidance Performance Specification-11 for PM CEMS (40 CFR Part 60, 
Appendix B), except that you need only conduct 5 runs to establish the 
initial correlation under Section 8.6 of Performance Specification 11.
    (C) For quality assurance, you should use as guidance Procedure 2 of 
Appendix F to Part 60 of this chapter and the detector manufacturer's 
recommended procedures for periodic quality assurance checks and tests, 
except that:
    (1) You must conduct annual Relative Response Audits as prescribed 
by Procedure 2 of Appendix F to Part 60 of this chapter (Section 
10.3(6));
    (2) You need only conduct Relative Response Audits on a 3-year 
interval after passing two sequential annual Relative Response Audits.
    (D) An exceedance of the particulate matter emission standard by a 
particulate matter detection system for which particulate emission 
concentrations have been approximately correlated with the detector 
response under paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section is not evidence 
that the standard has been exceeded. The approximate correlation is used 
for compliance assurance to determine when corrective measures must be 
taken rather than for compliance monitoring.
    (iv) Particulate matter detection system corrective measures 
requirements. The operating and maintenance plan required by paragraph 
(c)(7) of this section must include a corrective measures plan that 
specifies the procedures you will follow in the case of a particulate 
matter detection system alarm. The corrective

[[Page 38]]

measures plan must include, at a minimum, the procedures used to 
determine and record the time and cause of the alarm as well as the 
corrective measures taken to correct the control device malfunction or 
minimize emissions as specified below. Failure to initiate the 
corrective measures required by this paragraph is failure to ensure 
compliance with the emission standards in this subpart.
    (A) You must initiate the procedures used to determine the cause of 
the alarm within 30 minutes of the time the alarm first sounds; and
    (B) You must alleviate the cause of the alarm by taking the 
necessary corrective measure(s) which may include shutting down the 
combustor.
    (v) Excessive exceedances notification. If you operate the combustor 
when the detector response exceeds the alarm set-point more than 5 
percent of the time during any 6-month block time period, you must 
submit a notification to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of 
the 6-month block time period that describes the causes of the 
exceedances and the revisions to the design, operation, or maintenance 
of the combustor or emission control device you are taking to minimize 
exceedances. To document compliance with this requirement:
    (A) You must keep records of the date, time, and duration of each 
alarm, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a 
brief description of the cause of the alarm and the corrective action 
taken;
    (B) You must record the percent of the operating time during each 6-
month period that the alarm sounds;
    (C) In calculating the operating time percentage, if inspection of 
the emission control device demonstrates that no corrective action is 
required, no alarm time is counted; and
    (D) If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as 
a minimum of 1 hour.

Sec. 63.1207  What are the performance testing requirements?

    (a) General. The provisions of Sec. 63.7 apply, except as noted 
below.
    (b) Types of performance tests--(1) Comprehensive performance test. 
You must conduct comprehensive performance tests to demonstrate 
compliance with the emission standards provided by this subpart, 
establish limits for the operating parameters provided by Sec. 63.1209, 
and demonstrate compliance with the performance specifications for 
continuous monitoring systems.
    (2) Confirmatory performance test. You must conduct confirmatory 
performance tests to:
    (i) Demonstrate compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard 
when the source operates under normal operating conditions; and
    (ii) Conduct a performance evaluation of continuous monitoring 
systems required for compliance assurance with the dioxin/furan emission 
standard under Sec. 63.1209(k).
    (3) One-Time Dioxin/Furan Test for Sources Not Subject to a 
Numerical Dioxin/Furan Standard. For solid fuel boilers and hydrochloric 
acid production furnaces, for lightweight aggregate kilns that are not 
subject to a numerical dioxin/furan emission standard under Sec. 
63.1221, and liquid fuel boilers that are not subject to a numerical 
dioxin/furan emission standard under Sec. 63.1217, you must conduct a 
one-time emission test for dioxin/furan under feed and operating 
conditions that are most likely to reflect daily maximum operating 
variability, similar to a dioxin/furan comprehensive performance test.
    (i) You must conduct the dioxin/furan emissions test no later than 
the deadline for conducting the initial comprehensive performance test.
    (ii) You may use dioxin/furan emissions data from previous testing 
to meet this requirement, provided that:
    (A) The testing was conducted under feed and operating conditions 
that are most likely to reflect daily maximum operating variability, 
similar to a dioxin/furan compliance test;
    (B) You have not changed the design or operation of the source in a 
manner that could significantly affect stack

[[Page 39]]

gas dioxin/furan emission concentrations; and
    (C) The data meet quality assurance objectives that may be 
determined on a site-specific basis.
    (iii) You may use dioxin/furan emissions data from a source to 
represent emissions from another on-site source in lieu of testing 
(i.e., data in lieu of testing) if the design and operation, including 
hazardous waste feed and other feedstreams, of the sources are 
identical.
    (iv) You must include the results of the one-time dioxin/furan 
emissions test with the results of the initial comprehensive performance 
test in the Notification of Compliance.
    (v) You must repeat the dioxin/furan emissions test if you change 
the design or operation of the source in a manner that may increase 
dioxin/furan emissions.
    (vi) Sources that are required to perform the one-time dioxin/furan 
test pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section are not required to 
perform confirmatory performance tests.
    (c) Initial comprehensive performance test--(1) Test date. Except as 
provided by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, you must 
commence the initial comprehensive performance test not later than six 
months after the compliance date.
    (2) Data in lieu of the initial comprehensive performance test. (i) 
You may request that previous emissions test data serve as documentation 
of conformance with the emission standards of this subpart provided that 
the previous testing:
    (A) Was initiated after 54 months prior to the compliance date, 
except as provided by paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) or (c)(2)(iv) of this 
section;
    (B) Results in data that meet quality assurance objectives 
(determined on a site-specific basis) such that the results demonstrate 
compliance with the applicable standards;
    (C) Was in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section; and
    (D) Was sufficient to establish the applicable operating parameter 
limits under Sec. 63.1209.
    (ii) You must submit data in lieu of the initial comprehensive 
performance test in lieu of (i.e., if the data are in lieu of all 
performance testing) or with the notification of performance test 
required under paragraph (e) of this section.
    (iii) The data in lieu test age restriction provided in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not apply for the duration of the 
interim standards (i.e., the standards published in the Federal Register 
on February 13, 2002, 67 FR 6792). See 40 CFR parts 63, 264, 265, 266, 
270, and 271 revised as of July 1, 2002. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this 
section does not apply until EPA promulgates permanent replacement 
standards pursuant to the Settlement Agreement noticed in the Federal 
Register on November 16, 2001 (66 FR 57715).
    (iv) The data in lieu test age restriction provided in paragraph 
(c)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not apply to DRE data provided you do 
not feed hazardous waste at a location in the combustion system other 
than the normal flame zone.
    (3) For incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns, 
you must commence the initial comprehensive performance test to 
demonstrate compliance with the standards under Sec. Sec. 63.1219, 
63.1220, and 63.1221 not later than 12 months after the compliance date.
    (d) Frequency of testing. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph 
(d)(4) of this section, you must conduct testing periodically as 
prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. The date 
of commencement of the initial comprehensive performance test is the 
basis for establishing the deadline to commence the initial confirmatory 
performance test and the next comprehensive performance test. You may 
conduct performance testing at any time prior to the required date. The 
deadline for commencing subsequent confirmatory and comprehensive 
performance testing is based on the date of commencement of the previous 
comprehensive performance test. Unless the Administrator grants a time 
extension under paragraph (i) of this section, you must conduct testing 
as follows:
    (1) Comprehensive performance testing. Except as otherwise specified 
in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, you must

[[Page 40]]

commence testing no later than 61 months after the date of commencing 
the previous comprehensive performance test used to show compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1218, 63.1219, 63.1220, or 63.1221. If 
you submit data in lieu of the initial performance test, you must 
commence the subsequent comprehensive performance test within 61 months 
of commencing the test used to provide the data in lieu of the initial 
performance test.
    (2) Confirmatory performance testing. Except as otherwise specified 
in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, you must commence confirmatory 
performance testing no later than 31 months after the date of commencing 
the previous comprehensive performance test used to show compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, or 63.1221. If you submit data in 
lieu of the initial performance test, you must commence the initial 
confirmatory performance test within 31 months of the date six months 
after the compliance date. To ensure that the confirmatory test is 
conducted approximately midway between comprehensive performance tests, 
the Administrator will not approve a test plan that schedules testing 
within 18 months of commencing the previous comprehensive performance 
test.
    (3) Duration of testing. You must complete performance testing 
within 60 days after the date of commencement, unless the Administrator 
determines that a time extension is warranted based on your 
documentation in writing of factors beyond your control that prevent you 
from meeting the 60-day deadline.
    (4) Applicable testing requirements under the interim standards--(i) 
Waiver of periodic comprehensive performance tests. Except as provided 
by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must conduct only an initial 
comprehensive performance test under the interim standards (Sec. Sec. 
63.1203 through 63.1205); all subsequent comprehensive performance 
testing requirements are waived under the interim standards. The 
provisions in the introductory text to paragraph (d) and in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section apply only to tests used to demonstrate 
compliance with the replacement standards promulgated on or after 
October 12, 2005.
    (ii) Waiver of confirmatory performance tests. You are not required 
to conduct a confirmatory test under the interim standards (Sec. Sec. 
63.1203 through 63.1205). The confirmatory testing requirements in the

section apply only after you have demonstrated compliance with the 
replacement standards promulgated on or after October 12, 2005.
    (ii) Waiver of confirmatory performance tests. You are not required 
to conduct a confirmatory test under the interim standards (i.e., the 
standards published in the Federal Register on February 13, 2002. The 
confirmatory testing requirements in the introductory text to paragraph 
(d) and in paragraph (d)(2) of this section are waived until EPA 
promulgates permanent replacement standards pursuant to the Settlement 
Agreement noticed in the Federal Register on November 16, 2001.

necessary to determine whether to approve the confirmatory test plan.
    (g) Operating conditions during testing. You must comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 63.7(e). Conducting performance testing under 
operating conditions representative of the extreme range of normal 
conditions is consistent with the requirement of Sec. 63.7(e)(1) to 
conduct performance testing under representative operating conditions.
    (1) Comprehensive performance testing--(i) Operations during 
testing. For the following parameters, you must operate the combustor 
during the performance test under normal conditions (or conditions that 
will result in higher than normal emissions):
    (A) Chlorine feedrate. You must feed normal (or higher) levels of 
chlorine during the dioxin/furan performance test;
    (B) Ash feedrate. For hazardous waste incinerators, you must conduct 
the following tests when feeding normal (or higher) levels of ash: The 
semivolatile metal and low volatile metal performance tests; and the 
dioxin/furan and mercury performance tests if activated carbon injection 
or a carbon bed is used; and
    (C) Cleaning cycle of the particulate matter control device. You 
must conduct the following tests when the particulate matter control 
device undergoes its normal (or more frequent) cleaning cycle: The 
particulate matter, semivolatile metal, and low volatile metal 
performance tests; and the dioxin/furan and mercury performance tests if 
activated carbon injection or a carbon bed is used.
    (ii) Modes of operation. Given that you must establish limits for 
the applicable operating parameters specified in Sec. 63.1209 based on 
operations during the comprehensive performance test, you may conduct 
testing under two or more operating modes to provide operating 
flexibility.
    (iii) Steady-state conditions. (A) Prior to obtaining performance 
test data, you must operate under performance test conditions until you 
reach steady-state operations with respect to emissions of pollutants 
you must measure during the performance test and operating parameters 
under Sec. 63.1209 for which you must establish limits. During system 
conditioning, you must ensure that each operating parameter for which 
you must establish a limit is held at the level planned for the 
performance test. You must include documentation in the performance test 
plan under paragraph (f) of this section justifying the duration of 
system conditioning.
    (B) If you own or operate a hazardous waste cement kiln that 
recycles collected particulate matter (i.e., cement kiln dust) into the 
kiln, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate matter prior 
to obtaining performance test data for levels of selected metals that 
must be measured during performance testing to document that the system 
has reached steady-state conditions (i.e., that metals levels have 
stabilized). You must document the rationale for selecting metals that 
are indicative of system equilibrium and include the information in the 
performance test plan under paragraph (f) of this section. To determine 
system equilibrium, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate 
matter hourly for each selected metal, unless you submit in the 
performance test plan a justification for reduced sampling and analysis 
and the Administrator approves in writing a reduced sampling and 
analysis frequency.

[[Page 46]]

    (2) Confirmatory performance testing. You must conduct confirmatory 
performance testing for dioxin/furan under normal operating conditions 
for the following parameters:
    (i) Carbon monoxide (or hydrocarbon) CEMS emissions levels must be 
within the range of the average value to the maximum value allowed, 
except as provided by paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. The average 
value is defined as the sum of the hourly rolling average values 
recorded (each minute) over the previous 12 months, divided by the 
number of rolling averages recorded during that time. The average value 
must not include calibration data, startup data, shutdown data, 
malfunction data, and data obtained when not burning hazardous waste;
    (ii) Each operating limit (specified in Sec. 63.1209) established 
to maintain compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard must be 
held within the range of the average value over the previous 12 months 
and the maximum or minimum, as appropriate, that is allowed, except as 
provided by paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. The average value is 
defined as the sum of the rolling average values recorded over the 
previous 12 months, divided by the number of rolling averages recorded 
during that time. The average value must not include calibration data, 
startup data, shutdown data, malfunction data, and data obtained when 
not burning hazardous waste;
    (iii) You must feed chlorine at normal feedrates or greater; and
    (iv) If the combustor is equipped with carbon injection or carbon 
bed, normal cleaning cycle of the particulate matter control device.
    (v) The Administrator may approve an alternative range to that 
required by paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section if you 
document in the confirmatory performance test plan that it may be 
problematic to maintain the required range during the test. In addition, 
when making the finding of compliance, the Administrator may consider 
test conditions outside of the range specified in the test plan based on 
a finding that you could not reasonably maintain the range specified in 
the test plan and considering factors including whether the time 
duration and level of the parameter when operations were out of the 
specified range were such that operations during the confirmatory test 
are determined to be reasonably representative of normal operations. In 
addition, the Administrator will consider the proximity of the emission 
test results to the standard.
    (h) Operating conditions during subsequent testing. (1) Current 
operating parameter limits established under Sec. 63.1209 are waived 
during subsequent comprehensive performance testing.
    (2) Current operating parameter limits are also waived during 
pretesting prior to comprehensive performance testing for an aggregate 
time not to exceed 720 hours of operation (renewable at the discretion 
of the Administrator) under an approved test plan or if the source 
records the results of the pretesting. Pretesting means:
    (i) Operations when stack emissions testing for dioxin/furan, 
mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, particulate matter, 
or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas is being performed; and
    (ii) Operations to reach steady-state operating conditions prior to 
stack emissions testing under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (i) Time extension for subsequent performance tests. After the 
initial comprehensive performance test, you may request up to a one-year 
time extension for conducting a comprehensive or confirmatory 
performance test to consolidate performance testing with other state or 
federally required emission testing, or for other reasons deemed 
acceptable by the Administrator. If the Administrator grants a time 
extension for a comprehensive performance test, the deadlines for 
commencing the next comprehensive and confirmatory tests are based on 
the date that the subject comprehensive performance test commences.
    (1) You must submit in writing to the Administrator any request 
under this paragraph for a time extension for conducting a performance 
test.
    (2) You must include in the request for an extension for conducting 
a performance test the following:
    (i) A description of the reasons for requesting the time extension;

[[Page 47]]

    (ii) The date by which you will commence performance testing.
    (3) The Administrator will notify you in writing of approval or 
intention to deny approval of your request for an extension for 
conducting a performance test within 30 calendar days after receipt of 
sufficient information to evaluate your request. The 30-day approval or 
denial period will begin after you have been notified in writing that 
your application is complete. The Administrator will notify you in 
writing whether the application contains sufficient information to make 
a determination within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original 
application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any 
supplementary information that you submit.
    (4) When notifying you that your application is not complete, the 
Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the 
application. The Administrator will also provide notice of opportunity 
for you to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after 
notification of the incomplete application, additional information or 
arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the 
application.
    (5) Before denying any request for an extension for performance 
testing, the Administrator will notify you in writing of the 
Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with:
    (i) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended 
denial is based; and
    (ii) Notice of opportunity for you to present in writing, within 15 
calendar days after notification of the intended denial, additional 
information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on 
the request.
    (6) The Administrator's final determination to deny any request for 
an extension will be in writing and will set forth specific grounds upon 
which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 
30 calendar days after the presentation of additional information or 
argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 calendar days 
after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation 
is made.
    (j) Notification of compliance--(1) Comprehensive performance test. 
(i) Except as provided by paragraphs (j)(4) and (j)(5) of this section, 
within 90 days of completion of a comprehensive performance test, you 
must postmark a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance with 
the emission standards and continuous monitoring system requirements, 
and identifying operating parameter limits under Sec. 63.1209.
    (ii) Upon postmark of the Notification of Compliance, you must 
comply with all operating requirements specified in the Notification of 
Compliance in lieu of the limits specified in the Documentation of 
Compliance required under Sec. 63.1211(c).
    (2) Confirmatory performance test. Except as provided by paragraph 
(j)(4) of this section, within 90 days of completion of a confirmatory 
performance test, you must postmark a Notification of Compliance 
documenting compliance or noncompliance with the applicable dioxin/furan 
emission standard.
    (3) See Sec. Sec. 63.7(g), 63.9(h), and 63.1210(d) for additional 
requirements pertaining to the Notification of Compliance (e.g., you 
must include results of performance tests in the Notification of 
Compliance).
    (4) Time extension. You may submit a written request to the 
Administrator for a time extension documenting that, for reasons beyond 
your control, you may not be able to meet the 90-day deadline for 
submitting the Notification of Compliance after completion of testing. 
The Administrator will determine whether a time extension is warranted.
    (5) Early compliance. If you conduct the initial comprehensive 
performance test prior to the compliance date, you must postmark the 
Notification of Compliance within 90 days of completion of the 
performance test or by the compliance date, whichever is later.
    (k) Failure to submit a timely notification of compliance. (1) If 
you fail to postmark a Notification of Compliance by the specified date, 
you must cease hazardous waste burning immediately.
    (2) Prior to submitting a revised Notification of Compliance as 
provided by paragraph (k)(3) of this section, you may burn hazardous 
waste only for the

[[Page 48]]

purpose of pretesting or comprehensive performance testing and only for 
a maximum of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of the 
Administrator).
    (3) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of 
Compliance subsequent to a new comprehensive performance test before 
resuming hazardous waste burning.
    (l) Failure of performance test--(1) Comprehensive performance test. 
The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the initial 
comprehensive performance test if you conduct the test prior to your 
compliance date.
    (i) If you determine (based on CEM recordings, results of analyses 
of stack samples, or results of CMS performance evaluations) that you 
have exceeded any emission standard during a comprehensive performance 
test for a mode of operation, you must cease hazardous waste burning 
immediately under that mode of operation. You must make this 
determination within 90 days following completion of the performance 
test.
    (ii) If you have failed to demonstrate compliance with the emission 
standards for any mode of operation:
    (A) Prior to submitting a revised Notification of Compliance as 
provided by paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, you may burn 
hazardous waste only for the purpose of pretesting or comprehensive 
performance testing under revised operating conditions, and only for a 
maximum of 720 hours (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator), 
except as provided by paragraph (l)(3) of this section;
    (B) You must conduct a comprehensive performance test under revised 
operating conditions following the requirements for performance testing 
of this section; and
    (C) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of 
Compliance subsequent to the new comprehensive performance test.
    (2) Confirmatory performance test. If you determine (based on CEM 
recordings, results of analyses of stack samples, or results of CMS 
performance evaluations) that you have failed the dioxin/furan emission 
standard during a confirmatory performance test, you must cease burning 
hazardous waste immediately. You must make this determination within 90 
days following completion of the performance test. To burn hazardous 
waste in the future:
    (i) You must submit to the Administrator for review and approval a 
test plan to conduct a comprehensive performance test to identify 
revised limits on the applicable dioxin/furan operating parameters 
specified in Sec. 63.1209(k);
    (ii) You must submit to the Administrator a Notification of 
Compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard under the provisions 
of paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section and this paragraph (l). You 
must include in the Notification of Compliance the revised limits on the 
applicable dioxin/furan operating parameters specified in Sec. 
63.1209(k); and
    (iii) Until the Notification of Compliance is submitted, you must 
not burn hazardous waste except for purposes of pretesting or 
confirmatory performance testing, and for a maximum of 720 hours 
(renewable at the discretion of the Administrator), except as provided 
by paragraph (l)(3) of this section.
    (3) You may petition the Administrator to obtain written approval to 
burn hazardous waste in the interim prior to submitting a Notification 
of Compliance for purposes other than testing or pretesting. You must 
specify operating requirements, including limits on operating 
parameters, that you determine will ensure compliance with the emission 
standards of this subpart based on available information including data 
from the failed performance test. The Administrator will review, modify 
as necessary, and approve if warranted the interim operating 
requirements. An approval of interim operating requirements will include 
a schedule for submitting a Notification of Compliance.
    (m) Waiver of performance test. You are not required to conduct 
performance tests to document compliance with the mercury, semivolatile 
metals, low volatile metals, or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas emission 
standards under the conditions specified in paragraphs (m)(1) or (m)(2) 
of this section. The waiver provisions of this paragraph apply in 
addition to the provisions of Sec. 63.7(h).

[[Page 49]]

    (1) Emission standards based on exhaust gas flow rate. (i) You are 
deemed to be in compliance with an emission standard based on the 
volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas (i.e. [micro]g/dscm or ppmv) if the 
twelve-hour rolling average maximum theoretical emission concentration 
(MTEC) determined as specified below does not exceed the emission 
standard:

flowrate (either directly or by monitoring a surrogate parameter that 
you have correlated to gas flowrate);
    (C) Continuously calculate and record in the operating record the 
MTEC under the procedures of paragraph (m)(1)(i) of this section; and
    (D) Interlock the MTEC calculated in paragraph (m)(1)(i)(C) of this 
section to the AWFCO system to stop hazardous waste burning when the 
MTEC exceeds the emission standard.
    (iii) in lieu of the requirement in paragraphs (m)(1)(ii)(C) and (D) 
of this section, you may:
    (A) Identify in the Notification of Compliance a minimum gas 
flowrate limit and a maximum feedrate limit of mercury, semivolatile 
metals, low volatile metals, and/or total chlorine and chloride from all 
feedstreams that ensures the MTEC as calculated in paragraph 
(m)(1)(i)(C) of this section is below the applicable emission standard; 
and
    (B) Interlock the minimum gas flowrate limit and maximum feedrate 
limit of paragraph (m)(1)(iii)(A) of this section to the AWFCO system to

chloride feedrate exceeds the limits of paragraph (m)(1)(iii)(A) of this 
section.
    (2) Emission standards based on hazardous waste thermal 
concentration. (i) You are deemed to be in compliance with an emission 
standard specified on a hazardous waste thermal concentration basis 
(i.e., pounds emitted per million Btu of heat input) if the HAP thermal 
concentration in the waste feed does not exceed the allowable HAP 
thermal concentration emission rate.
    (ii) To document compliance with this provision, you must:
    (A) Monitor and record the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, 
low volatile metals, and total chlorine and chloride from all hazardous 
waste feedstreams in accordance with Sec. 63.1209(c);

waste feed;
    (C) Continuously calculate and record the thermal feed rate of all 
hazardous waste feedstreams by summing the products of each hazardous 
waste feed rate multiplied by the higher heating value of that hazardous 
waste;
    (D) Continuously calculate and record the total HAP thermal feed 
concentration for each constituent by dividing the HAP feedrate 
determined in paragraph (m)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by the thermal 
feed rate determined in paragraph (m)(2)(ii)(C) of this section for all 
hazardous waste feedstreams;
    (E) Interlock the HAP thermal feed concentration for each 
constituent with the AWFCO to stop hazardous waste feed when the thermal 
feed concentration exceeds the applicable thermal emission standard.
    (3) When you determine the feedrate of mercury, semivolatile metals, 
low volatile metals, or total chlorine and chloride for purposes of this 
provision, except as provided by paragraph (m)(4) of this section, you 
must assume that the analyte is present at the full detection limit when 
the feedstream analysis determines that the analyte in not detected in 
the feedstream.
    (4) Owners and operators of hazardous waste burning cement kilns and

[[Page 50]]

lightweight aggregate kilns may assume that mercury is present in raw 
material at half the detection limit when the raw material feedstream 
analysis determines that mercury is not detected.
    (5) You must state in the site-specific test plan that you submit 
for review and approval under paragraph (e) of this section that you 
intend to comply with the provisions of this paragraph. You must include 
in the test plan documentation that any surrogate that is proposed for 
gas flowrate adequately correlates with the gas flowrate.

after approval by the Administrator.
    (1) You may request approval to use Method 23 in the performance 
test plan required under Sec. 63.1207(e)(i) and (ii).
    (2) In determining whether to grant approval to use Method 23, the 
Administrator may consider factors including whether dioxin/furan were 
detected at levels substantially below the emission standard in previous 
testing, and whether previous Method 0023 analyses detected low levels 
of dioxin/furan in the front half of the sampling train.
    (3) Sources that emit carbonaceous particulate matter, such as coal-
fired boilers, and sources equipped with activated carbon injection, 
will be deemed not suitable for use of Method 23 unless you document 
that there would not be a significant improvement in quality assurance 
with Method 0023A.
    (ii) You must sample for a minimum of three hours, and you must 
collect a minimum sample volume of 2.5 dscm;
    (iii) You may assume that nondetects are present at zero 
concentration.

appendix to this subpart and Performance Specifications 1 (opacity), 4B 
(carbon monoxide and oxygen), and 8A (hydrocarbons) in appendix B, part 
60 of this chapter.
    (3) Carbon monoxide readings exceeding the span. (i) Except as 
provided by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if a carbon monoxide 
CEMS detects a response that results in a one-minute average at or above 
the 3,000 ppmv span level required by Performance Specification 4B in 
appendix B, part 60 of this chapter, the one-minute average must be 
recorded as 10,000 ppmv. The one-minute 10,000 ppmv value must be used 
for calculating the hourly rolling average carbon monoxide level.
    (ii) Carbon monoxide CEMS that use a span value of 10,000 ppmv when 
one-minute carbon monoxide levels are equal to or exceed 3,000 ppmv are 
not subject to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. Carbon monoxide CEMS 
that use a span value of 10,000 are subject to the same CEMS performance 
and equipment specifications when operating in the range of 3,000 ppmv 
to 10,000 ppmv that are provided by Performance Specification 4B for 
other carbon monoxide CEMS, except:
    (A) Calibration drift must be less than 300 ppmv; and
    (B) Calibration error must be less than 500 ppmv.
    (4) Hydrocarbon readings exceeding the span. (i) Except as provided 
by paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, if a hydrocarbon CEMS detects a 
response that results in a one-minute average at or above the 100 ppmv 
span level required by Performance Specification 8A in appendix B, part 
60 of this chapter, the one-minute average must be recorded as 500 ppmv. 
The one-minute 500 ppmv value must be used for calculating the hourly 
rolling average HC level.
    (ii) Hydrocarbon CEMS that use a span value of 500 ppmv when one-
minute hydrocarbon levels are equal to or exceed 100 ppmv are not 
subject to paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Hydrocarbon CEMS that 
use a span value of 500 ppmv are subject to the same CEMS performance 
and equipment specifications when operating in the range of 100 ppmv to 
500 ppmv that are provided by Performance Specification 8A for other 
hydrocarbon CEMS, except:
    (A) The zero and high-level calibration gas must have a hydrocarbon 
level of between 0 and 100 ppmv, and between 250 and 450 ppmv, 
respectively;
    (B) The strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder must be 
capable of recording all readings within the CEM measurement range and 
must have a resolution of 2.5 ppmv;
    (C) The CEMS calibration must not differ by more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>15 ppmv after each 24-hour period of the seven day test 
at both zero and high levels;
    (D) The calibration error must be no greater than 25 ppmv; and
    (E) The zero level, mid-level, and high level calibration gas used 
to determine calibration error must have a hydrocarbon level of 0-200 
ppmv, 150-200 ppmv, and 350-400 ppmv, respectively.
    (5) Petitions to use CEMS for other standards. You may petition the 
Administrator to use CEMS for compliance monitoring for particulate 
matter, mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, and hydrogen 
chloride and chlorine gas under Sec. 63.8(f) in lieu of compliance with 
the corresponding operating parameter limits under this section.
    (6) Calculation of rolling averages--(i) Calculation of rolling 
averages initially. The carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon CEMS must begin 
recording one-minute average values by 12:01 a.m. and hourly rolling 
average values by 1:01 a.m., when 60 one-minute values will be available 
for calculating the initial hourly rolling average for those sources 
that come into compliance on the regulatory compliance date. Sources 
that elect to come into compliance before the regulatory compliance date 
must begin recording one-minute and hourly rolling average values within 
60 seconds and 60 minutes (when 60 one-minute values will be available 
for calculating the initial hourly rolling average), respectively, from 
the time at which compliance begins.
    (ii) Calculation of rolling averages upon intermittent operations. 
You must ignore periods of time when one-minute values are not available 
for calculating the hourly rolling average. When one-

[[Page 54]]

minute values become available again, the first one-minute value is 
added to the previous 59 values to calculate the hourly rolling average.
    (iii) Calculation of rolling averages when the hazardous waste feed 
is cutoff. (A) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(6)(iii)(B) of this 
section, you must continue monitoring carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons 
when the hazardous waste feed is cutoff if the source is operating. You 
must not resume feeding hazardous waste if the emission levels exceed 
the standard.
    (B) You are not subject to the CEMS requirements of this subpart 
during periods of time you meet the requirements of Sec. 
63.1206(b)(1)(ii) (compliance with emissions standards for nonhazardous 
waste burning sources when you are not burning hazardous waste).
    (7) Operating parameter limits for hydrocarbons. If you elect to 
comply with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission standard by 
continuously monitoring carbon monoxide with a CEMS, you must 
demonstrate that hydrocarbon emissions during the comprehensive 
performance test do not exceed the hydrocarbon emissions standard. In 
addition, the limits you establish on the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) operating parameters required under paragraph (j) of 
this section also ensure that you maintain compliance with the 
hydrocarbon emission standard. If you do not conduct the hydrocarbon 
demonstration and DRE tests concurrently, you must establish separate 
operating parameter limits under paragraph (j) of this section based on 
each test and the more restrictive of the operating parameter limits 
applies.
    (b) Other continuous monitoring systems (CMS). (1) You must use CMS 
(e.g., thermocouples, pressure transducers, flow meters) to document 
compliance with the applicable operating parameter limits under this 
section.
    (2) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section, you must install and operate continuous monitoring systems 
other than CEMS in conformance with Sec. 63.8(c)(3) that requires you, 
at a minimum, to comply with the manufacturer's written specifications 
or recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the 
system:
    (i) Calibration of thermocouples and pyrometers. The calibration of 
thermocouples must be verified at a frequency and in a manner consistent 
with manufacturer specifications, but no less frequent than once per 
year. You must operate and maintain optical pyrometers in accordance 
with manufacturer specifications unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator. You must calibrate optical pyrometers in accordance with 
the frequency and procedures recommended by the manufacturer, but no 
less frequent than once per year, unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator. And,
    (ii) Accuracy and calibration of weight measurement devices for 
activated carbon injection systems. If you operate a carbon injection 
system, the accuracy of the weight measurement device must be <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq> 1 percent of the weight being measured. The calibration 
of the device must be verified at least once each calendar quarter at a 
frequency of approximately 120 days.
    (3) CMS must sample the regulated parameter without interruption, 
and evaluate the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and 
compute and record the average values at least every 60 seconds.
    (4) The span of the non-CEMS CMS detector must not be exceeded. You 
must interlock the span limits into the automatic waste feed cutoff 
system required by Sec. 63.1206(c)(3).
    (5) Calculation of rolling averages--(i) Calculation of rolling 
averages initially. Continuous monitoring systems must begin recording 
one-minute average values by 12:01 a.m., hourly rolling average values 
by 1:01 a.m.(e.g., when 60 one-minute values will be available for 
calculating the initial hourly rolling average), and twelve-hour rolling 
averages by 12:01 p.m.(e.g., when 720 one-minute averages are available 
to calculate a 12-hour rolling average), for those sources that come 
into compliance on the regulatory compliance date. Sources that elect to 
come into compliance before the regulatory compliance date must begin 
recording one-minute, hourly rolling average, and 12-hour rolling 
average values within 60 seconds, 60 minutes (when 60 one-

[[Page 55]]

minute values will be available for calculating the initial hourly 
rolling average), and 720 minutes (when 720 one-minute values will be 
available for calculating the initial 12-hour hourly rolling average) 
respectively, from the time at which compliance begins.
    (ii) Calculation of rolling averages upon intermittent operations. 
You must ignore periods of time when one-minute values are not available 
for calculating rolling averages. When one-minute values become 
available again, the first one-minute value is added to the previous 
one-minute values to calculate rolling averages.
    (iii) Calculation of rolling averages when the hazardous waste feed 
is cutoff. (A) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this 
section, you must continue monitoring operating parameter limits with a 
CMS when the hazardous waste feed is cutoff if the source is operating. 
You must not resume feeding hazardous waste if an operating parameter 
exceeds its limit.
    (B) You are not subject to the CMS requirements of this subpart 
during periods of time you meet the requirements of Sec. 
63.1206(b)(1)(ii) (compliance with emissions standards for nonhazardous 
waste burning sources when you are not burning hazardous waste).
    (c) Analysis of feedstreams--(1) General. Prior to feeding the 
material, you must obtain an analysis of each feedstream that is 
sufficient to document compliance with the applicable feedrate limits 
provided by this section.
    (2) Feedstream analysis plan. You must develop and implement a 
feedstream analysis plan and record it in the operating record. The plan 
must specify at a minimum:
    (i) The parameters for which you will analyze each feedstream to 
ensure compliance with the operating parameter limits of this section;
    (ii) Whether you will obtain the analysis by performing sampling and 
analysis or by other methods, such as using analytical information 
obtained from others or using other published or documented data or 
information;
    (iii) How you will use the analysis to document compliance with 
applicable feedrate limits (e.g., if you blend hazardous wastes and 
obtain analyses of the wastes prior to blending but not of the blended, 
as-fired, waste, the plan must describe how you will determine the 
pertinent parameters of the blended waste);
    (iv) The test methods which you will use to obtain the analyses;
    (v) The sampling method which you will use to obtain a 
representative sample of each feedstream to be analyzed using sampling 
methods described in appendix IX, part 266 of this chapter, or an 
equivalent method; and
    (vi) The frequency with which you will review or repeat the initial 
analysis of the feedstream to ensure that the analysis is accurate and 
up to date.
    (3) Review and approval of analysis plan. You must submit the 
feedstream analysis plan to the Administrator for review and approval, 
if requested.
    (4) Compliance with feedrate limits. To comply with the applicable 
feedrate limits of this section, you must monitor and record feedrates 
as follows:
    (i) Determine and record the value of the parameter for each 
feedstream by sampling and analysis or other method;
    (ii) Determine and record the mass or volume flowrate of each 
feedstream by a CMS. If you determine flowrate of a feedstream by 
volume, you must determine and record the density of the feedstream by 
sampling and analysis (unless you report the constituent concentration 
in units of weight per unit volume (e.g., mg/l)); and
    (iii) Calculate and record the mass feedrate of the parameter per 
unit time.
    (5) Waiver of monitoring of constituents in certain feedstreams. You 
are not required to monitor levels of metals or chlorine in the 
following feedstreams to document compliance with the feedrate limits 
under this section provided that you document in the comprehensive 
performance test plan the expected levels of the constituent in the 
feedstream and account for those assumed feedrate levels in documenting 
compliance with feedrate limits: natural gas, process air, and 
feedstreams from vapor recovery systems.
    (d) Performance evaluations. (1) The requirements of Sec. Sec. 
63.8(d) (Quality control program) and (e) (Performance evaluation of 
continuous monitoring

[[Page 56]]

systems) apply, except that you must conduct performance evaluations of 
components of the CMS under the frequency and procedures (for example, 
submittal of performance evaluation test plan for review and approval) 
applicable to performance tests as provided by Sec. 63.1207.
    (2) You must comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS 
prescribed in the appendix to this subpart.
    (e) Conduct of monitoring. The provisions of Sec. 63.8(b) apply.
    (f) Operation and maintenance of continuous monitoring systems. The 
provisions of Sec. 63.8(c) apply except:
    (1) Section 63.8(c)(3). The requirements of Sec. 63.1211(c), that 
requires CMSs to be installed, calibrated, and operational on the 
compliance date, shall be complied with instead of section 63.8(c)(3);
    (2) Section 63.8(c)(4)(ii). The performance specifications for 
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and oxygen CEMSs in subpart B, part 60 of 
this chapter that requires detectors to measure the sample concentration 
at least once every 15 seconds for calculating an average emission rate 
once every 60 seconds shall be complied with instead of section 
63.8(c)(4)(ii); and
    (3) Sections 63.8(c)(4)(i), (c)(5), and (c)(7)(i)(C) pertaining to 
COMS apply only to owners and operators of hazardous waste burning 
cement kilns.
    (g) Alternative monitoring requirements other than continuous 
emissions monitoring systems (CEMS)--(1) Requests to use alternatives to 
operating parameter monitoring requirements. (i) You may submit an 
application to the Administrator under this paragraph for approval of 
alternative operating parameter monitoring requirements to document 
compliance with the emission standards of this subpart. For requests to 
use additional CEMS, however, you must use paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section and Sec. 63.8(f). Alternative requests to operating parameter 
monitoring requirements that include unproven monitoring methods may not 
be made under this paragraph and must be made under Sec. 63.8(f).
    (ii) You may submit an application to waive an operating parameter 
limit specified in this section based on documentation that neither that 
operating parameter limit nor an alternative operating parameter limit 
is needed to ensure compliance with the emission standards of this 
subpart.
    (iii) You must comply with the following procedures for applications 
submitted under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:
    (A) Timing of the application. You must submit the application to 
the Administrator not later than with the comprehensive performance test 
plan.
    (B) Content of the application. You must include in the application:
    (1) Data or information justifying your request for an alternative 
monitoring requirement (or for a waiver of an operating parameter 
limit), such as the technical or economic infeasibility or the 
impracticality of using the required approach;
    (2) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring 
requirement, including the operating parameter to be monitored, the 
monitoring approach/technique (e.g., type of detector, monitoring 
location), the averaging period for the limit, and how the limit is to 
be calculated; and
    (3) Data or information documenting that the alternative monitoring 
requirement would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance 
with the relevant emission standard, or that it is the monitoring 
requirement that best assures compliance with the standard and that is 
technically and economically practicable.
    (C) Approval of request to use an alternative monitoring requirement 
or waive an operating parameter limit. The Administrator will notify you 
of approval or intention to deny approval of the request within 90 
calendar days after receipt of the original request and within 60 
calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that you 
submit. The Administrator will not approve an alternative monitoring 
request unless the alternative monitoring requirement provides 
equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission 
standard, or is the monitoring requirement that best assures compliance 
with the standard and that is technically and economically practicable. 
Before disapproving

[[Page 57]]

any request, the Administrator will notify you of the Administrator's 
intention to disapprove the request together with:
    (1) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended 
disapproval is based; and
    (2) Notice of opportunity for you to present additional information 
to the Administrator before final action on the request. At the time the 
Administrator notifies you of intention to disapprove the request, the 
Administrator will specify how much time you will have after being 
notified of the intended disapproval to submit the additional 
information.
    (D) Responsibility of owners and operators. You are responsible for 
ensuring that you submit any supplementary and additional information 
supporting your application in a timely manner to enable the 
Administrator to consider your application during review of the 
comprehensive performance test plan. Neither your submittal of an 
application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove 
the application, relieves you of the responsibility to comply with the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (iv) Dual standards that incorporate the interim standards for HAP 
metals--(A) Semivolatile and low volatile metals. You may petition the 
Administrator to waive a feedrate operating parameter limit under 
paragraph (n)(2) of this section for either the emission standards 
expressed in a thermal emissions format or the interim standards based 
on documentation that the feedrate operating parameter limit is not 
needed to ensure compliance with the relevant standard on a continuous 
basis.
    (B) Mercury. You may petition the Administrator to waive a feedrate 
operating parameter limit under paragraph (l)(1) of this section for 
either the feed concentration standard under Sec. Sec. 63.1220(a)(2)(i) 
and (b)(2)(i) or the interim standards based on documentation that the 
feedrate operating parameter limit is not needed to ensure compliance 
with the relevant standard on a continuous basis.
    (2) Administrator's discretion to specify additional or alternative 
requirements. The Administrator may determine on a case-by-case basis at 
any time (e.g., during review of the comprehensive performance test 
plan, during compliance certification review) that you may need to limit 
additional or alternative operating parameters (e.g., opacity in 
addition to or in lieu of operating parameter limits on the particulate 
matter control device) or that alternative approaches to establish 
limits on operating parameters may be necessary to document compliance 
with the emission standards of this subpart.
    (h) Reduction of monitoring data. The provisions of Sec. 63.8(g) 
apply.
    (i) When an operating parameter is applicable to multiple standards. 
Paragraphs (j) through (p) of this section require you to establish 
limits on operating parameters based on comprehensive performance 
testing to ensure you maintain compliance with the emission standards of 
this subpart. For several parameters, you must establish a limit for the 
parameter to ensure compliance with more than one emission standard. An 
example is a limit on minimum combustion chamber temperature to ensure 
compliance with both the DRE standard of paragraph (j) of this section 
and the dioxin/furan standard of paragraph (k) of this section. If the 
performance tests for such standards are not performed simultaneously, 
the most stringent limit for a parameter derived from independent 
performance tests applies.
    (j) DRE. To remain in compliance with the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) standard, you must establish operating limits during 
the comprehensive performance test (or during a previous DRE test under 
provisions of Sec. 63.1206(b)(7)) for the following parameters, unless 
the limits are based on manufacturer specifications, and comply with 
those limits at all times that hazardous waste remains in the combustion 
chamber (i.e., the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired 
since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated):
    (1) Minimum combustion chamber temperature. (i) You must measure the 
temperature of each combustion chamber at a location that best 
represents, as practicable, the bulk gas temperature in the combustion 
zone. You must

[[Page 58]]

submit under Sec. 63.1207(e);
    (ii) You must establish a minimum hourly rolling average limit as 
the average of the test run averages;
    (2) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish and comply with a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the 
maximum production rate, or another parameter that you document in the 
site-specific test plan as an appropriate surrogate for gas residence 
time, as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each 
run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis;
    (3) Maximum hazardous waste feedrate. (i) You must establish limits 
on the maximum pumpable and total (i.e., pumpable and nonpumpable) 
hazardous waste feedrate for each location where hazardous waste is fed.
    (ii) You must establish the limits as the average of the maximum 
hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (iii) You must comply with the feedrate limit(s) on a hourly rolling 
average basis;
    (4) Operation of waste firing system. You must specify operating 
parameters and limits to ensure that good operation of each hazardous 
waste firing system is maintained.
    (k) Dioxins and furans. You must comply with the dioxin and furans 
emission standard by establishing and complying with the following 
operating parameter limits. You must base the limits on operations 
during the comprehensive performance test, unless the limits are based 
on manufacturer specifications.
    (1) Gas temperature at the inlet to a dry particulate matter control 
device. (i) For sources other than a lightweight aggregate kiln, if the 
combustor is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator, baghouse 
(fabric filter), or other dry emissions control device where particulate 
matter is suspended in contact with combustion gas, you must establish a 
limit on the maximum temperature of the gas at the inlet to the device 
on an hourly rolling average. You must establish the hourly rolling 
average limit as the average of the test run averages.
    (ii) For hazardous waste burning lightweight aggregate kilns, you 
must establish a limit on the maximum temperature of the gas at the exit 
of the (last) combustion chamber (or exit of any waste heat recovery 
system) on an hourly rolling average. The limit must be established as 
the average of the test run averages;
    (2) Minimum combustion chamber temperature. (i) For sources other 
than cement kilns, you must measure the temperature of each combustion 
chamber at a location that best represents, as practicable, the bulk gas 
temperature in the combustion zone. You must document the temperature 
measurement location in the test plan you submit under Sec. Sec. 
63.1207(e) and (f);
    (ii) You must establish a minimum hourly rolling average limit as 
the average of the test run averages.
    (3) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish and comply with a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the 
maximum production rate, or another parameter that you document in the 
site-specific test plan as an appropriate surrogate for gas residence 
time, as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each 
run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis;
    (4) Maximum hazardous waste feedrate. (i) You must establish limits 
on the maximum pumpable and total (pumpable and nonpumpable) hazardous

the test run averages. If your carbon injection system injects carbon at 
more than one location, you must establish a carbon feedrate limit for 
each location.
    (ii) Carrier fluid. You must establish a limit on minimum carrier 
fluid (gas or liquid) flowrate or pressure drop as an hourly rolling 
average based on the manufacturer's specifications. You must document 
the specifications in the test plan you submit under Sec. Sec. 
63.1207(e) and (f);
    (iii) Carbon specification. (A) You must specify and use the brand 
(i.e., manufacturer) and type of carbon used during the comprehensive 
performance test until a subsequent comprehensive performance test is 
conducted, unless you document in the site-specific performance test 
plan required under Sec. Sec. 63.1207(e) and (f) key parameters that 
affect adsorption and establish limits on those parameters based on the 
carbon used in the performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
carbon provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the carbon used in the performance test and 
conforms to the key sorbent parameters you identify under paragraph 
(k)(6)(iii)(A) of this section. You must include in the operating record 
documentation that the substitute carbon will provide the same level of 
control as the original carbon.
    (7) Carbon bed parameter limits. If your combustor is equipped with 
a carbon bed system:
    (i) Monitoring bed life. You must:
    (A) Monitor performance of the carbon bed consistent with 
manufacturer's specifications and recommendations to ensure the carbon 
bed (or bed segment for sources with multiple segments) has not reached 
the end of its useful life to minimize dioxin/furan and mercury 
emissions at least to the levels required by the emission standards;
    (B) Document the monitoring procedures in the operation and 
maintenance plan;
    (C) Record results of the performance monitoring in the operating 
record; and
    (D) Replace the bed or bed segment before it has reached the end of 
its useful life to minimize dioxin/furan and mercury emissions at least 
to the levels required by the emission standards.
    (ii) Carbon specification. (A) You must specify and use the brand 
(i.e., manufacturer) and type of carbon used during the comprehensive 
performance test until a subsequent comprehensive performance test is 
conducted, unless you document in the site-specific performance test 
plan required under Sec. Sec. 63.1207(e) and (f) key parameters that 
affect adsorption and establish limits on those parameters based on the 
carbon used in the performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
carbon provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the carbon used in the performance test. You must 
include in the operating record documentation that the substitute carbon 
will provide an equivalent or improved level of control as the original 
carbon.
    (iii) Maximum temperature. You must measure the temperature of the 
carbon bed at either the bed inlet or exit and you must establish a 
maximum temperature limit on an hourly rolling average as the average of 
the test run averages.
    (8) Catalytic oxidizer parameter limits. If your combustor is 
equipped with a catalytic oxidizer, you must establish limits on the 
following parameters:
    (i) Minimum flue gas temperature at the entrance of the catalyst. 
You must establish a limit on minimum flue gas temperature at the 
entrance of the catalyst on an hourly rolling average as the average of 
the test run averages.
    (ii) Maximum time in-use. You must replace a catalytic oxidizer with 
a new catalytic oxidizer when it has reached the maximum service time 
specified by the manufacturer.
    (iii) Catalyst replacement specifications. When you replace a 
catalyst with a new one, the new catalyst must be equivalent to or 
better than the one used during the previous comprehensive test, as 
measured by:

[[Page 60]]

    (A) Catalytic metal loading for each metal;
    (B) Space time, expressed in the units s<SUP>-1</SUP>, the maximum 
rated volumetric flow of combustion gas through the catalyst divided by 
the volume of the catalyst; and
    (C) Substrate construction, including materials of construction, 
washcoat type, and pore density.
    (iv) Maximum flue gas temperature. You must establish a maximum flue 
gas temperature limit at the entrance of the catalyst as an hourly 
rolling average, based on manufacturer's specifications.
    (9) Inhibitor feedrate parameter limits. If you feed a dioxin/furan 
inhibitor into the combustion system, you must establish limits for the 
following parameters:
    (i) Minimum inhibitor feedrate. You must establish a limit on 
minimum inhibitor feedrate on an hourly rolling average as the average 
of the test run averages.
    (ii) Inhibitor specifications. (A) You must specify and use the 
brand (i.e., manufacturer) and type of inhibitor used during the 
comprehensive performance test until a subsequent comprehensive 
performance test is conducted, unless you document in the site-specific 
performance test plan required under Sec. Sec. 63.1207(e) and (f) key 
parameters that affect the effectiveness of the inhibitor and establish 
limits on those parameters based on the inhibitor used in the 
performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
inhibitor provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the inhibitor used in the performance test and 
conforms to the key parameters you identify under paragraph 
(k)(9)(ii)(A) of this section. You must include in the operating record 
documentation that the substitute inhibitor will provide the same level 
of control as the original inhibitor.
    (l) Mercury. You must comply with the mercury emission standard by 
establishing and complying with the following operating parameter 
limits. You must base the limits on operations during the comprehensive 
performance test, unless the limits are based on manufacturer 
specifications.
    (1) Feedrate of mercury. (i) For incinerators and solid fuel 
boilers, when complying with the mercury emission standards under 
Sec. Sec. 63.1203, 63.1216 and 63.1219, you must establish a 12-hour 
rolling average limit for the total feedrate of mercury in all 
feedstreams as the average of the test run averages.
    (ii) For liquid fuel boilers, when complying with the mercury 
emission standards of Sec. 63.1217, you must establish a rolling 
average limit for the mercury feedrate as follows on an averaging period 
not to exceed an annual rolling average:
    (A) You must calculate a mercury system removal efficiency for each 
test run and calculate the average system removal efficiency of the test 
run averages. If emissions exceed the mercury emission standard during 
the comprehensive performance test, it is not a violation because the 
averaging period for the mercury emission standard is (not-to-exceed) 
one year and compliance is based on compliance with the mercury feedrate 
limit with an averaging period not-to-exceed one year.
    (B) If you burn hazardous waste with a heating value of 10,000 Btu/
lb or greater, you must calculate the mercury feedrate limit as follows:
    (1) The mercury feedrate limit is the emission standard divided by 
[1 - system removal efficiency].
    (2) The mercury feedrate limit is a hazardous waste thermal 
concentration limit expressed as pounds of mercury in hazardous waste 
feedstreams per million Btu of hazardous waste fired.
    (3) You must comply with the hazardous waste mercury thermal 
concentration limit by determining the feedrate of mercury in all 
hazardous waste feedstreams (lb/hr) at least once a minute and the 
hazardous waste thermal feedrate (MM Btu/hr) at least once a minute to 
calculate a 60-minute average thermal emission concentration as 
[hazardous waste mercury feedrate (lb/hr) / hazardous waste thermal 
feedrate (MM Btu/hr)].
    (4) You must calculate a rolling average hazardous waste mercury 
thermal concentration that is updated each hour.
    (5) If you select an averaging period for the feedrate limit that is 
greater than a 12-hour rolling average, you

[[Page 61]]

must calculate the initial rolling average as though you had selected a 
12-hour rolling average, as provided by paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this 
section. Thereafter, you must calculate rolling averages using either 
one-minute or one-hour updates. Hourly updates shall be calculated using 
the average of the one-minute average data for the preceding hour. For 
the period beginning with initial operation under this standard until 
the source has operated for the full averaging period that you select, 
the average feedrate shall be based only on actual operation under this 
standard.
    (C) If you burn hazardous waste with a heating value of less than 
10,000 Btu/lb, you must calculate the mercury feedrate limit as follows:

emission standard divided by [1 - System Removal Efficiency].
    (2) The feedrate limit is expressed as a mass concentration per unit 
volume of stack gas ([micro]gm/dscm) and is converted to a mass feedrate 
(lb/hr) by multiplying it by the average stack gas flowrate of the test 
run averages.
    (3) You must comply with the feedrate limit by determining the 
mercury feedrate (lb/hr) at least once a minute to calculate a 60-minute 
average feedrate.
    (4) You must update the rolling average feedrate each hour with this 
60-minute feedrate measurement.
    (5) If you select an averaging period for the feedrate limit that is 
greater than a 12-hour rolling average, you must calculate the initial 
rolling average as though you had selected a 12-hour rolling average, as 
provided by paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. Thereafter, you must 
calculate rolling averages using either one-minute or one-hour updates. 
Hourly updates shall be calculated using the average of the one-minute 
average data for the preceding hour. For the period beginning with 
initial operation under this standard until the source has operated for 
the full averaging period that you select, the average feedrate shall be 
based only on actual operation under this standard.
    (D) If your boiler is equipped with a wet scrubber, you must comply 
with the following unless you document in the performance test plan that 
you do not feed chlorine at rates that may substantially affect the 
system removal efficiency of mercury for purposes of establishing a 
mercury feedrate limit based on the system removal efficiency during the 
test:
    (1) Scrubber blowdown must be minimized during a pretest 
conditioning period and during the performance test:
    (2) Scrubber water must be preconditioned so that mercury in the

63.1204 and 63.1220(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (b)(2)(ii)(A), you must establish a 
12-hour rolling average limit for the feedrate of mercury in all 
feedstreams as the average of the test run averages;

plan under Sec. Sec. 63.7(b) and (c) and Sec. Sec. 63.1207 (e) and (f) 
to use the mercury feedrates and associated emission rates during the 
comprehensive performance test to extrapolate to higher allowable 
feedrate limits and emission rates. The extrapolation methodology will 
be reviewed and approved, as warranted, by the Administrator. The review 
will consider in particular whether:
    (A) Performance test metal feedrates are appropriate (i.e., whether 
feedrates are at least at normal levels; depending on the heterogeneity 
of the waste, whether some level of spiking would be appropriate; and 
whether the physical form and species of spiked material is 
appropriate); and
    (B) Whether the extrapolated feedrates you request are warranted

[[Page 63]]

considering historical metal feedrate data.
    (2) Wet scrubber. If your combustor is equipped with a wet scrubber, 
you must establish operating parameter limits prescribed by paragraph 
(o)(3) of this section, except for paragraph (o)(3)(iv).

wet scrubber on an hourly rolling average, established as the average of 
the test run averages;
    (B) For all wet scrubbers:
    (1) To ensure that the solids content of the scrubber liquid does 
not exceed levels during the performance test, you must either:
    (i) Establish a limit on solids content of the scrubber liquid using 
a CMS or by manual sampling and analysis. If you elect to monitor solids 
content manually, you must sample and analyze the scrubber liquid hourly 
unless you support an alternative monitoring frequency in the 
performance test plan that you submit for review and approval; or
    (ii) Establish a minimum blowdown rate using a CMS and either a 
minimum scrubber tank volume or liquid level using a CMS.

either the minimum liquid to gas ratio or the minimum scrubber water 
flowrate and maximum flue gas flowrate on an hourly rolling average. If 
you establish limits on maximum flue gas flowrate under this paragraph, 
you need not establish a limit on maximum flue gas flowrate under 
paragraph (m)(2) of this section. You must establish these hourly 
rolling average limits as the average of the test run averages; and
    (ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) Other particulate matter control devices. For each particulate 
matter control device that is not a fabric filter or high energy wet 
scrubber, or is not an electrostatic precipitator or ionizing wet 
scrubber for which you elect to monitor particulate matter loadings 
under Sec. 63.1206(c)(9) of this chapter for process control, you must 
ensure that the control device is properly operated and maintained as 
required by Sec. 63.1206(c)(7) and by monitoring the operation of the 
control device as follows:
    (A) During each comprehensive performance test conducted to 
demonstrate compliance with the particulate matter emissions standard, 
you must establish a range of operating values for the control device 
that is a

[[Page 64]]

representative and reliable indicator that the control device is 
operating within the same range of conditions as during the performance 
test. You must establish this range of operating values as follows:
    (1) You must select a set of operating parameters appropriate for 
the control device design that you determine to be a representative and 
reliable indicator of the control device performance.
    (2) You must measure and record values for each of the selected 
operating parameters during each test run of the performance test. A 
value for each selected parameter must be recorded using a continuous 
monitor.
    (3) For each selected operating parameter measured in accordance 
with the requirements of paragraph (m)(1)(iv)(A)(1) of this section, you 
must establish a minimum operating parameter limit or a maximum 
operating parameter limit, as appropriate for the parameter, to define 
the operating limits within which the control device can operate and 
still continuously achieve the same operating conditions as during the 
performance test.
    (4) You must prepare written documentation to support the operating 
parameter limits established for the control device and you must include 
this documentation in the performance test plan that you submit for 
review and approval. This documentation must include a description for 
each selected parameter and the operating range and monitoring frequency 
required to ensure the control device is being properly operated and 
maintained.
    (B) You must install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a monitoring 
device equipped with a recorder to measure the values for each operating 
parameter selected in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 
(m)(1)(iv)(A)(1) of this section. You must install, calibrate, and 
maintain the monitoring equipment in accordance with the equipment 
manufacturer's specifications. The recorder must record the detector 
responses at least every 60 seconds, as required in the definition of 
continuous monitor.
    (C) You must regularly inspect the data recorded by the operating 
parameter monitoring system at a sufficient frequency to ensure the 
control device is operating properly. An excursion is determined to have 
occurred any time that the actual value of a selected operating 
parameter is less than the minimum operating limit (or, if applicable, 
greater than the maximum operating limit) established for the parameter 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (m)(1)(iv)(A)(3) of 
this section.
    (D) Operating parameters selected in accordance with paragraph 
(m)(1)(iv) of this section may be based on manufacturer specifications 
provided you support the use of manufacturer specifications in the 
performance test plan that you submit for review and approval.
    (2) Maximum flue gas flowrate or production rate. (i) As an 
indicator of gas residence time in the control device, you must 
establish a limit on the maximum flue gas flowrate, the maximum 
production rate, or another parameter that you document in the site-

as the average of the maximum hourly rolling averages for each run.
    (ii) You must comply with this limit on a hourly rolling average 
basis;
    (3) Maximum ash feedrate. Owners and operators of hazardous waste 
incinerators, solid fuel boilers, and liquid fuel boilers must establish 
a maximum ash feedrate limit as a 12-hour rolling average based on the 
average of the test run averages. This requirement is waived, however, 
if you comply with the particulate matter detection system requirements 
under Sec. 63.1206(c)(9).

[[Page 65]]

basis as the average of the test run averages.

General. You must establish feedrate limits for semivolatile metals 
(cadmium and lead) and low volatile metals (arsenic, beryllium, and 
chromium) as follows, except as provided by paragraph (n)(2)(vii) of 
this section.
    (ii) For incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate 
kilns, when complying with the emission standards under Sec. Sec. 
63.1203, 63.1204, 63.1205, and 63.1219, and for solid fuel boilers when 
complying with the emission standards under Sec. 63.1216, you must

and (b)(4)(i), you must establish 12-hour rolling average feedrate 
limits for semivolatile and low volatile metals as the thermal 
concentration of semivolatile metals or low volatile metals in all 
hazardous waste feedstreams. You must calculate hazardous waste thermal 
concentrations for semivolatile metals and low volatile metals for each 
run as the total mass feedrate of semivolatile metals or low volatile 
metals for all hazardous waste feedstreams divided by the total heat 
input rate for all hazardous waste feedstreams. The 12-hour rolling 
average feedrate limits for semivolatile metals and low volatile metals 
are the average of the test run averages, calculated on a thermal 
concentration basis, for all hazardous waste feeds.

metals. You must establish a rolling average limit for the semivolatile 
metal feedrate as follows on an averaging period not to exceed an annual 
rolling average.
    (1) System removal efficiency. You must calculate a semivolatile 
metal system removal efficiency for each test run and calculate the 
average system removal efficiency of the test run averages. If emissions 
exceed the semivolatile metal emission standard during the comprehensive 
performance test, it is not a violation because the averaging period for 
the semivolatile metal emission standard is one year and compliance is 
based on compliance with the semivolatile metal feedrate limit that has 
an averaging period not to exceed an annual rolling average.
    (2) Boilers that feed hazardous waste with a heating value of 10,000 
Btu/lb or greater. You must calculate the semivolatile metal feedrate

feedstreams per million Btu of hazardous waste fed to the boiler.
    (ii) You must comply with the hazardous waste semivolatile metal 
thermal concentration limit by determining the feedrate of semivolatile

thermal feedrate (MM Btu/hr) at least once a minute to calculate a 60-
minute average thermal emission concentration as [hazardous waste 
semivolatile metal feedrate (lb/hr) /

[[Page 66]]

hazardous waste thermal feedrate (MM Btu/hr)].
    (iii) You must calculate a rolling average hazardous waste 
semivolatile metal thermal concentration that is updated each hour.
    (iv) If you select an averaging period for the feedrate limit that 
is greater than a 12-hour rolling average, you must calculate the 
initial rolling average as though you had selected a 12-hour rolling 
average, as provided by paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. Thereafter, 
you must calculate rolling averages using either one-minute or one-hour 
updates. Hourly updates shall be calculated using the average of the 
one-minute average data for the preceding hour. For the period beginning 
with initial operation under this standard until the source has operated 
for the full averaging period that you select, the average feedrate 
shall be based only on actual operation under this standard.
    (3) Boilers that feed hazardous waste with a heating value less than 
10,000 Btu/lb. (i) You must calculate the semivolatile metal feedrate 
limit as the semivolatile metal emission standard divided by [1 - System 
Removal Efficiency].
    (ii) The feedrate limit is expressed as a mass concentration per 
unit volume of stack gas ([micro]gm/dscm) and is converted to a mass 
feedrate (lb/hr) by multiplying it by the average stack gas flowrate

    (iii) You must comply with the feedrate limit by determining the 
semivolatile metal feedrate (lb/hr) at least once a minute to calculate 
a 60-minute average feedrate.

this 60-minute feedrate measurement.
    (v) If you select an averaging period for the feedrate limit that is 
greater than a 12-hour rolling average, you must calculate the initial 
rolling average as though you had selected a 12-hour rolling average, as 
provided by paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. Thereafter, you must 
calculate rolling averages using either one-minute or one-hour updates. 
Hourly updates shall be calculated using the average of the one-minute 
average data for the preceding hour. For the period beginning with 
initial operation under this standard until the source has operated for 
the full averaging period that you select, the average feedrate shall be 
based only on actual operation under this standard.
    (B) Chromium--(1) Boilers that feed hazardous waste with a heating 
value of 10,000 Btu/lb or greater. (i) The 12-hour rolling average 
feedrate limit is a hazardous waste thermal concentration limit 
expressed as pounds of chromium in all hazardous waste feedstreams per 
million Btu of hazardous waste fed to the boiler. You must establish the 
12-hour rolling average feedrate limit as the average of the test run 
averages.
    (ii) You must comply with the hazardous waste chromium thermal 
concentration limit by determining the feedrate of chromium in all 
hazardous waste feedstreams (lb/hr) and the hazardous waste thermal

the procedures prescribed above for total low volatile metals. Dual 
feedrate limits for both pumpable and total feedstreams are not 
required, however, if you base the total feedrate limit solely on the 
feedrate of pumpable feedstreams.
    (vii) Extrapolation of feedrate levels. In lieu of establishing 
feedrate limits as specified in paragraphs (n)(2)(ii) through (vi) of 
this section, you may request as part of the performance test plan under 
Sec. Sec. 63.7(b) and (c) and Sec. Sec. 63.1207(e) and (f) to use the 
semivolatile metal and low volatile metal feedrates and associated 
emission rates during the comprehensive performance test to extrapolate 
to higher allowable feedrate limits and emission rates. The 
extrapolation

[[Page 67]]

methodology will be reviewed and approved, as warranted, by the 
Administrator. The review will consider in particular whether:
    (A) Performance test metal feedrates are appropriate (i.e., whether 
feedrates are at least at normal levels; depending on the heterogeneity

scrubber based on manufacturer's specifications. You must comply with 
the limit on an hourly rolling average;
    (iv) You must establish a limit on minimum pH on an hourly rolling 
average as the average of the test run averages;
    (v) You must establish limits on either the minimum liquid to gas 
ratio or the minimum scrubber water flowrate and maximum flue gas 
flowrate on an hourly rolling average as the average of the test run 
averages. If you establish limits on maximum flue gas flowrate under 
this paragraph, you need not establish a limit on maximum flue gas 
flowrate under paragraph (o)(2) of this section; and
    (4) Dry scrubber. If your combustor is equipped with a dry scrubber, 
you must establish the following operating parameter limits:
    (i) Minimum sorbent feedrate. You must establish a limit on minimum 
sorbent feedrate on an hourly rolling average as the average of the test 
run averages.
    (ii) Minimum carrier fluid flowrate or nozzle pressure drop. You 
must establish a limit on minimum carrier fluid (gas or liquid) flowrate 
or nozzle pressure drop based on manufacturer's specifications.
    (iii) Sorbent specifications. (A) You must specify and use the brand 
(i.e., manufacturer) and type of sorbent used during the comprehensive 
performance test until a subsequent comprehensive performance test is 
conducted, unless you document in the site-specific performance test 
plan required under Sec. Sec. 63.1207(e) and (f) key parameters that 
affect adsorption and establish limits on those parameters based on the 
sorbent used in the performance test.
    (B) You may substitute at any time a different brand or type of 
sorbent provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved 
properties compared to the sorbent used in the performance test and 
conforms to the key sorbent parameters you identify under paragraph 
(o)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. You must record in the operating record 
documentation that the substitute sorbent will provide the same level of 
control as the original sorbent.
    (p) Maximum combustion chamber pressure. If you comply with the 
requirements for combustion system leaks under Sec. 63.1206(c)(5) by 
maintaining the maximum combustion chamber zone pressure lower than 
ambient pressure to prevent combustion systems leaks from hazardous 
waste combustion, you must perform instantaneous monitoring of pressure 
and the automatic waste feed cutoff system must be engaged when negative 
pressure is not adequately maintained.
    (q) Operating under different modes of operation. If you operate 
under different modes of operation, you must establish operating 
parameter limits for each mode. You must document in the operating 
record when you change a mode of operation and begin complying with the 
operating limits for an alternative mode of operation.
    (1) Operating under otherwise applicable standards after the 
hazardous waste residence time has transpired. As provided by Sec. 
63.1206(b)(1)(ii), you may operate under otherwise applicable 
requirements promulgated under sections 112 and 129 of the Clean Air Act 
in lieu of the substantive requirements of this subpart.
    (i) The otherwise applicable requirements promulgated under sections 
112 and 129 of the Clean Air Act are applicable requirements under this 
subpart.
    (ii) You must specify (e.g., by reference) the otherwise applicable 
requirements as a mode of operation in your Documentation of Compliance 
under Sec. 63.1211(c), your Notification of Compliance under Sec. 
63.1207(j), and your

[[Page 69]]

title V permit application. These requirements include the otherwise 
applicable requirements governing emission standards, monitoring and 
compliance, and notification, reporting, and recordkeeping.
    (2) Calculating rolling averages under different modes of operation. 
When you transition to a different mode of operation, you must calculate 
rolling averages as follows:
    (i) Retrieval approach. Calculate rolling averages anew using the 
continuous monitoring system values previously recorded for that mode of 
operation (i.e., you ignore continuous monitoring system values 
subsequently recorded under other modes of operation when you transition 
back to a mode of operation); or
    (ii) Start anew. Calculate rolling averages anew without considering 
previous recordings.
    (A) Rolling averages must be calculated as the average of the 
available one-minute values for the parameter until enough one-minute 
values are available to calculate hourly or 12-hour rolling averages, 
whichever is applicable to the parameter.
    (B) You may not transition to a new mode of operation using this 
approach if the most recent operation in that mode resulted in an 
exceedance of an applicable emission standard measured with a CEMS or 
operating parameter limit prior to the hazardous waste residence time 
expiring; or
    (iii) Seamless transition. Continue calculating rolling averages 
using data from the previous operating mode provided that both the 
operating limit and the averaging period for the parameter are the same 
for both modes of operation.
    (r) Averaging periods. The averaging periods specified in this 
section for operating parameters are not-to-exceed averaging periods. 
You may elect to use shorter averaging periods. For example, you may 
elect to use a 1-hour rolling average rather than the 12-hour rolling 
average specified in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section for mercury.

    (ii) Based on an engineering evaluation prepared under your 
direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to ensure 
that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information 
and supporting documentation, and considering at a minimum the design, 
operation, and maintenance characteristics of the combustor and 
emissions control equipment, the types, quantities, and characteristics 
of feedstreams, and available emissions data:
    (A) You are in compliance with the emission standards of this 
subpart; and
    (B) The limits on the operating parameters under Sec. 63.1209 
ensure compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.
    (4) You must comply with the emission standards and operating 
parameter limits specified in the Documentation of Compliance.
    (d) Data compression. You may submit a written request to the 
Administrator for approval to use data compression techniques to record 
data from CMS, including CEMS, on a frequency less than that required by 
Sec. 63.1209. You must submit the request for review and approval as 
part of the comprehensive performance test plan.
    (1) You must record a data value at least once each ten minutes.
    (2) For each CEMS or operating parameter for which you request to 
use data compression techniques, you must recommend:
    (i) A fluctuation limit that defines the maximum permissible 
deviation of a new data value from a previously generated value without 
requiring you to revert to recording each one-minute value.
    (A) If you exceed a fluctuation limit, you must record each one-
minute value for a period of time not less than ten minutes.
    (B) If neither the fluctuation limit nor the data compression limit 
are exceeded during that period of time, you may reinitiate recording 
data values on a frequency of at least once each ten minutes; and
    (ii) A data compression limit defined as the closest level to an 
operating parameter limit or emission standard at which reduced data 
recording is allowed.
    (A) Within this level and the operating parameter limit or emission 
standard, you must record each one-minute average.
    (B) The data compression limit should reflect a level at which you 
are unlikely to exceed the specific operating parameter limit or 
emission standard, considering its averaging period, with the addition 
of a new one-minute average.

Sec. 63.1215  What are the health-based compliance alternatives for total 

chlorine?

    (a) General--(1) Overview. You may establish and comply with health-
based compliance alternatives for total chlorine under the procedures 
prescribed in this section for your hazardous waste combustors other 
than hydrochloric acid production furnaces. You may

[[Page 77]]

comply with these health-based compliance alternatives in lieu of the 
emission standards for total chlorine provided under Sec. Sec. 63.1216, 
63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221. To identify and comply with the 
limits, you must:
    (i) Identify a total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv) 
expressed as chloride (Cl(-)) equivalent for each on site hazardous 
waste combustor. You may select total chlorine emission concentrations 
as you choose to demonstrate eligibility for the risk-based limits under 
this section, except as provided by paragraph (b)(7) of this section;
    (ii) Apportion the total chlorine emission concentration between HCl 
and Cl<INF>2</INF> according to paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, and 
calculate HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> emission rates (lb/hr) using the gas 
flowrate and other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance 
test.
    (iii) Calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate as 
prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (iv) Perform an eligibility demonstration to determine if your HCl-
equivalent emission rate meets the national exposure standard and thus 
is below the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, as 
prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section;
    (v) Submit your eligibility demonstration for review and approval, 
as prescribed by paragraph (e) of this section, which must include 
information to ensure that the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate limit is not exceeded, as prescribed by paragraph (d) of this 
section;
    (vi) Demonstrate compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit during the comprehensive performance test, as 
prescribed by the testing and monitoring requirements under paragraph 
(e) of this section;
    (vii) Comply with compliance monitoring requirements, including 
establishing feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride, and 
operating parameter limits on emission control equipment, as prescribed 
by paragraph (f) of this section; and
    (viii) Comply with the requirements for changes, as prescribed by 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) Definitions. In addition to the definitions under Sec. 63.1201, 
the following definitions apply to this section:
    1-Hour Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate means the HCl-equivalent 
emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of chlorine to 
HCl using aRELs as the health risk metric for acute exposure.
    1-Hour Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate Limit means the HCl-
equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of 
chlorine to HCl using aRELs as the health risk metric for acute exposure 
and which ensures that maximum 1-hour average ambient concentrations of 
HCl-equivalents do not exceed a Hazard Index of 1.0, rounded to the 
nearest tenths decimal place (0.1), at an off-site receptor location.
    Acute Reference Exposure Level (aREL) means health thresholds below 
which there would be no adverse health effects for greater than once in 
a lifetime exposures of one hour. ARELs are developed by the California 
Office of Health Hazard Assessment and are available at http://
www.oehha.ca.gov/air/acute--rels/acuterel.html.
    Annual Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate means the HCl-equivalent 
emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of chlorine to 
HCl using RfCs as the health risk metric for long-term exposure.
    Annual Average HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate Limit means the HCl-
equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) determined by equating the toxicity of 
chlorine to HCl using RfCs as the health risk metric for long-term 
exposure and which ensures that maximum annual average ambient 
concentrations of HCl equivalents do not exceed a Hazard Index of 1.0, 
rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1), at an off-site 
receptor location.
    Hazard Index (HI) means the sum of more than one Hazard Quotient for 
multiple substances and/or multiple exposure pathways. In this section, 
the Hazard Index is the sum of the Hazard Quotients for HCl and 
chlorine.
    Hazard Quotient (HQ) means the ratio of the predicted media 
concentration of

[[Page 78]]

a pollutant to the media concentration at which no adverse effects are 
expected. For chronic inhalation exposures, the HQ is calculated under 
this section as the air concentration divided by the RfC. For acute 
inhalation exposures, the HQ is calculated under this section as the air 
concentration divided by the aREL.
    Look-up table analysis means a risk screening analysis based on 
comparing the HCl-equivalent emission rate from the affected source to 
the appropriate HCl-equivalent emission rate limit specified in Tables 1 
through 4 of this section.
    Reference Concentration (RfC) means an estimate (with uncertainty 
spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation 
exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is 
likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a 
lifetime. It can be derived from various types of human or animal data, 
with uncertainty factors generally applied to reflect limitations of the 
data used.
    (b) HCl-equivalent emission rates. (1) You must express total 
chlorine emission rates for each hazardous waste combustor as HCl-
equivalent emission rates.
    (2) Annual average rates. You must calculate annual average 
toxicity-weighted HCl-equivalent emission rates for each combustor as 
follows:

ER<INF>LTtw</INF> = ER<INF>HCl</INF> + ER<INF>Cl</INF>2 x 
(RfC<INF>HCl</INF>/RfC<INF>Cl</INF>2)

Where:

ER<INF>LTtw</INF> is the annual average HCl toxicity-weighted emission 
rate (HCl-equivalent emission rate) considering long-term exposures, lb/
hr
ER<INF>HCl</INF> is the emission rate of HCl in lbs/hr
ER<INF>Cl</INF>2 is the emission rate of chlorine in lbs/hr
RfC<INF>HCl</INF> is the reference concentration of HCl
RfC<INF>Cl</INF>2 is the reference concentration of chlorine

    (3) 1-hour average rates. You must calculate 1-hour average 
toxicity-weighted HCl-equivalent emission rates for each combustor as 
follows:

ER<INF>STtw</INF> = ER<INF>HCl</INF> + ER<INF>Cl</INF>2 x 
    (aREL<INF>HCl</INF>/aREL<INF>Cl</INF>2)

Where:

ER<INF>STtw</INF> is the 1-hour average HCl-toxicity-weighted emission 
rate (HCl-equivalent emission rate) considering 1-hour (short-term) 
exposures, lb/hr
ER<INF>HCl</INF> is the emission rate of HCl in lbs/hr
ER<INF>Cl</INF>2 is the emission rate of chlorine in lbs/hr
aREL<INF>HCl</INF> is the aREL for HCl
aREL<INF>Cl</INF>2 is the aREL for chlorine

    (4) You must use the RfC values for hydrogen chloride and chlorine 
found at http://epa.gov/ttn/atw/toxsource/ summary.html.
    (5) You must use the aREL values for hydrogen chloride and chlorine 
found at http://www.oehha.ca.gov/air/ acute--rels/acuterel.html.
    (6) Cl<INF>2</INF>HCl ratios--(i) Ratio for calculating annual 
average HCl-equivalent emission rates. (A) To calculate the annual 
average HCl-equivalent emission rate (lb/hr) for each combustor, you 
must apportion the total chlorine emission concentration (ppmv chloride 
(Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) equivalent) between HCl and chlorine according to the 
historical average Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl volumetric ratio for all 
regulatory compliance tests.
    (B) You must calculate HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> emission rates (lb/hr) 
using the apportioned emission concentrations and the gas flowrate and 
other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.
    (C) You must calculate the annual average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate using these HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> emission rates and the equation 
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Ratio for calculating 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission 
rates. (A) To calculate the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
for each combustor as a criterion for you to determine under paragraph 
(d) of this section if an hourly rolling average feedrate limit on total 
chlorine and chloride may be waived, you must apportion the total 
chlorine emission concentration (ppmv chloride (Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) 
equivalent) between HCl and chlorine according to the historical highest 
Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl volumetric ratio for all regulatory compliance tests.
    (B) You must calculate HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> emission rates (lb/hr) 
using the apportioned emission concentrations and the gas flowrate and 
other parameters from the most recent regulatory compliance test.
    (C) You must calculate the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate

[[Page 79]]

using these HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> emission rates and the equation in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (iii) Ratios for new sources. (A) You must use engineering 
information to estimate the Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl volumetric ratio for a 
new source for the initial eligibility demonstration.
    (B) You must use the Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl volumetric ratio 
demonstrated during the initial comprehensive performance test to 
demonstrate in the Notification of Compliance that your HCl-equivalent 
emission rate does not exceed your HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.
    (C) When approving the test plan for the initial comprehensive 
performance test, the permitting authority will establish a periodic 
testing requirement, such as every 3 months for 1 year, to establish a 
record of representative Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl volumetric ratios.
    (1) You must revise your HCl-equivalent emission rates and HCl-
equivalent emission rate limits after each such test using the 
procedures prescribed in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (2) If you no longer are eligible for the health-based compliance 
alternative, you must notify the permitting authority immediately and 
either:
    (i) Submit a revised eligibility demonstration requesting lower HCl-
equivalent emission rate limits, establishing lower HCl-equivalent 
emission rates, and establishing by downward extrapolation lower 
feedrate limits for total chlorine and chloride; or
    (ii) Request a compliance schedule of up to three years to 
demonstrate compliance with the emission standards under Sec. Sec. 
63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221.
    (iv) Unrepresentative or inadequate historical Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl 
volumetric ratios. (A) If you believe that the Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl 
volumetric ratio for one or more historical regulatory compliance tests 
is not representative of the current ratio, you may request that the 
permitting authority allow you to screen those ratios from the analysis 
of historical ratios.
    (B) If the permitting authority believes that too few historical 
ratios are available to calculate a representative average ratio or 
establish a maximum ratio, the permitting authority may require you to 
conduct periodic testing to establish representative ratios.
    (v) Updating Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl ratios. You must include the 
Cl<INF>2</INF>/HCl volumetric ratio demonstrated during each performance 
test in your data base of historical Cl2/HCl ratios to update the ratios 
you establish under paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section for 
subsequent calculations of the annual average and 1-hour average HCl-
equivalent emission rates.
    (7) Emission rates are capped. The hydrogen chloride and chlorine 
emission rates you use to calculate the HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limit for incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns 
must not result in total chlorine emission concentrations exceeding:
    (i) For incinerators that were existing sources on April 19, 1996: 
77 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as 
chloride (Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 
percent oxygen;
    (ii) For incinerators that are new or reconstructed sources after 
April 19, 1996: 21 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, 
expressed as chloride (Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) equivalent, dry basis and 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
    (iii) For cement kilns that were existing sources on April 19, 1996: 
130 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, expressed as 
chloride (Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) equivalent, dry basis and corrected to 7 
percent oxygen;
    (iv) For cement kilns that are new or reconstructed sources after 
April 19, 1996: 86 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, 
expressed as chloride (Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) equivalent, dry basis and 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
    (v) For lightweight aggregate kilns that were existing sources on 
April 19, 1996: 600 parts per million by volume, combined emissions, 
expressed as chloride (Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) equivalent, dry basis and 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
    (vi) For lightweight aggregate kilns that are new or reconstructed 
sources after April 19, 1996: 600 parts per million by volume, combined 
emissions, expressed as chloride (Cl<SUP>(-)</SUP>) equivalent, dry 
basis and corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
    (c) Eligibility demonstration--(1) General. (i) You must perform an 
eligibility

[[Page 80]]

demonstration to determine whether the total chlorine emission rates you 
select for each on-site hazardous waste combustor meet the national 
exposure standards using either a look-up table analysis prescribed by 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or a site-specific compliance 
demonstration prescribed by paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (ii) You must also determine in your eligibility demonstration 
whether each combustor may exceed the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission 
rate limit absent an hourly rolling average limit on the feedrate of 
total chlorine and chloride, as provided by paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) Definition of eligibility. (i) Eligibility for the risk-based 
total chlorine standard is determined by comparing the annual average 
HCl-equivalent emission rate for the total chlorine emission rate you 
select for each combustor to the annual average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate limit.
    (ii) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit ensures 
that the Hazard Index for chronic exposure from HCl and chlorine 
emissions from all on-site hazardous waste combustors is less than or 
equal to 1.0, rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1), for the 
actual individual most exposed to the facility's emissions, considering 
off-site locations where people reside and where people congregate for 
work, school, or recreation.
    (iii) Your facility is eligible for the health-based compliance 
alternative for total chlorine if either:
    (A) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each on-site 
hazardous waste combustor is below the appropriate value in the look-up 
table determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or
    (B) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate for each on-site 
hazardous waste combustor is below the annual average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit you calculate based on a site-specific compliance 
demonstration under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) Look-up table analysis. Look-up tables for the eligibility 
demonstration are provided as Tables 1 and 2 to this section.
    (i) Table 1 presents annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limits for sources located in flat terrain. For purposes of this 
analysis, flat terrain is terrain that rises to a level not exceeding 
one half the stack height within a distance of 50 stack heights.
    (ii) Table 2 presents annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limits for sources located in simple elevated terrain. For purposes of 
this analysis, simple elevated terrain is terrain that rises to a level 
exceeding one half the stack height, but that does not exceed the stack 
height, within a distance of 50 stack heights.
    (iii) To determine the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limit for a source from the look-up table, you must use the stack height 
and stack diameter for your hazardous waste combustors and the distance 
between the stack and the property boundary.
    (iv) If any of these values for stack height, stack diameter, and 
distance to nearest property boundary do not match the exact values in 
the look-up table, you must use the next lowest table value.
    (v) Adjusted HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for multiple on-site 
combustors. (A) If you have more than one hazardous waste combustor on 
site, the sum across all hazardous waste combustors of the ratio of the 
adjusted HCl-equivalent emission rate limit to the HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit provided by Tables 1 or 2 cannot exceed 1.0, 
according to the following equation:

Where:

i = number of on-site hazardous waste combustors;

[[Page 81]]

HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate Limit Adjusted<INF>i</INF> means the 
apportioned, allowable HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for combustor 
i, and
HCl-Equivalent Emission Rate Limit Table<INF>i</INF> means the HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit from Table 1 or 2 to Sec. 63.1215 for 
combustor i.

    (B) The adjusted HCl-equivalent emission rate limit becomes the HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit.
    (4) Site-specific compliance demonstration. (i) You may use any 
scientifically-accepted peer-reviewed risk assessment methodology for 
your site-specific compliance demonstration to calculate an annual 
average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each on-site hazardous 
waste combustor. An example of one approach for performing the 
demonstration for air toxics can be found in the EPA's ``Air Toxics Risk 
Assessment Reference Library, Volume 2, Site-Specific Risk Assessment 
Technical Resource Document,'' which may be obtained through the EPA's 
Air Toxics Web site at http://www.epa.gov/ttn/fera/risk--atra--
main.html.
    (ii) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit is the 
HCl-equivalent emission rate that ensures that the Hazard Index 
associated with maximum annual average exposures is not greater than 1.0 
rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place (0.1).
    (iii) To determine the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limit, your site-specific compliance demonstration must, at a minimum:
    (A) Estimate long-term inhalation exposures through the estimation 
of annual or multi-year average ambient concentrations;
    (B) Estimate the inhalation exposure for the actual individual most 
exposed to the facility's emissions from hazardous waste combustors, 
considering off-site locations where people reside and where people 
congregate for work, school, or recreation;
    (C) Use site-specific, quality-assured data wherever possible;
    (D) Use health-protective default assumptions wherever site-specific 
data are not available, and:
    (E) Contain adequate documentation of the data and methods used for 
the assessment so that it is transparent and can be reproduced by an 
experienced risk assessor and emissions measurement expert.
    (iv) Your site-specific compliance demonstration need not:
    (A) Assume any attenuation of exposure concentrations due to the 
penetration of outdoor pollutants into indoor exposure areas;
    (B) Assume any reaction or deposition of the emitted pollutants 
during transport from the emission point to the point of exposure.
    (d) Assurance that the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission rate limit 
will not be exceeded. To ensure that the 1-hour HCl-equivalent emission 
rate limit will not be exceeded when complying with the annual average 
HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, you must establish a 1-hour average 
HCl-equivalent emission rate for each combustor, establish a 1-hour 
average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each combustor, and 
consider site-specific factors including prescribed criteria to 
determine if the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit may 
be exceeded absent an hourly rolling average limit on the feedrate of 
total chlorine and chloride. If the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit may be exceeded, you must establish an hourly 
rolling average feedrate limit on total chlorine as provided by 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (1) 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate. You must calculate 
the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate from the total chlorine 
emission concentration you select for each source as prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (2) 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit. You must 
establish the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each 
affected source using either a look-up table analysis or site-specific 
analysis:
    (i) Look-up table analysis. Look-up tables are provided for 1-hour 
average HCl-equivalent emission rate limits as Table 3 and Table 4 to 
this section. Table 3 provides limits for facilities located in flat 
terrain. Table 4 provides limits for facilities located in simple 
elevated terrain. You must use the Tables to establish 1-hour average 
HCl-equivalent emission rate limits as prescribed in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(iii) through

[[Page 82]]

(c)(3)(v) of this section for annual average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate limits.
    (ii) Site-specific analysis. The 1-hour average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit is the HCl-equivalent emission rate that ensures 
that the Hazard Index associated with maximum 1-hour average exposures 
is not greater than 1.0 rounded to the nearest tenths decimal place 
(0.1). You must follow the risk assessment procedures under paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section to estimate short-term inhalation exposures 
through the estimation of maximum 1-hour average ambient concentrations.
    (3) Criteria for determining whether the 1-hour HCl-equivalent 
emission rate may be exceeded absent an hourly rolling average limit on 
the feedrate of total chlorine and chloride. An hourly rolling average 
feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride is waived if you determine 
considering the criteria listed below that the long-term feedrate limit 
(and averaging period) established under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section will also ensure that the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate will not exceed the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limit you calculate for each combustor.
    (i) The ratio of the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
based on the total chlorine emission rate you select for each hazardous 
waste combustor to the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit 
for the combustor; and
    (ii) The potential for the source to vary total chlorine and 
chloride feedrates substantially over the averaging period for the 
feedrate limit established under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
    (e) Review and approval of eligibility demonstrations--(1) Content 
of the eligibility demonstration--(i) General. The eligibility 
demonstration must include the following information, at a minimum:
    (A) Identification of each hazardous waste combustor combustion gas 
emission point (e.g., generally, the flue gas stack);
    (B) The maximum and average capacity at which each combustor will 
operate, and the maximum rated capacity for each combustor, using the 
metric of stack gas volume (under both actual and standard conditions)

appropriate for the combustor (e.g., million Btu/hr heat input for 
boilers; tons of dry raw material feed/hour for cement kilns);
    (C) Stack parameters for each combustor, including, but not limited 
to stack height, stack diameter, stack gas temperature, and stack gas

equivalent emission rate limit. You must include the following in your 
eligibility demonstration to implement the annual average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit:

calculations to confirm that the annual average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate that you calculate from the total chlorine emission rate you select 
for each combustor does not exceed the limits provided by paragraph 
(b)(7) of this section;
    (B) Comparison of the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limit for each combustor to the annual average HCl-equivalent emission 
rate for the total chlorine emission rate you select for each combustor;
    (C) The annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit for each 
hazardous waste combustor, and the limits on operating parameters

this section;
    (iii) Additional content to implement the 1-hour average HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit. You must include the following in your 
eligibility demonstration to implement the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent

    (A) Determination of whether the combustor may exceed the 1-hour 
HCl-equivalent emission rate limit absent an hourly rolling average 
chlorine feedrate limit, including:
    (1) Determination of the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
from the total chlorine emission rate you select for the combustor;
    (2) Determination of the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limit using either look-up Tables 3 and 4 to this section or site-
specific risk analysis;
    (3) Determination of the ratio of the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate to the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit 
for the combustor; and
    (4) The potential for the source to vary total chlorine and chloride 
feedrates substantially over the averaging period for the long-term 
feedrate limit established under paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of 
this section; and
    (B) Determination of the hourly rolling average chlorine feedrate 
limit, including the total chlorine system removal efficiency.
    (iv) Additional content of a look-up table demonstration. If you use 
the look-up table analysis to establish HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limits, your eligibility demonstration must also contain, at a minimum, 
the following:
    (A) Documentation that the facility is located in either flat or 
simple elevated terrain; and
    (B) For facilities with more than one on-site hazardous waste 
combustor, documentation that the sum of the ratios for all such 
combustors of the HCl-equivalent emission rate to the HCl-equivalent

    (v) Additional content of a site-specific compliance demonstration. 
If you use a site-specific compliance demonstration, your eligibility 
demonstration must also contain, at a minimum, the following information 
to support your determination of the annual average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit for each combustor:
    (A) Identification of the risk assessment methodology used;
    (B) Documentation of the fate and transport model used;
    (C) Documentation of the fate and transport model inputs, including

    (4) Other facility-specific parameters input into the model;
    (E) Documentation of the fate and transport model outputs; and
    (F) Documentation of any exposure assessment and risk

    (2) Review and approval--(i) Existing sources. (A) If you operate an 
existing source, you must submit the eligibility demonstration to your 
permitting authority for review and approval not later than 12 months 
prior to the compliance date. You must also submit a separate copy of 
the eligibility demonstration to: U.S. EPA, Risk and Exposure Assessment 
Group, Emission Standards Division (C404-01), Attn: Group Leader, 
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, electronic mail address 
REAG@epa.gov.
    (B) Your permitting authority should notify you of approval or 
intent to disapprove your eligibility demonstration within 6 months 
after receipt of the original demonstration, and within 3 months after 
receipt of any supplemental information that you submit. A notice of 
intent to disapprove your eligibility demonstration, whether before or 
after the compliance date, will identify incomplete or inaccurate 
information or noncompliance with prescribed procedures and specify how 
much time you will have to submit additional information or to achieve 
the MACT

[[Page 84]]

standards for total chlorine under Sec. Sec. 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 
63.1220, and 63.1221. If your eligibility demonstration is disapproved, 
the permitting authority may extend the compliance date of the total 
chlorine standards to allow you to make changes to the design or 
operation of the combustor or related systems as quickly as practicable 
to enable you to achieve compliance with the MACT total chlorine 
standards.
    (C) If your permitting authority has not approved your eligibility 
demonstration by the compliance date, and has not issued a notice of 
intent to disapprove your demonstration, you may nonetheless begin 
complying, on the compliance date, with the HCl-equivalent emission rate 
limits you present in your eligibility demonstration.
    (D) If your permitting authority issues a notice of intent to 
disapprove your eligibility demonstration after the compliance date, the 
authority will identify the basis for that notice and specify how much 
time you will have to submit additional information or to comply with 
the MACT standards for total chlorine under Sec. Sec. 63.1216, 63.1217, 
63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221. The permitting authority may extend the 
compliance date of the total chlorine standards to allow you to make 
changes to the design or operation of the combustor or related systems 
as quickly as practicable to enable you to achieve compliance with the 
MACT standards for total chlorine.
    (ii) New or reconstructed sources--(A) General. The procedures for 
review and approval of eligibility demonstrations applicable to existing 
sources under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section also apply to new or 
reconstructed sources, except that the date you must submit the 
eligibility demonstration is as prescribed in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii).
    (B) If you operate a new or reconstructed source that starts up 
before April 12, 2007, or a solid fuel boiler or liquid fuel boiler that 
is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit 
such that it becomes a major source of HAP before April 12, 2007, you 
must either:
    (1) Comply with the final total chlorine emission standards under 
Sec. Sec. 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221, by October 
12, 2005, or upon startup, whichever is later, except for a standard 
that is more stringent than the standard proposed on April 20, 2004 for 
your source. If a final standard is more stringent than the proposed 
standard, you may comply with the proposed standard until October 14, 
2008, after which you must comply with the final standard; or
    (2) Submit an eligibility demonstration for review and approval 
under this section by April 12, 2006, and comply with the HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limits and operating requirements you establish in the 
eligibility demonstration.
    (C) If you operate a new or reconstructed source that starts up on 
or after April 12, 2007, or a solid fuel boiler or liquid fuel boiler 
that is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to 
emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP on or after April 12, 
2007, you must either:
    (1) Comply with the final total chlorine emission standards under 
Sec. Sec. 63.1216, 63.1217, 63.1219, 63.1220, and 63.1221 upon startup. 
If the final standard is more stringent than the standard proposed for 
your source on April 20, 2004, however, and if you start operations 
before October 14, 2008, you may comply with the proposed standard until 
October 14, 2008, after which you must comply with the final standard; 
or
    (2) Submit an eligibility demonstration for review and approval 
under this section 12 months prior to startup.
    (f) Testing requirements--(1) General. You must comply with the 
requirements for comprehensive performance testing under Sec. 63.1207.
    (2) System removal efficiency. (i) You must calculate the total 
chlorine removal efficiency of the combustor during each run of the 
comprehensive performance test.
    (ii) You must calculate the average system removal efficiency as the 
average of the test run averages.
    (iii) If your source does not control emissions of total chlorine, 
you must assume zero system removal efficiency.
    (3) Annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit. If emissions 
during the comprehensive performance test exceed the annual average HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit, eligibility for

[[Page 85]]

emission limits under this section is not affected. This emission rate 
limit is an annual average limit even though compliance is based on a 
12-hour or (up to) an annual rolling average feedrate limit on total 
chlorine and chloride because the feedrate limit is also used for 
compliance assurance for the semivolatile metal emission standard
    (4) 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit. Total 
chlorine emissions during each run of the comprehensive performance test 
cannot exceed the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit.
    (5) Test methods. (i) If you operate a cement kiln or a combustor 
equipped with a dry acid gas scrubber, you must use EPA Method 320/321 
or ASTM D 6735-01, or an equivalent method, to measure hydrogen 
chloride, and the back-half (caustic impingers) of Method 26/26A, or an 
equivalent method, to measure chlorine gas.
    (ii) Bromine and sulfur considerations. If you operate an 
incinerator, boiler, or lightweight aggregate kiln and your feedstreams 
contain bromine or sulfur during the comprehensive performance test at 
levels specified under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, you must 
use EPA Method 320/321 or ASTM D 6735-01, or an equivalent method, to 
measure hydrogen chloride, and Method 26/26A, or an equivalent method, 
to measure chlorine and hydrogen chloride, and determine your chlorine 
emissions as follows:
    (A) You must determine your chlorine emissions to be the higher of 
the value measured by Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A-8, part 60 
of this chapter, or an equivalent method, or the value calculated by the 
difference between the combined hydrogen chloride and chlorine levels 
measured by Method 26/26A as provided in appendix A-8, part 60 of this 
chapter, or an equivalent method, and the hydrogen chloride measurement 
from EPA Method 320/321 as provided in appendix A, part 63 of this 
chapter, or ASTM D 6735-01 as described under Sec. 63.1208(b)(5)(i)(C), 
or an equivalent method.
    (B) The procedures under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for 
determining hydrogen chloride and chlorine emissions apply if you feed 
bromine or sulfur during the performance test at the levels specified in 
this paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B):
    (1) If the bromine/chlorine ratio in feedstreams is greater than 5 
percent by mass; or
    (2) If the sulfur/chlorine ratio in feedstreams is greater than 50 
percent by mass.
    (g) Monitoring requirements--(1) General. You must establish and 
comply with limits on the same operating parameters that apply to 
sources complying with the MACT standard for total chlorine under Sec. 
63.1209(o), except that feedrate limits on total chlorine and chloride 
must be established according to paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this 
section:
    (2) Feedrate limit to ensure compliance with the annual average HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit. (i) For sources subject to the feedrate 
limit for total chlorine and chloride under Sec. 63.1209(n)(4) to 
ensure compliance with the semivolatile metals standard:
    (A) The feedrate limit (and averaging period) for total chlorine and 
chloride to ensure compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit is the same as required by Sec. 63.1209(n)(4), 
except as provided by paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
    (B) The numerical value of the total chlorine and chloride feedrate 
limit (i.e., not considering the averaging period) you establish under 
Sec. 63.1209(n)(4) must not exceed the value you calculate as the 
annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit (lb/hr) divided by [1 
- system removal efficiency], where the system removal efficiency is 
calculated as prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (ii) For sources exempt from the feedrate limit for total chlorine 
and chloride under Sec. 63.1209(n)(4) because they comply with Sec. 
63.1207(m)(2), the feedrate limit for total chlorine and chloride to 
ensure compliance with the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate 
must be established as follows:
    (A) You must establish an average period for the feedrate limit that 
does not exceed an annual rolling average;
    (B) The numerical value of the total chlorine and chloride feedrate 
limit

[[Page 86]]

(i.e., not considering the averaging period) must not exceed the value 
you calculate as the annual average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit 
(lb/hr) divided by [1 - system removal efficiency], where the system 
removal efficiency is calculated as prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section.
    (C) You must calculate the initial rolling average as though you had 
selected a 12-hour rolling average, as provided by paragraph (b)(5)(i) 
of this section. You must calculate rolling averages thereafter as the 
average of the available one-minute values until enough one-minute 
values are available to calculate the rolling average period you select. 
At that time and thereafter, you update the rolling average feedrate 
each hour with a 60-minute average feedrate.
    (3) Feedrate limit to ensure compliance with the 1-hour average HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit. (i) You must establish an hourly rolling 
average feedrate limit on total chlorine and chloride to ensure 
compliance with the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit 
unless you determine that the hourly rolling average feedrate limit is 
waived under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (ii) You must calculate the hourly rolling average feedrate limit 
for total chlorine and chloride as the 1-hour average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit (lb/hr) divided by [1 - system removal efficiency], 
where the system removal efficiency is calculated as prescribed by 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (h) Changes--(1) Changes over which you have control--(i) Changes 
that would affect the HCl-equivalent emission rate limit. (A) If you 
plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the facility in 
a manner than would decrease the annual average or 1-hour average HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit, you must submit to the permitting 
authority prior to the change a revised eligibility demonstration 
documenting the lower emission rate limits and calculations of reduced 
total chlorine and chloride feedrate limits.
    (B) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of 
the facility in a manner than would increase the annual average or 1-
hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, and you elect to 
increase your total chlorine and chloride feedrate limits. You must also 
submit to the permitting authority prior to the change a revised 
eligibility demonstration documenting the increased emission rate limits 
and calculations of the increased feedrate limits prior to the change.
    (ii) Changes that could affect system removal efficiency. (A) If you 
plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor in 
a manner than could decrease the system removal efficiency, you are 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 63.1206(b)(5) for conducting a 
performance test to reestablish the combustor's system removal 
efficiency and you must submit a revised eligibility demonstration 
documenting the lower system removal efficiency and the reduced feedrate 
limits on total chlorine and chloride.
    (B) If you plan to change the design, operation, or maintenance of 
the combustor in a manner than could increase the system removal 
efficiency, and you elect to document the increased system removal 
efficiency to establish higher feedrate limits on total chlorine and 
chloride, you are subject to the requirements of Sec. 63.1206(b)(5) for 
conducting a performance test to reestablish the combustor's system 
removal efficiency. You must also submit to the permitting authority a 
revised eligibility demonstration documenting the higher system removal 
efficiency and the increased feedrate limits on total chlorine and 
chloride.
    (2) Changes over which you do not have control that may decrease the 
HCl-equivalent emission rate limits. These requirements apply if you use 
a site-specific risk assessment under paragraph (c)(4) of this section 
to demonstrate eligibility for the health-based limits.
    (i) Proactive review. You must submit for review and approval with 
each comprehensive performance test plan either a certification that the 
information used in your eligibility demonstration has not changed in a 
manner that would decrease the annual average or 1-hour average HCl-
equivalent emission rate limit, or a revised eligibility demonstration.

[[Page 87]]

    (ii) Reactive review. If in the interim between your comprehensive 
performance tests you have reason to know of changes that would decrease 
the annual average or 1-hour average HCl-equivalent emission rate limit, 
you must submit a revised eligibility demonstration as soon as 
practicable but not more frequently than annually.
    (iii) Compliance schedule. If you determine that you cannot 
demonstrate compliance with a lower annual average HCl-equivalent 
emission rate limit during the comprehensive performance test because 
you need additional time to complete changes to the design or operation 
of the source, you may request that the permitting authority grant you 
additional time to make those changes as quickly as practicable.

emissions in excess of the limits provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section;
    (2) Mercury in excess of 11 [micro]gm/dscm corrected to 7 percent

    (i) Carbon monoxide in excess of 100 parts per million by volume, 
over an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous 
emissions monitoring system), dry basis and corrected to 7 percent 
oxygen. If you elect to comply with this carbon monoxide standard rather 
than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this 
section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by Sec. 
63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume 
during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored 
continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or
    (ii) Hydrocarbons in excess of 10 parts per million by volume, over 
an hourly rolling average (monitored continuously with a continuous

corrected to 7 percent oxygen;
    (4) For arsenic, beryllium, and chromium combined, except for an 
area source as defined under Sec. 63.2, emissions in excess of 190

section, you must also document that, during the destruction and removal 
efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by Sec. 
63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 10 parts per million by volume

DRE. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must 
achieve a DRE of 99.99% for each principle organic hazardous constituent 
(POHC) designated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must 
calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation:

[[Page 92]]

W<INF>out</INF> = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust 
emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.

and (c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of 
the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste 
feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty 
of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and 
on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering 
the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.
    (d) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.

lieu of complying with the particulate matter standards of this section, 
you may elect to comply with the following alternative metal emission 
control requirement:
    (2) Alternative metal emission control requirements for existing

parameter limits must be established to ensure compliance with the 
alternative emission limitations described in paragraphs (e)(2) and 
(e)(3) of this section pursuant to Sec. 63.1209(n), except that 
semivolatile metal feedrate limits apply to lead, cadmium, and selenium, 
combined, and low volatile metal feedrate limits apply to arsenic, 
beryllium, chromium, antimony, cobalt, manganese, and nickel, combined.
    (f) Elective standards for area sources. Area sources as defined 
under Sec. 63.2 are subject to the standards for cadmium and lead, the 
standards for arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, the standards for 
hydrogen chloride and chlorine, and the standards for particulate matter 
under this section if they elect under Sec. 266.100(b)(3) of this 
chapter to comply with those standards in lieu of the standards under 40 
CFR 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 to control those pollutants.

achieve a DRE of 99.99% for each principle organic hazardous constituent 
(POHC) designated under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must 
calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation:

DRE = [1 - (W <INF>out</INF> / W <INF>in</INF>)] x 100%

Where:

Win = mass feedrate of one POHC in a waste feedstream; and
Wout = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust emissions 
prior to release to the atmosphere.

    (2) 99.9999% DRE. If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes 
F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see Sec. 261.31 of this 
chapter), you must achieve a DRE of 99.9999% for each POHC that you 
designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must demonstrate 
this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than 
tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You 
must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate 
DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must notify the Administrator of 
your intent to incinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, 
or F027.

(c)(3)(ii) of this section to the extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) 
and (c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of 
the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste 
feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty 
of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and 
on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering 
the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.
    (d) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.
    (e) Elective standards for area sources. Area sources as defined 
under Sec. 63.2 are subject to the standards for cadmium and lead, the 
standards for arsenic, beryllium, and chromium, the standards for 
hydrogen chloride and chlorine, and the standards for particulate matter 
under this section if they elect under Sec. 266.100(b)(3) of this 
chapter to comply with those standards in lieu of the standards under 40 
CFR 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 to control those pollutants.

    (iv) If your in-line kiln raw mill has dual stacks, you may assume 
that the dioxin/furan emission levels in the by-pass stack and the 
operating parameter limits determined during performance testing of the 
by-pass stack when the raw mill is off-line are the same as when the 
mill is on-line.
    (v) In lieu of conducting a performance test to demonstrate 
compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standards for the mode of 
operation when the raw mill is on-line, you may specify in the 
performance test workplan and Notification of Compliance the same 
operating parameter limits required under Sec. 63.1209(k) for the mode 
of operation when the raw mill is on-line as you establish during 
performance testing for the mode of operation when the raw mill is off-
line.

average emission concentration with the following equation:

C<INF>total</INF> = {C<INF>mill-off</INF> x (T<INF>mill-off</INF> / 
    (T<INF>mill-off</INF> + T<INF>mill-on</INF>)){time}  + 
    {C<INF>mill-on</INF> x (T<INF>mill-on</INF> / (T<INF>mill-off</INF> 
    + T<INF>mill-on</INF>)){time} 

Where:

C<INF>total</INF> = time-weighted average concentration of a regulated 
constituent considering both raw mill on time and off time;
C<INF>mill-off</INF> = average performance test concentration of 
regulated constituent with the raw mill off-line;
C<INF>mill-on</INF> = average performance test concentration of 
regulated constituent with the raw mill on-line;
T<INF>mill-off</INF> = time when kiln gases are not routed through the 
raw mill; and
T<INF>mill-on</INF> = time when kiln gases are routed through the raw 
mill.

    (ii) Compliance. (A) If you use this emission averaging provision, 
you must document in the operating record compliance with the emission 
standards on an annual basis by using the equation provided by paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (B) Compliance is based on one-year block averages beginning on the 
day you submit the initial notification of compliance.
    (iii) Notification. (A) If you elect to document compliance with one 
or more emission standards using this emission averaging provision, you 
must notify the Administrator in the initial comprehensive performance 
test plan submitted under Sec. 63.1207(e).
    (B) You must include historical raw mill operation data in the 
performance test plan to estimate future raw mill down-time and document 
in the performance test plan that estimated emissions and estimated raw 
mill

[[Page 105]]

down-time will not result in an exceedance of an emission standard on an 
annual basis.
    (C) You must document in the notification of compliance submitted 
under Sec. 63.1207(j) that an emission standard will not be exceeded 
based on the documented emissions from the performance test and 
predicted raw mill down-time.
    (e) Preheater or preheater/precalciner kilns with dual stacks--(1) 
General. You must conduct performance testing on each stack to 
demonstrate compliance with the emission standards, and you must 
establish operating parameter limits under Sec. 63.1209 for each stack, 
except as provided by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section for dioxin/
furan emissions testing and operating parameter limits for the by-pass 
stack of in-line raw mills.
    (2) Emissions averaging. You may comply with the mercury, 
semivolatile metal, low volatile metal, and hydrogen chloride/chlorine 
gas emission standards specified in this section on a gas flowrate-
weighted average basis under the following procedures:
    (i) Averaging methodology. You must calculate the gas flowrate-
weighted average emission concentration using the following equation:

C<INF>tot</INF> = {C<INF>main</INF> x (Q<INF>main</INF> / 
    (Q<INF>main</INF> + Q<INF>bypass</INF>)){time}  + 
    {C<INF>bypass</INF> x (Q<INF>bypass</INF> / (Q<INF>main</INF> + 
    Q<INF>bypass</INF>)){time} 

Where:

C<INF>tot</INF> = gas flowrate-weighted average concentration of the 
regulated constituent;
C<INF>main</INF> = average performance test concentration demonstrated 
in the main stack;
C<INF>bypass</INF> = average performance test concentration demonstrated 
in the bypass stack;
Q<INF>main</INF> = volumetric flowrate of main stack effluent gas; and
Q<INF>bypass</INF> = volumetric flowrate of bypass effluent gas.

    (ii) Compliance. (A) You must demonstrate compliance with the 
emission standard(s) using the emission concentrations determined from 
the performance tests and the equation provided by paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section; and
    (B) You must develop operating parameter limits for bypass stack and 
main stack flowrates that ensure the emission concentrations calculated 
with the equation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section do not exceed the 
emission standards on a 12-hour rolling average basis. You must include 
these flowrate limits in the Notification of Compliance.
    (iii) Notification. If you elect to document compliance under this 
emissions averaging provision, you must:
    (A) Notify the Administrator in the initial comprehensive 
performance test plan submitted under Sec. 63.1207(e). The performance 
test plan must include, at a minimum, information describing the 
flowrate limits established under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section; and
    (B) Document in the Notification of Compliance submitted under Sec. 
63.1207(j) the demonstrated gas flowrate-weighted average emissions that 
you calculate with the equation provided by paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section.
    (f) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) When you comply with the particulate matter requirements of 
paragraphs (a)(7) or (b)(7) of this section, you are exempt from the New 
Source Performance Standard for particulate matter and opacity under 
Sec. 60.60 of this chapter.

standard rather than the hydrocarbon standard under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) 
of this section, you also must document that, during the destruction and 
removal efficiency (DRE) test runs or their equivalent as provided by 
Sec. 63.1206(b)(7), hydrocarbons do not exceed 20 parts per million by 
volume during those runs, over an hourly rolling average (monitored 
continuously with a continuous emissions monitoring system), dry basis, 
corrected to 7 percent oxygen, and reported as propane; or

achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99% for each 
principal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. You must calculate DRE for each POHC 
from the following equation:

DRE = [1 - (W<INF>out</INF> / Win)] x 100%

Where:

W<INF>in</INF> = mass feedrate of one POHC in a waste feedstream; and
W<INF>out</INF> = mass emission rate of the same POHC present in exhaust 
emissions prior to release to the atmosphere.

    (2) 99.9999% DRE. If you burn the dioxin-listed hazardous wastes 
F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 (see Sec. 261.31 of this 
chapter), you must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 
99.9999% for each POHC that you designate under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section. You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are 
more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-
dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC. In addition, you must 
notify the Administrator of your intent to burn hazardous wastes F020, 
F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027.
    (3) Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs). (i) You must 
treat each POHC in the waste feed that you specify under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section to the extent required by paragraphs (c)(1) 
and (c)(2) of this section.
    (ii) You must specify one or more POHCs that are representative of 
the most difficult to destroy organic compounds in your hazardous waste 
feedstream. You must base this specification on the degree of difficulty 
of incineration of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste and 
on their concentration or mass in the hazardous waste feed, considering 
the results of hazardous waste analyses or other data and information.
    (d) Significant figures. The emission limits provided by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section are presented with two significant figures. 
Although you must perform intermediate calculations using at least three 
significant figures, you may round the resultant emission levels to two 
significant figures to document compliance.

 Sec. Appendix to Subpart EEE of Part 63--Quality Assurance Procedures 
  for Continuous Emissions Monitors Used for Hazardous Waste Combustors

                     1. Applicability and Principle

    1.1 Applicability. These quality assurance requirements are used to 
evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance 
(QA) procedures and the quality of data produced by continuous emission 
monitoring systems (CEMS) that are used for determining compliance with 
the emission standards on a continuous basis as specified in the 
applicable regulation. The QA procedures specified by these requirements 
represent the minimum requirements necessary for the control and 
assessment of the quality of CEMS data used to demonstrate compliance 
with the emission standards provided under this subpart EEE of part 63. 
Owners and operators must meet these minimum requirements and are 
encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program. These 
requirements supersede those found in part 60, Appendix F, of this 
chapter. Appendix F does not apply to hazardous waste-burning devices.
    1.2 Principle. The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally 
important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of 
the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control 
and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by implementing QC 
policies and corrective actions. These two functions form a control 
loop. When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is 
inadequate, the source must immediately stop burning hazardous waste. 
The CEM data control effort must be increased until the data quality is 
acceptable before hazardous waste burning can resume.
    a. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of 
data quality, this procedure explicitly specifies the assessment methods 
for response drift and accuracy. The methods are based on procedures 
included in the applicable performance specifications provided in 
appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. These procedures also require the 
analysis of the EPA audit samples concurrent with certain reference 
method (RM) analyses as specified in the applicable RM's.
    b. Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a 
variety of policies, specifications, standards, and corrective measures, 
this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow each 
source owner or operator to develop a QC system that is most effective 
and efficient for the circumstances.

                             2. Definitions

    2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). The total 
equipment required for the determination of a pollutant concentration. 
The system consists of the following major subsystems:
    2.1.1 Sample Interface. That portion of the CEMS used for one or 
more of the following: sample acquisition, sample transport, and sample 
conditioning, or protection of the monitor from the effects of the stack 
effluent.
    2.1.2 Pollutant Analyzer. That portion of the CEMS that senses the 
pollutant concentration and generates a proportional output.
    2.1.3 Diluent Analyzer. That portion of the CEMS that senses the 
diluent gas (O2) and generates an output proportional to the gas 
concentration.
    2.1.4 Data Recorder. That portion of the CEMS that provides a 
permanent record of the analyzer output. The data recorder may provide 
automatic data reduction and CEMS control capabilities.
    2.2 Relative Accuracy (RA). The absolute mean difference between the 
pollutant concentration determined by the CEMS and the value determined 
by the reference method

[[Page 110]]

(RM) plus the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient of a series of 
test divided by the mean of the RM tests or the applicable emission 
limit.
    2.3 Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the CEMS output 
readings from the established reference value after a stated period of 
operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment 
took place.
    2.4 Zero Drift (ZD). The difference in CEMS output readings at the 
zero pollutant level after a stated period of operation during which no 
unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.
    2.5 Calibration Standard. Calibration standards produce a known and 
unchanging response when presented to the pollutant analyzer portion of 
the CEMS, and are used to calibrate the drift or response of the 
analyzer.
    2.6 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). Comparison of CEMS 
measurements to reference method measurements in order to evaluate 
relative accuracy following procedures and specification given in the 
appropriate performance specification.
    2.7 Absolute Calibration Audit (ACA). Equivalent to calibration 
error (CE) test defined in the appropriate performance specification 
using NIST traceable calibration standards to challenge the CEMS and 
assess accuracy.
    2.8 Rolling Average. The average emissions, based on some 
(specified) time period, calculated every minute from a one-minute 
average of four measurements taken at 15-second intervals.

                          3. QA/QC Requirements

    3.1 QC Requirements. a. Each owner or operator must develop and 
implement a QC program. At a minimum, each QC program must include 
written procedures describing in detail complete, step-by-step 
procedures and operations for the following activities.
    1. Checks for component failures, leaks, and other abnormal 
conditions.
    2. Calibration of CEMS.
    3. CD determination and adjustment of CEMS.
    4. Integration of CEMS with the automatic waste feed cutoff (AWFCO) 
system.
    5. Preventive Maintenance of CEMS (including spare parts inventory).
    6. Data recording, calculations, and reporting.
    7. Checks of record keeping.
    8. Accuracy audit procedures, including sampling and analysis 
methods.
    9. Program of corrective action for malfunctioning CEMS.
    10. Operator training and certification.
    11. Maintaining and ensuring current certification or naming of 
cylinder gasses, metal solutions, and particulate samples used for audit 
and accuracy tests, daily checks, and calibrations.
    b. Whenever excessive inaccuracies occur for two consecutive 
quarters, the current written procedures must be revised or the CEMS 
modified or replaced to correct the deficiency causing the excessive 
inaccuracies. These written procedures must be kept on record and 
available for inspection by the enforcement agency.
    3.2 QA Requirements. Each source owner or operator must develop and 
implement a QA plan that includes, at a minimum, the following.
    1. QA responsibilities (including maintaining records, preparing 
reports, reviewing reports).
    2. Schedules for the daily checks, periodic audits, and preventive 
maintenance.
    3. Check lists and data sheets.
    4. Preventive maintenance procedures.
    5. Description of the media, format, and location of all records and 
reports.
    6. Provisions for a review of the CEMS data at least once a year. 
Based on the results of the review, the owner or operator must revise or 
update the QA plan, if necessary.

             4. CD and ZD Assessment and Daily System Audit

    4.1 CD and ZD Requirement. Owners and operators must check, record, 
and quantify the ZD and the CD at least once daily (approximately 24 
hours) in accordance with the method prescribed by the manufacturer. The 
CEMS calibration must, at a minimum, be adjusted whenever the daily ZD 
or CD exceeds the limits in the Performance Specifications. If, on any 
given ZD and/or CD check the ZD and/or CD exceed(s) two times the limits 
in the Performance Specifications, or if the cumulative adjustment to 
the ZD and/or CD (see Section 4.2) exceed(s) three times the limits in 
the Performance Specifications, hazardous waste burning must immediately 
cease and the CEMS must be serviced and recalibrated. Hazardous waste 
burning cannot resume until the owner or operator documents that the 
CEMS is in compliance with the Performance Specifications by carrying 
out an ACA.
    4.2 Recording Requirements for Automatic ZD and CD Adjusting 
Monitors. Monitors that automatically adjust the data to the corrected 
calibration values must record the unadjusted concentration measurement 
prior to resetting the calibration, if performed, or record the amount 
of the adjustment.
    4.3 Daily System Audit. The audit must include a review of the 
calibration check data, an inspection of the recording system, an 
inspection of the control panel warning lights, and an inspection of the 
sample transport and interface system (e.g., flowmeters, filters, etc.) 
as appropriate.

[[Page 111]]

    4.4 Data Recording and Reporting. All measurements from the CEMS 
must be retained in the operating record for at least 5 years.

      5. Performance Evaluation for CO, O<INF>2</INF>, and HC CEMS

    Carbon Monoxide (CO), Oxygen (O<INF>2</INF>), and Hydrocarbon (HC) 
CEMS. An Absolute Calibration Audit (ACA) must be conducted quarterly, 
and a Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA) (if applicable, see sections 
5.1 and 5.2) must be conducted yearly. An Interference Response Tests 
must be performed whenever an ACA or a RATA is conducted. When a 
performance test is also required under Sec. 63.1207 to document 
compliance with emission standards, the RATA must coincide with the 
performance test. The audits must be conducted as follows.
    5.1 Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA). This requirement applies to 
O<INF>2</INF> and CO CEMS. The RATA must be conducted at least yearly. 
Conduct the RATA as described in the RA test procedure (or alternate 
procedures section) described in the applicable Performance 
Specifications. In addition, analyze the appropriate performance audit 
samples received from the EPA as described in the applicable sampling 
methods.
    5.2 Absolute Calibration Audit (ACA). The ACA must be conducted at 
least quarterly except in a quarter when a RATA (if applicable, see 
section 5.1) is conducted instead. Conduct an ACA as described in the 
calibration error (CE) test procedure described in the applicable 
Performance Specifications.
    5.3 Interference Response Test. The interference response test must 
be conducted whenever an ACA or RATA is conducted. Conduct an 
interference response test as described in the applicable Performance 
Specifications.
    5.4 Excessive Audit Inaccuracy. If the RA from the RATA or the CE 
from the ACA exceeds the criteria in the applicable Performance 
Specifications, hazardous waste burning must cease immediately. 
Hazardous waste burning cannot resume until the owner or operator takes 
corrective measures and audit the CEMS with a RATA to document that the 
CEMS is operating within the specifications.

                          6. Other Requirements

    6.1 Performance Specifications. CEMS used by owners and operators of 
HWCs must comply with the following performance specifications in 
appendix B to part 60 of this chapter:

              Table I: Performance Specifications for CEMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            Performance
                           CEMS                            specification
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carbon monoxide..........................................          4B
Oxygen...................................................          4B
Total hydrocarbons.......................................          8A
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6.2 Downtime due to Calibration. Facilities may continue to burn 
hazardous waste for a maximum of 20 minutes while calibrating the CEMS. 
If all CEMS are calibrated at once, the facility must have twenty 
minutes to calibrate all the CEMS. If CEMS are calibrated individually, 
the facility must have twenty minutes to calibrate each CEMS. If the 
CEMS are calibrated individually, other CEMS must be operational while 
the individual CEMS is being calibrated.
    6.3 Span of the CEMS.
    6.3.1 CO CEMS. The CO CEM must have two ranges, a low range with a 
span of 200 ppmv and a high range with a span of 3000 ppmv at an oxygen 
correction factor of 1. A one-range CEM may be used, but it must meet 
the performance specifications for the low range in the specified span 
of the low range.
    6.3.2 O<INF>2 CEMS</INF>. The O<INF>2</INF> CEM must have a span of 
25 percent. The span may be higher than 25 percent if the O<INF>2</INF> 
concentration at the sampling point is greater than 25 percent.
    6.3.3 HC CEMS. The HC CEM must have a span of 100 ppmv, expressed as 
propane, at an oxygen correction factor of 1.
    6.3.4 CEMS Span Values. When the Oxygen Correction Factor is Greater 
than 2. When an owner or operator installs a CEMS at a location of high 
ambient air dilution, i.e., where the maximum oxygen correction factor 
as determined by the permitting agency is greater than 2, the owner or 
operator must install a CEM with a lower span(s), proportionate to the 
larger oxygen correction factor, than those specified above.
    6.3.5 Use of Alternative Spans. Owner or operators may request 
approval to use alternative spans and ranges to those specified. 
Alternate spans must be approved in writing in advance by the 
Administrator. In considering approval of alternative spans and ranges, 
the Administrator will consider that measurements beyond the span will 
be recorded as values at the maximum span for purposes of calculating 
rolling averages.
    6.3.6 Documentation of Span Values. The span value must be 
documented by the CEMS manufacturer with laboratory data.
    6.4.1 Moisture Correction. Method 4 of appendix A, part 60 of this 
chapter, must be used to determine moisture content of the stack gasses.

[[Page 112]]

    6.4.2 Oxygen Correction Factor. Measured pollutant levels must be 
corrected for the amount of oxygen in the stack according to the 
following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.022

Where:

P<INF>c</INF> = concentration of the pollutant or standard corrected to 
7 percent oxygen, dry basis;
P<INF>m</INF> = measured concentration of the pollutant, dry basis;
E = volume fraction of oxygen in the combustion air fed into the device, 
on a dry basis (normally 21 percent or 0.21 if only air is fed);
Y = measured fraction of oxygen on a dry basis at the sampling point.

    The oxygen correction factor is:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.023
    
    6.4.3 Temperature Correction. Correction values for temperature are 
obtainable from standard reference materials.
    6.5 Rolling Average. A rolling average is the arithmetic average of 
all one-minute averages over the averaging period.
    6.5.1 One-Minute Average for CO and HHC CEMS. One-minute averages 
are the arithmetic average of the four most recent 15-second 
observations and must be calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10JY00.004

Where:

c = the one minute average
c<INF>i</INF> = a fifteen-second observation from the CEM

    Fifteen second observations must not be rounded or smoothed. 
Fifteen-second observations may be disregarded only as a result of a 
failure in the CEMS and allowed in the source's quality assurance plan 
at the time of the CEMS failure. One-minute averages must not be 
rounded, smoothed, or disregarded.
    6.5.2 Ten Minute Rolling Average Equation. The ten minute rolling 
average must be calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.025

Where:

C<INF>RA</INF> = The concentration of the standard, expressed as a 
rolling average
c<INF>i</INF> = a one minute average

    6.5.3 Hourly Rolling Average Equation for CO and THC CEMS and 
Operating Parameter Limits. The rolling average, based on a specific 
number integer of hours, must be calculated using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30SE99.026

Where:

c<INF>RA</INF> = The concentration of the standard, expressed as a 
rolling average
c<INF>i</INF> = a one minute average

    6.5.4 Averaging Periods for CEMS other than CO and THC. The 
averaging period for CEMS other than CO and THC CEMS must be calculated 
as a rolling average of all one-hour values over the averaging period. 
An hourly average is comprised of 4 measurements taken at equally spaced 
time intervals, or at most every 15 minutes. Fewer than 4 measurements 
might be available within an hour for reasons such as facility downtime 
or CEMS calibration. If at least two measurements (30 minutes of data) 
are available, an hourly average must be calculated. The n-hour rolling 
average is calculated by averaging the n most recent hourly averages.
    6.6 Units of the Standards for the Purposes of Recording and 
Reporting Emissions. Emissions must be recorded and reported expressed 
after correcting for oxygen, temperature, and moisture. Emissions must 
be reported in metric, but may also be reported in the English system of 
units, at 7 percent oxygen, 20 [deg]C, and on a dry basis.
    6.7 Rounding and Significant Figures. Emissions must be rounded to 
two significant figures using ASTM procedure E-29-90 or its successor. 
Rounding must be avoided prior to rounding for the reported value.

Sec. 63.1250  Applicability.

    (a) Definition of affected source. (1) The affected source subject 
to this subpart consists of the pharmaceutical

[[Page 113]]

manufacturing operations as defined in Sec. 63.1251. Except as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the provisions of this 
subpart apply to pharmaceutical manufacturing operations that meet the 
criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this 
section:
    (i) Manufacture a pharmaceutical product as defined in Sec. 
63.1251;
    (ii) Are located at a plant site that is a major source as defined 
in section 112(a) of the Act; and
    (iii) Process, use, or produce HAP.
    (2) Determination of the applicability of this subpart shall be 
reported as part of an operating permit application or as otherwise 
specified by the permitting authority.
    (b) New source applicability. A new affected source subject to this 
subpart and to which the requirements for new sources apply is: An 
affected source for which construction or reconstruction commenced after 
April 2, 1997, and the standard was applicable at the time of 
construction or reconstruction; or a pharmaceutical manufacturing 
process unit (PMPU) dedicated to manufacturing a single product that has 
the potential to emit 10 tons per year of any one HAP or 25 tons per 
year of combined HAP for which construction commenced after April 2, 
1997 or reconstruction commenced after October 21, 1999.
    (c) General Provisions. Table 1 of this subpart specifies and 
clarifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to an 
owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart. The 
provisions of subpart A specified in Table 1 are the only provisions of 
subpart A that apply to an affected source subject to this subpart.
    (d) Processes exempted from the affected source. The provisions of 
this subpart do not apply to research and development facilities.
    (e) Storage tank ownership determination. The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) 
of this section to determine to which PMPU a storage tank shall belong. 
If an owner or operator produces only pharmaceutical products, the 
procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section 
are required only to determine applicability and demonstrate compliance 
with the pollution-prevention alternative specified in Sec. 63.1252(e), 
or to determine new source applicability for a PMPU dedicated to 
manufacturing a single product as specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (1) If a storage tank is dedicated to a single PMPU, the storage 
tank shall belong to that PMPU.
    (2) If a storage tank is shared among process units (including at 
least one PMPU), then the storage tank shall belong to the process unit 
located on the same plant site as the storage tank that has the greatest 
annual volume input into or output from the storage tank (i.e., said 
PMPU or process unit has the predominant use of the storage tank).
    (3) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage tank that 
is shared among process units (including at least one PMPU), then the 
owner or operator shall assign the storage tank to any one of the PMPU's 
that shares it and is also subject to this subpart.
    (4) If the predominant use of a storage tank varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization 
that occurred during the year preceding September 21, 1998 for existing 
affected sources. For new affected sources, predominant use will be 
based on the first year after initial startup. The determination of 
predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance 
Status required by Sec. 63.1260(f). If the predominant use changes, the 
redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next 
Periodic report.
    (5) If the storage tank begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) another PMPU, or ceases to receive material from (or send 
material to) a PMPU, or if the applicability of this subpart to a 
storage tank has been determined according to the provisions of 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section and there is a significant 
change in the use of the storage tank that could reasonably change the 
predominant use, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the 
applicability of this subpart to the storage tank and report such 
changes to EPA in the next Periodic report.

[[Page 114]]

    (f) Compliance dates. The compliance dates for affected sources are 
as follows:
    (1) An owner or operator of an existing affected source must comply 
with the provisions of this subpart no later than October 21, 2002.
    (2) An owner or operator of a new or reconstructed affected source 
must comply with the provisions of this subpart on August 29, 2000 or 
upon startup, whichever is later.
    (3) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, a new source which commences construction or reconstruction 
after April 2, 1997 and before September 21, 1998 shall not be required 
to comply with this subpart until September 21, 2001 if:
    (i) The requirements of this subpart are more stringent than the 
requirements of this subpart in effect before August 29, 2000 and 
contained in the 40 CFR, part (63.1200-end), edition revised as of July 
1, 2000; and
    (ii) The owner or operator complies with the requirements published 
on April 2, 1997 (62 FR 15754) during the period until September 21, 
2001.
    (4) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, a new source which commences construction or reconstruction 
after September 21, 1998 and before April 10, 2000 shall not be required 
to comply with this subpart until October 21, 2002 if:
    (i) The requirements of this subpart are more stringent than the 
requirements of this subpart in effect before August 29, 2000; and
    (ii) The owner or operator complies with the requirements of this 
subpart in effect before August 29, 2000 during the period between 
startup and October 21, 2002.
    (5) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, a new source which commences construction or reconstruction 
after April 10, 2000 and before August 29, 2000 shall not be required to 
comply with this subpart until August 29, 2001 if:
    (i) The requirements of this subpart are more stringent than the 
requirements published on April 10, 2000 (65 FR 19152); and
    (ii) The owner or operator complies with the requirements of this 
subpart in effect before August 29, 2000 during the period between 
startup and August 29, 2001.
    (6) Pursuant to section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, an owner or 
operator may request an extension allowing the existing source up to 1 
additional year to comply with section 112(d) standards.
    (i) For purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall 
be submitted no later than 120 days prior to the compliance dates 
specified in paragraphs (f) (1) through (5) of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section. The dates specified in 
Sec. 63.6(i) for submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply 
to sources subject to this subpart.
    (ii) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request 
after the date specified in paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section provided 
the need for the compliance extension arose after that date and before 
the otherwise applicable compliance date, and the need arose due to 
circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This 
request shall include the data described in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i) (A), 
(B), (C), and (D).
    (g) Applicability of this subpart except during periods of startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction. (1) Each provision set forth in this subpart 
shall apply at all times except that emission limitations shall not 
apply during periods of: startup; shutdown; and malfunction, if the 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction precludes the ability of a particular 
emission point of an affected source to comply with one or more specific 
emission limitations to which it is subject and the owner or operator 
follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction, as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.1259(a)(3) and 63.1260(i). 
Startup, shutdown, and malfunction are defined in Sec. 63.1251.
    (2) The provisions set forth in Sec. 63.1255 of this subpart shall 
apply at all times except during periods of nonoperation of the PMPU (or 
specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and 
depressurized resulting in the cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 
63.1255 of this subpart applies.
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with the emissions 
limitations of this

[[Page 115]]

subpart during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater 
streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment, if 
the shutdown would contravene emissions limitations of this subpart 
applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if 
the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or if the owner or operator 
must shut down the equipment to avoid damage due to a malfunction of the 
PMPU or portion thereof.
    (4) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emissions 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this paragraph, 
``excess emissions'' means emissions in excess of those that would have 
occurred if there were no startup, shutdown, or malfunction and the 
owner or operator complied with the relevant provisions of this subpart. 
The measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not limited to, 
air pollution control technologies, work practices, pollution 
prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the 
source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if 
available.
    (h) Consistency with other regulations.--(1) Compliance with other 
MACT standards. (i) After the compliance dates specified in this 
section, an affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart 
that is also subject to the provisions of any other subpart of this part 
63 may elect to comply with either the provisions of this subpart or the 
provisions of another applicable subpart governing the maintenance of 
records and reporting to EPA. The affected source shall identify in the 
Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 63.1260(f) 
under which authority such records will be maintained.
    (ii) After the compliance dates specified in paragraph (f) of this 
section, at an offsite reloading or cleaning facility subject to Sec. 
63.1253(f), compliance with the emission standards and associated 
initial compliance, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions 
of any other subpart of this part 63 constitutes compliance with the 
provisions of Sec. 63.1253(f)(7) (ii) or (iii). The owner or operator 
of the affected storage tank shall identify in the Notification of 
Compliance Status report required by Sec. 63.1260(f) the subpart of 
this part 63 with which the owner or operator of the offsite reloading 
or cleaning facility complies.
    (2) Consistency with 40 CFR parts 264 and 265, subparts AA, BB, and/
or CC. (i) After the compliance dates specified in this section, if any 
control device subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subpart 
AA, BB, or CC, or is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping 
requirements in 40 CFR part 265, subpart AA, BB, or CC, and the owner or 
operator complies with the periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR 
part 264, subpart AA, BB, or CC that would apply to the device if the 
facility had final-permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to 
comply either with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements of this subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in 
this paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this subpart. If the owner 
or operator elects to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, the owner or 
operator shall report all information required by Sec. 63.1260(g) and 
(i). The owner or operator shall identify in the Notification of 
Compliance Status, required by Sec. 63.1260(f), the monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting authority under which the owner or operator 
will comply.
    (ii) After the compliance dates specified in this section, if any 
equipment at an affected source that is subject to Sec. 63.1255, is 
also subject to 40 CFR part 264, subpart BB, or to 40 CFR part 265, 
subpart BB, then compliance with the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements of 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265

[[Page 116]]

may be used to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
of Sec. 63.1255, to the extent that the requirements of 40 CFR parts 
264 and/or 265 duplicate the requirements of Sec. 63.1255. The owner or 
operator shall identify in the Notification of Compliance Status, 
required by Sec. 63.1260(f), if the owner or operator will comply with 
the recordkeeping and reporting authority under 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 
265.
    (3) Compliance with 40 CFR 60.112(b). After the compliance dates 
specified in this section, a storage tank controlled with a floating 
roof and in compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.112b, subpart 
Kb, constitutes compliance with the provisions of this subpart GGG. A 
storage tank with a fixed roof, closed vent system, and control device 
in compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR 60.112b, subpart Kb must 
comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions of 
this subpart GGG. The owner or operator shall identify in the 
Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 63.1260(f) 
which tanks are in compliance with subpart Kb.
    (4) Compliance with subpart I of this part. After the compliance 
dates specified in this section, an affected source with equipment 
subject to subpart I of this part may elect to comply with either the 
provisions of Sec. 63.1255 or the provisions of subpart H of this part 
for all such equipment. The owner or operator shall identify in the 
Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 63.1260(f) 
the provisions with which the owner elects to comply.
    (5) Compliance with other regulations for wastewater. After the 
compliance dates specified in this section, the owner or operator of an 
affected wastewater stream that is also subject to provisions in 40 CFR 
parts 260 through 272 may elect to determine whether this subpart or 40 
CFR parts 260 through 272 contain the more stringent control 
requirements (e.g., design, operation, and inspection requirements for 
waste management units; numerical treatment standards; etc.) and the 
more stringent testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. 
Compliance with provisions of 40 CFR parts 260 through 272 that are 
determined to be more stringent than the requirements of this subpart 
constitutes compliance with this subpart. For example, provisions of 40 
CFR parts 260 through 272 for treatment units that meet the conditions 
specified in Sec. 63.1256(g)(13) constitute compliance with this 
subpart. In the Notification of Compliance Status report required by 
Sec. 63.1260(f), the owner or operator shall identify the more 
stringent provisions of 40 CFR parts 260 through 272 with which the 
owner or operator will comply. The owner or operator shall also identify 
in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 
63.1260(f) the information and procedures used to make any stringency 
determinations. If the owner or operator does not elect to determine the 
more stringent requirements, the owner or operator must comply with both 
the provisions of 40 CFR parts 260 through 272 and the provisions of 
this subpart.
    (6) Compliance with subpart PPP of this part. After the compliance 
dates specified in this section, an affected source with equipment in a 
pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit that is also part of an 
affected source under subpart PPP of this part may elect to demonstrate 
compliance with Sec. 63.1254 by controlling all process vents in 
accordance with Sec. 63.1425 (b), (c)(1), (c)(3), (d), and/or (f). 
Alternatively, the owner or operator may elect to determine which 
process vents must be controlled to comply with the percent reduction 
requirements of Sec. 63.1254 and control only those vents in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1425 (b), (c)(1), (c)(3), (d), and/or (f). For any 
pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit controlled in accordance with 
the requirements of Sec. 63.1425, the owner or operator must also 
comply with all other requirements in subpart PPP of this part. In the 
Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 63.1260(f), 
the owner or operator shall identify which pharmaceutical manufacturing 
process units are meeting the control requirements for process vents and 
all other requirements of subpart PPP of this part, and the owner or 
operator shall describe the calculations and other information used to 
identify which process vents must be controlled to comply with the 
percent reduction requirements of Sec. 63.1254, if applicable.

Sec. 63.1251  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of 
this part, or in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A 
of this part and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in 
this section for the purposes of this subpart.
    Active ingredient means any material that is intended to furnish 
pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, 
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the

either uncontrolled or controlled emission points.
    Air pollution control device or Control device means equipment 
installed on a process vent, storage tank, wastewater treatment exhaust 
stack, or combination thereof that reduces the mass of HAP emitted to 
the air. The equipment may consist of an individual device or a series 
of devices. Examples include, but are not limited to, incinerators, 
carbon adsorption units, condensers, flares, boilers, process heaters, 
and gas absorbers. Process condensers are not considered air pollution 
control devices or control devices.
    Annual average concentration, as used in the wastewater provisions 
in Sec. 63.1256, means the total mass of partially soluble and/or 
soluble HAP compounds in a wastewater stream during the calendar year

    Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that may be 
associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more 
than one batch emission episode. For example, a displacement of vapor 
resulting from the charging of a vessel with HAP will result in a 
discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the 
charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the 
charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another 
discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded 
vapor. Both emission episodes may occur in the same vessel or unit 
operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur 
from the vessel or other process equipment, depending on process 
operations.
    Batch operation or Batch process means a noncontinuous operation 
involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into equipment, and, in 
general, involves the emptying of the equipment after the batch 
operation ceases and prior to beginning a new operation. Addition of raw 
material and withdrawal of product do not occur simultaneously in a 
batch operation.
    Bench-scale batch process means a batch process (other than a 
research and development facility) that is capable of being located on a 
laboratory bench top. This bench-scale equipment will typically include 
reagent feed vessels, a small reactor and associated product separator,

recordkeeping, connector means joined fittings that are not 
inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined as described in Sec. 
63.1255(b)(1)(vii) and Sec. 63.1255(f)(3).
    Construction means the onsite fabrication, erection, or installation 
of an affected source or a PMPU. Addition of new equipment to a PMPU 
subject to existing source standards does not constitute construction, 
but it may constitute reconstruction of the affected source or PMPU if 
it satisfies the definition of reconstruction in this section.
    Consumption means the quantity of all HAP raw materials entering a 
process in excess of the theoretical amount used as reactant, assuming 
100 percent stoichiometric conversion. The raw materials include 
reactants, solvents, and any other additives. If a HAP is generated in 
the process as well as added as a raw material, consumption includes the 
quantity generated in the process.
    Container, as used in the wastewater provisions, means any portable 
waste management unit that has a capacity greater than or equal to 0.1 
m\3\ in which a material is stored, transported, treated, or otherwise 
handled. Examples of containers are drums, barrels, tank trucks, barges,

    (7) Calculations and engineering analyses required to demonstrate 
compliance; and
    (8) For reporting purposes, a change to any of these elements not 
previously reported, except for paragraph (5) of this definition, shall 
constitute a new operating scenario.
    Partially soluble HAP means a HAP listed in Table 2 of this subpart.
    Pharmaceutical manufacturing operations means the facilitywide 
collection of PMPU and any other equipment such as heat exchanger 
systems, wastewater and waste management units, or cooling towers that 
are not associated with an individual PMPU, but that are located at a 
facility for the purpose of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and 
are under common control.
    Pharmaceutical manufacturing process unit (PMPU) means the process, 
as defined in this subpart, and any associated storage tanks, equipment 
identified in Sec. 63.1252(f), and components such as pumps, 
compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection 
systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, and 
instrumentation systems that are used in the manufacturing of a 
pharmaceutical product.
    Pharmaceutical product means any of the following materials, 
excluding any material that is a nonreactive solvent,

[[Page 123]]

excipient, binder, or filler, or any material that is produced in a 
chemical manufacturing process unit that is subject to the requirements 
of subparts F and G of this part 63:
    (1) Any material described by the standard industrial classification 
(SIC) code 2833 or 2834; or
    (2) Any material whose manufacturing process is described by North 
American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 325411 or 325412; 
or
    (3) A finished dosage form of a drug, for example, a tablet, 
capsule, solution, etc.; or
    (4) Any active ingredient or precursor that is produced at a 
facility whose primary manufacturing operations are described by SIC 
code 2833 or 2834; or
    (5) At a facility whose primary operations are not described by SIC 
code 2833 or 2834, any material whose primary use is as an active 
ingredient or precursor.
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Point of determination (POD) means the point where a wastewater 
stream exits the process, storage tank, or last recovery device. If 
soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds are not recovered from 
water before discharge, the discharge point from the process equipment 
or storage tank is a POD. If water streams are routed to a recovery 
device, the discharge from the recovery device is a POD. There can be 
more than 1 POD per process or PMPU.
    Precursor means a material that is manufactured to undergo further 
chemical change or processing to ultimately manufacture an active 
ingredient or finished dosage form of a drug. This term does not include 
commodity chemicals produced by the synthetic organic chemical 
manufacturing industry.
    Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the 
system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure 
relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases 
over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
    Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to 
prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working 
pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a 
spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by 
a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 psig or by a vacuum are not 
pressure relief devices.
    Primary use means 50 percent or more of a material is used for a 
particular purpose.
    Process means all equipment which collectively function to produce a 
pharmaceutical product or isolated intermediate (which is also a 
pharmaceutical product). A process may consist of one or more unit 
operations. For the purposes of this subpart, process includes any, all, 
or a combination of reaction, recovery, separation, purification, or 
other activity, operation, manufacture, or treatment which are used to 
produce a pharmaceutical product or isolated intermediate. Cleaning 
operations conducted are considered part of the process. Nondedicated 
solvent recovery operations located within a contiguous area within the 
affected source are considered single processes. A storage tank that is 
used to accumulate used solvent from multiple batches of a single 
process for purposes of solvent recovery does not represent the end of 
the process. Nondedicated formulation operations occurring within a 
contiguous area are considered a single process that is used to 
formulate numerous materials and/or products. Quality assurance and 
quality control laboratories are not considered part of any process. 
Ancillary activities are not considered a process or part of any 
process. Ancillary activities include boilers and incinerators (not used 
to comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1253, Sec. 63.1254, or Sec. 
63.1256(h)), chillers and refrigeration systems, and other equipment and 
activities that are not directly involved (i.e., they operate within a 
closed system and materials are not combined with process fluids) in the 
processing of raw materials or the manufacturing of a pharmaceutical 
product.

[[Page 124]]

    Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to 
recover material as an integral part of a process. The condenser must 
support a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods of source equipment 
operation that are at or above the boiling or bubble point of 
substance(s) at the liquid surface. Examples of process condensers 
include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used 
in stripping or flashing operations. In a series of condensers, all 
condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas 
temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the substance(s) at the 
liquid surface are considered to be process condensers. All condensers 
in line prior to a vacuum source are included in this definition.
    Process shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that 
stops production from a process or part of a process during which it is 
technically feasible to clear process material from a process or part of 
a process consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs 
can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure 
that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 
24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or 
operational procedure that would stop production from a process or part 
of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to 
clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the 
process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of 
leaking components until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a 
process shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible 
bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process 
shutdowns.
    Process tank means a tank that is used to collect material 
discharged from a feedstock storage tank or unit operation and to 
transfer this material to another unit operation within the process or 
to a product storage tank. Surge control vessels and bottoms receivers 
that fit these conditions are considered process tanks. Product storage 
tanks are considered process tanks and are part of the PMPU that produce 
the stored material. For the purposes of this subpart, vents from 
process tanks are considered process vents.
    Process vent means a vent from a unit operation or vents from 
multiple unit operations within a process that are manifolded together 
into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or 
has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Examples of process 
vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for 
product recovery, bottom receivers, surge control vessels, reactors, 
filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. Emission streams that are 
undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP, as 
determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the 
emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(2)(ii), test data using Methods 18 of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, or any other test method that has been validated according 
to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part, are not 
considered process vents. Process vents do not include vents on storage 
tanks regulated under Sec. 63.1253, vents on wastewater emission 
sources regulated under Sec. 63.1256, or pieces of equipment regulated 
under Sec. 63.1255.
    Production-indexed HAP consumption factor is the result of dividing 
the annual consumption of total HAP by the annual production rate, per 
process.
    Production-indexed volatile organic compound (VOC) consumption 
factor is the result of dividing the annual consumption of total VOC by 
the annual production rate, per process.
    Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) means any devices and systems 
used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal 
sewage or industrial wastes of a liquid nature as defined in section 
212(2)(A) of the Clean Water Act, as amended [33 U.S.C. Sec. 
1292(2)(A)]. A POTW includes the treatment works, intercepting sewers, 
outfall sewers, sewage collection systems, pumping, power, and other 
equipment. The POTW is defined at 40 CFR 403.3(o).
    Reactor means a device or vessel in which one or more chemicals or 
reactants, other than air, are combined or decomposed in such a way that 
their molecular structures are altered and

[[Page 125]]

one or more new organic compounds are formed.
    Reconstruction, as used in Sec. 63.1250(b), shall have the meaning 
given in Sec. 63.2, except that ``affected or previously unaffected 
stationary source'' shall mean either ``affected facility'' or ``PMPU.'' 
As used in Sec. 63.1254(a)(3)(ii)(A)(3), reconstruction shall have the 
meaning given in Sec. 63.2, except that ``source'' shall mean ``control 
device.''
    Recovery device, as used in the wastewater provisions, means an 
individual unit of equipment used for the purpose of recovering 
chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, 
or for sale for fuel value, use or reuse. Examples of equipment that may 
be recovery devices include organic removal devices such as decanters, 
strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. To be a recovery device, a 
decanter and any other equipment based on the operating principle of 
gravity separation must receive only two-phase liquid streams.
    Repaired means that equipment:
    (1) Is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak as 
defined in the applicable paragraphs of Sec. 63.1255, and;
    (2) Is, unless otherwise specified in applicable provisions of Sec. 
63.1255, monitored as specified in Sec. 63.180(b) and (c) as 
appropriate, to verify that emissions from the equipment are below the 
applicable leak definition.
    Research and development facility means any stationary source whose 
primary purpose is to conduct research and development into new 
processes and products, where such source is operated under the close 
supervision of technically trained personnel, and is not engaged in the 
manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de 
minimis manner.
    Residual means any HAP-containing liquid or solid material that is 
removed from a wastewater stream by a waste management unit or treatment 
process that does not destroy organics (nondestructive unit). Examples 
of residuals from nondestructive waste management units are: the organic 
layer and bottom residue removed by a decanter or organic-water 
separator and the overheads from a steam stripper or air stripper. 
Examples of materials which are not residuals are: silt; mud; leaves; 
bottoms from a steam stripper or air stripper; and sludges, ash, or 
other materials removed from wastewater being treated by destructive 
devices such as biological treatment units and incinerators.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent 
deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting 
gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine 
venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover 
such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this 
vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature 
fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position 
during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or 
another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting 
applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the 
owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable 
regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering 
codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of 
flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
    Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a 
process unit used during periods of representative operation to take 
samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab 
samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
    Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the 
change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, 
pH, or liquid level.
    Set pressure means the pressure at which a properly operating 
pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system 
operating pressure.

[[Page 126]]

    Sewer line means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other 
conduit including, but not limited to, grates, trenches, etc., used to 
convey wastewater streams or residuals to a downstream waste management 
unit.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of a continuous process 
for any purpose. Shutdown also means the cessation of a batch process or 
any related individual piece of equipment required or used to comply 
with this subpart as a result of a malfunction or for replacement of 
equipment, repair, or any other purpose not excluded from this 
definition. Shutdown also applies to emptying and degassing storage 
vessels. Shutdown does not apply to cessation of a batch process at the 
end of a campaign, for routine maintenance, for rinsing or washing of 
equipment between batches, or other routine operations.
    Single-seal system means a floating roof having one continuous seal 
that completely covers the space between the wall of the storage tank 
and the edge of the floating roof. This seal may be a vapor-mounted, 
liquid-mounted, or metallic shoe seal.
    Small control device means a control device that controls total HAP 
emissions of less than 10 tons/yr, before control.
    Soluble HAP means a HAP listed in Table 3 of this subpart.
    Standard batch means a batch process operated within a range of 
operating conditions that are documented in an operating scenario. 
Emissions from a standard batch are based on the operating conditions 
that result in highest emissions. The standard batch defines the 
uncontrolled and controlled emissions for each emission episode defined 
under the operating scenario.
    Startup means the setting in operation of a continuous process unit 
for any purpose; the first time a new or reconstructed batch process 
unit begins production; for new equipment added, including equipment 
used to comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment is put 
into operation; or, for the introduction of a new product/process, the 
first time the product or process is run in equipment. For batch process 
units, startup does not apply to the first time the equipment is put 
into operation at the start of a campaign to produce a product that has 
been produced in the past, after a shutdown for maintenance, or when the 
equipment is put into operation as part of a batch within a campaign. As 
used in Sec. 63.1255, startup means the setting in operation of a piece 
of equipment or a control device that is subject to this subpart.
    Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
organic liquids that contain one or more HAP as raw material feedstocks. 
Storage tank also means a tank or other vessel in a tank farm that 
receives and accumulates used solvent from multiple batches of a process 
or processes for purposes of solvent recovery. The following are not 
considered storage tanks for the purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels storing organic liquids that contain HAP only as 
impurities;
    (4) Wastewater storage tanks; and
    (5) Process tanks (including product tanks and isolated intermediate 
tanks).
    Supplemental gases are any gaseous streams that are not defined as 
process vents, or closed-vent systems from wastewater management and 
treatment units, storage tanks, or equipment components and that contain 
less than 50 ppmv TOC, as determined through process knowledge, that are 
introduced into vent streams or manifolds. Air required to operate 
combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental gas.
    Surface impoundment means a waste management unit which is a natural 
topographic depression, manmade excavation, or diked area formed 
primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with manmade 
materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquid wastes 
or waste containing free liquids. A surface impoundment is used for the 
purpose of treating, storing, or disposing of wastewater or residuals, 
and is not an injection well. Examples of surface impoundments are 
equalization, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.

[[Page 127]]

    System flowrate means the flowrate of gas entering the control 
device.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures of Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    Treatment process means a specific technique that removes or 
destroys the organics in a wastewater or residual stream such as a steam 
stripping unit, thin-film evaporation unit, waste incinerator, 
biological treatment unit, or any other process applied to wastewater 
streams or residuals to comply with Sec. 63.1256. Most treatment 
processes are conducted in tanks. Treatment processes are a subset of 
waste management units.
    Uncontrolled HAP emissions means a gas stream containing HAP which 
has exited the process (or process condenser, if any), but which has not 
yet been introduced into an air pollution control device to reduce the 
mass of HAP in the stream. If the process vent is not routed to an air 
pollution control device, uncontrolled emissions are those HAP emissions 
released to the atmosphere.
    Unit operation means those processing steps that occur within 
distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare 
reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and 
recycle materials. Equipment used for these purposes includes but is not 
limited to reactors, distillation columns, extraction columns, 
absorbers, decanters, dryers, condensers, and filtration equipment.
    Vapor-mounted seal means a continuous seal that completely covers 
the annular space between the wall of the storage tank or waste 
management unit and the edge of the floating roof and is mounted such 
that there is a vapor space between the stored liquid and the bottom of 
the seal.
    Volatile organic compounds (VOC) means those materials defined in 40 
CFR 51.100.
    Waste management unit means the equipment, structure(s),and or 
devices used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams 
or residuals. Examples of waste management units include wastewater 
tanks, air flotation units, surface impoundments, containers, oil-water 
or organic-water separators, individual drain systems, biological 
wastewater treatment units, waste incinerators, and organic removal 
devices such as steam and air stripper units, and thin film evaporation 
units. If such equipment is used for recovery then it is part of a 
pharmaceutical process and is not a waste management unit.
    Wastewater means any portion of an individual wastewater stream or 
any aggregation of wastewater streams.
    Wastewater stream means water that is discarded from a PMPU through 
a single POD, that contains an annual average concentration of partially 
soluble and/or soluble HAP compounds of at least 5 parts per million by 
weight and a load of at least 0.05 kg/yr. The following are not 
considered wastewater streams for the purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Stormwater from segregated sewers;
    (2) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems, including testing 
of such systems;
    (3) Spills;
    (4) Water from safety showers;
    (5) Samples of a size not greater than reasonably necessary for the 
method of analysis that is used;
    (6) Equipment leaks;
    (7) Wastewater drips from procedures such as disconnecting hoses 
after clearing lines; and
    (8) Noncontact cooling water.
    Wastewater tank means a stationary waste management unit that is 
designed to contain an accumulation of wastewater or residuals and is 
constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, 
steel, plastic) which provide structural support. Wastewater tanks used 
for flow equalization are included in this definition.
    Water seal controls means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of 
trap filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain water levels 
adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a water 
barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The

[[Page 128]]

water level of the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a 
drain in order to be considered a water seal.

Sec. 63.1252  Standards: General.

    Each owner or operator of any affected source subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall control HAP emissions to the level 
specified in this section on and after the compliance dates specified in 
Sec. 63.1250(f). Initial compliance with the emission limits is 
demonstrated in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 63.1257, and 
continuous compliance is demonstrated in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 63.1258.
    (a) Opening of a safety device. Opening of a safety device, as 
defined in Sec. 63.1251, is allowed at any time conditions require it 
to do so to avoid unsafe conditions.
    (b) Closed-vent systems. The owner or operator of a closed-vent 
system that contains bypass lines that could divert a vent stream away 
from a control device used to comply with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 
63.1253, 63.1254, and 63.1256 shall comply with the requirements of 
Table 4 to this subpart and paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. 
Equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, 
open-ended valves or lines, rupture disks and pressure relief valves 
needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph.
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that 
determines whether vent stream flow is present at least once every 15 
minutes. Records shall be maintained as specified in Sec. 
63.1259(i)(6)(i). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance 
to any bypass line that could divert the vent stream away from the 
control device to the atmosphere; or
    (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car 
seal or lock and key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal 
or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to 
ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent 
stream is not diverted through the bypass line. Records shall be 
maintained as specified in Sec. 63.1259(i)(6)(ii).
    (c) Heat exchange systems. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, owners and operators of affected sources shall comply with 
the requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for heat exchange 
systems that cool process equipment or materials used in pharmaceutical 
manufacturing operations.
    (1) The heat exchange system shall be treated according to the 
provisions of Sec. 63.104, except that the monitoring frequency shall 
be no less than quarterly.
    (2) For identifying leaking equipment, the owner or operator of heat 
exchange systems on equipment which meet current good manufacturing 
practice (CGMP) requirements of 21 CFR part 211 may elect to use the 
physical integrity of the reactor as the surrogate indicator of heat 
exchange system leaks around the reactor.
    (d) Emissions averaging provisions. Except as specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section, owners or operators of 
storage tanks or processes subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 
63.1253 and 63.1254 may choose to comply by using emissions averaging 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1257(g) or (h) for any storage tank 
or process.
    (1) A State may prohibit averaging of HAP emissions and require the 
owner or operator of an existing source to comply with the provisions in 
Sec. Sec. 63.1253 and 63.1254.
    (2) Only emission sources subject to the requirements of Sec. 
63.1253(b)(1) or (c)(1)(i) or Sec. 63.1254(a)(1)(i) may be included in 
any averaging group.
    (3) Processes which have been permanently shutdown or storage tanks 
permanently taken out of HAP service may not be included in any 
averaging group.
    (4) Processes and storage tanks already controlled on or before 
November 15, 1990 may not be included in an emissions averaging group, 
except where the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990. 
In these cases, the uncontrolled emissions shall be the controlled 
emissions as calculated on November 15, 1990 for the purpose of 
determining the uncontrolled emissions as specified in Sec. 63.1257(g) 
and (h).
    (5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal 
rule other than this subpart may not be

[[Page 129]]

credited in an emission averaging group, unless the level of control has 
been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the 
other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by 
the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an 
emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in 
an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made 
subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point 
can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of 
complying with the previously approved average.
    (6) Not more than 20 processes subject to Sec. 63.1254(a)(1)(i), 
and 20 storage tanks subject to Sec. 63.1253(b)(1) or (c)(1)(i) at an 
affected source may be included in an emissions averaging group.
    (7) Compliance with the emission standards in Sec. 63.1253 shall be 
satisfied when the annual percent reduction efficiency is greater than 
or equal to 90 percent for those tanks meeting the criteria of Sec. 
63.1253(a)(1) and 95 percent for those tanks meeting the criteria of 
Sec. 63.1253(a)(2), as demonstrated using the test methods and 
compliance procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(g).
    (8) Compliance with the emission standards in Sec. 63.1254(a)(1)(i) 
shall be satisfied when the annual percent reduction efficiency is 
greater than or equal to 93 percent, as demonstrated using the test 
methods and compliance procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(h).
    (e) Pollution prevention alternative. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may choose to 
meet the pollution prevention alternative requirement specified in 
either paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section for any PMPU or for any 
situation described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, in lieu of the 
requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.1253, 63.1254, 63.1255, and 
63.1256. Compliance with paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section shall 
be demonstrated through the procedures in Sec. 63.1257(f). Any PMPU for 
which the owner or operator seeks to comply by using the pollution 
prevention alternative shall begin with the same starting material(s) 
and end with the same product(s). The owner or operator may not comply 
with the pollution prevention alternative by eliminating any steps of a 
process by transferring the step offsite (to another manufacturing 
location).
    (1) The HAP that are generated in the PMPU that are not part of the 
production-indexed consumption factor must be controlled according to 
the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.1253, 63.1254, 63.1255, and 63.1256. 
The hydrogen halides that are generated as a result of combustion 
control of emissions must be controlled according to the requirements of 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (2) The production-indexed HAP consumption factor (kg HAP consumed/
kg produced) shall be reduced by at least 75 percent from a 3 year 
average baseline established no earlier than the 1987 calendar year, or 
for the time period from startup of the process until the present in 
which the PMPU was operational and data are available, whichever is the 
lesser time period. If a time period less than 3 years is used to set 
the baseline, the data must represent at least 1 year's worth of data. 
For any reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP that is 
also a VOC, an equivalent reduction in the VOC factor is also required. 
For any reduction in the HAP factor that is achieved by reducing a HAP 
that is not a VOC, the VOC factor may not be increased.
    (3) Both requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of 
this section are met.
    (i) The production-indexed HAP consumption factor (kg HAP consumed/
kg produced) shall be reduced by at least 50 percent from a 3-year 
average baseline established no earlier than the 1987 calendar year, or 
for the time period from startup of the process until the present in 
which the PMPU was operational and data are available, whichever is 
less. If a time period less than 3 years is used to set the baseline, 
the data must represent at least 1 year's worth of data. For any 
reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP that is also a 
VOC, an equivalent reduction in the VOC factor is also required. For any 
reduction in the HAP factor that is achieved by reducing a HAP that is 
not a VOC, the VOC factor may not be increased.

[[Page 130]]

    (ii) The total PMPU HAP emissions shall be reduced by an amount, in 
kg/yr, that, when divided by the annual production rate, in kg/yr, and 
added to the reduction of the production-indexed HAP consumption factor, 
in kg/kg, yields a value of at least 75 percent of the average baseline 
HAP production-indexed consumption factor established according to 
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section according to the equation provided 
in Sec. 63.1257(f)(2)(ii)(A). The total PMPU VOC emissions shall be 
reduced by an amount calculated according to the equation provided in 
Sec. 63.1257(f)(2)(ii)(B). The annual reduction in HAP and VOC air 
emissions must be due to the use of the following control devices:
    (A) Combustion control devices such as incinerators, flares or 
process heaters.
    (B) Control devices such as condensers and carbon adsorbers whose 
recovered product is destroyed or shipped offsite for destruction.
    (C) Any control device that does not ultimately allow for recycling 
of material back to the PMPU.
    (D) Any control device for which the owner or operator can 
demonstrate that the use of the device in controlling HAP emissions will 
have no effect on the production-indexed consumption factor for the 
PMPU.
    (4) The owner or operator may comply with the requirements in either 
paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section for a series of processes, 
including situations where multiple processes are merged, subject to the 
following conditions:
    (i) The baseline period shall be a single year beginning no earlier 
than the 1992 calendar year.
    (ii) The term ``PMPU'' shall have the meaning provided in Sec. 
63.1251 except that the baseline and modified PMPU may include multiple 
processes (i.e., precursors, active ingredients, and final dosage form) 
if the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the multiple processes were merged after the baseline 
period into an existing process or processes.
    (iii) Nondedicated formulation and solvent recovery processes may 
not be merged with any other processes.
    (f) Control requirements for certain liquid streams in open systems 
within a PMPU. (1) The owner or operator shall comply with the

with an annual average concentration greater than or equal to 1,300 ppmw 
of partially soluble HAP compounds, or greater than or equal to 5,200 
ppmw of total partially soluble and/or soluble HAP compounds. The owner 
or operator of the source shall determine the average concentration of 
the stream at the inlet to the tank and according to the procedures in 
Sec. 63.1257(e)(1)(ii).
    (g) Control requirements for halogenated vent streams that are 
controlled by combustion devices. If a combustion device is used to 
comply with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 63.1253 (storage tanks), 
63.1254 (process vents), 63.1256(h) (wastewater vent streams) for a 
halogenated vent stream, then the vent stream shall be ducted to a

provisions specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) For equipment leaks and wastewater emissions that normally are 
controlled by the CCCD, if any, the owner or operator must continue to 
comply with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.1255(b)(4)(ii) and 
63.1256(h), respectively, using other control devices during the planned 
routine maintenance period for the CCCD.
    (2) During the planned routine maintenance period, the owner or 
operator must route emissions from process vents with organic HAP 
emissions greater than 15 pounds per day (lb/day) through a closed-vent 
system to a condenser that meets the conditions specified in paragraphs 
(h)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) The outlet gas temperature must be less than -50 [deg]C (-58 
[deg]F) when the emission stream contains organic HAP with a partial

shall mean each vent from a unit operation. The emission calculation 
shall not be performed on the aggregated emission stream from multiple 
unit operations that are manifolded together into a common header. Once 
an affected process vent has been controlled in accordance with this 
section, it is no longer subject to the requirements of this section or 
Sec. 63.1254 during the routine maintenance period.
    (5) The total period of planned routine maintenance, during which 
non-dedicated PMPU's that are normally controlled by the CCCD continue 
to operate, and process vent emissions are controlled as specified in 
paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section, must not exceed 240 hours in 
any 365-day period.
    (6) While being controlled as specified in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3)

operator may comply with the provisions in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A), (B), 
or (C) of this section, if applicable.
    (A) Control device operation. If the owner or operator can 
demonstrate that a process vent is controlled by a control device 
meeting the criteria specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A)(1) of this 
section, then the control device is required to be operated according to 
paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A)(2), (3), and (4) of this section:
    (1) The control device was installed on any process vent that met 
the conditions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section on or before April

63.1252(h) during planned routine maintenance of the CCCD.
    (B) If the owner or operator reduces HAP emissions from process 
vents by

[[Page 136]]

using a CCCD that is also a control device specified in Sec. 
63.1257(a)(4), implement the provisions in Sec. 63.1252(h) during 
planned routine maintenance of the CCCD.
    (C) If the owner or operator uses a CCCD to reduce emissions from a 
process vent subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, implement the 
planned routine maintenance provisions in Sec. 63.1252(h) for that vent 
only if the reason the planned routine maintenance is needed, and the 
reason it cannot be performed at a time when the vent subject to 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section is not operating, has been described in 
the Notification of Compliance Status Report or a periodic report 
submitted before the planned routine maintenance event.
    (b) New sources. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, uncontrolled HAP emissions from the sum of all process vents 
within a process at a new affected source shall be reduced by 98 percent 
or greater by weight or controlled in accordance with any of 
requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section. 
Initial compliance with the required emission limit or reduction is 
demonstrated in accordance with the initial compliance procedures in 
Sec. 63.1257(d), and continuous compliance is demonstrated in 
accordance with the monitoring requirements described in Sec. 63.1258.
    (2) Annual mass limit. The actual HAP emissions from the sum of all 
process vents for which the owner or operator is not complying with 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section are limited to 900 kg in any 365-day 
period.
    (c) Alternative standard. As an alternative standard, the owner or 
operator of an existing or new affected source may comply with the 
process vent standards by routing vents from a process to a combustion 
control device achieving an outlet TOC concentration, as calibrated on 
methane or the predominant HAP, of 20 ppmv or less, and an outlet 
concentration of hydrogen halides and halogens of 20 ppmv or less. If 
the owner or operator is routing emissions to a noncombustion control 
device, it must achieve an outlet TOC concentration, as calibrated on 
methane or the predominant HAP, of 50 ppmv or less, and an outlet 
concentration of hydrogen halides and halogens of 50 ppmv or less. Any 
process vents within a process that are not routed to this control 
device must be controlled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 
(a) or (b) of this section, as applicable. Initial compliance with the 
outlet concentrations is demonstrated in accordance with the initial 
compliance procedures described in Sec. 63.1257(d)(1)(iv), and 
continuous compliance is demonstrated in accordance with the emission 
monitoring requirements described in Sec. 63.1258(b)(5).

<R05>
Sec. 63.1255  Standards: Equipment leaks.

    (a) General equipment leak requirements. (1) The provisions of this 
section apply to pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, 
sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, 
connectors, instrumentation systems, control devices, and closed-vent 
systems required by this section that are intended to operate in organic 
hazardous air pollutant service 300 hours or more during the calendar 
year within a source subject to the provisions of this subpart.
    (2) Consistency with other regulations. After the compliance date 
for a process, equipment subject to both this section and either of the 
following will be required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart:
    (i) 40 CFR part 60.
    (ii) 40 CFR part 61.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) The provisions in Sec. 63.1(a)(3) of subpart A of this part do 
not alter the provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (5) Lines and equipment not containing process fluids are not 
subject to the provisions of this section. Utilities, and other 
nonprocess lines, such as heating and cooling systems which do not 
combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not 
considered to be part of a process.
    (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to bench-scale 
processes, regardless of whether the processes are located at the same 
plant site as a process subject to the provisions of this subpart.

[[Page 137]]

    (7) Equipment to which this section applies shall be identified such 
that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that is not subject 
to this section. Identification of the equipment does not require 
physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment may be 
identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by designation of 
process boundaries by some form of weatherproof identification. If 
changes are made to the affected source subject to the leak detection 
requirements, equipment identification for each type of component shall 
be updated, if needed, within 90 calendar days or by the next Periodic 
Report following the end of the monitoring period for that component, 
whichever is later.
    (8) Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the 
requirements of this section.
    (9) Equipment that is in organic HAP service, but is in such service 
less than 300 hours per calendar year, is excluded from the requirements 
of this section if it is identified as required in paragraph (g)(9) of 
this section.
    (10) When each leak is detected by visual, audible, or olfactory 
means, or by monitoring as described in Sec. 63.180(b) or (c), the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) A weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with 
the equipment identification number, shall be attached to the leaking 
equipment.
    (ii) The identification on a valve in light liquid or gas/vapor 
service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in 
paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, and no leak has been detected 
during the follow-up monitoring.
    (iii) The identification on equipment, except on a valve in light 
liquid or gas/vapor service, may be removed after it has been repaired.
    (11) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this section, all 
terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of 
required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual) refer to the 
standard calendar periods unless specified otherwise in the section or 
paragraph that imposes the requirement.
    (i) If the initial compliance date does not coincide with the 
beginning of the standard calendar period, an owner or operator may 
elect to utilize a period beginning on the compliance date, or may elect 
to comply in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(11)(ii) or 
(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Time periods specified in this subpart for completion of 
required tasks may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or 
operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part. 
For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period 
shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not 
necessary for each recurring period.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(11)(i) or (ii) of this 
section, where the period specified for compliance is a standard 
calendar period, if the initial compliance date does not coincide with 
the beginning of the calendar period, compliance shall be required 
according to the schedule specified in paragraph (a)(11)(iii)(A) or (B) 
of this section, as appropriate.
    (A) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard 
calendar period within which the initial compliance date occurs if there 
remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 
2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for 
tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for 
tasks that must be performed annually; or
    (B) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end 
of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which 
the initial compliance date occurs.
    (iv) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires 
completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an 
owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during each 
period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after 
completion of the task during the previous period.
    (12) In all cases where the provisions of this subpart require an 
owner or operator to repair leaks by a specified time after the leak is 
detected, it is a violation of this section to fail to take action to 
repair the leaks within the

[[Page 138]]

specified time. If action is taken to repair the leaks within the 
specified time, failure of that action to successfully repair the leak 
is not a violation of this section. However, if the repairs are 
unsuccessful, a leak is detected and the owner or operator shall take 
further action as required by applicable provisions of this section.
    (b) References. (1) The owner or operator of a source subject to 
this section shall comply with the provisions of subpart H of this part, 
as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section. The term 
``process unit'' as used in subpart H of this part shall be considered 
to be defined the same as ``group of processes'' for sources subject to 
this subpart GGG. The term ``fuel gas system,'' as used in subpart H of 
this part, shall not apply for the purposes of this subpart GGG.

at least one pressure

[[Page 139]]

gage or other pressure measurement device that can be read from a 
readily accessible location to verify that negative pressure is being 
maintained in the closed-vent system when the associated control device 
is operating.
    (C) The requirements apply at all times, except as specified in 
Sec. 63.1250(g). The owner or operator may not comply with the planned 
routine maintenance provisions in Sec. 63.1252(h).
    (iii) Section 63.174 shall apply except:
    (A) Section 63.174(f), (g), and (h) shall not apply. Instead of 
Sec. 63.174(f), (g), and (h), the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraph (f) of this section. Section 63.174(b)(3) shall not apply. 
Instead of Sec. 63.174(b)(3), the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraphs (b)(4)(iii)(B) through (F) of this section.
    (B) If the percent leaking connectors in a group of processes was 
greater than or equal to 0.5 percent during the initial monitoring 
period, monitoring shall be performed once per year until the percent 
leaking connectors is less than 0.5 percent.
    (C) If the percent leaking connectors in the group of processes was 
less than 0.5 percent, but equal to or greater than 0.25 percent, during 
the initial or last required monitoring period, the owner or operator 
may elect to monitor once every 4 years. An owner or operator may comply 
with the requirements of this paragraph by monitoring at least 40 
percent of the connectors in the first 2 years and the remainder of the 
connectors within the next 2 years. The percent leaking connectors will 
be calculated for the total of all required monitoring performed during 
the 4-year period.
    (D) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, 
if leaking connectors comprise at least 0.5 percent but less than 1.0 
percent of the connectors during the last monitoring period, the owner 
or operator shall monitor at least once every 2 years for the next 
monitoring period. At the end of that 2-year monitoring period, if the 
percent leaking connectors is greater than or equal to 0.5 percent, the 
owner or operator shall monitor once per year until the percent leaking 
connectors is less than 0.5 percent. If, at the end of a monitoring 
period, the percent leaking connectors is less than 0.5 percent, the 
owner or operator shall monitor in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(4)(iii)(C) or (F) of this section, as appropriate.
    (E) If an owner or operator determines that 1 percent or greater of 
the connectors in a group of processes are leaking, the owner or 
operator shall monitor the connectors once per year. The owner or 
operator may elect to use the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C), 
(D), or (F) of this section, as appropriate, after a monitoring period 
in which less than 1 percent of the connectors are determined to be 
leaking.
    (F) The owner or operator may elect to perform monitoring once every 
8 years if the percent leaking connectors in the group of processes was 
less than 0.25 percent during the initial or last required monitoring 
period. An owner or operator shall monitor at least 50 percent of the 
connectors in the first 4 years and the remainder of the connectors 
within the next 4 years. If the percent leaking connectors in the first 
4 years is equal to or greater than 0.35 percent, the monitoring program 
shall revert at that time to the appropriate monitoring frequency 
specified in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(C), (D), or (E) of this section.
    (iv) Section 63.178 shall apply except:
    (A) Section 63.178(b), requirements for pressure testing, may be 
applied to all processes (not just batch processes) and to supply lines 
between storage and processing areas.
    (B) For pumps, the phrase ``at the frequencies specified in Table 1 
of this subpart'' in Sec. 63.178(c)(3)(iii) shall mean ``quarterly'' 
for the purposes of this subpart.
    (v) Section 63.180 shall apply except Sec. 63.180(b)(4)(ii)(A) 
through (C) shall not apply. Instead, calibration gases shall be a 
mixture of methane and air at a concentration of approximately, but less 
than, 10,000 parts per million methane for agitators; 2,000 parts per 
million for pumps; and 500 parts per million for all other equipment, 
except as provided in Sec. 63.180(b)(4)(iii).
    (vi) When Sec. Sec. 63.171, 63.172, 63.174, 63.178, and 63.180 
reference other sections in subpart H of this part, the references shall 
mean those sections specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4)(i)

through (v) of this section, as applicable.
    (c) Standards for pumps in light liquid service and agitators in 
gas/vapor service and in light liquid service. (1) The provisions of 
this section apply to each pump that is in light organic HAP liquid 
service, and to each agitator in organic HAP gas/vapor service or in 
light organic HAP liquid service.
    (2)(i) Monitoring. Each pump and agitator subject to this section 
shall be monitored quarterly to detect leaks by the method specified in 
Sec. 63.180(b) except as provided in Sec. Sec. 63.177, 63.178, 
paragraph (f) of this section, and paragraphs (c)(5) through (9) of this 
section.
    (ii) Leak definition. The instrument reading, as determined by the 
method as specified in Sec. 63.180(b), that defines a leak is:
    (A) For agitators, an instrument reading of 10,000 parts per million 
or greater.
    (B) For pumps, an instrument reading of 2,000 parts per million or 
greater.
    (iii) Visual Inspections. Each pump and agitator shall be checked by 
visual inspection each calendar week for indications of liquids dripping 
from the pump or agitator seal. If there are indications of liquids 
dripping from the pump or agitator seal at the time of the weekly 
inspection, the owner or operator shall follow the procedure specified 
in either paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section prior to the 
next weekly inspection.
    (A) The owner or operator shall monitor the pump or agitator by the 
method specified in Sec. 63.180(b). If the instrument reading indicates 
a leak as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a leak is 
detected.
    (B) The owner or operator shall eliminate the visual indications of 
liquids dripping.
    (3) Repair provisions. (i) When a leak is detected pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(iii)(A), (c)(5)(iv)(A), or (c)(5)(vi)(B) of 
this section, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but not later 
than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
    (ii) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 
calendar days after the leak is detected. First attempts at repair 
include, but are not limited to, the following practices where 
practicable:
    (A) Tightening of packing gland nuts.
    (B) Ensuring that the seal flush is operating at design pressure and 
temperature.
    (4) Calculation of percent leakers. (i) The owner or operator shall 
decide no later than the end of the first monitoring period what groups 
of processes will be developed. Once the owner or operator has decided, 
all subsequent percent calculations shall be made on the same basis.
    (ii) If, calculated on a 1-year rolling average, the greater of 
either 10 percent or three of the pumps in a group of processes leak, 
the owner or operator shall monitor each pump once per month, until the 
calculated 1-year rolling average value drops below 10 percent or three 
pumps, as applicable.
    (iii) The number of pumps in a group of processes shall be the sum 
of all the pumps in organic HAP service, except that pumps found leaking 
in a continuous process within 1 quarter after startup of the pump shall 
not count in the percent leaking pumps calculation for that one 
monitoring period only.
    (iv) Percent leaking pumps shall be determined by the following 
Equation 3:

%P<INF>L</INF> = [(P<INF>L</INF>--P<INF>S</INF>)/(P<INF>T</INF>--
    P<INF>S</INF>)] x 100 (Eq. 3)

Where:

%P<INF>L</INF> = percent leaking pumps
P<INF>L</INF> = number of pumps found leaking as determined through 
periodic monitoring as required in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
P<INF>T</INF> = total pumps in organic HAP service, including those 
meeting the criteria in paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section.
P<INF>S</INF> = number of pumps in a continuous process leaking within 1 
quarter of startup during the current monitoring period.

    (5) Exemptions. Each pump or agitator equipped with a dual 
mechanical seal system that includes a barrier fluid system is exempt 
from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section, provided the following requirements are met:
    (i) Each dual mechanical seal system is:

calendar week for indications of liquids dripping from the pump/agitator 
seal. If there are indications of liquids dripping from the pump or 
agitator seal at the time of the weekly inspection, the owner or 
operator shall follow the procedures specified in either paragraph 
(c)(5)(iv)(A) or (B) of this section prior to the next required 
inspection.
    (A) The owner or operator shall monitor the pump or agitator using 
the method specified in Sec. 63.180(b) to determine if there is a leak 
of organic HAP in the barrier fluid. If the instrument reading indicates 
a leak, as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a leak is 
detected.
    (B) The owner or operator shall eliminate the visual indications of 
liquids dripping.

through (6) of this section.
    (ii) The cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve shall seal the 
open end at all times except during operations requiring process fluid 
flow through the open-ended valve or line, or during maintenance or 
repair. The cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve shall be in place 
within 1 hour of cessation of operations requiring process fluid flow 
through the open-ended valve or line, or within 1 hour of cessation of 
maintenance or repair. The owner or operator is not required to keep a 
record documenting compliance with the 1-hour requirement.
    (2) Each open-ended valve or line equipped with a second valve shall 
be

[[Page 142]]

operated in a manner such that the valve on the process fluid end is 
closed before the second valve is closed.
    (3) When a double block and bleed system is being used, the bleed 
valve or line may remain open during operations that require venting the 
line between the block valves but shall comply with paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section at all other times.

this section, Sec. Sec. 63.178 and 63.179.
    (i) The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method 
specified in Sec. 63.180(b).
    (ii) An instrument reading of 500 parts per million or greater 
defines a leak.
    (4) Subsequent monitoring frequencies. After conducting the initial 
survey required in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the owner or 
operator shall monitor valves for leaks at the intervals specified 
below:
    (i) For a group of processes with 2 percent or greater leaking 
valves, calculated according to paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the 
owner or operator shall monitor each valve once per month, except as 
specified in paragraph (e)(9) of this section.

4 quarters.
    (v) For a group of processes with less than 0.25 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
2 years.
    (5) Calculation of percent leakers. For a group of processes to 
which this subpart applies, an owner or operator may choose to subdivide 
the valves in the applicable group of processes and apply the provisions 
of paragraph (e)(4) of this section to each subgroup. If the owner or 
operator elects to subdivide the valves in the applicable group of 
processes, then the provisions of paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through 
(e)(5)(viii) of this section apply.
    (i) The overall performance of total valves in the applicable group 
of processes must be less than 2 percent leaking valves, as detected 
according to paragraphs (e)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section and as 
calculated according to paragraphs (e)(6) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) The initial assignment or subsequent reassignment of valves to 
subgroups shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) 
(A) through (C) of this section.

[[Page 143]]

    (A) The owner or operator shall determine which valves are assigned 
to each subgroup. Valves with less than 1 year of monitoring data or 
valves not monitored within the last 12 months must be placed initially 
into the most frequently monitored subgroup until at least 1 year of 
monitoring data has been obtained.
    (B) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a less 
frequently monitored subgroup to a more frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned were monitored during the most 
recent monitoring period for the less frequently monitored subgroup. The 
monitoring results must be included with the less frequently monitored 
subgroup's monitoring event and associated next percent leaking valves 
calculation for that group.
    (C) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a more 
frequently monitored subgroup to a less frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned have not leaked for the period 
of the less frequently monitored subgroup (e.g., for the last 12 months, 
if the valve or group of valves is to be reassigned to a subgroup being 
monitored annually). Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a 
less frequently monitored subgroup.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the 
overall performance of total valves in the applicable group of processes 
is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in 
the next periodic report. If the overall performance of total valves in 
the applicable group of processes is 2 percent leaking valves or 
greater, the owner or operator shall revert to the program required in 
paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(4) of this section. The overall 
performance of total valves in the applicable group of processes shall 
be calculated as a weighted average of the percent leaking valves of 
each subgroup according to the following Equation 4:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21SE98.002

where:

%V<INF>LO</INF> = overall performance of total valves in the applicable 
process or group of processes
%V<INF>Li</INF> = percent leaking valves in subgroup i, most recent 
value calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section
V<INF>i</INF> = number of valves in subgroup i

    (iv) Records. In addition to records required by paragraph (g) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall maintain records specified in 
paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Which valves are assigned to each subgroup,
    (B) Monitoring results and calculations made for each subgroup for 
each monitoring period,
    (C) Which valves are reassigned and when they were reassigned, and
    (D) The results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (v) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later 
than 30 days prior to the beginning of the next monitoring period of the 
decision to subgroup valves. The notification shall identify the 
participating processes and the valves assigned to each subgroup.
    (vi) Semiannual reports. In addition to the information required by 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit in 
the periodic reports the information specified in paragraphs 
(e)(5)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Valve reassignments occurring during the reporting period, and
    (B) Results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required by paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (vii) To determine the monitoring frequency for each subgroup, the 
calculation procedures of paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section shall be 
used.

[[Page 144]]

    (viii) Except for the overall performance calculations required by 
paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (e)(5)(iii) of this section, each subgroup 
shall be treated as if it were a process for the purposes of applying 
the provisions of this section.
    (6)(i) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the 
implementation date of this subpart or upon revision of an operating 
permit how to group the processes. Once the owner or operator has 
decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the 
same basis.
    (ii) Percent leaking valves for each group of processes or subgroup 
shall be determined by the following Equation 5:

%V<INF>L</INF> = [V<INF>L</INF>/V<INF>T</INF>] x 100 (Eq. 5)

Where:

%V<INF>L</INF> = percent leaking valves as determined through periodic 
monitoring required in paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section.
V<INF>T</INF> = total valves monitored, in a monitoring period excluding 
valves monitored as required by (e)(7)(iii) of this section

    (iii) When determining monitoring frequency for each group of 
processes or subgroup subject to monthly, quarterly, or semiannual 
monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last two 
monitoring periods. When determining monitoring frequency for each group 
of processes or subgroup subject to annual or biennial (once every 2 
years) monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last three 
monitoring periods.
    (iv)(A) Nonrepairable valves shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking 
and nonrepairable and as required to comply with paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(B) 
of this section. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable valves (identified 
and included in the percent leaking calculation in a previous period) up 
to a maximum of 1 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP 
service at a process may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking 
valves for subsequent monitoring periods.
    (B) If the number of nonrepairable valves exceeds 1 percent of the 
total number of valves in organic HAP service at a process, the number 
of nonrepairable valves exceeding 1 percent of the total number of 
valves in organic HAP service shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves.
    (7) Repair provisions. (i) When a leak is detected, it shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days 
after the leak is detected, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(i)) 
of this section.
    (ii) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 
calendar days after each leak is detected.
    (iii) When a leak is repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least 
once within the first 3 months after its repair. Days that the valve is 
not in organic HAP service shall not be considered part of this 3 month 
period. The monitoring required by this paragraph is in addition to the 
monitoring required to satisfy the definitions of ``repaired'' and 
``first attempt at repair.''
    (A) The monitoring shall be conducted as specified in Sec. 
63.180(b) and (c) as appropriate to determine whether the valve has 
resumed leaking.
    (B) Periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of 
this section may be used to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 
(e)(7)(iii) of this section, if the timing of the monitoring period 
coincides with the time specified in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this 
section. Alternatively, other monitoring may be performed to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, regardless of 
whether the timing of the monitoring period for periodic monitoring 
coincides with the time specified in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this 
section.
    (C) If a leak is detected by monitoring that is conducted pursuant 
to paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator shall 
follow the provisions of paragraphs (e)(7)(iii)(C)(1) and (2) of this 
section to determine whether that valve must be counted as a leaking 
valve for purposes of paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
    (1) If the owner or operator elects to use periodic monitoring 
required by paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section to satisfy the 
requirements of

[[Page 145]]

paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, then the valve shall be counted 
as a leaking valve.
    (2) If the owner or operator elects to use other monitoring prior to 
the periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of 
this section to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of 
this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve unless 
it is repaired and shown by periodic monitoring not to be leaking.
    (8) First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the 
following practices where practicable:
    (i) Tightening of bonnet bolts,
    (ii) Replacement of bonnet bolts,
    (iii) Tightening of packing gland nuts, and
    (iv) Injection of lubricant into lubricated packing.
    (9) Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves 
in organic HAP service in the affected source is exempt from the 
requirements for monthly monitoring specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of 
this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve in 
organic HAP service for leaks once each quarter, or comply with 
paragraph (e)(4)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, except as provided 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Unsafe to monitor/inspect, difficult to monitor/inspect, and 
inaccessible equipment. (1) Equipment that is designated as unsafe to 
monitor, unsafe to inspect, difficult to monitor, difficult to inspect, 
or inaccessible is exempt from the monitoring requirements as specified 
in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section provided the owner 
or operator meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2), (3), 
or (4) of this section, as applicable. All equipment must be assigned to 
a group of processes. Ceramic or ceramic-lined connectors are subject to 
the same requirements as inaccessible connectors.
    (i) For pumps and agitators, paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this 
section do not apply.
    (ii) For valves, paragraphs (e)(2) through (7) of this section do 
not apply.
    (iii) For connectors, Sec. 63.174(b) through (e) and paragraphs 
(b)(4)(iii)(B) through (F) of this section do not apply.
    (iv) For closed-vent systems, Sec. 63.172(f)(1) and (2) and Sec. 
63.172(g) do not apply.
    (2) Equipment that is unsafe to monitor or unsafe to inspect. (i) 
Valves, connectors, agitators, and pumps may be designated as unsafe to 
monitor if the owner or operator determines that monitoring personnel 
would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying 
with the monitoring requirements referred to in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) 
through (iii) of this section.
    (ii) Any part of a closed-vent system may be designated as unsafe to 
inspect if the owner or operator determines that monitoring personnel 
would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying 
with the monitoring requirements referred to in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of 
this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator of equipment that is designated as 
unsafe to monitor must have a written plan that requires monitoring of 
the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe to monitor times, 
but not more frequently than the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise 
applicable to the group of processes in which the equipment is located.
    (iv) For any parts of a closed-vent system designated as unsafe to 
inspect, the owner or operator must have a written plan that requires 
inspection of the closed-vent systems as frequently as practicable 
during safe to inspect times, but not more frequently than annually.
    (3) Equipment that is difficult to monitor or difficult to inspect. 
(i) A valve, agitator, or pump may be designated as difficult to monitor 
if the owner or operator determines that the valve, agitator, or pump 
cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 
2 meters above a support surface, or it is not accessible in a safe 
manner when it is in organic HAP service.
    (ii) Any part of a closed-vent system may be designated as difficult 
to inspect if the owner or operator determines that the equipment cannot 
be inspected without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 
meters

[[Page 146]]

above a support surface, or it is not accessible in a safe manner when 
it is in organic HAP service.
    (iii) At an existing source, any valve, agitator or pump within a 
group of processes that meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of 
this section may be designated as difficult to monitor, and any parts of 
a closed-vent system that meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) 
of this section may be designated as difficult to inspect. At a new 
affected source, an owner or operator may designate no more than 3 
percent of valves as difficult to monitor.
    (iv) The owner or operator of valves, agitators, or pumps designated 
as difficult to monitor must have a written plan that requires 
monitoring of the equipment at least once per calendar year or on the 
periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable to the group of 
processes in which the equipment is located, whichever is less frequent. 
For any part of a closed-vent system designated as difficult to inspect, 
the owner or operator must have a written plan that requires inspection 
of the closed-vent system at least once every 5 years.
    (4) Inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connectors. (i) A 
connector may be designated as inaccessible if it is:

monitor probe;
    (C) Obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the 
connector by a monitor probe;
    (D) Unable to be reached from a wheeled scissor-lift or hydraulic-
type scaffold which would allow access to equipment up to 7.6 meters (25 
feet) above the ground; or
    (E) Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform 
monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a 
wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a 
motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists, 
or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical 
lines, or would risk damage to equipment.
    (ii) A connector may be designated as inaccessible if it would 
require elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters above a 
permanent support surface or would require the erection of scaffold.
    (iii) At an existing source, any connector that meets the criteria 
of paragraph (f)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section may be designated as 
inaccessible. At a new affected source, an owner or operator may 
designate no more than 3 percent of connectors as inaccessible.
    (iv) If any inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connector is 
observed by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means to be leaking, 
the leak shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 
calendar days after the leak is detected, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
    (v) Any connector that is inaccessible or that is ceramic or 
ceramic-lined is exempt from the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements of paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
    (g) Recordkeeping requirements. (1) An owner or operator of more 
than one group of processes subject to the provisions of this section 
may comply with the recordkeeping requirements for the groups of 
processes in one recordkeeping system if the system identifies with each 
record the program being implemented (e.g., quarterly monitoring) for 
each type of equipment. All records and information required by this 
section shall be maintained in a manner that can be readily accessed at 
the plant site. This could include physically locating the records at 
the plant site or accessing the records from a central location by 
computer at the plant site.

Sec. 63.1256  Standards: Wastewater.

    (a) General. Each owner or operator of any affected source (existing 
or new) shall comply with the general wastewater requirements in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section and the maintenance 
wastewater provisions in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. An owner or 
operator may transfer wastewater to a treatment operation not owned by 
the owner or operator in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section.
    (1) Identify wastewater that requires control. For each POD, the 
owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in either paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section to determine whether a wastewater 
stream is an affected wastewater stream that requires control for 
soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds or to designate the 
wastewater stream as an affected wastewater stream, respectively. The 
owner or operator may use a combination of the approaches in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section for different affected wastewater 
generated at the source.
    (i) Determine characteristics of a wastewater stream. At new and 
existing sources, a wastewater stream is an affected wastewater stream 
if the annual average concentration and annual load exceed any of the 
criteria specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this 
section. At new sources, a wastewater stream is subject to additional 
control requirements if the annual average concentration and annual load 
exceed the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(D) of this 
section. The owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 
63.1257(e)(1) to determine the annual average concentrations and annual 
load of partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds.
    (A) The wastewater stream contains partially soluble HAP compounds 
at an annual average concentration greater than 1,300 ppmw, and the 
total soluble and partially soluble HAP load in all wastewater from the 
PMPU exceeds 0.25 Mg/yr.
    (B) The wastewater stream contains partially soluble and/or soluble 
HAP compounds at an annual average concentration greater than 5,200 
ppmw, and the total soluble and partially soluble HAP load in all 
wastewater from the PMPU exceeds 0.25 Mg/yr.
    (C) The wastewater stream contains partially soluble and/or soluble 
HAP at an annual average concentration of greater than 10,000 ppmw, and 
the total partially soluble and/or soluble HAP load in all wastewater 
from the affected source is greater than 1 Mg/yr.
    (D) The wastewater stream contains soluble HAP compounds at an 
annual

[[Page 152]]

average concentration greater than 110,000 ppmw, and the total soluble 
and partially soluble HAP load in all wastewater from the PMPU exceeds 1 
Mg/yr.
    (ii) Designate wastewater as affected wastewater. For existing 
sources, the owner or operator may elect to designate wastewater streams 
as meeting the criteria of either paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A),(B), or (C) of 
this section. For new sources, the owner or operator may elect to 
designate wastewater streams meeting the criterion in paragraph 
(a)(1)(i)(D) or for wastewater known to contain no soluble HAP, as 
meeting the criterion in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. For 
designated wastewater the procedures specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section shall be followed, except as 
specified in paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (g)(9)(i), and (g)(10) of this 
section. The owner or operator is not required to determine the annual 
average concentration or load for each designated wastewater stream for 
the purposes of this section.
    (A) From the POD for the wastewater stream that is designated as an 
affected wastewater stream to the location where the owner or operator 
elects to designate such wastewater stream as an affected wastewater 
stream, the owner or operator shall comply with all applicable emission 
suppression requirements specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section.
    (B) From the location where the owner or operator designates a 
wastewater stream as an affected wastewater stream, such wastewater 
stream shall be managed in accordance with all applicable emission 
suppression requirements specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section and with the treatment requirements in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (iii) Scrubber Effluent. Effluent from a water scrubber that has 
been used to control Table 2 HAP-containing vent streams that are 
controlled in order to meet the process vent requirements in Sec. 
63.1254 of this subpart is considered an affected wastewater stream.
    (2) Requirements for affected wastewater. (i) An owner or operator 
of a facility shall comply with the applicable requirements for 
wastewater tanks, surface impoundments, containers, individual drain 
systems, and oil/water separators as specified in paragraphs (b) through 
(f) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section.
    (ii) Comply with the applicable requirements for control of soluble 
and partially soluble compounds as specified in paragraph (g) of this 
section. Alternatively, the owner or operator may elect to comply with 
the treatment provisions specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (iii) Comply with the applicable monitoring and inspection 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1258.
    (iv) Comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.1259 and 63.1260.
    (3) Requirements for multiphase discharges. The owner or operator 
shall not discharge a separate phase that can be isolated through 
gravity separation from the aqueous phase to a waste management or 
treatment unit, unless the stream is discharged to a treatment unit in 
compliance with paragraph (g)(13) of this section.
    (4) Maintenance wastewater requirements. Each owner or operator of a 
source subject to this subpart shall comply with the requirements of 
paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section for maintenance 
wastewater containing partially soluble or soluble HAP listed in Tables 
2 and 3 of this subpart. Maintenance wastewater is exempt from all other 
provisions of this subpart.
    (i) The owner or operator shall prepare a description of maintenance 
procedures for management of wastewater generated from the emptying and 
purging of equipment in the process during temporary shutdowns for 
inspections, maintenance, and repair (i.e., a maintenance turnaround) 
and during periods which are not shutdowns (i.e., routine maintenance). 
The descriptions shall:
    (A) Specify the process equipment or maintenance tasks that are 
anticipated to create wastewater during maintenance activities; and
    (B) Specify the procedures that will be followed to properly manage 
the wastewater and minimize organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere; and

[[Page 153]]

    (C) Specify the procedures to be followed when clearing materials 
from process equipment.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall modify and update the information 
required by paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section as needed following each 
maintenance procedure based on the actions taken and the wastewater 
generated in the preceding maintenance procedure.

information required by paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section as 
part of the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required under Sec. 
63.6(e)(3).
    (5) Offsite treatment or onsite treatment not owned or operated by 
the source. The owner or operator may elect to transfer affected 
wastewater streams or a residual removed from such affected wastewater 
to an onsite treatment operation not owned or operated by the owner or 
operator of the source generating the wastewater or residual, or to an 
offsite treatment operation.
    (i) The owner or operator transferring the wastewater or residual 
shall:
    (A) Comply with the provisions specified in paragraphs (b) through 
(f) of this section for each waste management unit that receives or 
manages affected wastewater or a residual removed from affected 
wastewater prior to shipment or transport.
    (B) Include a notice with each shipment or transport of affected 
wastewater or residual removed from affected wastewater. The notice 
shall state that the affected wastewater or residual contains organic 
HAP that are to be treated in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart. When the transport is continuous or ongoing (for example, 
discharge to a publicly-owned treatment works), the notice shall be 
submitted to the treatment operator initially and whenever there is a 
change in the required treatment. The owner or operator shall keep a 
record of the notice in accordance with Sec. 63.1259(g).
    (ii) The owner or operator may not transfer the affected wastewater 
or residual unless the transferee has submitted to the EPA a written 
certification that the transferee will manage and treat any affected 
wastewater or residual removed from affected wastewater received from a 
source subject to the requirements of this subpart in accordance with 
the requirements of either:
    (A) Paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section; or
    (B) Subpart D of this part if alternative emission limitations have 
been granted the transferor in accordance with those provisions; or
    (C) Section 63.6(g); or
    (D) If the affected wastewater streams or residuals removed from 
affected wastewater streams received by the transferee contain less than 
50 ppmw of partially soluble HAP, then the transferee must, at a 
minimum, manage and treat the affected wastewater streams and residuals 
in accordance with one of the following:
    (1) Comply with paragraph (g)(10) of this section and cover the 
waste management units up to the activated sludge unit; or
    (2) Comply with paragraphs (g)(11)(i), (ii), and (h) of this section 
and cover the waste management units up to the activated sludge unit; or
    (3) Comply with paragraph (g)(10) of this section provided that the 
owner or operator of the affected source demonstrates that less than 5 
percent of the total soluble HAP is emitted from waste management units 
up to the activated sludge unit; or
    (4) Comply with paragraphs (g)(11)(i), (ii), and (h) of this section 
provided that the owner or operator of the affected source demonstrates 
that less than 5 percent of the total soluble HAP is emitted from waste 
management units up to the activated sludge unit.
    (iii) The certifying entity may revoke the written certification by 
sending a written statement to the EPA and the owner or operator giving 
at least 90 days notice that the certifying entity is rescinding 
acceptance of responsibility for compliance with the regulatory 
provisions listed in this paragraph. Upon expiration of the notice 
period, the owner or operator may

[[Page 154]]

not transfer the wastewater stream or residual to the treatment 
operation.
    (iv) By providing this written certification to the EPA, the 
certifying entity accepts responsibility for compliance with the 
regulatory provisions listed in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section 
with respect to any shipment of wastewater or residual covered by the 
written certification. Failure to abide by any of those provisions with 
respect to such shipments may result in enforcement action by the EPA 
against the certifying entity in accordance with the enforcement 
provisions applicable to violations of these provisions by owners or 
operators of sources.
    (v) Written certifications and revocation statements, to the EPA 
from the transferees of wastewater or residuals shall be signed by the 
responsible official of the certifying entity, provide the name and 
address of the certifying entity, and be sent to the appropriate EPA 
Regional Office at the addresses listed in Sec. 63.13. Such written 
certifications are not transferable by the treater.
    (b) Wastewater tanks. For each wastewater tank that receives, 
manages, or treats affected wastewater or a residual removed from 
affected wastewater, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section as 
specified in Table 6 of this subpart.

identification of the first and last treatment process or control 
device. The owner or operator shall include this information as part of 
the treatment process description reported in the Notification of 
Compliance Status.
    (D) The performance test or design evaluation shall determine 
compliance across the combination of treatment processes or control 
devices. If a performance test is conducted, the ``inlet'' shall be the 
point at which the wastewater stream or residual enters the first 
treatment process, or the vented gas stream enters the first control 
device. The ``outlet'' shall be the point at which the treated 
wastewater stream exits the last treatment process, or the vented gas 
stream exits the last control device.

[[Page 164]]

    (ii) Compliance across individual units. (A) For combinations of 
treatment processes, each treatment process shall meet the applicable 
requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section except as 
provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

Sec. 63.1257  Test methods and compliance procedures.

    (a) General. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section, the procedures specified in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) 
of this section are required to demonstrate initial compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 63.1253, 63.1254, 63.1256, and 63.1252(e), respectively. The 
provisions in paragraphs (a) (2) through (3) apply to performance tests 
that are specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. The 
provisions in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are used to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the alternative standards specified in 
Sec. Sec. 63.1253(d) and 63.1254(c). The provisions in paragraph (a)(6) 
of this section are used to comply with the outlet concentration 
requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.1253(c), 63.1254 (a)(2)(i) and 
(a)(3)(ii)(B), 63.1254(b)(i) and 63.1256(h)(2).
    (1) Design evaluation. To demonstrate that a control device meets 
the required control efficiency, a design evaluation must address the 
composition and organic HAP concentration of the vent stream entering 
the control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent 
stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as 
specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (vi) of this 
section, depending on the type of control device that is used. If the 
vent stream is not the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency 
demonstration also must consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, 
other than fuels, received by the control device.
    (i) For an enclosed combustion device used to comply with the 
provisions of 63.1253 (b)(2) or (c)(2), or 63.1256(h)(2)(i)(C) with a 
minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 
[deg]C, the design evaluation must document that these conditions exist.
    (ii) For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the

[[Page 168]]

design evaluation must document control efficiency and address the 
following characteristics, depending on the type of control device:
    (A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must 
consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, must consider 
the vent stream flow rate, and must establish the design minimum and 
average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone 
residence time.
    (B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate and shall establish the design 
minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and 
outlet.
    (C) For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate; shall establish the design minimum 
and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time; 
and shall describe the method and location where the vent stream is 
introduced into the flame zone.
    (iii) For a condenser, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish 
the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design 
average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design 
average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and 
outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser must be 
measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.
    (iv) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the 
design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative 
humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent 
stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, 
number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream 
mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed 
regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, 
design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon. 
For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included.
    (v) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon 
canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream mass or 
volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall 
establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration 
level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated 
carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based 
on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source 
operating schedule.
    (vi) For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream composition; constituent concentrations; liquid-to-vapor ratio; 
scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration; temperature; and the 
reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The 
design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic 
compound concentration level and will include the additional information 
in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section for trays and a 
packed column scrubber.
    (A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;
    (B) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and 
for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed 
section.
    (2) Calculation of TOC or total organic HAP concentration. The TOC 
concentration or total organic HAP concentration is the sum of the 
concentrations of the individual components. If compliance is being 
determined based on TOC, the owner or operator shall compute TOC for 
each run using Equation 6 of this subpart. If compliance with the 
wastewater provisions is being determined based on total organic HAP, 
the owner or operator shall compute total organic HAP using Equation 6 
of this subpart, except that only the organic HAP compounds shall be 
summed; when determining compliance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this 
section, only the soluble and partially soluble HAP compounds shall be 
summed.

integrated sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the actual oxygen 
concentration (%O<INF>2d</INF>). The samples shall be taken during the 
same time that the TOC or total organic HAP or hydrogen halides and 
halogen samples are taken. The concentration corrected to 3 percent 
oxygen (C<INF>d</INF>) shall be computed using Equation 7A of this 
subpart:

63.1258(b)(5)(ii)(B), if a control device other than a combustion device 
is used to comply with a TOC, organic HAP, or hydrogen halide outlet 
concentration standard, the owner or operator must correct the actual 
concentration for supplemental gases using Equation 7B of this subpart; 
process knowledge and representative operating data may be used to 
determine the fraction of the total flow due to supplemental gas.

measured every 15 minutes during each 1-hour run. The HAP concentration 
shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over 
the duration of each l-hour test run, or from grab samples collected 
simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an 
integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling 
rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow 
rate. For continuous gas streams, the emission rate used to determine 
compliance

[[Page 171]]

shall be the average emission rate of the three test runs.
    (8) Testing and compliance determination conditions for batch 
processes. Testing of emissions on equipment where the flow of gaseous 
emissions is intermittent (batch operations) shall be conducted as 
specified in paragraphs (b)(8)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(9) of this section for 
condensers, testing shall be conducted at absolute worst-case conditions 
or hypothetical worst-case conditions. Gas stream volumetric flow rates 
shall be measured at 15-minute intervals. The HAP or TOC concentration 
shall be determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over 
the duration of the test, or from grab samples collected simultaneously 
with the flow rate measurements (every 15 minutes). If an integrated 
sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be 
adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow rate. The absolute 
worst-case or hypothetical worst-case conditions shall be characterized 
by the criteria presented in paragraphs (b)(8)(i)(A) and (B)of this 
section. In all cases, a site-specific plan shall be submitted to the 
Administrator for approval prior to testing in accordance with Sec. 
63.7(c) and Sec. 63.1260(l). The test plan shall include the emission 
profile described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (A) Absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the criteria 
presented in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A)(1) or (2) of this section if the 
maximum load is the most challenging condition for the control device. 
Otherwise, absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the conditions 
in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(A)(3) of this section. The owner or operator must 
consider all relevant factors, including load and compound-specific 
characteristics in defining absolute worst-case conditions.
    (1) The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain 
at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP load (in lb) capable of being 
vented to the control device over any 8 hour period. An emission profile 
as described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this section shall be used to 
identify the 8-hour period that includes the maximum projected HAP load.
    (2) A 1-hour period of time in which the inlet to the control device 
will contain the highest HAP mass loading rate, in lb/hr, capable of 
being vented to the control device. An emission profile as described in 
paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 1-
hour period of maximum HAP loading.
    (3) The period of time when the HAP loading or stream composition 
(including non-HAP) is most challenging for the control device. These 
conditions include, but are not limited to the following:
    (i) Periods when the stream contains the highest combined VOC and 
HAP load, in lb/hr, described by the emission profiles in paragraph 
(b)(8)(ii) of this section;
    (ii) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
limits of solubility for scrubbing media;
    (iii) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that 
approach limits of adsorptivity for carbon adsorption systems.
    (B) Hypothetical worst-case conditions are simulated test conditions 
that, at a minimum, contain the highest hourly HAP load of emissions 
that would be predicted to be vented to the control device from the 
emissions profile described in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) or (C) of this 
section.
    (ii) Emissions profile. The owner or operator may choose to perform 
tests only during those periods of the worst-case conditions that the 
owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required 
emission reduction. The owner or operator must develop an emission 
profile for the vent to the control device that describes the 
characteristics of the vent stream at the inlet to the control device 
under worst case conditions. The emission profile shall be developed 
based on any one of the procedures described in (b)(8)(ii)(A) through 
(C) of this section, as required by paragraph (b)(8)(i).
    (A) Emission profile by process. The emission profile must consider 
all emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack for a 
period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting to 
the stack and

[[Page 172]]

shall consider production scheduling. The profile shall describe the HAP 
load to the device that equals the highest sum of emissions from the 
episodes that can vent to the control device in any given hour. 
Emissions per episode shall be calculated using the procedures specified 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Emissions per episode shall be 
divided by the duration of the episode only if the duration of the 
episode is longer than 1 hour.
    (B) Emission profile by equipment. The emission profile must consist 
of emissions that meet or exceed the highest emissions, in lb/hr, that 
would be expected under actual processing conditions. The profile shall 
describe equipment configurations used to generate the emission events, 
volatility of materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale 
used to identify and characterize the emission events. The emissions may 
be based on using a compound more volatile than compounds actually used 
in the process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all 
equipment in the process(es) or only selected equipment.
    (C) Emission profile by capture and control device limitation. The 
emission profile shall consider the capture and control system 
limitations and the highest emissions, in lb/hr, that can be routed to 
the control device, based on maximum flowrate and concentrations 
possible because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment 
(e.g., fans, LEL alarms and safety bypasses).
    (iii) Three runs, at a minimum of 1 hour each and a maximum of 8 
hours each, are required for performance testing. Each run must occur 
over the same worst-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(8)(i) 
of this section.
    (9) Testing requirements for condensers. For emission streams 
controlled using condensers, continuous direct measurement of condenser 
outlet gas temperature to be used in determining concentrations per the 
design evaluation described in Sec. 63.1257(a)(1)(iii) is required.
    (10) Wastewater testing. Wastewater analysis shall be conducted in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(10)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this 
section.

Methods,'' EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, September 1986, as 
amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. As an alternative, an owner or 
operator may use any more recent, updated version of Method 8260 or 8270 
approved by the EPA. For the purpose of using Method 8260 or 8270 to 
comply with this subpart, the owner or operator must maintain a formal 
quality assurance program consistent with either Section 8 of Method 
8260 or Method 8270, and this program must include the following

(b)(10)(iv)(A) of this section, and comply with the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(10)(vi) of this section.
    (vi) Sampling plan. The owner or operator shall prepare a sampling 
plan. Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures 
which minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and 
analysis and maintain sample integrity. The sample plan shall include 
procedures for determining recovery efficiency of the relevant partially 
soluble and soluble HAP compounds. An example of an acceptable sampling

increments; one increment is from the initial temperature to 10 K below 
the boiling point, and the second is from 10 K below the boiling point 
to the lower of either the final temperature or the temperature 5 K

from the initial temperature to the lower of either the final 
temperature or the temperature 5 K below the boiling point.

HAP remaining after a reaction shall be based on stoichometry assuming 
100 percent theoretical consumption or yield, as applicable.

nonbiological treatment process, the owner or operator shall conduct 
either a design evaluation as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section, or a performance test as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of 
this section to demonstrate that each nonbiological treatment process 
used to comply with Sec. 63.1256(g) (8), (9), and/or (12) achieves the 
conditions specified for compliance. The owner or operator shall 
demonstrate by the procedures in either paragraph (e)(2) (ii) or (iii) 
of this section that each closed biological treatment process used to 
comply with Sec. 63.1256 (g)(8)(ii), (g)(9)(ii), (g)(11), or (g)(12) 
achieves the conditions specified for compliance. If an open biological 
treatment unit is used to comply with Sec. 63.1256 (g)(8)(ii), 
(g)(9)(ii), (g)(11), or (g)(12), the owner or operator shall comply with 
the performance test requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) Design evaluation. A design evaluation and supporting 
documentation that addresses the operating characteristics of the 
treatment process and that is based on operation at a wastewater stream 
flow rate and a concentration under which it would be most difficult to 
demonstrate compliance. For closed biological treatment processes, the 
percent reduction from removal/destruction in the treatment unit and 
control device shall be determined by a mass balance over the unit. The 
mass flow rate of soluble and/or partially soluble HAP compounds exiting 
the treatment process shall be the sum of the mass flow rate of soluble 
and/or partially soluble HAP compounds in the wastewater stream exiting 
the biological treatment process and the mass flow rate of the vented 
gas stream exiting the control device. The mass flow rate entering the 
treatment process minus the mass flow rate exiting the process 
determines the actual mass removal. Compounds that meet the requirements 
specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this section are not 
required to be included in the design evaluation; the term ``performance 
test'' in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this section shall mean 
``design evaluation'' for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (iii) Performance tests. Performance tests shall be conducted using 
test methods and procedures that meet the applicable requirements 
specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A) through (G) of this section.
    (A) General. This paragraph specifies the general procedures for 
performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a 
treatment process with the control requirements specified in Sec. 
63.1256(g).
    (1) Representative process unit operating conditions. Compliance 
shall be demonstrated for representative operating conditions. 
Operations during periods of malfunction and periods of nonoperation 
shall not constitute representative conditions. The owner or operator 
shall record the process information that is necessary to document 
operating conditions during the test.
    (2) Representative treatment process operating conditions. 
Performance tests shall be conducted when the treatment process is 
operating at a representative inlet flow rate and concentration. If the 
treatment process will be operating at several different sets of 
representative operating conditions, the owner or operator shall comply 
with paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.

[[Page 188]]

The owner or operator shall record information that is necessary to 
document treatment process or control device operating conditions during 
the test.
    (i) Range of operating conditions. If the treatment process will be 
operated at several different sets of representative operating 
conditions, performance testing over the entire range is not required. 
In such cases, the performance test results shall be supplemented with 
modeling and/or engineering assessments to demonstrate performance over 
the operating range.
    (ii) Consideration of residence time. If concentration and/or flow 
rate to the treatment process are not relatively constant (i.e., 
comparison of inlet and outlet data will not be representative of 
performance), the owner or operator shall consider residence time, when 
determining concentration and flow rate.
    (3) Testing equipment. All testing equipment shall be prepared and 
installed as specified in the applicable test methods, or as approved by 
the Administrator.
    (4) Compounds not required to be considered in performance tests. 
Compounds that meet the requirements specified in (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4)(i), 
(ii), or (iii) of this section are not required to be included in the 
performance test. Concentration measurements based on Method 305 shall 
be adjusted by dividing each concentration by the compound-specific Fm 
factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart. Concentration measurements 
based on methods other than Method 305 shall not be adjusted by the 
compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    (i) Compounds not used or produced by the PMPU; or
    (ii) Compounds with concentrations at the POD that are below 1 ppmw; 
or
    (iii) Compounds with concentrations at the POD that are below the 
lower detection limit where the lower detection limit is greater than 1 
ppmw. The method shall be an analytical method for wastewater which has 
the compound of interest as a target analyte.
    (5) Treatment using a series of treatment processes. In all cases 
where the wastewater provisions in this subpart allow or require the use 
of a treatment process to comply with emissions limitations, the owner 
or operator may use multiple treatment processes. The owner or operator 
complying with the requirements of Sec. 63.1256(g)(7)(i), when 
wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping, shall comply with either 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section. The owner or 
operator complying with the requirements of Sec. 63.1256(g)(7)(ii) 
shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(5)(ii) of 
this section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across 
each series of treatment processes. For each series of treatment 
processes, inlet concentration and flow rate shall be measured either 
where the wastewater enters the first treatment process in a series of 
treatment processes, or prior to the first treatment process as 
specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(6) of this section. For each 
series of treatment processes, outlet concentration and flow rate shall 
be measured where the wastewater exits the last treatment process in the 
series of treatment processes, except when the last treatment process is 
an open or a closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating 
compliance by using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) 
of this section. When the last treatment process is either an open or a 
closed aerobic biological treatment process demonstrating compliance by 
using the procedures in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) of this 
section, inlet and outlet concentrations and flow rates shall be 
measured at the inlet and outlet to the series of treatment processes 
prior to the biological treatment process and at the inlet to the 
biological treatment process, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii)(A)(6)(ii) of this section. The mass flow rate destroyed in 
the biological treatment process for which compliance is demonstrated 
using paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) or (F) of this section shall be added to 
the mass flow rate removed or destroyed in the series of treatment units 
before the biological treatment unit. This sum shall be used to 
calculate the overall control efficiency.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test across 
each treatment process in the series of

[[Page 189]]

treatment processes. The mass flow rate removed or destroyed by each 
treatment process shall be added together and the overall control 
efficiency calculated to determine whether compliance has been 
demonstrated using paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of 
this section, as applicable. If a biological treatment process is one of 
the treatment processes in the series of treatment processes, the inlet 
to the biological treatment process shall be the point at which the 
wastewater enters the biological treatment process, or the inlet to the 
equalization tank if all the criteria of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(6)(ii) 
of this section are met.
    (6) The owner or operator determining the inlet for purposes of 
demonstrating compliance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E), or (F)of this 
section may elect to comply with paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(6)(i) or (ii) 
of this section.
    (i) When wastewater is conveyed exclusively by hard-piping from the 
point of determination to a treatment process that is either the only 
treatment process or the first in a series of treatment processes (i.e., 
no treatment processes or other waste management units are used upstream 
of this treatment process to store, handle, or convey the wastewater), 
the inlet to the treatment process shall be at any location from the 
point of determination to where the wastewater stream enters the 
treatment process. When samples are taken upstream of the treatment 
process and before wastewater streams have converged, the owner or 
operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all affected wastewater 
is accounted for when using Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii), (g)(9)(ii) or 
(g)(12) of this subpart to comply and that the mass flow rate of all 
wastewater, not just affected wastewater, is accounted for when using 
Sec. 63.1256(g)(11) to comply, except as provided in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The owner or operator may consider the inlet to the 
equalization tank as the inlet to the biological treatment process if 
the wastewater is conveyed by hard-piping from either the last previous 
treatment process or the point of determination to the equalization 
tank; or the wastewater is conveyed from the equalization tank 
exclusively by hard-piping to the biological treatment process and no 
treatment processes or other waste management units are used to store, 
handle, or convey the wastewater between the equalization tank and the 
biological treatment process; or the equalization tank is equipped with 
a fixed roof and a closed-vent system that routes emissions to a control 
device that meets the requirements of Sec. 63.1256(b)(1)(i) through 
(iv) and Sec. 63.1256(b)(2)(i). The outlet from the series of treatment 
processes prior to the biological treatment process is the point at 
which the wastewater exits the last treatment process in the series 
prior to the equalization tank, if the equalization tank and biological 
treatment process are part of a series of treatment processes. The owner 
or operator shall ensure that the mass flow rate of all affected 
wastewater is accounted for when using Sec. 63.1256(g)(9)(ii) or (12) 
to comply and that the mass flow rate of all wastewater, not just 
affected wastewater is accounted for when using Sec. 63.1256(g)(11) to 
comply, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A)(4) of this 
section.
    (B) Noncombustion treatment process--concentration limits. This 
paragraph applies to performance tests that are conducted to demonstrate 
compliance of a noncombustion treatment process with the ppmw wastewater 
stream concentration limits at the outlet of the treatment process. This 
compliance option is specified in Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(i) and (9)(i). 
Wastewater samples shall be collected using sampling procedures which 
minimize loss of organic compounds during sample collection and analysis 
and maintain sample integrity per paragraph (b)(10)(vi) of this section. 
Samples shall be collected and analyzed using the procedures specified 
in paragraphs (b)(10)(i) through (vi) of this section. Samples may be 
grab samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken at 
approximately equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 
1-hour period constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist 
of a minimum of three runs. Concentration measurements based on methods 
other than Method 305 may be adjusted by multiplying each concentration 
by the compound-specific

[[Page 190]]

Fm factor listed in Table 8 of this subpart. (For affected wastewater 
streams that contains both partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds, 
compliance is demonstrated only if the sum of the concentrations of 
partially soluble HAP compounds is less than 50 ppmw, and the sum of the 
concentrations of soluble HAP compounds is less than 520 ppmw.)
    (C) Noncombustion, nonbiological treatment process: percent mass 
removal/destruction option. This paragraph applies to performance tests 
that are conducted to demonstrate compliance of a noncombustion, 
nonbiological treatment process with the percent mass removal limits 
specified in Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii) and (9)(ii) for partially soluble 
and soluble HAP compounds, respectively. The owner or operator shall 
comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(C)(1) 
through (5) of this section.
    (1) Concentration. The concentration of partially soluble and/or 
soluble HAP compounds entering and exiting the treatment process shall 
be determined as provided in this paragraph. Wastewater samples shall be 
collected using sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic 
compounds during sample collection and analysis and maintain sample 
integrity per paragraph (b)(10)(vi) of this section. The method shall be 
an analytical method for wastewater which has the compound of interest 
as a target analyte. Samples may be grab samples or composite samples. 
Samples shall be taken at approximately equally spaced time intervals 
over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period constitutes a run, and the 
performance test shall consist of a minimum of three runs. Concentration 
measurements based on Method 305 shall be adjusted by dividing each 
concentration by the compound-specific Fm factor listed in Table 8 of 
this subpart. Concentration measurements based on methods other than 
Method 305 shall not be adjusted by the compound-specific Fm factor 
listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    (2) Flow rate. The flow rate of the entering and exiting wastewater 
streams shall be determined using inlet and outlet flow meters, 
respectively. Where the outlet flow is not greater than the inlet flow, 
a single flow meter may be used, and may be used at either the inlet or 
outlet. Flow rate measurements shall be taken at the same time as the 
concentration measurements.
    (3) Calculation of mass flow rate--for noncombustion, nonbiological 
treatment processes. The mass flow rates of partially soluble and/or 
soluble HAP compounds entering and exiting the treatment process are 
calculated using Equations 44 and 45 of this subpart.

treatment process. The concentration of partially soluble and/or soluble 
HAP compounds entering the treatment process shall be determined as 
provided in this paragraph. Wastewater samples shall be collected using 
sampling procedures which minimize loss of organic compounds during 
sample collection and analysis and maintain sample integrity per 
paragraph (b)(10)(vi) of this section. The method shall be an analytical 
method for wastewater which has the compound of interest as a target

shall be determined as provided in this paragraph. Samples may be grab 
samples or composite samples. Samples shall be taken at approximately 
equally spaced time intervals over a 1-hour period. Each 1-hour period 
constitutes a run, and the performance test shall consist of a minimum 
of three runs. Concentration measurements shall be determined using

may be used at either the inlet or outlet. Flow rate measurements shall 
be taken at the same time as the concentration measurements.
    (3) Destruction efficiency. The owner or operator shall comply with 
the provisions in either paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E)(3)(i) or (ii) of this 
section. Compliance is demonstrated if the destruction efficiency, E, is 
equal to or greater than 95 percent.
    (i) If the performance test is performed across the open or closed 
biological treatment system only, compliance is demonstrated if E is 
equal to F<INF>bio</INF>, where E is the destruction efficiency of 
partially soluble and/or soluble HAP compounds and F<INF>bio</INF> is

to be treated.

    (4) Site-specific fraction biodegraded (F<INF>bio</INF>). The 
procedures used to determine the compound-specific kinetic parameters 
for use in calculating F<INF>bio</INF> differ for the compounds listed 
in Tables 2 and 3 of this subpart. An owner or operator shall calculate 
F<INF>bio</INF> as specified in either paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E)(4)(i) or

    (i) For biological treatment processes that do not meet the 
definition for enhanced biological treatment in Sec. 63.1251, the owner 
or operator shall determine the F<INF>bio</INF> for the compounds in 
Tables 2 and 3 of this subpart using any of the procedures in appendix C 
to part 63, except procedure 3 (inlet and outlet concentration 
measurements). (The symbol ``F<INF>bio</INF>'' represents the site-
specific fraction of an individual partially soluble or soluble HAP 
compound that is biodegraded.)
    (ii) If the biological treatment process meets the definition of 
``enhanced biological treatment process'' in Sec. 63.1251, the owner or 
operator shall determine F<INF>bio</INF> for the compounds in Table 2 of 
this subpart using any of the procedures specified in appendix C to part 
63. The owner or operator shall calculate F<INF>bio</INF> for the 
compounds in Table 3 of this subpart using the defaults for first order 
biodegradation rate constants (K<INF>1</INF>) in Table 9 of this subpart 
and follow the procedure explained in Form III of appendix C, 40 CFR 
part 63, or any of the procedures specified in appendix C of 40 CFR part 
63.
    (F) Open or closed aerobic biological treatment processes: percent 
removal for partially soluble or soluble HAP compounds. This paragraph 
applies to the use of performance tests that are conducted for open or 
closed aerobic biological treatment processes to demonstrate compliance 
with the percent removal provisions for either partially soluble HAP 
compounds in Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii) or soluble HAP compounds in Sec. 
63.1256(g)(9)(ii) or (g)(12). The owner or operator shall comply with 
the provisions in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, except that 
compliance with Sec. 63.1256(g)(8)(ii) shall be demonstrated when E is 
equal to or greater than 99 percent, compliance with Sec. 
63.1256(g)(9)(ii) shall be demonstrated when E is equal to or greater

option. This paragraph applies to the use of performance tests that are 
conducted for closed biological treatment processes to demonstrate 
compliance with the percent removal provisions in Sec. Sec. 
63.1256(g)(8)(ii), (g)(9)(ii), (g)(11), or (g)(12). The owner or 
operator shall comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs

daily (24-hour) or block average shall be calculated as the average of 
all values for a monitored parameter level set according to the 
procedures in (b)(3)(iii) of this section recorded during the operating 
day or block.
    (ii) The operating day or block shall be defined in the Notification 
of Compliance Status report. The daily average may be from midnight to 
midnight or another continuous 24-hour period. The block average is 
limited to a period of time that is, at a maximum, equal to the time 
from the beginning to end of a batch process.
    (iii) Monitoring values taken during periods in which the control 
devices are not functioning in controlling emissions, as indicated by 
periods of no flow, shall not be considered in the averages. Where flow 
to the device could be intermittent, the owner or operator shall 
install, calibrate and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet 
of the control device to identify periods of no flow.
    (3) Procedures for setting parameter levels for control devices used 
to control

[[Page 202]]

emissions--(i) Small control devices. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, for devices controlling less than 10 tons per 
year of HAP for which a performance test is not required, the parametric 
levels shall be set based on the design evaluation required in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(3)(i). If a performance test is conducted, the monitoring 
parameter level shall be established according to the procedures in 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Large control devices. For devices controlling greater than 10 
tons per year of HAP for which a performance test is required, the 
parameter level must be established as follows:
    (A) If the operating parameter level to be established is a maximum, 
it must be based on the average of the values from each of the three 
test runs.
    (B) If the operating parameter level to be established is a minimum, 
it must be based on the average of the values from each of the three 
test runs.
    (C) The owner or operator may establish the parametric monitoring 
level(s) based on the performance test supplemented by engineering 
assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is 
not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter 
values. The rationale for the specific level for each parameter, 
including any data and calculations used to develop the level(s) and a 
description of why the level indicates proper operation of the control 
device shall be provided in the Precompliance report. The procedures 
specified in this section have not been approved by the Administrator 
and determination of the parametric monitoring level using these 
procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
    (iii) Parameters for control devices controlling batch process 
vents. For devices controlling batch process vents alone or in 
combination with other streams, the parameter level(s) shall be 
established in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this 
section.
    (A) If more than one batch emission episode has been selected to be 
controlled, a single level for the batch process(es) shall be determined 
from the initial compliance demonstration.
    (B) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch 
process(es), as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, 
an owner or operator may establish separate levels for each batch 
emission episode, selected to be controlled. If separate monitoring 
levels are established, the owner or operator must provide a record 
indicating at what point in the daily schedule or log of processes 
required to be recorded per the requirements of Sec. 63.1259(b)(9) the 
parameter being monitored changes levels and must record at least one 
reading of the new parameter level, even if the duration of monitoring 
for the new parameter is less than 15-minutes.
    (4) Request approval to monitor alternative parameters. An owner or 
operator may request approval to monitor parameters other than those 
required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (ix) of this section. The 
request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f) or included in the Precompliance report.
    (5) Monitoring for the alternative standards. (i) For control 
devices that are used to comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1253(d) 
or Sec. 63.1254(c), the owner or operator shall monitor and record the 
outlet TOC concentration and the outlet hydrogen halide and halogen 
concentration every 15 minutes during the period in which the device is 
functioning in achieving the HAP removal required by this subpart using 
CEMS as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of this 
section.
    (A) A TOC monitor meeting the requirements of EPA Performance 
Specification 8, 9, or 15 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 shall be 
installed, calibrated, and maintained according to Sec. 63.8.
    (B) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(C) and (D) of this 
section, the owner or operator must monitor HCl using either a FTIR CEMS 
that meets Performance Specification 15 of appendix B of part 60 or any 
other CEMS capable of measuring HCl for which a performance 
specification has been promulgated in appendix B of part 60. To monitor 
HCl with a CEMS for which a performance specification has not been 
promulgated, the owner or operator must prepare a monitoring plan and

[[Page 203]]

submit it for approval in accordance with the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8.
    (C) As an alternative to using a CEMS as specified in paragraph 
(b)(5)(i)(B) of this section to monitor halogenated vent streams that 
are controlled by a combustion device followed by a scrubber, the owner 
or operator may elect to monitor scrubber operating parameters as 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that demonstrate the 
HCl emissions are reduced by at least 95 percent by weight.
    (D) The owner or operator need not monitor the hydrogen halide and 
halogen concentration if, based on process knowledge, the owner or 
operator determines that the emission stream does not contain hydrogen 
halides or halogens.
    (ii) An owner or operator complying with the alternative standard 
using control devices in which supplemental gases are added to the vents 
or manifolds must either correct for supplemental gases as specified in 
Sec. 63.1257(a)(3) or comply with the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(5)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section. If the owner or operator corrects 
for supplemental gases as specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(3)(ii) for 
noncombustion control devices, the flow rates must be evaluated as 
specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (A) Provisions for combustion devices. As an alternative to 
correcting for supplemental gases as specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(3), 
the owner or operator may monitor residence time and firebox temperature 
according to the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(A)(1) and (2) of 
this section. Monitoring of residence time may be accomplished by 
monitoring flowrate into the combustion chamber.
    (1) If complying with the alternative standard instead of achieving 
a control efficiency of 95 percent or less, the owner or operator must 
maintain a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum 
combustion chamber temperature of 760 [deg]C.
    (2) If complying with the alternative standard instead of achieving 
a control efficiency of 98 percent, the owner or operator must maintain 
a minimum residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum combustion 
chamber temperature of 816 [deg]C.
    (B) Provisions for dense gas systems. As an alternative to 
correcting for supplemental gases as specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(3), 
for noncombustion devices used to control emissions from dense gas 
systems, as defined in Sec. 63.1251, the owner or operator shall 
monitor flowrate as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(B)(1) through (4) 
of this section.
    (1) Use Equation 63 of this subpart to calculate the system flowrate 
setpoint at which the average concentration is 5,000 ppmv TOC:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29AU00.011

Where:

F<INF>s</INF> = system flowrate setpoint, scfm
E<INF>an</INF> = annual emissions entering the control device, lbmols/yr

    (2) Annual emissions used in Equation 63 of this subpart must be 
based on the actual mass of organic compounds entering the control 
device, as calculated from the most representative emissions inventory 
data submitted within the 5 years before the Notification of Compliance 
Status report is due. The owner or operator must recalculate the system 
flowrate setpoint once every 5 years using the annual emissions from the 
most representative emissions inventory data submitted during the 5-year 
period after the previous calculation. Results of the initial 
calculation must be included in the Notification of Compliance Status 
report, and recalculated values must be included in the next Periodic 
report after each recalculation. For all calculations after the initial 
calculation, to use emissions inventory data calculated using procedures 
other than those specified in Sec. 63.1257(d), the owner or operator 
must submit the emissions inventory data calculations and rationale for 
their use in the Notification of Process Change report or an application 
for a part 70 permit renewal or revision.
    (3) In the Notification of Compliance Status report, the owner or 
operator may elect to establish both a maximum daily average operating 
flowrate limit above the flowrate setpoint and a reduced outlet 
concentration limit corresponding to this flowrate limit. The

[[Page 204]]

owner or operator may also establish reduced outlet concentration limits 
for any daily average flowrates between the flowrate setpoint and the 
flowrate limit. The correlation between these elevated flowrates and the 
corresponding outlet concentration limits must be established using 
Equation 64 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29AU00.012

Where:

C<INF>a</INF> = adjusted outlet concentration limit, dry basis, ppmv
50 = outlet concentration limit associated with the flowrate setpoint, 
dry basis, ppmv
F<INF>s</INF> = system flowrate setpoint, scfm
F<INF>a</INF> = actual system flowrate limit, scfm

    (4) The owner or operator must install and operate a monitoring 
system for measuring system flowrate. The flowrate into the control 
device must be monitored and recorded at least once every hour. The 
system flowrate must be calculated as the average of all values measured 
during each 24-hour operating day. The flowrate monitoring device must 
be accurate to within 5 percent of the system flowrate setpoint, and the 
flowrate monitoring device must be calibrated annually.
    (C) Flow rate evaluation for noncombustion devices. To demonstrate 
continuous compliance with the requirement to correct for supplemental 
gases as specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(3)(ii) for noncombustion devices, 
the owner or operator must evaluate the volumetric flow rate of 
supplemental gases, V<INF>s</INF>, and the volumetric flow rate of all 
gases, V<INF>a</INF>, each time a new operating scenario is implemented 
based on process knowledge and representative operating data. The 
procedures used to evaluate the flow rates, and the resulting correction 
factor used in Equation 7B of this subpart, must be included in the 
Notification of Compliance Status report and in the next Periodic report 
submitted after an operating scenario change.
    (6) Exceedances of operating parameters. An exceedance of an 
operating parameter is defined as one of the following:
    (i) If the parameter, averaged over the operating day or block, is 
below a minimum value established during the initial compliance 
demonstration.
    (ii) If the parameter, averaged over the operating day or block, is 
above the maximum value established during the initial compliance 
demonstration.
    (iii) Each loss of all pilot flames for flares.
    (7) Excursions. Excursions are defined by either of the two cases 
listed in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) When the period of control device operation is 4 hours or 
greater in an operating day and monitoring data are insufficient to 
constitute a valid hour of data, as defined in paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of 
this section, for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
    (ii) When the period of control device operation is less than 4 
hours in an operating day and more than one of the hours during the 
period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data due to 
insufficient monitoring data.
    (iii) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section, if 
measured values are unavailable for any of the required 15-minute 
periods within the hour.
    (8) Violations. Exceedances of parameters monitored according to the 
provisions of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iv) through (ix), and 
(b)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, or excursions as defined by 
paragraphs (b)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section, constitute 
violations of the operating limit according to paragraphs (b)(8)(i), 
(ii), and (iv) of this section. Exceedances of the temperature limit 
monitored according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section or exceedances of the outlet concentrations monitored according 
to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(x) of this section constitute 
violations of the emission limit according to paragraphs (b)(8)(i), 
(ii), and (iv) of this section. Exceedances of the outlet concentrations 
monitored according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section constitute violations of the emission limit according to the 
provisions of paragraphs (b)(8)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for 
episodes occurring more than once per day,

[[Page 205]]

exceedances of established parameter limits or excursions will result in 
no more than one violation per operating day for each monitored item of 
equipment utilized in the process.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for 
control devices used for more than one process in the course of an 
operating day, exceedances or excursions will result in no more than one 
violation per operating day, per control device, for each process for 
which the control device is in service.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, 
exceedances of the 20 or 50 ppmv TOC outlet emission limit, averaged 
over the operating day, will result in no more than one violation per 
day per control device. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of 
this section, exceedances of the 20 or 50 ppmv hydrogen halide or 
halogen outlet emission limit, averaged over the operating day, will 
result in no more than one violation per day per control device.
    (iv) Periods of time when monitoring measurements exceed the 
parameter values as well as periods of inadequate monitoring data do not 
constitute a violation if they occur during a start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction, and the facility operates in accordance with Sec. 
63.6(e)(1).
    (c) Monitoring for emission limits. The owner or operator of any 
affected source complying with the provisions of Sec. 63.1254(a)(2) 
shall demonstrate continuous compliance with the 900 and 1,800 kg/yr 
emission limits by calculating daily 365-day rolling summations of 
emissions. During periods of planned routine maintenance when emissions 
are controlled as specified in Sec. 63.1252(h), the owner or operator 
must calculate controlled emissions assuming the HAP emissions are 
reduced by 93 percent. For any owner or operator opting to switch 
compliance strategy from the 93 percent control requirement to the 
annual mass emission limit method, as described in Sec. 
63.1254(a)(1)(i), the rolling summations, beginning with the first day 
after the switch, must include emissions from the past 365 days.
    (d) Monitoring for equipment leaks. The owner or operator of any 
affected source complying with the requirements of Sec. 63.1255 of this 
subpart shall meet the monitoring requirements described Sec. 63.1255 
of this subpart.
    (e) Pollution prevention. The owner or operator of any affected 
source that chooses to comply with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
63.1252(e)(2) and (3) shall calculate a yearly rolling average of kg HAP 
consumption per kg production and kg VOC consumption per kg production 
every month or every 10 batches. Each rolling average kg/kg factor that 
exceeds the value established in Sec. 63.1257(f)(1)(ii) will be 
considered a violation of the emission limit.
    (f) Emissions averaging. The owner or operator of any affected 
source that chooses to comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.1252(d) 
shall meet all monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (3) of this section, as applicable, for all processes and storage 
tanks included in the emissions average.
    (g) Inspection and monitoring of waste management units and 
treatment processes. (1) For each wastewater tank, surface impoundment, 
container, individual drain system, and oil-water separator that 
receives, manages, or treats wastewater, a residual removed from 
wastewater, a recycled wastewater, or a recycled residual removed from 
wastewater, the owner or operator shall comply with the inspection 
requirements specified in Table 7 of this subpart.
    (2) For each biological treatment unit used to comply with Sec. 
63.1256(g), the owner or operator shall monitor TSS, BOD, and the 
biomass concentration at a frequency approved by the permitting 
authority and using methods approved by the permitting authority. The 
owner or operator may request approval to monitor other parameters. The 
request shall be submitted in the Precompliance report according to the 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.1260(e), and shall include a 
description of planned reporting and recordkeeping procedures. The owner 
or operator shall include as part of the submittal the basis for the 
selected monitoring frequencies and the methods that will be used. The 
Administrator will specify appropriate

[[Page 206]]

reporting and recordkeeping requirements as part of the review of the 
permit application or by other appropriate means.
    (3) For nonbiological treatment units, the owner or operator shall 
request approval to monitor appropriate parameters that demonstrate 
proper operation of the selected treatment process. The request shall be 
submitted in the Precompliance report according to the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.1260(e), and shall include a description of 
planned reporting and recordkeeping procedures. The Administrator will 
specify appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements as part of 
the review of the permit application or by other appropriate means.
    (h) Leak inspection provisions for vapor suppression equipment. (1) 
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(9) and (10) of this section, for 
each vapor collection system, closed-vent system, fixed roof, cover, or 
enclosure required to comply with this section, the owner or operator 
shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (h)(2) through (8) of 
this section.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(6) and (7) of this section, 
each vapor collection system and closed-vent system shall be inspected 
according to the procedures and schedule specified in paragraphs 
(h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section and each fixed roof, cover, and 
enclosure shall be inspected according to the procedures and schedule 
specified in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (i) If the vapor collection system or closed-vent system is 
constructed of hard-piping, the owner or operator shall:
    (A) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and
    (B) Conduct annual visual inspections for visible, audible, or 
olfactory indications of leaks.
    (ii) If the vapor collection system or closed-vent system is 
constructed of ductwork, the owner or operator shall:
    (A) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and
    (B) Conduct annual inspections according to the procedures in 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
    (C) Conduct annual visual inspections for visible, audible, or 
olfactory indications of leaks.
    (iii) For each fixed roof, cover, and enclosure, the owner or 
operator shall:
    (A) Conduct an initial inspection according to the procedures in 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and
    (B) Conduct semiannual visual inspections for visible, audible, or 
olfactory indications of leaks.
    (3) Each vapor collection system, closed-vent system, fixed roof, 
cover, and enclosure shall be inspected according to the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with Method 21 of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    (ii) Detection instrument performance criteria. (A) Except as 
provided in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the detection 
instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in 
section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of 
the process fluid not each individual VOC in the stream. For process 
streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not 
organic HAP or VOC, the average stream response factor shall be 
calculated on an inert-free basis.
    (B) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet 
the performance criteria specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the 
average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-
free basis as described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
    (iii) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on 
each day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A.
    (iv) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
    (A) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million hydrocarbon in air); 
and
    (B) Mixtures of methane in air at a concentration less than 10,000 
parts per million. A calibration gas other than methane in air may be 
used if the instrument does not respond to methane or if the instrument 
does not meet the

[[Page 207]]

performance criteria specified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section. In such cases, the calibration gas may be a mixture of one or 
more of the compounds to be measured in air.
    (v) An owner or operator may elect to adjust or not adjust 
instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects to 
not adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings shall 
be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine 
whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust 
instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall measure 
background concentration using the procedures in Sec. 63.180(b) and 
(c). The owner or operator shall subtract background reading from the 
maximum concentration indicated by the instrument.
    (vi) The background level shall be determined according to the 
procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60 appendix A.
    (vii) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration 
indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared 
with 500 parts per million for determining compliance.
    (4) Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 
parts per million above background or by visual inspections, shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, except as provided in paragraph (h)(5) 
of this section.
    (i) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar 
days after the leak is detected.
    (ii) Repair shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after 
the leak is detected, except as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of 
this section.
    (iii) For leaks found in vapor collection systems used for transfer 
operations, repairs shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days 
after the leak is detected or at the beginning of the next transfer 
loading operation, whichever is later.
    (5) Delay of repair of a vapor collection system, closed-vent 
system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure for which leaks have been 
detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a 
shutdown, as defined in Sec. 63.1251, or if the owner or operator 
determines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be 
greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of 
repair. Repair of such equipment shall be complete by the end of the 
next shutdown.
    (6) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed-vent system, 
fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in 
paragraph (h)(8) of this section, as unsafe to inspect are exempt from 
the inspection requirements of paragraphs (h)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of 
this section if:
    (i) The owner or operator determines that the equipment is unsafe to 
inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent or 
potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraphs 
(h)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section; and
    (ii) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires 
inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-
inspect times.
    (7) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed-vent system, 
fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in 
paragraph (h)(8) of this section, as difficult to inspect are exempt 
from the inspection requirements of paragraphs (h)(2)(i), (ii), and 
(iii)(A) of this section if:
    (i) The owner or operator determines that the equipment cannot be 
inspected without elevating the inspecting personnel more than 2 meters 
above a support surface; and
    (ii) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires 
inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years.
    (8) Records shall be maintained as specified in Sec. 63.1259(i) (4) 
through (9).
    (9) If a closed-vent system subject to this section is also subject 
to the equipment leak provisions of Sec. 63.1255, the owner or operator 
shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1255 and is exempt from the 
requirements of this section.
    (10) Instead of complying with the provisions of paragraphs (h)(2) 
through (8) of this section, an owner or operator may design a closed-
vent system to operate at a pressure below atmospheric pressure. The 
system shall be equipped with at least one pressure gauge or other 
pressure measurement device that can be read from a readily accessible 
location to verify that negative

[[Page 208]]

pressure is being maintained in the closed-vent system when the 
associated control device is operating.
    (i) Planned routine maintenance. During periods of planned routine 
maintenance when organic HAP emissions are controlled as specified in 
Sec. 63.1252(h)(2), the owner or operator must monitor the condenser 
outlet gas temperature according to the procedures specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. During periods of planned routine 
maintenance when HCl emissions are controlled as specified in Sec. 
63.1252(h)(3), the owner or operator must monitor the pH of the scrubber 
effluent once per day.

    (a) This subpart applies to owners and operators of natural gas 
transmission and storage facilities that transport or store natural gas 
prior to entering the pipeline to a local distribution company or to a 
final end user (if there is no local distribution company), and that are 
major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions as defined in 
Sec. 63.1271. Emissions for major source determination purposes can be 
estimated using the maximum natural gas throughput calculated in either 
paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section and paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of 
this section. As an alternative to calculating the maximum natural gas 
throughput, the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use 
the facility design maximum natural gas throughput to estimate the 
maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's 
major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented 
and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction. A compressor station 
that transports natural gas prior to the point of custody transfer or to 
a natural gas processing plant (if present) is not considered a part of 
the natural gas transmission and storage source category. A facility 
that is determined to be an area source, but subsequently increases its 
emissions or its potential to emit above the major source levels 
(without first obtaining and complying with other limitations that keep 
its potential to emit HAP below major source levels), and becomes a 
major source, must comply thereafter with all applicable provisions of 
this subpart starting on the applicable compliance date specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to 
preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through

[[Page 224]]

other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the 
permitting authority.
    (1) Facilities that store natural gas or facilities that transport 
and store natural gas shall calculate maximum annual facility natural 
gas throughput using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29JN01.026

Where:

Throughput = Maximum annual facilitywide natural gas throughput in cubic 
meters per year.
<INF>IR</INF> max = Maximum facility injection rate in cubic meters per 
hour.
<INF>WR</INF> max = Maximum facility withdrawal rate in cubic meters per 
hour.
8,760 = Maximum hours of operation per year.

    (i)-(iii) [Reserved]
    (2) Facilities that only transport natural gas shall calculate the 
maximum natural gas throughput as the highest annual natural gas 
throughput over the 5 years prior to June 17, 1999, multiplied by a 
factor of 1.2.
    (3) The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual 
facility natural gas throughput each year and upon request, submit such 
records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas 
throughput increases above the maximum natural gas throughput calculated 
in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the maximum natural gas 
throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied 
by a factor of 1.2.
    (4) The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for 
other parameters used to calculate potential emissions as the maximum 
over the same period for which maximum throughput is determined as 
specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. These 
parameters shall be based on an annual average or the highest single 
measured value.
    (b) The affected source is each glycol dehydration unit.
    (c) The owner or operator of a facility that does not contain an 
affected source, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, is not 
subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) The owner or operator of each affected source shall achieve 
compliance with the provisions of this subpart by the following dates:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected source, the construction or 
reconstruction of which commenced before February 6, 1998, shall achieve 
compliance with this provisions of the subpart no later than June 17, 
2002 except as provided for in Sec. 63.6(i). The owner or operator of 
an area source, the construction or reconstruction of which commenced 
before February 6, 1998, that increases its emissions of (or its 
potential to emit) HAP such that the source becomes a major source that 
is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart 3 years after 
becoming a major source.
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected source, the construction or 
reconstruction of which commences on or after February 6, 1998, shall 
achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart immediately upon 
initial startup or June 17, 1999, whichever date is later. Area sources, 
the construction or reconstruction of which commences on or after 
February 6, 1998, that become major sources shall comply with the 
provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.
    (e) An owner or operator of an affected source that is a major 
source or is located at a major source and is subject to the provisions 
of this subpart is also subject to 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 permitting 
requirements.
    (f) Exemptions. A facility with a facilitywide actual annual average 
natural gas throughput less than 28.3 thousand standard cubic meters per 
day, where glycol dehydration units are the only HAP emission source, is 
not subject to the requirements of this subpart. Records shall be 
maintained as required in Sec. 63.10(b)(3).

Sec. 63.1271  Definitions.

    All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given to them 
in the Clean Air Act, subpart A of this part (General Provisions), and 
in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A and in this 
section, it shall have

[[Page 225]]

the meaning given in this section for purposes of this subpart.
    Boiler means an enclosed device using controlled flame combustion 
and having the primary purpose of recovering and exporting thermal 
energy in the form of steam or hot water. Boiler also means any 
industrial furnace as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.
    Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere 
and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and if necessary, flow 
inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point to 
one or more control devices. If gas or vapor from regulated equipment is 
routed to a process (e.g., to a fuel gas system), the conveyance system 
shall not be considered a closed-vent system and is not subject to 
closed-vent system standards.
    Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a 
flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion 
of organic HAP emissions.
    Compressor station means any permanent combination of compressors 
that move natural gas at increased pressure from fields, in transmission 
pipelines, or into storage.
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device that either 
records an instantaneous data value at least once every hour or records 
hourly or more frequent block average values.
    Control device means any equipment used for recovering or oxidizing 
HAP or volatile organic compound (VOC) vapors. Such equipment includes, 
but is not limited to, absorbers, carbon absorbers, condensers, 
incinerators, flares, boilers, and process heaters. For the purposes of 
this subpart, if gas or vapor from regulated equipment is used, reused 
(i.e., injected into the flame zone of an enclosed combustion device), 
returned back to the process, or sold, then the recovery system used, 
including piping, connections, and flow inducing devices, is not 
considered to be a control device or a closed-vent system.
    Custody transfer means the transfer of natural gas after processing 
and/or treatment in the production operations to pipelines or any other 
forms of transportation.
    Facility means any grouping of equipment where natural gas is 
processed, compressed, or stored prior to entering a pipeline to a local 
distribution company or (if there is no local distribution company) to a 
final end user. Examples of a facility for this source category are: an 
underground natural gas storage operation; or a natural gas compressor 
station that receives natural gas via pipeline, from an underground 
natural gas storage operation, or from a natural gas processing plant. 
The emission points associated with these phases include, but are not 
limited to, process vents. Processes that may have vents include, but 
are not limited to, dehydration and compressor station engines.
    Facility, for the purpose of a major source determination, means 
natural gas transmission and storage equipment that is located inside 
the boundaries of an individual surface site (as defined in this 
section) and is connected by ancillary equipment, such as gas flow lines 
or power lines. Equipment that is part of a facility will typically be 
located within close proximity to other equipment located at the same 
facility. Natural gas transmission and storage equipment or groupings of 
equipment located on different gas leases, mineral fee tracts, lease 
tracts, subsurface unit areas, surface fee tracts, or surface lease 
tracts shall not be considered part of the same facility.
    Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a 
combustion device occupied by the flame envelope.
    Flash tank. See the definition for gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) 
separator.
    Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is 
present in a line or whether the valve position would allow gas flow to 
be present in a line.
    Gas-condensate-glycol (GCG) separator means a two-or three-phase 
separator through which the ``rich'' glycol stream of a glycol 
dehydration unit is passed to remove entrained gas and hydrocarbon 
liquid. The GCG separator is commonly referred to as a flash separator 
or flash tank.
    Glycol dehydration unit means a device in which a liquid glycol 
(including, but not limited to, ethylene glycol,

[[Page 226]]

diethylene glycol, or triethylene glycol) absorbent directly contacts a 
natural gas stream and absorbs water in a contact tower or absorption 
column (absorber). The glycol contacts and absorbs water vapor and other 
gas stream constituents from the natural gas and becomes ``rich'' 
glycol. This glycol is then regenerated in the glycol dehydration unit 
reboiler. The ``lean'' glycol is then recycled.
    Glycol dehydration unit baseline operations means operations 
representative of the glycol dehydration unit operations as of June 17, 
1999. For the purposes of this subpart, for determining the percentage 
of overall HAP emission reduction attributable to process modifications, 
glycol dehydration unit baseline operations shall be parameter values 
(including, but not limited to, glycol circulation rate or glycol-HAP 
absorbency) that represent actual long-term conditions (i.e., at least 1 
year). Glycol dehydration units in operation for less than 1 year shall 
document that the parameter values represent expected long-term 
operating conditions had process modifications not been made.
    Glycol dehydration unit process vent means the glycol dehydration 
unit reboiler vent and the vent from the GCG separator (flash tank), if 
present.
    Glycol dehydration unit reboiler vent means the vent through which 
exhaust from the reboiler of a glycol dehydration unit passes from the 
reboiler to the atmosphere or to a control device.
    Hazardous air pollutants or HAP means the chemical compounds listed 
in section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (Act). All chemical compounds 
listed in section 112(b) of the Act need to be considered when making a 
major source determination. Only the HAP compounds listed in Table 1 of 
this subpart need to be considered when determining compliance.
    Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying organic compounds. Auxiliary fuel may be used to heat waste 
gas to combustion temperatures. Any energy recovery section is not 
physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit with the 
combustion section; rather, the energy recovery section is a separate 
section following the combustion section and the two are joined by ducts 
or connections carrying flue gas. The above energy recovery section 
limitation does not apply to an energy recovery section used solely to 
preheat the incoming vent stream or combustion air.
    Initial startup means the first time a new or reconstructed source 
begins production. For the purposes of this subpart, initial startup 
does not include subsequent startups (as defined in this section) of 
equipment, for example, following malfunctions or shutdowns.
    Major source, as used in this subpart, shall have the same meaning 
as in Sec. 63.2, except that:
    (1) Emissions from any pipeline compressor station or pump station 
shall not be aggregated with emissions from other similar units, whether 
or not such units are in a contiguous area or under common control; and
    (2) Emissions from processes, operations, and equipment that are not 
part of the same facility, as defined in this section, shall not be 
aggregated.
    Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and 
nonhydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's 
surface. The principal hydrocarbon constituent is methane.
    Natural gas transmission means the pipelines used for the long 
distance transport of natural gas (excluding processing). Specific 
equipment used in natural gas transmission includes the land, mains, 
valves, meters, boosters, regulators, storage vessels, dehydrators, 
compressors, and their driving units and appurtenances, and equipment 
used for transporting gas from a production plant, delivery point of 
purchased gas, gathering system, storage area, or other wholesale source 
of gas to one or more distribution area(s).
    No detectable emissions means no escape of HAP from a device or 
system to the atmosphere as determined by:
    (1) Instrument monitoring results in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 63.1282(b); and
    (2) The absence of visible openings or defects in the device or 
system, such as rips, tears, or gaps.

[[Page 227]]

    Operating parameter value means a minimum or maximum value 
established for a control device or process parameter which, if achieved 
by itself or in combination with one or more other operating parameter 
values, indicates that an owner or operator has complied with an 
applicable operating parameter limitation, over the appropriate 
averaging period as specified in Sec. 63.1282 (e) and (f).
    Operating permit means a permit required by 40 CFR part 70 or part 
71.
    Organic monitoring device means an instrument used to indicate the 
concentration level of organic compounds exiting a control device based 
on a detection principle such as infra-red, photoionization, or thermal 
conductivity.
    Primary fuel means the fuel that provides the principal heat input 
(i.e., more than 50 percent) to the device. To be considered primary, 
the fuel must be able to sustain operation without the addition of other 
fuels.
    Process heater means an enclosed device using a controlled flame, 
the primary purpose of which is to transfer heat to a process fluid or 
process material that is not a fluid, or to a heat transfer material for 
use in a process (rather than for steam generation) .
    Safety device means a device that meets both of the following 
conditions: the device is not used for planned or routine venting of 
liquids, gases, or fumes from the unit or equipment on which the device 
is installed; and the device remains in a closed, sealed position at all 
times except when an unplanned event requires that the device open for 
the purpose of preventing physical damage or permanent deformation of 
the unit or equipment on which the device is installed in accordance 
with good engineering and safety practices for handling flammable, 
combustible, explosive, or other hazardous materials. Examples of 
unplanned events which may require a safety device to open include 
failure of an essential equipment component or a sudden power outage.
    Shutdown means for purposes including, but not limited to, periodic 
maintenance, replacement of equipment, or repair, the cessation of 
operation of a glycol dehydration unit, or other affected source under 
this subpart, or equipment required or used solely to comply with this 
subpart.
    Startup means the setting into operation of a glycol dehydration 
unit, or other affected equipment under this subpart, or equipment 
required or used to comply with this subpart. Startup includes initial 
startup and operation solely for the purpose of testing equipment.
    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is designed to 
contain an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate 
hydrocarbon liquids, produced water, or other liquid, and is constructed 
primarily of non-earthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, 
plastic) that provide structural support.
    Surface site means any combination of one or more graded pad sites, 
gravel pad sites, foundations, platforms, or the immediate physical 
location upon which equipment is physically affixed.
    Temperature monitoring device means an instrument used to monitor 
temperature and having a minimum accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 
percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in [deg]C, or 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 [deg]C, whichever is greater. The temperature 
monitoring device may measure temperature in degrees Fahrenheit or 
degrees Celsius, or both.
    Total organic compounds or TOC, as used in this subpart, means those 
compounds which can be measured according to the procedures of Method 
18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    Underground storage means the subsurface facilities utilized for 
storing natural gas that has been transferred from its original location 
for the primary purpose of load balancing, which is the process of 
equalizing the receipt and delivery of natural gas. Processes and 
operations that may be located at an underground storage facility 
include, but are not limited to, compression and dehydration.

Sec. 63.1272  Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.

    (a) The provisions set forth in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during startups or shutdowns, during malfunctions, and 
during periods of

[[Page 228]]

non-operation of the affected sources (or specific portion thereof) 
resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. 
However, during the startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-
operation of one portion of an affected source, all emission points 
which can comply with the specific provisions to which they are subject 
must do so during the startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-
operation.
    (b) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart during times when emissions are being routed to such items of 
equipment, if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart 
applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if 
the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or if the owner or operator 
must shut down the equipment to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction of the affected source or a portion 
thereof.
    (c) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the 
requirements of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to the 
extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the maximum extent practical. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term ``excess emissions'' means emissions in excess of 
those that would have occurred if there were no startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction, and the owner or operator complied with the relevant 
provisions of this subpart. The measures to be taken shall be identified 
in the applicable startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may 
include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, 
recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, 
and/or changes in the manner of operation of the source. Back-up control 
devices are not required, but may be used if available.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner 
or operator shall prepare a startup, shutdown, or malfunction plan as 
required in Sec. 63.6(e)(3), except that the plan is not required to be 
incorporated by reference into the source's title V permit as specified 
in Sec. 63.6(e)(3)(i). Instead, the owner or operator shall keep the 
plan on record as required by Sec. 63.6(e)(3)(v). The failure of the 
plan to adequately minimize emissions during the startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction does not shield an owner or operator from enforcement 
actions.
    (e) Owners or operators are exempt from the requirements to prepare 
a startup, shutdown, or malfunction plan for any facility where all of 
the affected sources meet the exemption criteria specified in Sec. 
63.1274(d).

dehydration unit process vents to the atmosphere are less than 0.90 
megagram per year as determined by the procedures specified in Sec. 
63.1282(a)(2) of this subpart.
    (e) Each owner or operator of a major HAP source subject to this 
subpart is required to apply for a part 70 or part 71 operating permit 
from the appropriate permitting authority. If the Administrator has 
approved a State operating permit program under part 70, the permit 
shall be obtained from the State authority. If a State operating permit 
program has not been approved, the owner or operator shall apply to the 
EPA Regional Office pursuant to part 71.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) In all cases where the provisions of this subpart require an 
owner or operator to repair leaks by a specified time after the leak is 
detected, it is a violation of this standard to fail to take action to 
repair the leak(s) within the specified time. If action is taken to 
repair the leak(s) within the specified time, failure of that action to 
successfully repair the leak(s) is not a violation of this standard. 
However, if the repairs are unsuccessful, a leak is detected and the 
owner or operator shall take further action as required by the 
applicable provisions of this subpart.

Sec. 63.1282  Test methods, compliance procedures, and compliance 

demonstrations.

    (a) Determination of glycol dehydration unit flowrate or benzene 
emissions. The procedures of this paragraph shall be used by an owner or 
operator to determine glycol dehydration unit natural gas flowrate or 
benzene emissions to meet the criteria for the exemption from control 
requirements under Sec. 63.1274(d).
    (1) The determination of actual flowrate of natural gas to a glycol 
dehydration unit shall be made using the procedures of either paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall install and operate a monitoring 
instrument that directly measures natural gas flowrate to the glycol 
dehydration unit with an accuracy of plus or minus 2 percent or better. 
The owner or operator shall convert the annual natural gas flowrate to a 
daily average by dividing the annual flowrate by the number of days per 
year the glycol dehydration unit processed natural gas.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall document, to the Administrator's 
satisfaction, that the actual annual average natural gas flowrate to the 
glycol dehydration unit is less than 283.0 thousand standard cubic 
meters per day.
    (2) The determination of actual average benzene emissions from a 
glycol dehydration unit shall be made using the procedures of either 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Emissions shall be 
determined either uncontrolled or with federally enforceable controls in 
place.
    (i) The owner or operator shall determine actual average benzene 
emissions using the model GRI-GLYCalc<SUP>TM</SUP>, Version 3.0 or 
higher, and the procedures presented in the associated GRI-
GLYCalc<SUP>TM</SUP> Technical Reference Manual. Inputs to the model 
shall be representative of actual operating conditions of the glycol 
dehydration unit and may be determined using the procedures documented 
in the Gas Research Institute (GRI) report entitled ``Atmospheric Rich/
Lean Method for Determining Glycol Dehydrator Emissions'' (GRI-95/
0368.1); or
    (ii) The owner or operator shall determine an average mass rate of 
benzene emissions in kilograms per hour through direct measurement by 
performing three runs of Method 18 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A (or an 
equivalent method), and averaging the results of the three runs. Annual 
emissions in kilograms per year shall be determined by multiplying the 
mass rate by the number of hours the unit is operated per year. This 
result shall be converted to megagrams per year.
    (b) No detectable emissions test procedure. (1) The procedure shall 
be conducted in accordance with Method 21, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of 
Method 21, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response 
factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21

[[Page 233]]

shall be for the average composition of the fluid, and not for each 
individual organic compound in the stream.
    (3) The detection instrument shall be calibrated before use on each 
day of its use by the procedures specified in Method 21, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    (4) Calibration gases shall be as follows:
    (i) Zero air (less than 10 parts per million by volume hydrocarbon 
in air); and
    (ii) A mixture of methane in air at a methane concentration of less 
than 10,000 parts per million by volume.
    (5) An owner or operator may choose to adjust or not adjust the 
detection instrument readings to account for the background organic 
concentration level. If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the 
instrument readings for the background level, the background level value 
must be determined according to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A.
    (6)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, 
the detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 
21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor 
criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average 
composition of the process fluid not each individual volatile organic 
compound in the stream. For process streams that contain nitrogen, air, 
or other inerts which are not organic HAP or VOC, the average stream 
response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis.
    (ii) If no instrument is available at the facility that will meet 
the performance criteria specified in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the 
average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-
free basis as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
    (7) An owner or operator must determine if a potential leak 
interface operates with no detectable emissions using the applicable 
procedure specified in paragraph (b)(7)(i) or (b)(7)(ii) of this 
section.
    (i) If an owner or operator chooses not to adjust the detection 
instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, then 
the maximum organic concentration value measured by the detection 
instrument is compared directly to the applicable value for the 
potential leak interface as specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this 
section.
    (ii) If an owner or operator chooses to adjust the detection 
instrument readings for the background organic concentration level, the 
value of the arithmetic difference between the maximum organic 
concentration value measured by the instrument and the background 
organic concentration value as determined in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section is compared with the applicable value for the potential leak 
interface as specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
    (8) A potential leak interface is determined to operate with no 
detectable organic emissions if the organic concentration value 
determined in paragraph (b)(7) is less than 500 parts per million by 
volume.

in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 63.1282(d)(4) to 
demonstrate that the control device achieves the applicable performance 
requirements specified in Sec. 63.1281(d)(1) or (e)(3)(ii), then the 
minimum operating parameter value or the maximum operating parameter 
value shall be established based on the control device design analysis 
and may be supplemented by the control device manufacturer's 
recommendations.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall establish a condenser performance 
curve showing the relationship between condenser outlet temperature and

occurred when the monitoring data or lack of monitoring data result in 
any one of the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(6)(i) through 
(d)(6)(iv) of this section being met. When multiple operating parameters 
are monitored for the same control device and during the same operating 
day, and more than one of these operating parameters meets an excursion 
criterion specified in paragraphs (d)(6)(i) through (d)(6)(iv) of this 
section, then a single excursion is determined to have occurred for the 
control device for that operating day.
    (i) An excursion occurs when the daily average value of a monitored 
operating parameter is less than the minimum operating parameter limit 
(or, if applicable, greater than the maximum operating parameter limit) 
established for the operating parameter in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.
    (ii) An excursion occurs when average condenser efficiency 
calculated according to the requirements specified in Sec. 
63.1282(f)(2)(iii) is less than 95.0 percent, as specified in Sec. 
63.1282(f)(3).
    (iii) An excursion occurs when the monitoring data are not available

    (iv) If the closed-vent system contains one or more bypass devices 
that could be used to divert all or a portion of the gases, vapors, or 
fumes from entering the control device, an excursion occurs when:
    (A) For each bypass line subject to Sec. 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(A) the 
flow indicator indicates that flow has been detected and that the stream 
has been diverted away from the control device to the atmosphere.
    (B) For each bypass line subject to Sec. 63.1281(c)(3)(i)(B), if 
the seal or closure mechanism has been broken, the bypass line valve 
position has changed, the key for the lock-and-key type lock has been 
checked out, or the car-seal has broken.
    (7) For each excursion, except as provided for in paragraph (d)(8) 
of this section, the owner or operator shall be

[[Page 243]]

deemed to have failed to have applied control in a manner that achieves 
the required operating parameter limits. Failure to achieve the required 
operating parameter limits is a violation of this standard.
    (8) An excursion is not a violation of the operating parameter limit 
as specified in paragraphs (d)(8)(i) and (d)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (i) An excursion does not count toward the number of excused 
excursions allowed under paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section when the 
excursion occurs during any one of the following periods:
    (A) During a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction when the 
affected facility is operated during such period in accordance with 
Sec. 63.6(e)(1); or
    (B) During periods of non-operation of the unit or the process that 
is vented to the control device (resulting in cessation of HAP emissions 
to which the monitoring applies).
    (ii) For each control device, or combinations of control devices, 
installed on the same HAP emissions unit, one excused excursion is 
allowed per semiannual period for any reason. The initial semiannual 
period is the 6-month reporting period addressed by the first Periodic 
Report submitted by the owner or operator in accordance with Sec. 
63.1285(e) of this subpart.
    (9) Nothing in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(8) of this section 
shall be construed to allow or excuse a monitoring parameter excursion 
caused by any activity that violates other applicable provisions of this 
subpart.

Sec. 63.2 of subpart A.
    (b) For the purpose of this subpart, an affected source includes all 
processes meeting the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of 
this section that are located at a contiguous plant site, with the 
exception of those processes listed in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) A process meeting one of the following criteria listed in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section shall not be subject to 
the provisions of this subpart:
    (1) A process exclusively dedicated to the fabrication of flexible 
polyurethane foam;
    (2) A research and development process; or
    (3) A slabstock flexible polyurethane foam process at a plant site 
where the total amount of HAP, excluding diisocyanate reactants, used 
for slabstock foam production and foam fabrication is less than or equal 
to five tons per year, provided that slabstock foam production and foam 
fabrication processes are the only processes at the plant site that emit 
HAP. The amount of non-diisocyanate HAP used, HAP<INF>used</INF>, shall 
be calculated using Equation 1. Owners or operators of slabstock foam 
processes exempt from the regulation in accordance with this paragraph 
shall maintain records to verify that total non-diisocyanate HAP use at 
the plant site is less than 5 tons per year (4.5 megagrams per year).

Sec. 63.1291  Compliance schedule.

    (a) Existing affected sources shall be in compliance with all 
provisions of this subpart no later than October 8, 2001.
    (b) New or reconstructed affected sources shall be in compliance 
with all provisions of this subpart upon initial startup.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1292  Definitions.

    All terms used in this subpart shall have the meaning given them in 
the Act, in subpart A of this part, and in this section. If a term is 
defined in subpart A and in this section, it shall have

[[Page 253]]

the meaning given in this section for purposes of this subpart.
    Auxiliary blowing agent, or ABA, means a low-boiling point liquid 
added to assist foaming by generating gas beyond that resulting from the 
isocyanate-water reaction.
    Breakthrough means that point in the adsorption step when the mass 
transfer zone (i.e., the section of the carbon bed where the HAP is 
removed from the carrier gas stream) first reaches the carbon bed outlet 
as the mass transfer zone moves down the bed in the direction of flow. 
The breakthrough point is characterized by the beginning of a sharp 
increase in the outlet HAP or organic compound concentration.
    Calibrate means to verify the accuracy of a measurement device 
against a known standard. For the purpose of this subpart, there are two 
levels of calibration. The initial calibration includes the verification 
of the accuracy of the device over the entire operating range of the 
device. Subsequent calibrations can be conducted for a point or several 
points in a limited range of operation that represents the most common 
operation of the device.
    Canned motor pump means a pump with interconnected cavity housings, 
motor rotors, and pump casing. In a canned motor pump, the motor 
bearings run in the process liquid and all seals are eliminated.
    Carbon adsorption system means a system consisting of a tank or 
container that contains a specific quantity of activated carbon. For the 
purposes of this subaprt, a carbon adsorption system is used as a 
control device for storage vessels. Typically, the spent carbon bed does 
not undergo regeneration, but is replaced.
    Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to 
connect two pipe lines or a pipe line and a piece of equipment. A common 
connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the 
circumference of the interface are not considered to be connectors for 
the purposes of this subpart.
    Cured foam means flexible polyurethane foam with fully developed 
physical properties. A period of 12 to 24 hours from pour is typically 
required to completely cure foam, although mechanical or other devices 
are sometimes used to accelerate the curing process.
    Curing area means the area in a slabstock foam production facility 
where foam buns are allowed to fully develop physical properties.
    Diaphragm pump means a pump where the driving member is a flexible 
diaphragm made of metal, rubber, or plastic. In a diaphragm pump, there 
is no packing or seals that are exposed to the process liquid.
    Diisocyanate means a compound containing two isocyanate groups per 
molecule. The most common diisocyanate compounds used in the flexible 
polyurethane foam industry are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene 
diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI).
    Flexible polyurethane foam means a flexible cellular polymer 
containing urea and carbamate linkages in the chain backbone produced by 
reacting a diisocyanate, polyol, and water. Flexible polyurethane foams 
are open-celled, permit the passage of air through the foam, and possess 
the strength and flexibility to allow repeated distortion or compression 
under stress with essentially complete recovery upon removal of the 
stress.
    Flexible polyurethane foam process means the equipment used to 
produce a flexible polyurethane foam product. For the purpose of this 
subpart, the flexible polyurethane foam process includes raw material 
storage; production equipment and associated piping, ductwork, etc.; and 
curing and storage areas.
    Foam fabrication process means an operation for cutting or bonding 
flexible polyurethane foam pieces together or to other substrates.
    Grade of foam means foam with a distinct combination of indentation 
force deflection (IFD) and density values.
    HAP ABA means methylene chloride, or any other HAP compound used as 
an auxiliary blowing agent.
    HAP-based means to contain 5 percent (by weight) or more of HAP. 
This applies to equipment cleaners (and mixhead flushes) and mold 
release agents. The concentration of HAP may be determined using EPA 
test method 18, material safety data sheets, or engineering 
calculations.

[[Page 254]]

    High-pressure mixhead means a mixhead where mixing is achieved by 
impingement of the high pressure streams within the mixhead.
    Indentation Force Deflection (IFD) means a measure of the load 
bearing capacity of flexible polyurethane foam. IFD is generally 
measured as the force (in pounds) required to compress a 50 square inch 
circular indentor foot into a four inch thick sample, typically 15

Sec. 63.1297  Standards for slabstock flexible polyurethane foam production--

HAP ABA emissions from the production line.

    (a) Each owner or operator of a new or existing slabstock affected 
source complying with the emission point specific limitation option 
provided in Sec. 63.1293(a)(1) shall control HAP ABA emissions from the 
slabstock polyurethane foam production line in accordance with the 
provisions in this section. Compliance shall be determined on a rolling 
annual basis as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. As an 
alternative, the owner or operator can determine compliance on a monthly 
basis, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) Rolling annual compliance. In determining compliance on a 
rolling annual basis, actual HAP ABA emissions shall be compared to 
allowable HAP ABA emissions for each consecutive 12-month period. The 
allowable HAP ABA emission level shall be calculated based on the 
production for the 12-month period, resulting in a potentially different 
allowable level for each 12-month period. Compliance shall be determined 
each month for the previous 12-month period. The compliance requirements 
are provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Monthly compliance alternative. As an alternative to determining 
compliance on a rolling annual basis, an owner or operator can determine 
compliance by comparing actual HAP ABA emissions to allowable HAP ABA 
emissions for each month. The allowable HAP ABA emission level shall be 
calculated based on the production for the month, resulting in a 
potentially different allowable level each month. The requirements for 
this monthly compliance alternative are provided in paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (3) Each owner or operator electing to change between the compliance 
methods described under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section 
shall notify the Administrator no later than 180 calendar days prior to 
the change.
    (b) Rolling annual compliance. At each slabstock foam production 
source complying with the rolling annual compliance provisions described 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, actual HAP ABA emissions shall not 
exceed the allowable HAP ABA emission level for a consecutive 12-month 
period. The actual HAP ABA emission level for a consecutive 12-month 
period shall be determined using the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, and the allowable HAP ABA emission level for the 
corresponding 12-month period shall be calculated in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) The actual HAP ABA emissions for a 12-month period shall be 
calculated as the sum of actual monthly HAP ABA emissions for each of 
the individual 12 months in the period. Actual monthly HAP ABA emissions 
shall be equal to the amount of HAP ABA added to the slabstock foam 
production line at the mixhead, determined in accordance with Sec. 
63.1303(b), unless a recovery device is used. Slabstock foam production 
sources using recovery devices to reduce HAP ABA emissions shall 
determine actual monthly HAP ABA emissions using the procedures in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) The allowable HAP ABA emissions for a consecutive 12-month 
period shall be calculated as the sum of allowable monthly HAP ABA 
emissions for each of the individual 12 months in the period. Allowable 
HAP ABA emissions for each individual month shall be calculated using 
Equation 2.

provided in Sec. 63.1293(b) shall control HAP ABA storage and equipment 
leak emissions, HAP ABA emissions from the production line, and 
equipment cleaning HAP emissions in accordance with the provisions in 
this section. Compliance shall be determined on a rolling annual basis 
in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. As an alternative, the 
owner or operator can determine compliance monthly, as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (a) Rolling annual compliance. Under the rolling annual compliance 
provisions, actual source-wide HAP ABA storage and equipment leak 
emissions, HAP ABA emissions from the production line, and equipment 
cleaning HAP emissions are compared to allowable source-wide emissions 
for each consecutive 12-month period. The allowable source-wide HAP 
emission level is calculated based on the production for the 12-month 
period, resulting in a potentially different allowable level for each 
12-month period. While compliance is on an annual basis, compliance 
shall be determined monthly for the preceding 12-month period. The 
actual source-wide HAP emission level for a consecutive 12-month period 
shall be determined using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(4) of this section, unless a recovery device is used. Slabstock foam 
production

[[Page 262]]

sources using recovery devices shall determine actual source-wide HAP 
emissions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The 
allowable HAP emission level for a consecutive 12-month period shall be 
determined using the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Monthly compliance alternative. As an alternative to determining 
compliance on a rolling annual basis, an owner or operator can determine 
compliance by comparing actual HAP emissions to allowable HAP emissions 
for each month. The allowable source-wide emission level is calculated 
based on the production for the month, resulting in a potentially 
different allowable level each month. The actual monthly emission level 
shall be determined using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(3) of this section, unless a recovery device is used. Slabstock foam 
production sources using recovery devices shall determine actual source-
wide HAP emissions in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The 
allowable monthly HAP ABA emission level shall be determined in 
accordance with Equation 6.
    (c) Procedures for determining actual source-wide HAP emissions. The 
actual source-wide HAP ABA storage and equipment leak emissions, HAP ABA 
emissions from the production line, and equipment cleaning HAP emissions 
shall be determined using the procedures in this section. Actual source-
wide HAP emissions for each individual month shall be determined using 
the procedures specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this 
section.
    (1) Actual source-wide HAP emissions for a month shall be determined 
using Equation 5 and the information determined in accordance with 
paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 63.1304  Testing requirements.

    Owners and operators of affected sources shall use the test methods 
listed in this section, as applicable, to demonstrate compliance with 
this subpart.
    (a) Test method and procedures to determine equipment leaks. 
Monitoring, as required under Sec. 63.1296, shall comply with the 
following requirements:
    (1) Monitoring shall comply with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of 
Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, except that the instrument 
response factor criteria in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for 
the average composition of the source fluid, rather than for

[[Page 267]]

each individual VOC in the stream. For source streams that contain 
nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not HAP or VOC, the average 
stream response factor shall be calculated on an inert-free basis. The 
response factor may be determined at any concentration for which 
monitoring for leaks will be conducted.
    (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its 
use by the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A.
    (4) Calibration gases shall be:
    (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and
    (ii) A mixture of methane and air at a concentration of 
approximately, 1,000 ppm for all transfer pumps; and 500 ppm for all 
other equipment, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this 
section.
    (iii) The instrument may be calibrated at a higher methane 
concentration (up to 2,000 ppm) than the leak definition concentration 
for a specific piece of equipment for monitoring that piece of 
equipment. If the monitoring instrument's design allows for multiple 
calibration gas concentrations, then the lower concentration calibration 
gas shall be no higher than 2,000 ppm methane and the higher 
concentration calibration gas shall be no higher than 10,000 ppm 
methane.
    (5) Monitoring shall be performed when the equipment is in HAP ABA 
service, in use with an acceptable surrogate volatile organic compound 
which is not a HAP ABA, or is in use with any other detectable gas or 
vapor.
    (6) If no instrument is available onsite that will meet the 
performance criteria specified in section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 of 40 
CFR Part 60, appendix A, the readings from an available instrument may 
be adjusted by multiplying by the average response factor for the 
stream.
    (b) Test method to determine foam properties. The IFD and density of 
each grade of foam produced during each run of foam shall be determined 
using ASTM D3574-91, Standard Test Methods for Flexible Cellular 
Materials--Slab, Bonded, and Molded (incorporation by reference--see 
Sec. 63.14), using a sample of foam cut from the center of the foam 
bun. The maximum sample size for which the IFD and density is determined 
shall not be larger than 24 inches by 24 inches by 4 inches. For grades 
of foam where the owner or operator has designated the HAP ABA 
formulation limitation as zero, the owner or operator is not required to 
determine the IFD and density in accordance with this paragraph.

alternative means of emission limitation.
    (c) Each owner or operator applying for permission to use an 
alternative means of emission limitation under Sec. 63.6(g) shall be 
responsible for collecting and verifying data to demonstrate the 
emission reduction achieved by the alternative means of emission 
limitation.
    (d) Use of the alternative means of emission limitation shall not 
begin until approval is granted by the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 63.6(g).

Sec. 63.1310  Applicability and designation of affected sources.

    (a) Definition of affected source. The provisions of this subpart 
apply to each affected source. Affected sources are described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.
    (1) An affected source is either an existing affected source or a 
new affected source. Existing affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and new affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (2) An existing affected source is defined as each group of one or 
more thermoplastic product process units (TPPU) and associated 
equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section that is not 
part of a new affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, that is manufacturing the same primary product, and that is 
located at a plant site that is a major source.
    (3) A new affected source is defined by the criteria in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii), or (a)(3)(iii) of this section. The situation 
described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is distinct from those 
situations described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(3)(iii) of this 
section and from any situation described in paragraph (i) of this 
section.
    (i) At a site without HAP emission points before March 29, 1995 
(i.e., a ``greenfield'' site), each group of one or more TPPU and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
that is manufacturing the same primary product and that is part of a 
major source on which construction commenced after March 29, 1995;
    (ii) A group of one or more TPPU meeting the criteria in paragraph 
(i)(1)(i) of this section; or
    (iii) A reconstructed affected source meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section.
    (4) Emission points and equipment. The affected source also includes 
the emission points and equipment specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) 
through (a)(4)(vi) of this section that are associated with each 
applicable group of one or more TPPU constituting an affected source.
    (i) Each waste management unit.
    (ii) Maintenance wastewater.
    (iii) Each heat exchange system.
    (iv) Each process contact cooling tower used in the manufacture of 
PET that is associated with a new affected source.
    (v) Each process contact cooling tower used in the manufacture of 
PET using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end 
finisher process that is associated with an existing affected source.
    (vi) Equipment required by, or utilized as a method of compliance 
with, this subpart which may include control devices and recovery 
devices.
    (5) TPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, that are located at plant sites that are not major sources 
are neither affected sources nor part of an affected source.
    (b) TPPUs without organic HAP. The owner or operator of a TPPU that 
is part of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section, but that does not use or manufacture any organic HAP shall 
comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of 
this section. Such a TPPU is not subject to any other provisions of this 
subpart and is not required to comply with the provisions of subpart A 
of this part.
    (1) Retain information, data, and analyses used to document the 
basis for the determination that the TPPU

[[Page 282]]

does not use or manufacture any organic HAP. Types of information that 
could document this determination include, but are not limited to, 
records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process 
stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
    (2) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the TPPU 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP.
    (c) Emission points not subject to the provisions of this subpart. 
The affected source includes the emission points listed in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section, but these emission points are not 
subject to the requirements of this subpart or to the provisions of 
subpart A of this part.
    (1) Equipment that does not contain organic HAP and is located 
within a TPPU that is part of an affected source;
    (2) Stormwater from segregated sewers;
    (3) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems in segregated 
sewers;
    (4) Spills;
    (5) Water from safety showers;
    (6) Water from testing of deluge systems;
    (7) Water from testing of firefighting systems;
    (8) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contain no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only; and
    (9) Equipment that is intended to operate in organic HAP service for 
less than 300 hours during the calendar year.
    (d) Processes exempted from the affected source. The processes 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section are 
exempted from the affected source:
    (1) Research and development facilities;
    (2) Polymerization processes occurring in a mold;
    (3) Processes which manufacture binder systems containing a 
thermoplastic product for paints, coatings, or adhesives;
    (4) Finishing processes including equipment such as compounding 
units, spinning units, drawing units, extruding units, and other 
finishing steps; and
    (5) Solid state polymerization processes.
    (e) Applicability determination of nonthermoplastic equipment 
included within the boundaries of a TPPU. If a polymer that is not a 
thermoplastic product is produced within the equipment (i.e., 
collocated) making up a TPPU and at least 50 percent of that polymer is 
used in the production of a thermoplastic product manufactured by the 
same TPPU, then the unit operations involved in the production of that 
polymer are considered part of the TPPU and are subject to this subpart, 
with the following exception. Any emission points from such unit 
operations that are subject to another subpart of this part with an 
effective date prior to September 5, 1996 shall remain subject to that 
other subpart of this part and are not subject to this subpart.
    (f) Primary product determination and applicability. An owner or 
operator of a process unit that produces or plans to produce a 
thermoplastic product shall determine if the process unit is subject to 
this subpart in accordance with this paragraph. The owner or operator 
shall initially determine whether a process unit is designated as a TPPU 
and subject to the provisions of this subpart in accordance with either 
paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator of a 
flexible operation unit that was not initially designated as a TPPU, but 
in which a thermoplastic product is produced, shall conduct an annual 
re-determination of the applicability of this subpart in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Owners or operators that anticipate 
the production of a thermoplastic product in a process unit that was not 
initially designated as a TPPU, and in which no thermoplastic products 
are currently produced, shall determine if the process unit is subject 
to this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. 
Paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) through (f)(7) of this section discuss 
compliance only for flexible operation units. Other paragraphs apply to 
all process units, including flexible operation units, unless otherwise 
noted. Paragraph (f)(8) of this section

[[Page 283]]

contains reporting requirements associated with the applicability 
determinations. Paragraphs (f)(9) and (f)(10) of this section describe 
criteria for removing the TPPU designation from a process unit.
    (1) Initial determination. The owner or operator shall initially 
determine if a process unit is subject to the provisions of this subpart 
based on the primary product of the process unit in accordance with 
paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. If the process unit 
never uses or manufactures any organic HAP, regardless of the outcome of 
the primary product determination, the only requirements of this subpart 
that might apply to the process unit are contained in paragraph (b) of 
this section. If a flexible operation unit does not use or manufacture 
any organic HAP during the manufacture of one or more products, 
paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section applies to that flexible operation 
unit.
    (i) If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that 
product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.
    (ii) If a process unit produces more than one intended product at 
the same time, the primary product shall be determined in accordance 
with paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) The product for which the process unit has the greatest annual 
design capacity on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of 
the process unit, or
    (B) If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on 
a mass basis for two or more products, and if one of those products is a 
thermoplastic product, then the thermoplastic product shall represent 
the primary product of the process unit.
    (iii) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible 
operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in 
paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the 
anticipated operations for the 5 years following September 12, 1996 at 
existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit 
begins production of any product for new process units. If operations 
cannot be anticipated sufficiently to allow the determination of the 
primary product for the specified period, applicability shall be 
determined (in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for 
the greatest operating time over the specified 5 year period for 
existing process units, or the specified 1 year period for new process 
units, then that product shall represent the primary product of the 
flexible operation unit.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple 
products equally based on operating time, then the product with the 
greatest expected production on a mass basis over the specified 5 year 
period for existing process units, or the specified 1 year period for 
new process units shall represent the primary product of the flexible 
operation unit.
    (iv) If, according to paragraph (f)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section, the primary product of a process unit is a thermoplastic 
product, then that process unit shall be designated as a TPPU. That TPPU 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
is either an affected source or part of an affected source comprised of 
other TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at 
the same plant site that is a major source. If the primary product of a 
process unit is determined to be a product that is not a thermoplastic 
product, then that process unit is not a TPPU.
    (2) If the primary product cannot be determined for a flexible 
operation unit in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, 
applicability shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.
    (i) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in 
accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, but can determine 
that a thermoplastic product is not the primary product, then that 
flexible operation unit is not a TPPU.
    (ii) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product 
in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, and cannot 
determine that a thermoplastic product is not the

[[Page 284]]

primary product as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, 
applicability shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(A) or (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit is an existing process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a TPPU if a thermoplastic 
product was produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating 
time of the flexible operating unit since March 9, 1999. That TPPU and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is 
either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of 
other TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at 
the same plant site that is a major source. For a flexible operation 
unit that is designated as an TPPU in accordance with this paragraph, 
the thermoplastic product produced for the greatest amount of time since 
March 9, 1999 shall be designated as the primary product of the TPPU.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit is a new process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a TPPU if the owner or 
operator anticipates that a thermoplastic product will be manufactured 
in the flexible operation unit at any time in the first year after the 
date the unit begins production of any product. That TPPU and associated 
equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an 
affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other TPPU 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant 
site that is a major source. For a process unit that is designated as a 
TPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the thermoplastic product that 
will be produced shall be designated as the primary product of the TPPU. 
If more than one thermoplastic product will be produced, the owner or 
operator may select which thermoplastic product is designated as the 
primary product.
    (3) Annual applicability determination for non-TPPUs that have 
produced a thermoplastic product. Once per year beginning September 12, 
2001, the owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not 
designated as a TPPU, but that has produced a thermoplastic product at 
any time in the preceding 5-year period or since the date that the unit 
began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the 
evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this 
section. However, an owner or operator that does not intend to produce 
any thermoplastic product in the future, in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(9) of this section, is not required to perform the evaluation 
described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the 
owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time 
over which the product was produced during the preceding 5-year period.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the 
product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the 
preceding 5-year period.
    (iii) If the primary product identified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) is a 
thermoplastic product, the flexible operation unit shall be designated 
as a TPPU. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later 
than 45 days after determining that the flexible operation unit is a 
TPPU, and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in 
accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section for the flexible 
operation unit.
    (4) Applicability determination for non-TPPUs that have not produced 
a thermoplastic product. The owner or operator that anticipates the 
production of a thermoplastic product in a process unit that is not 
designated as a TPPU, and in which no thermoplastic products have been 
produced in the previous 5-year period or since the date that the 
process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, 
shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in 
accordance with paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. Also, 
owners or operators who have notified the Administrator that a process 
unit is not a TPPU in accordance with paragraph (f)(9) of this section, 
that now anticipate the production of a

[[Page 285]]

thermoplastic product in the process unit, shall determine if the 
process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraphs 
(f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall use the procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section to determine if the process unit is 
designated as a TPPU, with the following exception: For existing process 
units that are determining the primary product in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, production shall be projected for 
the five years following the date that the owner or operator anticipates 
initiating the production of a thermoplastic product.
    (ii) If the unit is designated as a TPPU in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply 
in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section.
    (5) Compliance for flexible operation units. Owners or operators of 
TPPUs that are flexible operation units shall comply with the standards 
specified for the primary product, with the exceptions provided in 
paragraphs (f)(5)(i) and (f)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product in 
which no organic HAP is used or manufactured, the owner or operator is 
only required to comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section to demonstrate compliance for activities associated with the 
manufacture of that product. This subpart does not require compliance 
with the provisions of subpart A of this part for activities associated 
with the manufacture of a product that meets the criteria of paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (ii) Whenever a flexible operation unit manufactures a product that 
makes it subject to subpart GGG of this part, the owner or operator is 
not required to comply with the provisions of this subpart during the 
production of that product.
    (6) Owners or operators of TPPUs that are flexible operation units 
have the option of determining the group status of each emission point 
associated with the flexible operation unit, in accordance with either 
paragraph (f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, with the exception of 
batch process vents. For batch process vents, the owner or operator 
shall determine the group status in accordance with Sec. 63.1323.
    (i) The owner or operator may determine the group status of each 
emission point based on emission point characteristics when the primary 
product is being manufactured. The criteria that shall be used for this 
group determination are the Group 1 criteria specified for the primary 
product.
    (ii) The owner or operator may determine the group status of each 
emission point separately for each product produced by the flexible 
operation unit. For each product, the group status shall be determined 
using the emission point characteristics when that product is being 
manufactured and using the Group 1 criteria specified for the primary 
product. (Note: Under this scenario, it is possible that the group 
status, and therefore the requirement to achieve emission reductions, 
for an emission point may change depending on the product being 
manufactured.)
    (7) Owners or operators determining the group status of emission 
points in flexible operation units based solely on the primary product 
in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section shall establish 
parameter monitoring levels, as required, in accordance with either 
paragraph (f)(7)(i) or (f)(7)(ii) of this section. Owners or operators 
determining the group status of emission points in flexible operation 
units based on each product in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of 
this section shall establish parameter monitoring levels, as required, 
in accordance with paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section.
    (i) Establish separate parameter monitoring levels in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1334(a) for each individual product.
    (ii) Establish a single parameter monitoring level (for each 
parameter required to be monitored at each device subject to monitoring 
requirements) in accordance with Sec. 63.1334(a) that would apply for 
all products.
    (8) Reporting requirements. When it is determined that a process 
unit is a TPPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart, the 
Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec. 63.1335(e)(5) shall 
include the information specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(i) and (f)(8)(ii) 
of this section, as applicable. If

[[Page 286]]

it is determined that the process unit is not subject to this subpart, 
the owner or operator shall either retain all information, data, and 
analysis used to document the basis for the determination that the 
primary product is not a thermoplastic product, or, when requested by 
the Administrator, demonstrate that the process unit is not subject to 
this subpart.
    (i) If the TPPU manufactures only one thermoplastic product, 
identification of that thermoplastic product.
    (ii) If the TPPU is designed and operated as a flexible operation 
unit, the information specified in paragraphs (f)(8)(ii)(A) through 
(f)(8)(ii)(D) of this section, as appropriate, shall be submitted.
    (A) If a primary product could be determined, identification of the 
primary product.
    (B) Identification of which compliance option, either paragraph 
(f)(6)(i) or (f)(6)(ii) of this section, has been selected by the owner 
or operator.
    (C) If the option to establish separate parameter monitoring levels 
for each product in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section is selected, the 
identification of each product and the corresponding parameter 
monitoring level.
    (D) If the option to establish a single parameter monitor level in 
paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section is selected, the parameter 
monitoring level for each parameter.
    (9) TPPUs terminating production of all thermoplastic products. If a 
TPPU terminates the production of all thermoplastic products and does 
not anticipate the production of any thermoplastic products in the 
future, the process unit is no longer a TPPU and is not subject to this 
subpart after notification is made to the Administrator. This 
notification shall be accompanied by a rationale for why it is 
anticipated that no thermoplastic products will be produced in the 
process unit in the future.
    (10) Redetermination of applicability to TPPUs that are flexible 
operation units. Whenever changes in production occur that could 
reasonably be expected to change the primary product of a TPPU that is 
operating as a flexible operation unit from a thermoplastic product to a 
product that would make the process unit subject to another subpart of 
this part, the owner or operator shall re-evaluate the status of the 
process unit as a TPPU in accordance with paragraphs (f)(10)(i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the 
owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time 
in which the product was produced for the preceding five-year period, or 
since the date that the process unit began production of any product, 
whichever is shorter.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the 
product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the 
period.
    (iii) If the conditions in (f)(10)(iii)(A) through (C) of this 
section are met, the flexible operation unit shall no longer be 
designated as a TPPU and shall no longer be subject to the provisions of 
this subpart after the date that the process unit is required to be in 
compliance with the provisions of the other subpart of this part to 
which it is subject. If the conditions in paragraphs (f)(10)(iii)(A) 
through (C) of this section are not met, the flexible operation unit 
shall continue to be considered a TPPU and subject to the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (A) The product identified in (f)(10)(ii) of this section is not a 
thermoplastic product; and
    (B) The production of the product identified in (f)(10)(ii) of this 
section is subject to another subpart of this part; and
    (C) The owner or operator submits a notification to the 
Administrator of the pending change in applicability.
    (g) Storage vessel ownership determination. The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through 
(g)(7) of this section to determine to which process unit a storage 
vessel shall be assigned. Paragraph (g)(8) of this section specifies 
when an owner or operator is required to redetermine to which process 
unit a storage vessel is assigned.
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 
CFR part 63 on September 12, 1996, said storage vessel shall be assigned 
to the process unit subject to the other subpart.

[[Page 287]]

    (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
    (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the 
same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into 
or output from the storage vessel (i.e., said process unit has the 
predominant use of the storage vessel).
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if only one of those process 
units is a TPPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be 
assigned to said TPPU.
    (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process 
units are TPPUs that have different primary products and that are 
subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the 
storage vessel to any one of the said TPPUs.
    (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization 
that occurred during the year preceding September 12, 1996 or based on 
the expected utilization for the 5 years following September 12, 1996 
for existing affected sources, whichever is more representative of the 
expected operations for said storage vessel, and based on the expected 
utilization for the first 5 years after initial start-up for new 
affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported 
in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by Sec. 
63.1335(e)(5)(vi).
    (7) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that 
includes one or more process units which place material into, or receive 
materials from the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in 
a tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this 
subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs 
(g)(7)(i) through (g)(7)(iv) of this section.
    (i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that 
utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage 
vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate). With respect 
to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage 
vessel connected by hard-piping both to the process unit and to the 
storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering 
or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage 
vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in 
the tank farm.
    (ii) If there is no process unit at the major source that meets the 
criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a 
storage vessel, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel.
    (iii) If there is only one process unit at the major source that 
meets the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect 
to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that 
process unit.
    (iv) If there are two or more process units at the major source that 
meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section with respect to 
a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those 
process units according to the provisions of paragraphs (g)(3) through 
(g)(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among 
only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(7)(i) 
of this section.
    (8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) 
a process unit, the owner or operator shall re-evaluate the 
applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel.
    (h) Recovery operations equipment ownership determination. The owner 
or operator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (h)(6) of this section to determine to which process unit 
recovery operations equipment shall be assigned. Paragraph (h)(7) of 
this section specifies when an owner or operator is required to 
redetermine to which process unit the recovery operations equipment is 
assigned.
    (1) If recovery operations equipment is already subject to another 
subpart of 40 CFR part 63 on September 12, 1996,

[[Page 288]]

said recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to the process unit 
subject to the other subpart.
    (2) If recovery operations equipment is dedicated to a single 
process unit, the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to 
that process unit.
    (3) If recovery operations equipment is shared among process units, 
then the recovery operations equipment shall be assigned to that process 
unit located on the same plant site as the recovery operations equipment 
that has the greatest input into or output from the recovery operations 
equipment (i.e., said process unit has the predominant use of the 
recovery operations equipment).
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operations 
equipment that is shared among process units and if one of those process 
units is a TPPU subject to this subpart, the recovery operations 
equipment shall be assigned to said TPPU.
    (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for recovery operations 
equipment that is shared among process units and if more than one of the 
process units are TPPUs that have different primary products and that 
are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the 
recovery operations equipment to any one of said TPPUs.
    (6) If the predominant use of recovery operations equipment varies 
from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the 
utilization that occurred during the year preceding September 12, 1996 
or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following September 
12, 1996 for existing affected sources, whichever is the more 
representative of the expected operations for said recovery operations 
equipment, and based on the first 5 years after initial start-up for new 
affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported 
in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by Sec. 
63.1335(e)(5)(vii).
    (7) If a piece of recovery operations equipment begins receiving 
material from a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from a process unit that 
was included in the initial determination, the owner or operator shall 
reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that recovery operations 
equipment.
    (i) Changes or additions to plant sites. The provisions of 
paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4) of this section apply to owners or 
operators that change or add to their plant site or affected source. 
Paragraph (i)(5) of this section provides examples of what are and are 
not considered process changes for purposes of this paragraph (i) of 
this section. Paragraph (i)(6) of this section discusses reporting 
requirements.
    (1) Adding a TPPU to a plant site. The provisions of paragraphs 
(i)(1)(i) and (i)(1)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators 
that add one or more TPPUs to a plant site.
    (i) If a group of one or more TPPUs that produce the same primary 
product is added to a plant site, the added group of one or more TPPUs 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements 
for a new affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up or by 
June 19, 2000, whichever is later, except that new affected sources 
whose primary product, as determined using the procedures specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section, is poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) 
shall be in compliance with Sec. 63.1331 upon initial start-up or 
February 27, 2001, whichever is later, if the added group of one or more 
TPPUs meets the criteria in either paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A) or 
(i)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and the criteria in either paragraph

[[Page 289]]

    (D) The primary product of the group of one or more TPPUs is not 
currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an 
affected source and the plant site meets, or after the addition of the 
group of one or more TPPUs and associated equipment, as listed in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, will meet the definition of a major 
source.
    (ii) If a group of one or more TPPUs that produce the same primary 
product is added to a plant site, and the group of one or more TPPUs 
does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this 
section, and the plant site meets, or after the addition will meet, the 
definition of a major source, the group of one or more TPPUs and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
shall comply with the requirements for an existing affected source in 
this subpart upon initial start-up; by June 19, 2001; or by 6 months 
after notifying the Administrator that a process unit has been 
designated as a TPPU (in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this 
section), whichever is later.
    (2) Adding emission points or making process changes to existing 
affected sources. The provisions of paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through 
(i)(2)(ii) of this section apply to owners or operators that add 
emission points or make process changes to an existing affected source.
    (i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through 
(i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are met, the entire affected source shall 
be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a 
new affected source upon initial start-up or by June 19, 2000, whichever 
is later, as provided in Sec. 63.6(b), except that new affected sources 
whose primary product is poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) shall be in

    (ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(A) through 
(i)(2)(i)(B) of this section are not met, and that replacement of 
components creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either 
newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change 
group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point 
to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, equipment leak components 
subject to Sec. 63.1331, continuous process vents subject to Sec. Sec. 
63.1316 through 63.1320, and heat exchange systems subject to Sec. 
63.1328), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the 
applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting 
emission points shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of 
initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.1311 (i.e., February 27, 1998 for most equipment leak 
components subject to Sec. 63.1331, and June 19, 2001 for most emission 
points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
    (iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process 
change that solely replaces components) is made to an existing affected 
source that creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either 
newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change 
group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point 
to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, equipment leak components 
subject to Sec. 63.1331, continuous process vents subject to Sec. Sec. 
63.1316 through 63.1320, and heat exchange systems subject to Sec. 
63.1328), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the 
applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting 
emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 days after the date of 
initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.1311 (i.e., February 27, 1998 for most equipment leak 
components subject to Sec. 63.1331, and June 19, 2001 for most emission 
points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
    (iv) If any process change (not including a process change that 
solely replaces components) is made to an existing affected source that 
results in baseline emissions (i.e., emissions prior to

[[Page 290]]

applying controls for purposes of complying with this subpart) from 
continuous process vents in the collection of material recovery sections 
within the affected source at an existing affected source producing PET 
using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process changing from less 
than or equal to 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product to greater than 
0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product, the continuous process vents 
shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected 
source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by 120 
days after the date of initial start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever 
is later.
    (3) Existing affected source requirements for surge control vessels 
and bottoms receivers that become subject to subpart H requirements. If 
a process change or addition of an emission point causes a surge control 
vessel or bottoms receiver to become subject to Sec. 63.170 under this 
paragraph (i), the owner or operator shall be in compliance upon initial 
start-up or by June 19, 2001, whichever is later.
    (4) Existing affected source requirements for compressors that 
become subject to the requirements of subpart H of this part. If a 
process change or the addition of an emission point causes a compressor 
to become subject to Sec. 63.164 under this paragraph (i), the owner or 
operator shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by the 
compliance date for that compressor as specified in Sec. 63.1311(d)(1) 
through (d)(4), whichever is later.
    (5) Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes 
of paragraph (i) of this section, examples of process changes include, 
but are not limited to, changes in feedstock type, or process catalyst 
type, or the replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment, or 
equipment changes that increase production capacity. For purposes of 
paragraph (i) of this section, process changes do not include: Process 
upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not 
alter the equipment configuration and operating conditions.
    (6) Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or 
add to their plant site or affected source. Owners or operators that 
change or add to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in 
paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as 
specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(7)(iv).
    (j) Applicability of this subpart during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation. Paragraphs (j)(1) through 
(j)(4) of this section shall be followed during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source or any 
part thereof.
    (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the 
emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or 
specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which this subpart applies. The emission limitations of this subpart and 
the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall not apply 
during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, except as provided 
in paragraphs (j)(3) and (j)(4) of this section. However, if a start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation of one portion of an 
affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission 
point to comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, 
then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the 
applicable emission limitations of this subpart during the start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation. For example, if there 
is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of 
the affected source would still be required to be controlled in 
accordance with the emission limitations in Sec. 63.1314. Similarly, 
the degassing of a storage vessel would not affect the ability of a 
batch process vent to meet the emission limitations of Sec. Sec. 
63.1321 through 63.1327.
    (2) The emission limitations set forth in subpart H of this part, as 
referred to in Sec. 63.1331, shall apply at all times except during 
periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion 
thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in 
cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 63.1331 applies, or during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, malfunction, or

[[Page 291]]

process unit shutdown (as defined in Sec. 63.161).
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during times when 
emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are 
being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown would 
contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items of 
equipment. This paragraph (j)(3) does not apply if the item of equipment 
is malfunctioning. This paragraph also does not apply if the owner or 
operator shuts down the compliance equipment (other than monitoring 
systems) to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction of the affected source or portion thereof. If the owner or 
operator has reason to believe that monitoring equipment would be 
damaged due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of 
the affected source or portion thereof, the owner or operator shall 
provide documentation supporting such a claim in the Precompliance 
Report or in a supplement to the Precompliance Report, as provided in 
Sec. 63.1335(e)(3). Once approved by the Administrator in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1335(e)(3)(viii), the provision for ceasing to collect, 
during a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would 
otherwise be required by the provisions of this subpart must be 
incorporated into the start-up, shutdown, malfunction plan for that 
affected source, as stated in Sec. 63.1335(b)(1).
    (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (j)(1) 
through (j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, 
to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize 
excess emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term ``excess emissions'' means emissions greater than 
those allowed by the emissions limitation which would apply during 
operational periods other than start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. The 
measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not limited to, 
air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work 
practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the 
manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are 
not required, but may be used if available.

extension to the appropriate Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Regional Office at the address listed in Sec. 63.13 no later than June 
16, 1997. The request for a compliance extension shall contain the 
information specified in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D). Unless 
the EPA Regional Office objects to the request for a compliance 
extension within 30 days after receipt of the request, the request shall 
be deemed approved.
    (3) If compliance with the compressor provisions of Sec. 63.164 
cannot reasonably be achieved without a process unit shutdown, the owner 
or operator shall achieve compliance no later than September 12, 1998. 
The owner or operator who elects to use this provision shall submit a 
request for a compliance extension in accordance with the requirements 
of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (4) Compliance with the compressor provisions of Sec. 63.164 shall 
occur not later than September 12, 1999 for any compressor meeting one 
or more of the criteria in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iii) of 
this section. The owner or operator who elects to use these provisions 
shall submit a request for an extension of compliance in accordance with 
the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (i) Compliance cannot be achieved without replacing the compressor;
    (ii) Compliance cannot be achieved without recasting the distance 
piece; or
    (iii) Design modifications are required to connect to a closed-vent 
or recovery system.
    (5) Compliance with the provisions of Sec. 63.170 shall occur no 
later than June 19, 2001.
    (6) Nothhstanding paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section, 
existing affected sources whose primary product, as determined using the 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.1310(f), is PET shall be in compliance 
with Sec. 63.1331 no later than August 6, 2002.
    (e) Pursuant to Section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Act, an owner or 
operator may request an extension allowing the existing affected source 
up to 1 additional year to comply with Section 112(d) standards. For 
purposes of this subpart,

[[Page 293]]

a request for an extension shall be submitted to the permitting 
authority as part of the operating permit application or to the 
Administrator as a separate submittal or as part of the Precompliance 
Report. Requests for extensions shall be submitted no later than 120 
days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (b) through 
(d) of this section, or as specified elsewhere in this subpart, except 
as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The dates specified in 
Sec. 63.6(i) for submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply 
to this subpart.
    (1) A request for an extension of compliance shall include the data 
described in Sec. 63.6(i)(6)(i) (A),(B), and (D).
    (2) The requirements in Sec. 63.6(i)(8) through Sec. 63.6(i)(14) 
shall govern the review and approval of requests for extensions of 
compliance with this subpart.
    (3) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request 
after the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section, provided that 
the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and the 
need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner 
or operator. This request shall include, in addition to the information 
specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a statement of the 
reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or 
operator first learned of the circumstances necessitating a request for 
compliance extension under this paragraph (e)(3).
    (f) Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of 
this part that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators 
of affected sources subject to this subpart.
    (g)(1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an 
affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the 
provisions of subpart I of this part, is required to comply only with 
the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in 
this section, said affected source shall no longer be subject to subpart 
I of this part.
    (2) Said affected sources that elected to comply with subpart I of 
this part through a quality improvement program, as specified in Sec. 
63.175 or Sec. 63.176 or both, may elect to continue these programs 
without interruption as a means of complying with this subpart. In other 
words, becoming subject to this subpart does not restart or reset the 
``compliance clock'' as it relates to reduced burden earned through a 
quality improvement program.
    (h) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage 
vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart 
and that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart 
Kb, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. 
After the compliance dates specified in this section, said storage 
vessel shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb.

section, after the compliance dates specified in this section, affected 
sources producing PET using a continuous terephthalic acid process, 
producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process, or 
producing polystyrene resin using a continuous process subject to this 
subpart that are also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart DDD, are required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said 
sources shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD.
    (2) Existing affected sources producing PET using a continuous 
terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end finisher process shall 
continue to be subject to 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(2)(ii)(C). Once said 
affected source becomes subject to and achieves compliance with Sec. 
63.1329(c) of this subpart, said affected source is no longer subject to 
the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDD.
    (3) Existing affected sources producing PET using a continuous 
terephthalic acid process, but not using a continuous terephthalic acid 
high viscosity multiple end finisher process, that are subject to and 
complying with 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(2)(ii)(B) shall continue to comply 
with said section. Existing affected sources producing PET using a 
continuous dimethyl terephthalic process that are subject to and 
complying with 40 CFR 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B) shall continue to comply 
with said section.

[[Page 294]]

    (j) Owners or operators of affected sources subject to this subpart 
that are also subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this part shall 
comply with both subparts.
    (k) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an 
affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, is required to comply only 
with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates 
specified in this section, said source shall no longer be subject to 40 
CFR part 60, subpart VV.
    (l) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a 
distillation operation that is assigned to an affected source subject to 
this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart NNN, is required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, the 
distillation operation shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart NNN.
    (m) Applicability of other regulations for monitoring, recordkeeping 
or reporting with respect to combustion devices, recovery devices, or 
recapture devices. After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, 
if any combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to 
this subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements in 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC, or is subject to 
monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 265 subpart AA 
or CC and the owner or operator complies with the periodic reporting 
requirements under 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC that would apply to 
the device if the facility had final-permitted status, the owner or 
operator may elect to comply either with the monitoring, recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements of this subpart, or with the monitoring, 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, 
as described in this paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with 
the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this 
subpart. The owner or operator shall identify which option has been 
selected in the Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec. 
63.1335(e)(5).
    (n) Applicability of other requirements for heat exchange systems or 
waste management units. Paragraphs (n)(1) and (n)(2) of this section 
address instances in which certain requirements from other regulations 
also apply for the same heat exchange system(s) or waste management 
unit(s) that are subject to this subpart.
    (1) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, 
if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a 
standard identified in paragraphs (n)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, 
compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in 
paragraphs (n)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance 
with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat 
exchange system.
    (i) Subpart F of this part.
    (ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with Sec. 
63.104 (e.g., subpart U of this part).
    (2) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, 
if any waste management unit subject to this subpart is also subject to 
a standard identified in paragraph (n)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, 
compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in 
paragraph (n)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance 
with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that 
waste management unit.
    (i) Subpart G of this part.
    (ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 63.132 through 63.147.
    (o) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for 
completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), 
unless specified otherwise in the section or paragraph that imposes the 
requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods.
    (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for 
completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as 
specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the 
compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the 
standard calendar period). For each

[[Page 295]]

time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall 
remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for 
each recurring period.
    (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar 
period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the 
period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified 
in paragraphs (o)(2)(i) or (o)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate.
    (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard 
calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there 
remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 
2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for 
tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for 
tasks that must be performed annually; or
    (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end 
of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which 
the initial compliance deadline occurs.
    (3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires 
completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an 
owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the 
specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable 
interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

product. Initial start-up does not include operation solely for testing

[[Page 299]]

equipment. Initial start-up does not include subsequent start-ups of an 
affected source or portion thereof following malfunctions or shutdowns 
or following changes in product for flexible operation units or 
following recharging of equipment in batch operation. Further, for 
purposes of Sec. 63.1311 and Sec. 63.1331, initial start-up does not 
include subsequent start-ups of affected sources or portions thereof 
following malfunctions or process unit shutdowns.
    Maintenance wastewater is defined in Sec. 63.101, except that the 
term ``thermoplastic product process unit'' shall apply wherever the 
term ``chemical manufacturing process unit'' is used. Further, the 
generation of wastewater from the routine rinsing or washing of 
equipment in batch operation between batches is not maintenance 
wastewater, but is considered to be process wastewater, for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    Mass process means a polymerization process carried out through the 
use of thermal energy. Mass processes do not utilize emulsifying or 
suspending agents, but may utilize catalysts or other additives.

material recovery section means the equipment that recovers unreacted 
styrene from any process section for use, reuse, or sale, or the 
equipment that separates materials containing unreacted styrene from any 
process section for off-site purification or treatment with the intent 
to recover styrene for reuse. Equipment used to store recovered 
materials (i.e., ethylene glycol, methanol, or styrene) is not included. 
Equipment designed to recover or separate materials from the polymer 
product is to be included in this process section, provided that at the 
time of initial compliance some of the unreacted or by-product material 
is recovered for return to the TPPU, or sale, or provided that some of 
the separated material is sent for off-site purification or treatment 
with the intent to recover the unreacted or by-product material for 
reuse. Otherwise, such equipment is to be assigned to one of the other 
process sections, as appropriate. If equipment is used to recover 
unreacted or by-product material and return it directly to the same 
piece of process equipment from which it was emitted, then that recovery 
equipment is considered part of the process section that contains the 
process equipment. On the other hand, if equipment is used to recover 
unreacted or by-product material and return it to a different piece of 
process equipment in the same process section, that recovery equipment 
is considered part of a material recovery section. Equipment used for 
the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from PET plants, however, is not 
included in the material recovery section; such equipment is to be 
included in the polymerization reaction section. Equipment used for the 
on-site recovery of both ethylene glycol and any other materials from 
PET plants is not included in the material recovery section; this 
equipment is to be included in the polymerization reaction section. Such 
equipment includes both contact and non-contact condensers removing 
ethylene glycol from vapor streams coming out of polymerization vessels.
    Maximum true vapor pressure is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that

esterification vessels). For the purposes of these standards, the 
polymerization reaction section begins with the equipment used to 
transfer the materials from the raw materials preparation section and 
ends with the last vessel in which polymerization occurs. Equipment used 
for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from PET plants is included 
in this process section, rather than in the material recovery process 
section.

    Process unit means a collection of equipment assembled and connected 
by hardpiping or duct work, used to process raw materials and to 
manufacture a product.
    Process vent means a gaseous emission stream from a unit operation 
that is discharged to the atmosphere either directly or after passing 
through one or more control, recovery, or recapture devices. Unit 
operations that may have process vents are condensers, distillation 
units, reactors, or other unit operations within the TPPU. Process vents

[[Page 301]]

exclude pressure releases, gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas 
system(s), and leaks from equipment regulated under Sec. 63.1331. A 
gaseous emission stream is no longer considered to be a process vent 
after the stream has been controlled and monitored in accordance with 
the applicable provisions of this subpart.
    Product means a polymer produced using the same monomers and varying 
in additives (e.g., initiators, terminators, etc.); catalysts; or in the 
relative proportions of monomers, that is manufactured by a process 
unit. With respect to polymers, more than one recipe may be used to 
produce the same product. As an example, styrene acrylonitrile resin and 
methyl methacrylate butadiene styrene resin each represent a different 
product. Product also means a chemical that is not a polymer, that is 
manufactured by a process unit. By-products, isolated intermediates, 
impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not considered products.
    Raw materials preparation section means the equipment at a polymer 
manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as monomers 
and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of the standards in 
this subpart, this process section includes the equipment used to 
transfer raw materials from storage and/or the equipment used to 
transfer recovered material from the material recovery process sections 
to the raw material preparation section, and ends with the last piece of 
equipment that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw 
materials preparation section may include equipment that is used to 
purify, dry, or otherwise treat raw materials or raw and recovered 
materials together; to activate catalysts; or to promote esterification 
including the formation of some short polymer chains (oligomers). The 
raw materials preparation section does not include equipment that is 
designed primarily to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the 
treatment of recovered materials alone, or the storage of raw or 
recovered materials.
    Recipe means a specific composition, from among the range of 
possible compositions that may occur within a product, as defined in 
this section. A recipe is determined by the proportions of monomers and, 
if present, other reactants and additives that are used to make the 
recipe. For example, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene latex resin (ABS 
latex) without additives; ABS latex with an additive; and ABS latex with 
different proportions of acrylonitrile to butadiene are all different 
recipes of the same product, ABS latex.
    Reconstruction means the replacement of components of an affected 
source or of a previously unaffected stationary source that becomes an 
affected source as a result of the replacement, to such an extent that:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent 
of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a 
comparable new source; and
    (2) It is technologically and economically feasible for the 
reconstructed source to meet the provisions of this subpart.

absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, oil-water separators or 
organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such as decanters, 
strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. For the purposes of the 
monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements of this subpart, 
recapture devices are considered recovery devices.
    Recovery operations equipment means the equipment used to separate 
the components of process streams. Recovery operations equipment 
includes distillation units, condensers, etc. Equipment used for 
wastewater treatment and recovery or recapture devices used as control 
devices shall not be considered recovery operations equipment.
    Residual is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that when the definition 
in Sec. 63.111 uses the term ``Table 9 compounds,'' the term ``organic 
HAP listed in Table 6 of

[[Page 302]]

subpart JJJ'' shall apply for purposes of this subpart.
    Shutdown means for purposes including, but not limited to, periodic 
maintenance, replacement of equipment, or repair, the cessation of 
operation of an affected source, a TPPU(s) within an affected source, a 
waste management unit or unit operation within an affected source, or 
equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, or the emptying 
or degassing of a storage vessel. For purposes of the wastewater 
provisions of Sec. 63.1330, shutdown does not include the routine 
rinsing or washing of equipment in batch operation between batches. For 
purposes of the batch process vent provisions in Sec. Sec. 63.1321 
through 63.1327, the cessation of equipment in batch operation is not a 
shutdown, unless the equipment undergoes maintenance, is replaced, or is

    (18) When a combustion device is used to comply with the 20 parts 
per million by volume outlet concentration standard specified in Sec. 
63.113(a)(2), the correction to 3 percent oxygen is only required when 
supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions, for the 
purposes of this subpart. In addition, the correction to 3 percent 
oxygen specified in Sec. 63.116(c)(3) and (c)(3)(iii) is only required 
when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the emissions, for 
the purposes of this subpart. Finally, when a combustion device is used 
to comply with the 20 parts per million by volume outlet concentration 
standard specified in Sec. 63.113(a)(2), an owner or operator shall 
record and report the outlet concentration required in Sec. 
63.117(a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iv) corrected to 3 percent oxygen when

4.0'' is used, or related terms indicating a TRE index value of 4.0, 
referred to in Sec. Sec. 63.113 through 63.118, are used, the term 
``TRE of 6.7,'' shall apply instead, for the purposes of this subpart. 
The TRE range of 3.7 to 6.7 for continuous process vents at existing 
affected sources producing MBS corresponds to the TRE range of 1.0 to 
4.0 for other continuous process vents, as it applies to monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting.
    (2) Not allow organic HAP emissions from the collection of 
continuous process vents at the affected source to be greater than 
0.000590 kg organic HAP/Mg of product. Compliance with this paragraph

affected sources producing PET or polystyrene using a continuous process 
are subject to the provisions of this section.
    (e) Owners or operators of affected sources producing ASA/AMSAN 
shall reduce organic HAP emissions from each continuous process vent, 
each batch process vent, and each aggregate batch vent stream by 98 
weight-percent and shall comply with either paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), or

shall be considered to be a Group 1 aggregate batch vent stream and the 
owner or operator of that aggregate batch vent stream shall comply with 
the requirements for a Group 1 aggregate batch vent stream contained in 
Sec. Sec. 63.1321 through 63.1327, except that each aggregate batch 
vent stream shall be controlled to reduce organic HAP emissions by 98

63.1323(b)(6)(i), to demonstrate that mass emissions per mass product 
are less than or equal to 0.07 kg organic HAP/Mg product. If engineering 
assessment shows that mass emissions per mass product are greater than 
0.07 kg organic HAP/Mg product and the owner or operator wishes to 
demonstrate that mass emissions per mass product are less than the 
threshold emission rate of 0.12 kg organic HAP/Mg product, the owner or 
operator shall use the procedures specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (c) Compliance with mass emissions per mass product standards. 
Owners or operators complying with Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), 
(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), and (c)(1)(i) shall demonstrate

Sec. 63.1323  Batch process vents--methods and procedures for group 

determination.

    (a) General requirements. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section and in Sec. 63.1321(b)(1), the owner or operator of batch 
process vents at affected sources shall determine the group status of 
each batch process vent in accordance with the provisions of this 
section. This determination may be based on either organic HAP or TOC 
emissions.
    (1) The procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this 
section shall be followed to determine the group status of each batch 
process vent. This determination shall be made in accordance with either 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of 
a batch process vent based on the expected mix of products. For each 
product, emission characteristics of the single highest-HAP recipe, as 
defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for that product shall 
be used in the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.
    (ii) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status 
of a batch process vent based on annualized production of the single 
highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, 
considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit 
operation. The annualized production of the highest-HAP recipe shall be 
based exclusively on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe of 
all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation for a 12 
month period. The production level used may be the actual production 
rate. It is not necessary to assume a maximum production rate (i.e., 
8,760 hours per year at maximum design production).

[[Page 320]]

    (iii) The single highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe 
of the product with the highest total mass of HAP charged to the reactor 
during the production of a single batch of product.
    (2) The annual uncontrolled organic HAP or TOC emissions and annual 
average batch vent flow rate shall be determined at the exit from the 
batch unit operation. For the purposes of these determinations, the 
primary condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or 
distillation column, the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction 
products, by-products, or solvent from a stripper operated in batch 
mode, and the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, 
by-products, or solvent from a distillation operation operated in batch 
mode shall be considered part of the batch unit operation. All other 
devices that recover or oxidize organic HAP or TOC vapors shall be 
considered control devices as defined in Sec. 63.1312.
    (3) The owner or operator of a batch process vent complying with the 
flare provisions in Sec. 63.1322(a)(1) or Sec. 63.1322(b)(1) or 
routing the batch process vent to a control device to comply with the 
requirements in Sec. 63.1322(a)(2) or Sec. 63.1322(b)(2) is not 
required to perform the batch process vent group determination described 
in this section, but shall comply with all requirements applicable to 
Group 1 batch process vents for said batch process vent.
    (b) Determination of annual emissions. The owner or operator shall 
calculate annual uncontrolled TOC or organic HAP emissions for each 
batch process vent using the methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(8) of this section. To estimate emissions from a batch 
emissions episode, owners or operators may use either the emissions

batch vent stream.
    (i) Process changes affecting Group 2 batch process vents. Whenever 
process changes, as described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, are 
made that affect one or more Group 2 batch process vents and that could 
reasonably be expected to change one or more Group 2 batch process vents 
to Group 1 batch process vents or that could reasonably be expected to 
reduce the batch mass input limitation for one or more Group 2 batch 
process vents, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (i)(2) 
and (3) of this section.
    (1) Examples of process changes include the changes listed in 
paragraphs (i)(1)(i), (i)(1)(ii), and (i)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (i) For all batch process vents, examples of process changes

(i), process changes do not include: Process upsets; unintentional, 
temporary process changes; and changes that are within the margin of 
variation on which the original group determination was based.
    (ii) For Group 2 batch process vents where the group determination 
and batch mass input limitation are based on the expected mix of 
products, the situations described in paragraphs (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) 
of this section shall be considered to be process changes.
    (A) The production of combinations of products not considered in 
establishing the batch mass input limitation.

[[Page 329]]

highest-HAP recipe for that product in the batch mass input limitation 
determination.
    (iii) For Group 2 batch process vents where the group determination 
and batch mass input limitation are based on the single highest-HAP 
recipe (considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit 
operation), the production of a recipe having a total mass of HAP 
charged to the reactor (during the production of a single batch of 
product) that is higher than the total mass of HAP for the highest-HAP 
recipe used in the batch mass input limitation determination shall be 
considered to be a process change.
    (2) For each batch process vent affected by a process change, the 
owner or operator shall redetermine the group status by repeating the 
procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, as 
applicable; alternatively, engineering assessment, as described in 
paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, may be used to determine the

    (3) Based on the results from paragraph (i)(2) of this section, 
owners or operators of affected sources shall comply with either 
paragraph (i)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (i) If the group redetermination described in paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section indicates that a Group 2 batch process vent has become a 
Group 1 batch process vent as a result of the process change, the owner 
or operator shall submit a report as specified in Sec. 63.1327(b) and 
shall comply with the Group 1 provisions in Sec. Sec. 63.1322 through 
63.1327 in accordance with Sec. 63.1310(i)(2)(ii) or (i)(2)(iii), as 
applicable.
    (ii) If the redetermination described in paragraph (i)(2) of this 
section indicates that a Group 2 batch process vent with annual 
emissions less than the level specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section, that is in compliance with Sec. 63.1322(g), now has annual 
emissions greater than or equal to the level specified in paragraph (d) 
of this section but remains a Group 2 batch process vent, the owner or 
operator shall comply with the provisions in paragraphs (i)(3)(ii)(A) 
through (C) of this section.
    (A) Redetermine the batch mass input limitation;
    (B) Submit a report as specified in Sec. 63.1327(c); and
    (C) Comply with Sec. 63.1322(f), beginning with the year following 
the submittal of the report submitted according to paragraph 
(i)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (iii) If the group redetermination described in paragraph (i)(2) of 
this section indicates no change in group status or no change in the 
relation of annual emissions to the levels specified in paragraph (d) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs 
(i)(3)(iii)(A) and (i)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (A) The owner or operator shall redetermine the batch mass input 
limitation; and
    (B) The owner or operator shall submit the new batch mass input 
limitation in accordance with Sec. 63.1327(c).
    (j) Process changes to new SAN affected sources using a batch 
process. Whenever process changes, as described in paragraph (j)(1) of 
this section, are made to a new affected source producing SAN using a 
batch process that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the 
compliance status (i.e., achievement of 84 percent emission reduction) 
of the affected source, the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (1) Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, 
changes in production capacity, production rate, feedstock type, or 
catalyst type; replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment 
considered part of a batch unit operation, as specified in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section; replacement, removal, or addition of control 
equipment associated with a continuous or batch process vent or an 
aggregate batch vent stream. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(1), 
process changes do not include process upsets or unintentional, 
temporary process changes.
    (2) The owner or operator shall redetermine the percent emission 
reduction achieved using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1333(c). 
If engineering assessment, as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section, can demonstrate that the process change did

[[Page 330]]

not cause the percent emission reduction to decrease, it may be used in 
lieu of redetermining the percent reduction using the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.1333(c).
    (3) Where the redetermined percent reduction is less than 84 
percent, the owner or operator of the affected source shall submit a 
report as specified in Sec. 63.1327(d) and shall comply with Sec. 
63.1322(a)(3) and all associated provisions in accordance with Sec. 
63.1310(i).

Sec. 63.1324  Batch process vents--monitoring equipment.

    (a) General requirements. Each owner or operator of a batch process 
vent or aggregate batch vent stream that uses a control device to comply 
with the requirements in Sec. 63.1322(a) or Sec. 63.1322(b), shall 
install the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (c) of this 
section. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, 
maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or 
other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the 
equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
    (1) This monitoring equipment shall be in operation at all times 
when batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, that the owner or 
operator has selected to control are vented to the control device, or at 
all times when an aggregate batch vent stream is vented to the control 
device.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the owner or 
operator shall operate control devices such that the daily average of 
monitored parameters, established as specified in paragraph (f) of this 
section, remains above the minimum level or below the maximum level, as 
appropriate.
    (b) Continuous process vents. Each owner or operator of a continuous 
process vent that uses a control device or recovery device to comply 
with the requirements in Sec. 63.1322(a)(3) shall comply with the 
applicable requirements of Sec. 63.1315(a) as specified in Sec. 
63.1321(b).
    (c) Batch process vent and aggregate batch vent stream monitoring 
equipment. The monitoring equipment specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(8) of this section shall be installed as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The parameters to be monitored are 
specified in Table 7 of this subpart.
    (1) Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device 
equipped with a continuous recorder is required.
    (i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, 
the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or

    (ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring 
devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and 
after the catalyst bed.
    (2) Where a flare is used, a device (including but not limited to a 
thermocouple, ultra-violet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of 
continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required.
    (3) Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts 
design heat input capacity is used, a temperature monitoring device in 
the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder is required. Any boiler 
or process heater in which all batch process vents or aggregate batch 
vent streams are introduced with the primary fuel or are used as the 
primary fuel is exempt from this requirement.
    (4) Where a scrubber is used with an incinerator, boiler, or process 
heater in concert with the combustion of halogenated batch process vents 
or halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, the following monitoring 
equipment is required for the scrubber.
    (i) A pH monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder to 
monitor the pH of the scrubber effluent.
    (ii) A flow measurement device equipped with a continuous recorder 
shall be located at the scrubber influent for liquid flow. Gas stream 
flow shall be determined using one of the procedures specified in 
paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(A) through (c)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (A) The owner or operator may determine gas stream flow using the 
design

[[Page 331]]

blower capacity, with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop.
    (B) If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264 
through 266 that have required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/
G) ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the 
owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had 
been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was 
conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized 
to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.
    (C) The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream 
flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will 
be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require 
determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide 
a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream flow 
anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions 
other than start-ups, shutdowns, or malfunctions. The plan shall include 
a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of 
how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas stream 
flow, and a description of the records that will be maintained to 
document the determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator 
shall maintain the plan as specified in Sec. 63.1335(a).
    (5) Where an absorber is used, a scrubbing liquid temperature 
monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device are required, 
each equipped with a continuous recorder.
    (6) Where a condenser is used, a condenser exit temperature (product 
side) monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.
    (7) Where a carbon adsorber is used, an integrating regeneration 
steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure monitoring device having an 
accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent of the flow rate, level, or 
pressure, or better, capable of recording the total regeneration steam 
flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure (gauge or absolute) for each 
regeneration cycle; and a carbon bed temperature monitoring device, 
capable of recording the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration 
and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle are required.
    (8) As an alternate to paragraphs (c)(5) through (c)(7) of this 
section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device 
equipped with a continuous recorder.
    (d) Alternative monitoring parameters. An owner or operator of a 
batch process vent or aggregate batch vent stream may request approval 
to monitor parameters other than those required by paragraph (c) of this 
section. The request shall be submitted according to the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.1327(f) and Sec. 63.1335(f). Approval shall be 
requested if the owner or operator:
    (1) Uses a control device other than those included in paragraph (c) 
of this section; or
    (2) Uses one of the control devices included in paragraph (c) of 
this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those 
specified in Table 7 of this subpart and paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) Monitoring of bypass lines. Owners or operators of a batch 
process vent or aggregate batch vent stream using a vent system that 
contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from a control 
device used to comply with Sec. 63.1322(a) or Sec. 63.1322(b) shall 
comply with either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section. Equipment 
such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended 
valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety purposes 
are not subject to this paragraph (e).
    (1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that 
takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be 
generated as specified in Sec. 63.1326(e)(3). The flow indicator shall 
be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert 
emissions away from the control device and to the atmosphere; or
    (2) Secure the bypass line damper or valve in the non-diverting 
position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual 
inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least 
once every month to ensure that the damper or valve is maintained in the 
non-diverting position and emissions are not diverted

[[Page 332]]

through the bypass line. Records shall be generated as specified in 
Sec. 63.1326(e)(4).
    (f) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. Parameter 
monitoring levels for batch process vents and aggregate batch vent 
streams shall be established as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through 
(f)(3) of this section. For continuous process vents complying with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(3), parameter monitoring levels shall be established as 
specified in Sec. 63.1315(a), except as specified in paragraph (f)(4) 
of this section.
    (1) For each parameter monitored under paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall establish a level, defined as 
either a maximum or minimum operating parameter as denoted in Table 8 of 
this subpart, that indicates proper operation of the control device. The 
level shall be established in accordance with the procedures specified 
in Sec. 63.1334. The level may be based upon a prior performance test 
conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by 
EPA, and the owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance 
test under Sec. 63.1325, provided that the prior performance test meets 
the conditions of Sec. 63.1325(b)(3).
    (i) For batch process vents using a control device to comply with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(2), the established level shall reflect the control 
efficiency established as part of the initial compliance demonstration 
specified in Sec. 63.1325(c)(2).
    (ii) For aggregate batch vent streams using a control device to 
comply with Sec. 63.1322(b)(2), the established level shall reflect the 
emission reduction requirement of either 90 percent or 20 ppmv specified 
in Sec. 63.1322(b)(2).
    (iii) For batch process vents and aggregate batch vent streams using 
a control device to comply with Sec. 63.1322(a)(3), the established 
level shall reflect the control efficiency established as part of the 
initial compliance demonstration specified in Sec. 63.1325(f)(4).
    (2) The established level, along with supporting documentation, 
shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status or the 
operating permit application as required in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5) or Sec. 
63.1335(e)(8), respectively.
    (3) The operating day shall be defined as part of establishing the 
parameter monitoring level and shall be submitted with the information 
in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The definition of operating day 
shall specify the time(s) at which an operating day begins and ends. The 
operating day shall not exceed 24 hours.
    (4) For continuous process vents using a control or recovery device 
to comply with Sec. 63.1322(a)(3), the established level shall reflect 
the control efficiency established as part of the initial compliance 
demonstration specified in Sec. 63.1325(f)(4).

<R05>
Sec. 63.1325  Batch process vents--performance test methods and procedures to 

determine compliance.

    (a) Use of a flare. When a flare is used to comply with Sec. 
63.1322(a)(1), Sec. 63.1322(a)(3), Sec. 63.1322(b)(1), or Sec. 
63.1322(b)(3), the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply 
with Sec. 63.1333(e).
    (b) Exceptions to performance tests. An owner or operator is not 
required to conduct a performance test when a control device specified 
in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section is used to comply 
with Sec. 63.1322(a)(2) or (a)(3).
    (1) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 
44 megawatts or greater.
    (2) A boiler or process heater where the vent stream is introduced 
with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.
    (3) A control device for which a performance test was conducted for 
determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA and the 
test was conducted using the same Methods specified in this section and 
either no deliberate process changes have been made since the test, or 
the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the 
performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate 
compliance despite process changes. Recovery devices used for 
controlling emissions from continuous process vents complying with Sec. 
63.1322(a)(3) are also eligible for the

[[Page 333]]

exemption described in this paragraph (b)(3).
    (4) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the 
owner or operator:
    (i) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and 
complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or
    (ii) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements 
of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.
    (5) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator 
has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified 
compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, 
subpart O.
    (c) Batch process vent testing and procedures for compliance with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(2). Except as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, an owner or operator using a control device to comply with 
Sec. 63.1322(a)(2) shall conduct a performance test using the 
procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in order to 
determine the control efficiency of the control device. An owner or 
operator shall determine the percent reduction for the batch cycle using 
the control efficiency of the control device as specified in paragraphs 
(c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section and the procedures 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based 
on either total organic HAP or TOC. For purposes of this paragraph (c), 
the term ``batch emission episode'' shall have the meaning ``period of 
the batch emission episode selected for control,'' which may be the 
entire batch emission episode or may only be a portion of the batch 
emission episode.
    (1) Performance tests shall be conducted as specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(v) of this section.
    (i) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a 
test shall be performed for the entire period of each batch emission 
episode in the batch cycle that the owner or operator selects to control 
as part of achieving the required 90 percent emission reduction for the 
batch cycle specified in Sec. 63.1322(a)(2). Only one test is required 
for each batch emission episode selected by the owner or operator for 
control. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures listed in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B) through (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section.
    (A) Alternatively, an owner or operator may choose to test only 
those periods of the batch emission episode during which the emission 
rate for the entire episode can be determined or during which the 
emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch 
emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options 
shall develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, 
based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate 
that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could 
constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material 
balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used 
provided the results are still relevant to the current batch process 
vent conditions.
    (B) Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, 
shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring 
device is a pitot tube, except that references to particulate matter in 
Method 1A do not apply for the purposes of this subpart. No traverse is 
necessary when Method 2A or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is used to 
determine gas stream volumetric flow rate. Inlet sampling sites shall be 
located as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B)(1) and (c)(1)(i)(B)(2) 
of this section. Outlet sampling sites shall be located at the outlet of 
the control device prior to release to the atmosphere.
    (1) The control device inlet sampling site shall be located at the 
exit from the batch unit operation before any control device. Sec. 
63.1323(a)(2) describes those recovery devices considered part of the 
unit operation. Inlet sampling sites would be after these specified 
recovery devices.
    (2) If a batch process vent is introduced with the combustion air or 
as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design 
capacity less than 44 megawatts, selection of the location of the inlet 
sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total organic HAP or TOC 
(minus methane and ethane) concentrations in all batch process

[[Page 334]]

vents and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or 
process heater.
    (C) Gas stream volumetric flow rate and/or average batch vent flow 
rate shall be determined as specified in Sec. 63.1323(e).
    (D) Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be 
used to determine the concentration of organic HAP or TOC, as 
appropriate. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been 
validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 
appendix A of this part may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 
60, appendix A shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(i)(D)(1) and (c)(1)(i)(D)(2) of this section.
    (1) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the 
largest percent by volume of the emissions.
    (2) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable 
if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times 
the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas 
when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
    (ii) If an integrated sample is taken over the entire test period to 
determine average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, 
emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equations 
19 and 20 of this subpart.

in Sec. 63.1323(b).
    (i) For noncombustion devices, the control efficiency shall be as 
determined by the performance test required by paragraph (f)(1), (f)(2), 
or (f)(3) of

[[Page 338]]

this section. Alternatively, if a performance test is not required by 
paragraph (c) of this section, the control efficiency shall be 
determined by the owner or operator based on engineering assessment.
    (ii) For combustion devices, the control efficiency shall be as 
determined by the performance test required by paragraph (f)(1), (f)(2), 
or (f)(3) of this section. Alternatively, if a performance test is not 
required, the control efficiency shall be 98 percent. The control 
efficiency for a flare shall be 98 percent.
    (g) Batch mass input limitation. The batch mass input limitation 
required by Sec. 63.1322(g)(1) shall be determined by the owner or 
operator such that annual emissions for the batch process vent remain 
less than the level specified in Sec. 63.1323(d). The batch mass input 
limitation required by Sec. 63.1322(f)(1) shall be determined by the 
owner or operator such that annual emissions remain at a level that 
ensures that said batch process vent remains a Group 2 batch process 
vent, given the actual annual flow rate for said batch process vent 
determined according to the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1323(e)(3). 
The batch mass input limitation shall be determined using the same 
basis, as described in Sec. 63.1323(a)(1), used to make the group 
determination (i.e., expected mix of products or highest-HAP recipe.) 
The establishment of the batch mass input limitation is not dependent 
upon any past production or activity level.
    (1) If the expected mix of products serves as the basis for the 
batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be 
determined based on any foreseeable combination of products that the 
owner or operator expects to manufacture.
    (2) If the single highest-HAP recipe serves as the basis for the 
batch mass input limitation, the batch mass input limitation shall be 
determined based solely on the production of the single highest-HAP 
recipe, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit 
operation.

Sec. 63.1329  Process contact cooling towers provisions.

    (a) The owner or operator of each new affected source that 
manufactures PET is required to comply with paragraph (b) of this 
section. The owner or operator of each existing affected source that 
manufactures PET using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity 
multiple end finisher process that utilizes a process contact cooling 
tower shall comply with paragraph (c) of this section, and is not 
required to comply with paragraph (b) of this section. The compliance 
date for process contact cooling towers subject to the provisions of 
this section is specified in Sec. 63.1311.
    (b) New affected source requirements. The owner or operator of a new 
affected source subject to this section shall comply with paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator of a new affected source subject to this 
section shall not send contact condenser effluent associated with a 
vacuum system to a process contact cooling tower.
    (2) The owner or operator of a new affected source subject to this 
section shall indicate in the Notification of Compliance Status, as 
required in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5), that contact condenser

[[Page 344]]

effluent associated with vacuum systems is not sent to process contact 
cooling towers.
    (c) Existing affected source requirements. The owner or operator of 
an existing affected source subject to this section who manufactures PET 
using a continuous terephthalic acid high viscosity multiple end 
finisher process, and who is subject or becomes subject to 40 CFR part 
60, subpart DDD, shall maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the 
process contact cooling tower at or below 4.0 percent by weight averaged 
on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days. 
Compliance with this paragraph (c) shall be determined as specified in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. It should be noted 
that compliance with this paragraph (c) does not exempt owners or 
operators from complying with the provisions of Sec. 63.1330 for those 
process wastewater streams that are sent to the process contact cooling 
tower.
    (1) To determine the ethylene glycol concentration, owners or 
operators shall follow the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.564(j)(1), 
except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (i) At least one sample per operating day shall be collected using 
the procedures specified in 40 CFR 60.564(j)(1)(i). An average ethylene 
glycol concentration by weight shall be calculated on a daily basis over 
a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each daily average ethylene 
glycol concentration so calculated constitutes a performance test.
    (ii) The owner or operator may elect to reduce the sampling program 
to any 14 consecutive operating day period once every two calendar 
months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling average 
concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling program are 
each less than 1.2 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the average 
concentration obtained over the 14 operating day sampling during the 
reduced test period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval 
calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day 
average exceeded 1.2 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or 
operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. The 95 percent 
confidence interval shall be calculated as specified in paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section. A reduced program may be reinstituted if 
the requirements specified in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) are met.
    (iii) The upper 95 percent confidence interval shall be calculated 
using the Equation 27 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JN00.040

Where:

CI<INF>95</INF> = 95 percent confidence interval
X<INF>i</INF> = daily ethylene glycol concentration for each operating 
day used to calculate each 14-day rolling average used in test results 
to justify implementing the reduced testing program.
n = number of ethylene glycol concentrations.

    (2) Measuring an alternative parameter, such as carbon oxygen demand 
or biological oxygen demand, that is demonstrated to be directly 
proportional to the ethylene glycol concentration shall be allowed. Such 
parameter shall be measured during the initial 14-day performance test 
during which the facility is shown to be in compliance with the ethylene 
glycol concentration standard whereby the ethylene glycol concentration 
is determined using the procedures described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. The alternative parameter shall be measured on a daily basis 
and the average value of the alternative parameter shall be calculated 
on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each 
daily average value of the alternative parameter constitutes a 
performance test.

[[Page 345]]

    (3) During each performance test, daily measurement and daily 
average 14-day rolling averages of the ethylene glycol concentration in 
the cooling tower water shall be recorded. For the initial performance 
test, these records shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance 
Status report.
    (4) All periods when the 14-day rolling average exceeds the standard 
shall be reported in the Periodic Report.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, the owner or operator of each affected source shall comply with 
the requirements of subpart H of this part, with the differences noted 
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(13) of this section.
    (1) For an affected source producing polystyrene resin, the 
indications of liquids dripping, as defined in subpart H of this part, 
from bleed ports in pumps and agitator seals in light liquid service 
shall not be considered to be a leak. For purposes of this subpart, a 
``bleed port'' is a technologically-required feature of the pump or seal 
whereby polymer fluid used to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the 
pump or agitator shaft exits the pump, thereby resulting in a visible 
dripping of fluid.
    (2) The compliance date for the equipment leak provisions contained 
in this section is provided in Sec. 63.1311. Whenever subpart H of this 
part refers to the compliance dates specified in any paragraph contained 
in Sec. 63.100, the compliance dates listed in Sec. 63.1311(d) shall 
instead apply, for the purposes of this subpart. When Sec. 63.182(c)(4) 
refers to ``sources subject to subpart F,'' the phrase ``sources subject 
to this subpart'' shall apply, for the purposes of this subpart. In 
addition, extensions of compliance dates are addressed by Sec. 
63.1311(e) instead of Sec. 63.182(a)(6), for the purposes of this 
subpart.
    (3) Owners and operators of an affected source subject to this 
subpart are not required to submit the Initial Notification required by 
Sec. 63.182(a)(1) and Sec. 63.182(b).
    (4) As specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5), the Notification of 
Compliance Status required by paragraphs Sec. 63.182(a)(2) and Sec. 
63.182(c) shall be submitted within 150 days (rather than 90 days) of 
the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.1311 for the 
equipment leak provisions.
    (5) The information specified by Sec. 63.182(a)(3) and Sec. 
63.182(d) (i.e., Periodic Reports) shall be submitted as part of the 
Periodic Reports required by Sec. 63.1335(e)(6).
    (6) For pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid 
service; pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid 
service; and instrumentation systems; owners or operators of affected 
sources producing PET shall

[[Page 348]]

comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (ii) of this 
section instead of with the requirements of Sec. 63.139. Owners or 
operators of PET affected sources shall comply with all other provisions 
of subpart H of this part for pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators 
in heavy liquid service; pressure relief devices in light liquid or 
heavy liquid service; and instrumentation systems, except as specified 
in paragraphs (a)(6)(iii) through (v) of this section.
    (i) A leak is determined to be detected if there is evidence of a 
potential leak found by visual, audible, or olfactory means. Method 21, 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A may not be used to determine the presence or 
absence of a leak.
    (ii)(A) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as 
practical, but not later than 15 days after it is detected, except as 
provided in Sec. 63.171.
    (B) The first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 days 
after each leak is detected.
    (C) Repaired shall mean that the visual, audible, olfactory, or 
other indications of a leak have been eliminated; that no bubbles are 
observed at potential leak sites during a leak check using soap 
solution; or that the system will hold a test pressure.
    (iii) An owner or operator is not required to develop an initial 
list of identification numbers as would otherwise be required under 
Sec. 63.181(b)(1)(i) or Sec. 63.181(b)(4).
    (iv) When recording the detection of a leak under Sec. 
63.182(d)(1), the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply 
with paragraphs (a)(6)(iv)(A) through (a)(6)(iv)(B) of this section.
    (A) When complying with Sec. 63.181(d)(1), provide an 
identification number for the leaking equipment at the time of 
recordkeeping. Further, the owner or operator is not required to record 
the identification number of the instrument (i.e., Method 21 instrument) 
because the use of Method 21 is not an acceptable method for determining 
a leak under this paragraph (a)(6).
    (B) An owner or operator is not required to comply with Sec. 
63.181(d)(4) which requires a record of the maximum instrument reading 
measured by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    (v) Indications of liquids dripping, as defined in subpart H of this 
part, from packing glands for pumps in ethylene glycol service where the 
pump seal is designed to weep fluid shall not be considered to be a 
leak. Ethylene glycol dripping from pump seals must be captured in a 
catchpan and returned to the process.
    (7) When Sec. 63.166(b)(4)(i) refers to Table 9 of subpart G of 
this part, the owner or operator is only required to consider organic 
HAP listed on Table 6 of this subpart for purposes of this subpart, 
except for ethylene glycol which need not be considered.
    (8) When the provisions of subpart H of this part specify that 
Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used, Method 18 or 
Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used for the purposes of 
this subpart. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall 
conform with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (a)(8)(ii) of 
this section.
    (i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be the single organic HAP representing 
the largest percent by volume of the emissions.
    (ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is 
acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at 
least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero 
calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive 
scale.
    (9) [Reserved]
    (10) If specific items of equipment, comprising part of a process 
unit subject to this subpart, are managed by different administrative 
organizations (e.g., different companies, affiliates, departments, 
divisions, etc.), those items of equipment may be aggregated with any 
TPPU within the affected source for all purposes under subpart H of this 
part, providing there is no delay in achieving the applicable compliance 
date.
    (11) When the terms ``equipment'' and ``equipment leak'' are used in 
subpart H of this part, the definitions of these terms in Sec. 63.1312 
shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.

[[Page 349]]

    (12) The phrase ``the provisions of subparts F, I, or JJJ of this 
part'' shall apply instead of the phrase ``the provisions of subpart F 
or I of this part'' throughout Sec. Sec. 63.163 and 63.168, for the 
purposes of this subpart. In addition, the phrase ``subparts F, I, and 
JJJ'' shall apply instead of the phrase ``subparts F and I'' in Sec. 
63.174(c)(2)(iii), for the purposes of this subpart.
    (13) An owner or operator using a flare to comply with the 
requirements of this section shall conduct a compliance demonstration as 
specified in Sec. 63.1333(e).
    (b) The provisions of this section do not apply to each TPPU 
producing PET using a process other than a continuous terephthalic acid 
(TPA) high viscosity multiple end finisher process that is part of an 
affected source if all of the equipment leak components subject to this 
section Sec. 63.1331 in the TPPU are either in vacuum service or in 
heavy liquid service.
    (1) Owners and operators of a TPPU exempted under paragraph (b) of 
this section shall comply with paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (i) Retain information, data, and analyses used to demonstrate that 
all of the components in the exempted TPPU are either in vacuum service 
or in heavy liquid service. For components in vacuum service, examples 
of information that could document this include, but are not limited to, 
analyses of process stream composition and process conditions, 
engineering calculations, or process knowledge. For components in heavy 
liquid service, such documentation shall include an analysis or 
demonstration that the process fluids do not meet the criteria of ``in 
light liquid service'' or ``in gas or vapor service.''
    (ii) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that all of 
the components in the TPPU are either in vacuum service or in heavy 
liquid service.
    (2) If changes occur at a TPPU exempted under paragraph (b) of this 
section such that all of the components in the TPPU are no longer either 
in vacuum service or in heavy liquid service (e.g., by either process 
changes or the addition of new components), the owner or operator of the 
affected source shall comply with the provisions of this section for all 
of the components at the TPPU. The owner or operator shall submit a 
report within 180 days after the process change is made or the 
information regarding the process change is known to the owner or 
operator. This report may be included in the next Periodic Report, as 
specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. A description of the 
process change shall be submitted with this report.
    (c) The provisions of this section do not apply to each affected 
source producing PET using a continuous TPA high viscosity multiple end

<R05>
Sec. 63.1332  Emissions averaging provisions.

    (a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing affected 
sources who seek to comply with Sec. 63.1313(b) by using emissions 
averaging rather than following the provisions of Sec. Sec. 63.1314, 
63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, and 63.1330.
    (1) The following emission point limitations apply to the use of 
these provisions:
    (i) All emission points included in an emissions average shall be 
from the same affected source. There may be an emissions average for 
each affected source located at a plant site.
    (ii)(A) If a plant site has only one affected source for which 
emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number 
of emission points allowed in the emissions average for said affected 
source is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five 
additional emission points if pollution prevention measures are used to 
control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions 
average.
    (B) If a plant site has two or more affected sources for which 
emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number 
of emission points allowed in the emissions averages for said affected 
sources is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five 
additional emission points if pollution prevention

[[Page 350]]

measures are used to control five or more of the emission points 
included in the emissions averages.
    (2) Compliance with the provisions of this section may be based on 
either organic HAP or TOC.
    (3) For the purposes of these provisions, whenever Method 18, 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, is specified within the paragraphs of this section 
or is specified by reference through provisions outside this section, 
Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used. The 
use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall conform with the 
requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 
CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the 
largest percent by volume of the emissions.
    (ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable 
if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times 
the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas 
when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.
    (b) Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the 
owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Emissions 
Averaging Plan containing all of the information required in Sec. 
63.1335(e)(4) for all emission points to be included in an emissions 
average.
    (c) Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section describe the 
emission points that may be used to generate emissions averaging credits 
if control was applied after November 15, 1990, and if sufficient 
information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits 
for the emission point. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section discusses the 
use of pollution prevention in generating emissions averaging credits.
    (1) Storage vessels, batch process vents, aggregate batch vent 
streams, continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1315, and process 
wastewater streams that are determined to be Group 2 emission points. 
The term ``continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1315'' includes 
continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316 (b)(1)(iii), 
(b)(2)(iii), and (c)(2), which reference Sec. 63.1315.
    (2) Continuous process vents located in the collection of material 
recovery sections within the affected source at an existing affected 
source producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process 
subject to Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(i) where the uncontrolled organic HAP 
emissions from said continuous process vents are equal to or less than 
0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product. These continuous process vents 
shall be considered Group 2 emission points for the purposes of this 
section.
    (3) Storage vessels, continuous process vents subject to Sec. 
63.1315, and process wastewater streams that are determined to be Group 
1 emission points and that are controlled by a technology that the 
Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal 
efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the 
nominal efficiencies for such technologies shall be submitted and 
approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (4) Batch process vents and aggregate batch vent streams that are 
determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled to a 
level more stringent than the applicable standard.
    (5) Continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316 (b)(1)(i), 
(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1) located in the collection 
of process sections within the affected source, as specified in 
paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(ii) of this section. The continuous 
process vents identified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(ii) of 
this section shall be considered to be Group 1 emission points for the 
purposes of this section.
    (i) Continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(i) 
located in the collection of material recovery sections within the 
affected source where the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for said 
continuous process vents are greater than 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of 
product and said continuous process vents are controlled to a level more 
stringent than the applicable standard.
    (ii) Continuous process vents subject to Sec. 63.1316(b)(1)(ii), 
(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or

[[Page 351]]

(c)(1) located in the collection of process sections within the affected 
source where the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from said continuous 
process vents are controlled to a level more stringent than the 
applicable standard.
    (6) The percent reduction for any storage vessel, batch process 
vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous process vent, and process 
wastewater stream from which emissions are reduced by pollution 
prevention measures shall be determined using the procedures specified 
in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (i) For a Group 1 storage vessel, batch process vent, aggregate 
batch vent stream, continuous process vent, or process wastewater 
stream, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than 
if the applicable reference control technology or standard had been 
applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention 
measure, except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with 
other controls for a Group 1 storage vessel, batch process vent, 
aggregate batch vent stream, continuous process vent, or process 
wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have 
to reduce emissions more than the applicable reference control 
technology or standard, but the combination of the pollution prevention 
measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than if the 
applicable reference control technology or standard had been applied 
instead of the pollution prevention measure.
    (d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate 
emissions averaging credits:
    (1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 
1990, cannot be used to generate credits unless the level of control is 
increased after November 15, 1990. In this case, credit will be allowed 
only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.
    (2) Group 1 emission points, identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, that are controlled by a reference control technology cannot be 
used to generate credits unless the reference control technology has 
been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal 
efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph 
(i) of this section.
    (3) Emission points for nonoperating TPPU cannot be used to generate 
credits. TPPU that are shutdown cannot be used to generate credits or 
debits.
    (4) Maintenance wastewater cannot be used to generate credits. 
Wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units cannot be used 
to generate credits. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to 
generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms 
wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.
    (5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal 
rule other than this subpart cannot be used to generate credits, unless 
the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990, to a 
level above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only 
the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule 
will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to 
generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, 
and the emission point is subsequently made subject to a State or 
Federal rule other than this subpart, the emission point may continue to 
generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with 
the previously approved emissions average.
    (e) For all emission points included in an emissions average, the 
owner or operator shall perform the following tasks:
    (1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission 
points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference 
control technology or standard for those emission points. Said Group 1 
emission points are identified in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of 
this section. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used 
to calculate debits.
    (2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 and Group 2 
emission points that are over-controlled to compensate for the debits. 
Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate 
credits. Emission points and controls that meet

[[Page 352]]

the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the 
credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this 
section shall not be included.
    (3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to 
paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits 
calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator may choose to include more than the 
required number of credit-generating emission points in an emissions 
average in order to increase the likelihood of being in compliance.
    (ii) The initial demonstration in the Emissions Averaging Plan or 
operating permit application that credit-generating emission points will 
be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from 
the debit-generating emission points shall be made under representative 
operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual operating data 
will be used for all debit and credit calculations.
    (4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) 
period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 
times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph 
(h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined 
based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 
percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.
    (5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the 
Periodic Reports as specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(6). Every fourth 
Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the 
emissions averaging provisions as required by Sec. 
63.1335(e)(6)(x)(C)(2).
    (f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the 
methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this 
section, respectively, and shall not include emissions during the 
following periods:
    (1) Emissions during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction, 
as described in the Start-up, Shutdown, and Malfunction Plan.
    (2) Emissions during periods of monitoring excursions, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1334(d). For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits 
and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) 
through (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission 
point.
    (ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating 
emission point.
    (iii) The owner or operator may demonstrate to the Administrator 
that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned using the 
procedures in paragraph (l) of this section.
    (g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual 
emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is 
controlled to a level less stringent than the applicable reference 
control technology or standard and the emissions allowed for the Group 1 
emission point. Said Group 1 emission points are identified in 
paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this section. Debits shall be 
calculated as follows:
    (1) Source-wide debits shall be calculated using Equation 28 of this 
subpart. Debits and all terms of Equation 28 of this subpart are in 
units of megagrams per month:

before discharge to the atmosphere. Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, shall be used for selection of the sampling site.
    (ii) ECPV<INF>iu</INF> for each continuous process vent i shall be 
calculated using Equation 29 of this subpart.

using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as 
appropriate.
h=Monthly hours of operation during which positive flow is present in 
the continuous process vent, hours per month.

j as measured by Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
Mj=Molecular weight of organic HAP j, gram per gram-mole.

    (A) The values of Q and Cj shall be determined during a performance 
test conducted under representative operating conditions. The values of 
Q and Cj shall be established in the Notification of Compliance Status 
and shall be updated as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section.
    (B) If there is a change in capacity utilization other than a change 
in monthly operating hours, or if any other change is made to the 
process or product recovery equipment or operation such that the 
previously measured values of Q and Cj are no longer representative, a 
new performance test shall be conducted to determine new representative 
values of Q and Cj. These new values shall be used to calculate debits 
and credits from the time of the change forward, and the new values 
shall be reported in the next Periodic Report.
    (iii) The following procedures and equations shall be used to 
calculate ECPV<INF>iACTUAL</INF>:
    (A) If the continuous process vent is not controlled by a control 
device or pollution prevention measure, 
ECPV<INF>iACTUAL</INF>=ECPV<INF>iu</INF>, where ECPV<INF>iu</INF> is 
calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and 
(g)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (B) If the continuous process vent is controlled using a control 
device or a pollution prevention measure achieving less than 98 percent 
reduction, calculate ECPV<INF>iACTUAL</INF> using Equation 30 of this 
subpart.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12SE96.029

    (1) The percent reduction shall be measured according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.116 if a combustion control device is used. For a 
flare meeting the criteria in Sec. 63.116(a), or a boiler or process 
heater meeting the criteria in Sec. 63.116(b), the percent reduction 
shall be 98 percent. If a noncombustion control device is used, percent 
reduction shall be demonstrated by a performance test at the inlet and 
outlet of the device, or, if testing is not feasible, by a control 
design evaluation and documented engineering calculations.
    (2) For determining debits from Group 1 continuous process vents, 
product recovery devices shall not be considered control devices and 
cannot be assigned a percent reduction in calculating 
ECPV<INF>iACTUAL.</INF> The sampling site for measurement of 
uncontrolled emissions is after the final product recovery device. 
However, as provided in Sec. 63.113(a)(3), a Group 1 continuous process 
vent may add sufficient product recovery to raise the TRE index value 
above 1.0 or, for Group 1 continuous process vents at an existing 
affected source producing MBS, above 3.7, thereby becoming a Group 2 
continuous process vent. Such a continuous process vent would not be a 
Group 1 continuous process vent and would, therefore, not be included in 
determining debits under this paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B)(2).
    (3) Procedures for calculating the percent reduction of pollution 
prevention measures are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (3) Emissions from continuous process vents located in the 
collection of process sections within the affected source subject to 
Sec. 63.1316 (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1) 
shall be calculated as follows:
    (i) The total organic HAP emissions from continuous process vents 
located in the collection of process sections j within the affected 
source,

[[Page 355]]

ECPVS<INF>jACTUAL</INF>, shall be calculated as follows. The procedures 
in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section shall be used to determine the 
organic HAP emissions for each individual continuous process vent, 
except that paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(B)(2) of this section shall not apply 
and the sampling site shall be after those recovery devices installed as 
part of normal operation; before any add-on control devices (i.e., those 
required by regulation); and prior to discharge to the atmosphere. Then, 
individual continuous process vent emissions shall be summed to 
determine ECPVS<INF>jACTUAL</INF>.

15, 1990, use Equation 45 of this subpart and the procedures in 
paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(A) through (h)(7)(ii)(B) of this section. 
EABV2<INF>iu</INF> shall be calculated according to the equations and 
procedures for EABV<INF>iu</INF> in paragraphs (g)(7)(i) and (g)(7)(ii) 
of this section.

    (i) The following procedures shall be followed to establish nominal 
efficiencies for emission controls for storage vessels, continuous 
process vents, and process wastewater streams. The procedures in 
paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(6) of this section shall be followed for 
control technologies that are different in use or design from the 
reference control technologies and achieve greater percent reductions 
than the percent efficiencies assigned to the reference control 
technologies in Sec. 63.111.
    (1) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission 
to take

[[Page 363]]

credit for use of a control technology that is different in use or 
design from the reference control technology, and the different control 
technology will be used in more than three applications at a single 
plant-site, the owner or operator shall submit the information specified 
in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) of this section, as specified 
in Sec. 63.1335(e)(7)(ii), to the Director of the EPA Office of Air 
Quality Planning and Standards in writing:
    (i) Emission stream characteristics of each emission point to which 
the control technology is or will be applied including the kind of 
emission point, flow, organic HAP concentration, and all other stream 
characteristics necessary to design the control technology or determine 
its performance.
    (ii) Description of the control technology including design 
specifications.
    (iii) Documentation demonstrating to the Administrator's 
satisfaction the control efficiency of the control technology. This may 
include performance test data collected using an appropriate EPA Method 
or any other method validated according to Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, 
appendix A, of this part. If it is infeasible to obtain test data, 
documentation may include a design evaluation and calculations. The 
engineering basis of the calculation procedures and all inputs and 
assumptions made in the calculations shall be documented.
    (iv) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to 
ensure that the control technology will be operated in conformance with 
its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that 
parameter (or parameters).
    (2) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days whether an 
application presents sufficient information to determine nominal 
efficiency. The Administrator reserves the right to request specific 
data in addition to the items listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this 
section.
    (3) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days of the 
submittal of sufficient data whether a control technology shall have a 
nominal efficiency and the level of that nominal efficiency. If, in the 
Administrator's judgment, the control technology achieves a level of 
emission reduction greater than the reference control technology for a 
particular kind of emission point, the Administrator will publish a 
Federal Register notice establishing a nominal efficiency for the 
control technology.
    (4) The Administrator may grant permission to take emission credits 
for use of the control technology. The Administrator may also impose 
requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance 
to achieve the specified nominal efficiency.
    (5) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission 
to take credit for use of a control technology that is different in use 
or design from the reference control technology and the different 
control technology will be used in no more than three applications at a 
single plant site, the owner or operator shall submit the information 
listed in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) of this section, as 
specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(7)(ii), to the Administrator.
    (i) In these instances, use and conditions for use of the control 
technology may be approved by the permitting authority as part of an 
operating permit application or modification. The permitting authority 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (i)(2) through 
(i)(4) of this section except that, in these instances, a Federal 
Register notice is not required to establish the nominal efficiency for 
the different technology.
    (ii) If, in reviewing the application, the permitting authority 
believes the control technology has broad applicability for use by other 
affected sources, the permitting authority shall submit the information 
provided in the application to the Director of the EPA Office of Air 
Quality Planning and Standards. The Administrator shall review the 
technology for broad applicability and may publish a Federal Register 
notice; however, this review shall not affect the permitting authority's 
approval of the nominal efficiency of the control technology for the 
specific application.
    (6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an 
emission point, the Administrator or permitting

[[Page 364]]

authority determines the control technology is not different in use or 
design from the reference control technology, the Administrator or 
permitting authority shall deny the application.
    (j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the 
efficiency (percent reduction) of pollution prevention measures for 
storage vessels, continuous process vents, batch process vents, 
aggregate batch vent streams, and wastewater streams:
    (1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that meets the 
criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a 
lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to 
the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control 
of emissions, while the same product is produced.
    (ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: substitution of 
feedstocks that reduce organic HAP emissions; alterations to the 
production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the 
environment; equipment modifications; housekeeping measures; and in-
process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as 
raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution 
prevention.
    (2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention 
measures implemented after November 15, 1990, may be used in calculating 
the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit 
equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
    (i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction used in 
the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(7) of this section and 
paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(7) of this section is the percent 
difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission 
point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month 
versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the 
pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced 
during the two monthly periods.
    (ii) Equation 46 of this subpart shall be used to calculate the 
percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission 
point.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12SE96.045

Where:

Percent reduction=Efficiency of pollution prevention measure (percent 
organic HAP reduction).
E<INF>B</INF>=Monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, 
megagrams per month, determined as specified in paragraphs 
(j)(2)(ii)(A), (j)(2)(ii)(B), and (j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
E<INF>pp</INF>=Monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, 
megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month, determined 
as specified in either paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) or (j)(2)(ii)(E) of this 
section.
P<INF>B</INF>=Monthly production before the pollution prevention 
measure, megagrams per month, during the same period over which 
E<INF>B</INF> is calculated.
P<INF>pp</INF>=Monthly production after the pollution prevention 
measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month.

    (A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, 
E<INF>B</INF>, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the 
equations and procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section 
for continuous process vents, paragraph (g)(4) of this section for 
storage vessels, paragraph (g)(6) of this section for batch process 
vents, and paragraph (g)(7) of this section for aggregate batch vent 
streams.
    (B) For wastewater, E<INF>B</INF> shall be calculated using Equation 
47 of this subpart:

[[Page 365]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09MR99.011

Where:

n = Number of wastewater streams.
Q<INF>Bi</INF> = Annual average flow rate for wastewater stream i before 
the pollution prevention measure, defined and determined according to 
Sec. 63.144(c)(3), liters per minute, before implementation of the 
pollution prevention measure.
H<INF>Bi</INF> = Number of hours per month that wastewater stream i was 
discharged before the pollution prevention measure, hours per month.
s = Total number of organic HAP in wastewater stream i.
F<INF>em</INF> = Fraction emitted of organic HAP m in wastewater from 
Table 34 of subpart G of this part, dimensionless.
HAP<INF>Bim</INF> = Annual average concentration of organic HAP m in 
wastewater stream i, defined and determined according to paragraph Sec. 
63.150(g)(5)(i) of this section, before the pollution prevention 
measure, parts per million by weight, as measured before the 
implementation of the pollution measure.

    (C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to 
September 12, 1996 records may be used to determine E<INF>B</INF>.
    (D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, 
E<INF>pp</INF>, may be determined during a performance test or by a 
design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an 
emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio can be 
used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.
    (E) For wastewater, E<INF>pp</INF> shall be calculated using 
Equation 48 of this subpart and n, Q<INF>ppi</INF>, H<INF>ppi</INF>, s, 
Fe<INF>m</INF>, and HAP<INF>ppim</INF> are defined and determined as 
described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, except that 
Q<INF>ppi</INF>, H<INF>ppi</INF>, and HAP<INF>ppim</INF> shall be 
determined after the pollution prevention measure has been implemented.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12SE96.047

    (iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, 
and other information used to determine the percent reduction achieved 
by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully 
documented.
    (iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from 
multiple emission points. In such cases, the percent reduction in 
emissions for each emission point shall be calculated.
    (v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through 
(h)(7) of this section used to calculate credits for emission points 
controlled more stringently than the reference control technology or 
standard, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is 
equivalent to the percent reduction of the pollution prevention measure. 
When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of an 
affected source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a 
nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
    (k) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the emissions from 
the emission points proposed to be included in the emissions average 
will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the 
Administrator, greater risk to human health or the environment than if 
the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in 
Sec. Sec. 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, and 
63.1330.
    (1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made 
to the satisfaction of the Administrator.

[[Page 366]]

    (i) The Administrator may require owners and operators to use 
specific methodologies and procedures for making a hazard or risk 
determination.
    (ii) The demonstration and approval of hazard or risk equivalency 
shall be made according to any guidance that the Administrator makes 
available for use.
    (2) Owners and operators shall provide documentation demonstrating 
the hazard or risk equivalency of their proposed emissions average in 
their operating permit application or in their Emissions Averaging Plan 
if an operating permit application has not yet been submitted.
    (3) An Emissions Averaging Plan that does not demonstrate hazard or 
risk equivalency to the satisfaction of the Administrator shall not be 
approved. The Administrator may require such adjustments to the 
Emissions Averaging Plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the 
emissions average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human 
health or the environment than would result if the emission points were 
controlled according to Sec. Sec. 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 
63.1320, 63.1321, and 63.1330.
    (4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration shall:
    (i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;
    (ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human 
health or the environment; and
    (iii) Meet any requirements set by the Administrator for such 
demonstrations.
    (l) For periods of parameter monitoring excursions, an owner or 
operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through 
(l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in 
paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of 
monitoring excursions in the Periodic Reports as required in Sec. 
63.1335(e)(6).
    (2) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that other types of 
monitoring data or engineering calculations are appropriate to establish 
that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a 
fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits. This 
demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the 
Administrator may establish procedures of demonstrating compliance that 
are acceptable.
    (3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the 
excursion and the other type of monitoring data or engineering 
calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the 
emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full 
or partial credits and debits.
    (4) The Administrator may assign full or partial credit and debits 
upon review of the information provided.
    (m) For each emission point included in an emissions average, the 
owner or operator shall perform testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting equivalent to that required for Group 1 emission points 
complying with Sec. Sec. 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 
63.1321, and 63.1330, as applicable. The specific requirements for

the references in Sec. 63.7(g) to the Notification of Compliance Status 
requirements in Sec. 63.9(h).
    (3) Because the site-specific test plans in Sec. 63.7(c)(3) are not 
required, Sec. 63.7(h)(4)(ii) is not applicable.
    (4) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the 
intention to conduct a performance test at least 30 days before the 
performance test is scheduled to allow the Administrator the opportunity 
to have an observer present during the test. If after 30 days notice for 
an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to 
operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance 
test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the 
Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test 
date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the 
rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled 
date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.
    (5) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days 
after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for

parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable 
provisions of subpart A, F, G, or H of this part.
    (b) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based exclusively 
on performance tests. In cases where a performance test is required by 
this subpart, or the owner or operator of the affected source elects to 
do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 
and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring 
level for a control, recovery, or recapture device based exclusively on 
parameter values measured during the performance test, the owner or 
operator of the affected source shall comply with the procedures in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, as applicable.
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Continuous process vents. During initial compliance testing, the 
appropriate parameter shall be continuously monitored during the 
required 1-hour runs. The monitoring level(s) shall then be established 
as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from the three 
test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be used when 
establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum values 
shall be used when establishing a minimum level.
    (3) Batch process vents. The monitoring level(s) shall be 
established using the procedures specified in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) 
or (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The procedures specified in this 
paragraph (b)(3) may only be used if the batch emission episodes, or 
portions thereof, selected to be controlled were tested, and monitoring 
data were collected, during the entire period in which emissions were 
vented to the control device, as specified in Sec. 63.1325(c)(1)(i). If 
the owner or operator chose to test only a portion of the batch emission 
episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled, the procedures 
in paragraph (c) of this section shall be used.
    (i) If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion 
of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single 
level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:
    (A) The average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for 
each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, in the batch cycle 
selected to be controlled. The average shall be based on all values 
measured during the required performance test.
    (B) If the level to be established is a maximum operating parameter, 
the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average parameter 
values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch 
cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or 
portion thereof, which requires the lowest parameter value in order to 
assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to 
assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall 
be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the 
batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).
    (C) If the level to be established is a minimum operating parameter, 
the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average parameter 
values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch 
cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or 
portion thereof, which requires the highest parameter value in order to 
assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to 
assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall 
be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the 
batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).

[[Page 371]]

    (D) Alternatively, an average monitored parameter value shall be 
calculated for the entire batch cycle based on all values measured 
during each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be 
controlled.
    (ii) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch cycle, as 
described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator 
may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, or 
portion thereof, selected to be controlled. Each level shall be 
determined as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
    (iii) The batch cycle shall be defined in the Notification of 
Compliance Status, as specified in Sec. 63.1335(e)(5). Said definition 
shall include an identification of each batch emission episode and the 
information required to determine parameter monitoring compliance for 
partial batch cycles (i.e., when part of a batch cycle is accomplished 
during two different operating days).
    (4) Aggregate batch vent streams. For aggregate batch vent streams, 
the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or 
manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a performance test is 
required by this subpart, or the owner or operator elects to do a 
performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and 
an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level 
for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (c), 
the owner or operator shall supplement the parameter values measured 
during the performance test with engineering assessments and/or 
manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to 
be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values.
    (d) Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where a 
performance test is not required by this subpart and an owner or 
operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, 
recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (d), the 
determination of the parameter monitoring level shall be based 
exclusively on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's 
recommendations.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Parameter monitoring excursion definitions. (1) With respect to 
storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring plan specifies 
continuous monitoring), continuous process vents, aggregate batch vent 
streams, and process wastewater streams, an excursion means any of the 
three cases listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this 
section. For a control or recovery device where multiple parameters are 
monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria 
in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this section, this is 
considered a single excursion for the control or recovery device. For 
each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance 
with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) 
of this section.
    (i) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters 
is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for 
the given parameters.
    (ii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with 
the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is 4 hours 
or greater in an operating day, and monitoring data are insufficient, as 
defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, to constitute a valid 
hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.
    (iii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with 
the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is less than 
4 hours in an operating day and more than two of the hours during the 
period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of data due to 
insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this 
section.
    (iv) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section, 
if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods 
within the hour. For data compression systems approved under Sec. 
63.1335(g)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid

[[Page 372]]

hour of data if there are less than four data measurements made during 
the hour.
    (v) The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(v)(A) through 
(f)(1)(v)(E) of this section are not considered to be part of the period 
of control or recovery device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs 
(f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (A) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (B) Start-ups;
    (C) Shutdowns;
    (D) Malfunctions; or
    (E) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (2) With respect to batch process vents, an excursion means one of 
the two cases listed in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section. For a control device where multiple parameters are monitored, 
if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in either 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section, this is considered a 
single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner 
or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of 
this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (i) When the batch cycle daily average value of one or more 
monitored parameters is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established level for the given parameters.
    (ii) When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. 
Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values 
are not available for at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when 
batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to 
the control device during the operating day, using the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(A) through (f)(2)(ii)(D) of this 
section.
    (A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when 
batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to 
the control device.
    (B) Subtract the time during the periods listed in paragraphs 
(f)(2)(ii)(B)(1) through (f)(2)(ii)(B)(4) of this section from the total 
amount of time determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, to 
obtain the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are 
insufficient.
    (1) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (2) Start-ups;
    (3) Shutdowns; or
    (4) Malfunctions.
    (C) Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating 
time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was 
determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (D) If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of 
the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for 
the operating day.
    (3) For storage vessels where the applicable monitoring plan does 
not specify continuous monitoring, an excursion is defined in paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. For a control or 
recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more 
of the parameters meets the excursion criteria, this is considered a 
single excursion for the control or recovery device. For each excursion, 
the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the 
provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (i) If the monitoring plan specifies monitoring a parameter and 
recording its value at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes or 
every hour), either of the cases listed in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) or 
(f)(3)(i)(B) of this section is considered a single excursion for the 
control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be 
deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (A) When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over 
the duration of the filling period for the storage vessel, is above the 
maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given 
parameters.

[[Page 373]]

    (B) When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be 
considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at 
least 75 percent of the specific intervals at which parameters are to be 
monitored and recorded, according to the storage vessel's monitoring 
plan, during the filling period for the storage vessel.
    (ii) If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter 
and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the 
relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon 
canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring 
plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating 
requirement.
    (4) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass 
emissions per mass product requirements specified in Sec. 
63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1)(i), an 
excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate calculated as 
specified in Sec. 63.1318(c) exceeds the appropriate mass emissions per 
mass product requirement. For each excursion, the owner or operator 
shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, 
except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (5) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the 
temperature limits for final condensers specified in Sec. 
63.1316(b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(ii), an excursion has occurred when the 
daily average exit temperature exceeds the appropriate condenser 
temperature limit. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be 
deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as 
provided in paragraph (g) of this section. The periods listed in 
paragraphs (f)(5)(i) through (f)(5)(v) of this section are not 
considered to be part of the period of operation for the condenser for 
purposes of determining the daily average exit temperature.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (6) With respect to new affected sources producing SAN using a batch 
process, an excursion has occurred when the percent reduction calculated 
using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1333(c) is less than 84 
percent. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out 
of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section. The periods listed in paragraphs 
(f)(6)(i) through (f)(6)(v) of this section are not considered to be 
part of the period of control or recovery device operation for purposes 
of determining the percent reduction.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (7) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass 
emissions per mass product requirement specified in Sec. 63.1315(b)(2), 
an excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate calculated as 
specified in Sec. 63.1333(b) exceeds the mass emissions per mass 
product requirement specified in Sec. 63.1315(b)(2). For each 
excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with 
the provisions of this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (g) Excused excursions. A number of excused excursions shall be 
allowed for each control or recovery device for each semiannual period. 
The number of excused excursions for each semiannual period is specified 
in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(6) of this section. This paragraph (g) 
applies to affected sources required to submit Periodic Reports 
semiannually or quarterly. The first semiannual period is the 6-month 
period starting the date the Notification of Compliance Status is due.
    (1) For the first semiannual period--six excused excursions.
    (2) For the second semiannual period--five excused excursions.

[[Page 374]]

    (3) For the third semiannual period--four excused excursions.
    (4) For the fourth semiannual period--three excused excursions.
    (5) For the fifth semiannual period--two excused excursions.
    (6) For the sixth and all subsequent semiannual periods--one excused 
excursion.

<R05>
Sec. 63.1335  General recordkeeping and reporting provisions.

    (a) Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the 
owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all 
applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 
years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the 
exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that 
they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall 
be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained 
offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable 
form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, 
floppy disk, magnetic tape, or microfiche.
    (2) If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required 
to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the 
requirement of Sec. 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, 
the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those 
reports.
    (b) Requirements of subpart A of this part. The owner or operator of 
an affected source shall comply with the applicable recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements in subpart A of this part as specified in Table 1 
of this subpart. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) Start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan. The owner or operator 
of an affected source shall develop a written startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan as specified in Sec. 63.6(e)(3). This plan shall 
describe, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the 
affected source during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction 
and a program for corrective action for malfunctioning process and air 
pollution control equipment used to comply with this subpart. Inclusion 
of Group 2 emission points is not required, unless these points are 
included in an emissions average. For equipment leaks (subject to Sec. 
63.1331), the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan requirement is 
limited to control devices and is optional for other equipment. For 
equipment leaks, the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan may 
include written procedures that identify conditions that justify a delay 
of repair. A provision for ceasing to collect, during a start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would otherwise be 
required by the provisions of this subpart may be included in the start-
up, shutdown, and malfunction plan only if the owner or operator has 
demonstrated to the Administrator, through the Precompliance Report or a 
supplement to the Precompliance Report, that the monitoring system would 
be damaged or destroyed if it were not shut down during the start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction. The affected source shall keep the start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan on-site. Records associated with the plan 
shall be kept as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through 
(b)(1)(i)(C) of this section. Reports related to the plan shall be 
submitted as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) Records of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. The owner or 
operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) 
through (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section.
    (A) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or control 
devices or recovery devices or continuous monitoring systems used to 
comply with this subpart during which excess emissions (as defined in 
Sec. 63.1310(j)(4)) occur.

[[Page 375]]

    (B) For each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during which excess 
emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1310(j)(4)) occur, records reflecting 
whether the procedures specified in the affected source's start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of 
actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing 
a control device to a backup control device, records shall be kept of 
whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a 
``checklist,'' or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance 
with the start-up shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
    (C) Records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through 
(b)(1)(i)(B) of this section are not required if they pertain solely to 
Group 2 emission points that are not included in an emissions average.
    (ii) Reports of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. For the 
purposes of this subpart, the semiannual start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction reports shall be submitted on the same schedule as the 
Periodic Reports required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section instead 
of being submitted on the schedule specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(i). 
The reports shall include the information specified in Sec. 
63.10(d)(5)(i).
    (2) Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. For 
new affected sources, each owner or operator shall comply with the 
provisions in Sec. 63.5 regarding construction and reconstruction, 
excluding the provisions specified in Sec. 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H), 
(d)(1)(iii), (d)(2), and (d)(3)(ii).
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Recordkeeping and documentation. Owners or operators required to 
keep continuous records shall keep records as specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (d)(7) of this section, unless an alternative 
recordkeeping system has been requested and approved as specified in 
paragraph (g) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h) 
of this section. If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to 
Sec. 63.1314(a)(9) requires continuous records, the monitoring plan 
shall specify which provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through 
(d)(7) of this section apply. As described in Sec. 63.1314(a)(9), 
certain storage vessels are not required to keep continuous records as 
specified in this paragraph. Owners and operators of such storage 
vessels shall keep records as specified in the monitoring plan required 
by Sec. 63.1314(a)(9). Paragraphs (d)(8) and (d)(9) of this section 
specify documentation requirements.
    (1) The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once 
every 15 minutes.
    (2) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data 
value or block average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated 
from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured 
more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may 
be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average 
instead of all measured values. Owners or operators of batch process 
vents shall record each measured data value.
    (3) Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values of each 
continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for each operating 
day as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this 
section.
    (i) The daily average value or batch cycle daily average shall be 
calculated as the average of all parameter values recorded during the 
operating day, except as specified in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. 
For batch process vents, as specified in Sec. 63.1326(e)(2)(i), only 
parameter values measured during those batch emission episodes, or 
portions thereof, in the batch cycle that the owner or operator has 
chosen to control shall be used to calculate the average. The calculated 
average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the 
number of hours of operation per operating day if operation is not 
continuous.
    (ii) The operating day shall be the period the owner or operator 
specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance 
Status for purposes of determining daily average values or batch cycle 
daily average values of monitored parameters.

[[Page 376]]

    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) Records required when all recorded values are within the 
established limits. If all recorded values for a monitored parameter 
during an operating day are above the minimum level or below the maximum 
level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating 
permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the 
minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and 
recording a daily average (or batch cycle daily average) for that 
operating day.
    (7) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs 
(d)(7)(i) through (d)(7)(v) of this section shall not be included in any 
average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times 
and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process 
or control device or recovery device operation when monitors are not 
operating.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions;
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (8) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this 
subpart, records documenting the completion of calibration checks, and 
records documenting the maintenance of continuous monitoring systems 
that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or that are 
specified in other written procedures that provide adequate assurance 
that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
    (9) The owner or operator of an affected source granted a waiver 
under Sec. 63.10(f) shall maintain the information, if any, specified 
by the Administrator as a condition of the waiver of recordkeeping or 
reporting requirements.
    (e) Reporting and notification. In addition to the reports and 
notifications required by subpart A of this part as specified in Table 1 
of this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall 
prepare and submit the reports listed in paragraphs (e)(3) through 
(e)(8) of this section, as applicable. All reports required by this 
subpart, and the schedule for their submittal, are listed in Table 9 of 
this subpart.
    (1) Owners and operators shall not be in violation of the reporting 
requirements of this subpart for failing to submit information required 
to be included in a specified report if the owner or operator meets the 
requirements in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iii) of this 
section. Examples of circumstances where this paragraph may apply 
include information related to newly-added equipment or emission points, 
changes in the process, changes in equipment required or utilized for 
compliance with the requirements of this subpart, or changes in methods 
or equipment for monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting.
    (i) The information was not known in time for inclusion in the 
report specified by this subpart;
    (ii) The owner or operator has been diligent in obtaining the 
information; and
    (iii) The owner or operator submits a report according to the 
provisions of paragraphs (e)(1)(iii)(A) through (e)(1)(iii)(C) of this 
section.
    (A) If this subpart expressly provides for supplements to the report 
in which the information is required, the owner or operator shall submit 
the information as a supplement to that report. The information shall be 
submitted no later than 60 days after it is obtained, unless otherwise 
specified in this subpart.
    (B) If this subpart does not expressly provide for supplements, but 
the owner or operator must submit a request for revision of an operating 
permit pursuant to part 70 or part 71, due to circumstances to which the 
information pertains, the owner or operator shall submit the information 
with the request for revision to the operating permit.
    (C) In any case not addressed by paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) or 
(e)(1)(iii)(B) of this paragraph, the owner or operator shall submit the 
information with the first Periodic Report, as required

[[Page 377]]

by this subpart, which has a submission deadline at least 60 days after 
the information is obtained.
    (2) All reports required under this subpart shall be sent to the 
Administrator at the appropriate address listed in Sec. 63.13. If 
acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of an 
affected source, reports may be submitted on electronic media.
    (3) Precompliance Report. Owners or operators of affected sources 
requesting an extension for compliance; requesting approval to use 
alternative monitoring parameters, alternative continuous monitoring and 
recordkeeping, or alternative controls; requesting approval to use 
engineering assessment to estimate emissions from a batch emissions 
episode, as described in Sec. 63.1323(b)(6)(i)(C); wishing to establish 
parameter monitoring levels according to the procedures contained in 
Sec. 63.1334(c) or (d); or requesting approval to incorporate a 
provision for ceasing to collect monitoring data, during a start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction, into the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan, when that monitoring equipment would be damaged if it did not 
cease to collect monitoring data, as permitted under Sec. 
63.1310(j)(3), shall submit a Precompliance Report according to the 
schedule described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. The 
Precompliance Report shall contain the information specified in 
paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) through (e)(3)(viii) of this section, as

[[Page 388]]

paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.
    (1) The required information shall include a description of the 
parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the recovery device, control 
device, or pollution prevention measure is operated in conformance with 
its design and achieves the specified emission limit, percent reduction, 
or nominal efficiency, and an explanation of the criteria used to select 
the parameter(s).
    (2) The required information shall include a description of the 
methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the 
parameter indicates proper operation, the schedule for this 
demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will establish 
a level for the monitored parameter as part of the Notification of

unless this information has already been included in the operating 
permit application.
    (3) The required information shall include a description of the 
proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system, to include the 
frequency and content of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. 
Further, the rationale for the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting system shall be included if either condition in paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) or (f)(3)(ii) of this section is met:
    (i) If monitoring and recordkeeping is not continuous; or
    (ii) If reports of daily average values will not be included in 
Periodic Reports when the monitored parameter value is above the maximum 
level or below the minimum level as established in the operating permit 
or the Notification of Compliance Status.
    (g) Alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping. An owner or 
operator choosing not to implement the provisions listed in Sec. 
63.1315 or Sec. 63.1317, as appropriate, for continuous process vents, 
Sec. 63.1321 for batch process vents and aggregate batch vent streams, 
or Sec. 63.1330 for process wastewater, may instead request approval to 
use alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions 
according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through 
(g)(4) of this section. Requests shall be submitted in the Precompliance 
Report as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, if not 
already included in the operating permit application, and shall contain 
the information specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) and (g)(3)(ii) of 
this section, as applicable.
    (1) The provisions in Sec. 63.8(f)(5)(i) shall govern the review 
and approval of requests.
    (2) An owner or operator of an affected source that does not have an 
automated monitoring and recording system capable of measuring parameter 
values at least once every 15 minutes and that does not generate 
continuous records may request approval to use a nonautomated system 
with less frequent monitoring, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(i) 
and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The requested system shall include manual reading and recording 
of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than 
once per hour. Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values shall 
be calculated from these hourly values and recorded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the planned monitoring and recordkeeping 
system;
    (B) Documentation that the affected source does not have an 
automated monitoring and recording system;
    (C) Justification for requesting an alternative monitoring and 
recordkeeping system; and
    (D) Demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction that the 
proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control or 
recovery device operating conditions, considering typical variability of 
the specific process and control or recovery device operating parameter 
being monitored.
    (3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated 
data compression recording system that does not record monitored 
operating parameter values at a set frequency, but records all values 
that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values, in 
accordance with paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (i) The requested system shall be designed to:

[[Page 389]]

    (A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once during every 
15 minute period;
    (B) Except for the monitoring of batch process vents, calculate 
hourly average values each hour during periods of operation;
    (C) Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;
    (D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not 
functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;
    (E) Calculate daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values of 
the monitored operating parameter based on all measured data; and
    (F) If the daily average is not an excursion, as defined in Sec. 
63.1334(f), the data for that operating day may be converted to hourly 
average values and the four or more individual records for each hour in 
the operating day may be discarded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression 
recording system, including the criteria used to determine which 
monitored values are recorded and retained;
    (B) The method for calculating daily averages and batch cycle daily 
averages; and
    (C) A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other 
alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f)(4).
    (h) Reduced recordkeeping program. For any parameter with respect to 
any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the 
recordkeeping requirements specified in paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of 
this section as alternatives to the continuous operating parameter 
monitoring and recordkeeping provisions that would otherwise apply under 
this subpart. The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years 
each record required by paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, 
except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average (or 
batch cycle daily average) value, and is not required to retain more 
frequent monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter 
with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(vi) of this section are met. An owner or 
operator electing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of 
Compliance Status as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(xi) of this section 
or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, 
in the Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section as specified in 
paragraph (e)(6)(ix) of this section.
    (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or 
impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, 
shutdowns, or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of -200 [deg]C 
on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The 
owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the 
alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
    (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly 
throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring 
values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the 
capability to observe this running average is readily available to the 
Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator 
shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (h)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. All 
instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
    (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established limits;
    (B) The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average 
values; and
    (C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data 
during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns, or 
malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging 
data is the expected operating condition based on

[[Page 390]]

past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the 
operator by alarm or other means. The owner or operator shall record the 
occurrence. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating 
day constitute a single occurrence.
    (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an 
alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated 
under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is 
appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is 
being monitored.
    (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the 
monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, at the times specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (h)(1)(v)(C). The owner or operator 
shall document that the required verifications occurred.
    (A) Upon initial installation.
    (B) Annually after initial installation.
    (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting 
the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the 
monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, 
for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how 
compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(v) of this section. The description shall 
identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) 
for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or 
operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded 
description, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring 
system that would reasonably be expected to impair its ability to comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as 
long as the description is current. The current description shall, at 
all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location 
by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions 
for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded 
descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central 
location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours 
after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, 
superseded descriptions may be stored off-site.
    (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a monitored 
parameter with respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 
consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in 
paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer 
required to record the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) 
value for any operating day when the daily average (or batch cycle daily 
average) value is less than the maximum or greater than the minimum 
established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data 
generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited 
toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and 
the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance 
date was required and/or approved by the Administrator.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average 
(or batch cycle daily average) values, the owner or operator shall 
notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as specified in 
paragraph (e)(6)(x) of this section. The notification shall identify the 
parameter and unit of equipment.
    (ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased 
recording daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values as 
provided in paragraph

[[Page 391]]

(h)(2) of this section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph 
(h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately 
resume retaining the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value 
for each operating day and shall notify the Administrator in the next 
Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each 
daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value until another period 
of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in 
paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(iii) of this section, for the

regulated parameter specified in Sec. 63.1350 of this subpart without 
interruption, evaluates the detector response at least once every 15 
seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 
seconds, except during

[[Page 402]]

allowable periods of calibration and except as defined otherwise by the 
continuous emission monitoring system performance specifications in 
appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.

    In-line kiln/raw mill means a system in a portland cement production 
process where a dry kiln system is integrated with the raw mill so that 
all or a portion of the kiln exhaust gases are used to perform the 
drying operation of the raw mill, with no auxiliary heat source used. In 
this system the kiln is capable of operating without the raw mill 
operating, but the raw mill cannot operate without the kiln gases, and 
consequently, the raw mill does not generate a separate exhaust gas

used to grind feed to the appropriate size. Moisture may be added or 
removed from the feed during the grinding operation. If the raw mill is 
used to remove moisture from feed materials, it is also, by definition, 
a raw material dryer. The raw mill also includes the air separator 
associated with the raw mill.

[[Page 403]]

    Rolling average means the average of all one-minute averages over 
the averaging period.
    Run average means the average of the one-minute parameter values for

Sec. 63.1343  Standards for kilns and in-line kiln/raw mills.

    (a) General. The provisions in this section apply to each kiln, each 
in-line kiln/raw mill, and any alkali bypass associated with that kiln 
or in-line kiln/raw mill. All gaseous, mercury and D/F emission limits 
are on a dry basis, corrected to 7 percent oxygen. All total hydrocarbon 
(THC) emission limits are measured as propane. The block averaging 
periods to demonstrate compliance are hourly for 20 ppmv total 
hydrocarbon (THC) limits and monthly for the 50 ppmv THC limit.
    (b) Existing kilns located at major sources. No owner or operator of 
an existing kiln or an existing kiln/raw mill located at a facility that 
is a major source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause 
to be discharged into the atmosphere from these affected sources, any 
gases which:
    (1) Contain particulate matter (PM) in excess of 0.15 kg per Mg 
(0.30 lb per ton) of feed (dry basis) to the kiln. When there is an 
alkali bypass associated with a kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill, the 
combined particulate matter emissions from the kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill and the alkali bypass are subject to this emission limit.
    (2) Exhibit opacity greater than 20 percent.
    (3) Contain D/F in excess of:

exhaust of

[[Page 404]]

the in-line kiln/raw mill, or the alkali bypass in excess of 41[mu]g/
dscm if the source is a new or reconstructed source that commenced 
construction after December 2, 2005. As an alternative to meeting the 41 
[mu]g/dscm standard you may route the emissions through a packed bed or 
spray tower wet scrubber with a liquid-to-gas (l/g) ratio of 30 gallons 
per 1000 actual cubic feet per minute (acfm) or more and meet a site-
specific emissions limit based on the measured performance of the wet 
scrubber.
    (d) Existing kilns located at area sources. No owner or operator of 
an existing kiln or an existing in-line kiln/raw mill located at a 
facility that is an area source subject to the provisions of this 
subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from these 
affected sources any gases which:
    (1) Contain D/F in excess of 0.20 ng per dscm (8.7 x 
10<SUP>-11</SUP> gr per dscf) (TEQ); or

applicable temperature limit for the main in-line kiln/raw mill exhaust, 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section and established during the 
performance test when the raw mill was operating is not exceeded.
    (2) When the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is not operating, 
the applicable temperature limit for the main in-line kiln/raw mill 
exhaust, specified in paragraph (b) of this section and established 
during the performance test when the raw mill was not operating, is not 
exceeded.
    (3) If the in-line kiln/raw mill is equipped with an alkali bypass, 
the applicable temperature limit for the alkali bypass specified in 
paragraph (b)

[[Page 405]]

of this section and established during the performance test, with or 
without the raw mill operating, is not exceeded.
    (b) The temperature limit for affected sources meeting the limits of 
paragraph (a) of this section or paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of 
this section is determined in accordance with Sec. 63.1349(b)(3)(iv).

mercury, THC or D/F emission limitation under Sec. 63.1343 that employs 
carbon injection as an emission control technique must operate the 
carbon injection system in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) 
of this section.
    (1) The three-hour rolling average activated carbon injection rate 
shall be equal to or greater than the activated carbon injection rate 
determined in accordance with Sec. 63.1349(b)(3)(vi).
    (2) The owner or operator shall either:
    (i) Maintain the minimum activated carbon injection carrier gas flow 
rate, as a three-hour rolling average, based on the manufacturer's 
specifications. These specifications must be documented in the test plan 
developed in accordance with Sec. 63.7(c), or
    (ii) Maintain the minimum activated carbon injection carrier gas 
pressure drop, as a three-hour rolling average, based on the 
manufacturer's specifications. These specifications must be documented 
in the test plan developed in accordance with Sec. 63.7(c).
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the owner 
or operator of an affected source subject to a mercury, THC or D/F 
emission limitation under Sec. 63.1343 that employs carbon injection as 
an emission control technique must specify and use the brand and type of 
activated carbon used during the performance test until a subsequent 
performance test is conducted, unless the site-specific performance test 
plan contains documentation of key parameters that affect adsorption and 
the owner or operator establishes limits based on those parameters, and 
the limits on these parameters are maintained.
    (e) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to a D/F, 
THC, or mercury emission limitation under Sec. 63.1343 that employs 
carbon injection as an emission control technique may substitute, at any 
time, a different brand or type of activated carbon provided that the 
replacement has equivalent or improved properties compared to the 
activated carbon specified in the site-specific performance test plan 
and used in the performance test. The owner or operator must maintain 
documentation that the substitute activated carbon will provide the same 
or better level of control as the original activated carbon.
    (f) Existing kilns and in-line kilns/raw mills must implement good 
combustion practices (GCP) designed to minimize THC from fuel 
combustion. GCP include training all operators and supervisors to 
operate and maintain the kiln and calciner, and the pollution control 
systems in accordance with good engineering practices. The training 
shall include methods for minimizing excess emissions.
    (g) No kiln and in-line kiln/raw mill may use as a raw material or 
fuel any fly ash where the mercury content of the fly ash has been 
increased through the use of activated carbon, or any other sorbent 
unless the facility can demonstrate that the use of that fly ash will 
not result in an increase in mercury emissions over baseline emissions 
(i.e. emissions not using the fly ash). The facility has the burden of 
proving there has been no emissions increase over baseline.
    (h) All kilns and in-line kilns/raw mills must remove (i.e. not 
recycle to the kiln) from the kiln system sufficient cement kiln dust to 
maintain the desired product quality.
    (i) New and reconstructed kilns and in-line kilns/raw mills must not 
exceed the average hourly CKD recycle rate measured during mercury 
performance testing. Any exceedance of this average hourly rate is 
considered a violation of the standard.

the PM collected in the impingers (``back half'') of the Method 5 
particulate sampling train is not required to demonstrate initial 
compliance with the PM standards of this subpart. However, this shall 
not preclude the permitting authority from requiring a determination of 
the ``back half'' for other purposes.
    (ii) Suitable methods shall be used to determine the kiln or inline 
kiln/raw mill feed rate, except for fuels, for each run.
    (iii) The emission rate, E, of PM shall be computed for each run 
using equation 1:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.001

Where:

E = emission rate of particulate matter, kg/Mg of kiln feed.
c<INF>s</INF> = concentration of PM, kg/dscm.
Q<INF>sd</INF> = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr.
P = total kiln feed (dry basis), Mg/hr.

    (iv) When there is an alkali bypass associated with a kiln or in-
line kiln/raw mill, the main exhaust and alkali bypass of the kiln or 
in-line kiln/raw mill shall be tested simultaneously and the combined 
emission rate of particulate matter from the kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill and alkali bypass shall be computed for each run using equation 2,
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.002

Where:

E<INF>c</INF> = the combined emission rate of particulate matter from 
the kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill and bypass stack, kg/Mg of kiln feed.
c<INF>sk</INF> = concentration of particulate matter in the kiln or in-
line kiln/raw mill effluent, kg/dscm.
    Q<INF>sdk</INF> = volumetric flow rate of kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill effluent, dscm/hr.
c<INF>sb</INF> = concentration of particulate matter in the alkali 
bypass gas, kg/dscm.
Q<INF>sdb</INF> = volumetric flow rate of alkali bypass gas, dscm/hr.
P=total kiln feed (dry basis), Mg/hr.

    (v) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section the 
opacity exhibited during the period of the Method 5 performance tests 
required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined 
through the use of a continuous opacity monitor (COM). The maximum six-
minute average opacity during the three Method 5 test runs shall be 
determined during each Method 5 test run, and used to demonstrate 
initial compliance with the applicable opacity limits of Sec. 
63.1343(b)(2), Sec. 63.1343(c)(2), or Sec. 63.1345(a)(2).
    (vi) Each owner or operator of a kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill, or 
clinker cooler

subject to the provisions of this subpart using a fabric filter with 
multiple stacks or an electrostatic precipitator with multiple stacks 
may, in lieu of installing the continuous opacity monitoring system 
required by paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, conduct an opacity test 
in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter 
during each Method 5 performance test required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section. If the control device exhausts through a monovent, or if 
the use of a COM in accordance with the installation specifications of 
Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) of appendix B to part 60 of this 
chapter is not feasible, a test shall be conducted in accordance with 
Method 9 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter during each Method 5 
performance test required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The 
maximum six-minute average opacity shall be determined during the three 
Method 5 test runs, and used to demonstrate initial compliance with the 
applicable opacity limits of Sec. 63.1343(b)(2), Sec. 63.1343(c)(2), 
or Sec. 63.1345(a)(2).
    (2) The owner or operator of any affected source subject to 
limitations on opacity under this subpart that is not subject to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall demonstrate initial compliance 
with the affected source opacity limit by conducting a test in 
accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. The 
performance test shall be conducted under the conditions that exist when 
the affected source is operating at the representative performance 
conditions in accordance with Sec. 63.7(e). The maximum 6-minute 
average opacity exhibited during the test period shall be used to 
determine whether the affected source is in initial compliance with the 
standard. The duration of the Method 9 performance test shall be 3 hours 
(30 6-minute averages), except that the duration of the Method 9 
performance test may be reduced to 1 hour if the conditions of 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section apply:
    (i) There are no individual readings greater than 10 percent 
opacity;
    (ii) There are no more than three readings of 10 percent for the 
first 1-hour period.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to 
limitations on D/F emissions under this subpart shall demonstrate 
initial compliance with the D/F emission limit by conducting a 
performance test using Method 23 of appendix A to part 60 of this 
chapter. The owner or operator of an in-line kiln/raw mill shall 
demonstrate initial compliance by conducting separate performance tests 
while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is under normal 
operating conditions and while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill 
is not operating. The owner or operator of a kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill equipped with an alkali bypass shall conduct simultaneous 
performance tests of the kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill exhaust and the 
alkali bypass. However, the owner or operator of an in-line kiln/raw 
mill may conduct a performance test of the alkali bypass exhaust when 
the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is operating or not operating.
    (i) Each performance test shall consist of three separate runs; each 
run shall be conducted under the conditions that exist when the affected 
source is operating at the representative performance conditions in 
accordance with Sec. 63.7(e). The duration of each run shall be at 
least 3 hours, and the sample volume for each run shall be at least 2.5 
dscm (90 dscf). The concentration shall be determined for each run, and 
the arithmetic average of the concentrations measured for the three runs 
shall be calculated and used to determine compliance.
    (ii) The temperature at the inlet to the kiln or in-line kiln/raw 
mill PMCD, and where applicable, the temperature at the inlet to the 
alkali bypass PMCD, must be continuously recorded during the period of 
the Method 23 test, and the continuous temperature record(s) must be 
included in the performance test report.
    (iii) One-minute average temperatures must be calculated for each 
minute of each run of the test.
    (iv) The run average temperature must be calculated for each run, 
and the average of the run average temperatures must be determined and 
included in the performance test report

[[Page 409]]

and will determine the applicable temperature limit in accordance with 
Sec. 63.1344(b).
    (v) If activated carbon injection is used for D/F control, the rate 
of activated carbon injection to the kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill 
exhaust, and where applicable, the rate of activated carbon injection to 
the alkali bypass exhaust, must be continuously recorded during the 
period of the Method 23 test, and the continuous injection rate 
record(s) must be included in the performance test report. In addition, 
the performance test report must include the brand and type of activated 
carbon used during the performance test and a continuous record of 
either the carrier gas flow rate or the carrier gas pressure drop for 
the duration of the test. Activated carbon injection rate parameters 
must be determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(3)(vi) of this 
section.
    (vi) The run average injection rate must be calculated for each run, 
and the average of the run average injection rates must be determined 
and included in the performance test report and will determine the 
applicable injection rate limit in accordance with Sec. 63.1344(c)(1).
    (4)(i) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to 
limitations on emissions of THC shall demonstrate initial compliance 
with the THC limit by operating a continuous emission monitor in 
accordance with Performance Specification 8A of appendix B to part 60 of 
this chapter. The duration of the performance test shall be three hours, 
and the average THC concentration (as calculated from the one-minute 
averages) during the three-hour performance test shall be calculated. 
The owner or operator of an in-line kiln/raw mill shall demonstrate 
initial compliance by conducting separate performance tests while the 
raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is under normal operating 
conditions and while the raw mill of the in-line kiln/raw mill is not 
operating.
    (ii) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to 
limitations on emissions of THC who elects to demonstrate compliance 
with the alternative THC emission limit of 98 percent weight reduction 
must demonstrate compliance by also operating a continuous emission 
monitor in accordance with Performance Specification 8A of appendix B to 
part 60 at the inlet to the THC control device of the kiln, inline kiln 
raw mill, or raw materials dryer in the same manner as prescribed in 
paragraph (i) above. Alternately, you may elect to demonstrate a 98 
weight percent reduction in THC across the control device using the 
performance test requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS.
    (5) The owner or operator of a kiln or in-line kiln/raw mill subject 
to the 41 [mu]g/dscm mercury standard shall demonstrate compliance using 
EPA Method 29 of 40 CFR part 60. ASTM D6784-02, Standard Test Method for 
Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury Gas Generated from 
Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method), is an acceptable 
alternative to EPA Method 29 (portion for mercury only). If the kiln has 
an in-line raw mill, you must demonstrate compliance with both raw mill 
off and raw mill on. You must record the hourly recycle rate of CKD 
during both test conditions and calculate an average hourly rate for the 
three test runs for each test condition.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, performance 
tests required under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall 
be repeated every five years, except that the owner or operator of a 
kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill or clinker cooler is not required to repeat 
the initial performance test of opacity for the kiln, in-line kiln/raw 
mill or clinker cooler.
    (d) Performance tests required under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section shall be repeated every 30 months.
    (e)(1) If a source plans to undertake a change in operations that 
may adversely affect compliance with an applicable D/F standard under 
this subpart, the source must conduct a performance test and establish 
new temperature limit(s) as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) If a source plans to undertake a change in operations that may 
adversely affect compliance with an applicable PM standard under Sec. 
63.1343, the source must conduct a performance

[[Page 410]]

test as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) In preparation for and while conducting a performance test 
required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a source may operate under 
the planned operational change conditions for a period not to exceed 360 
hours, provided that the conditions in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iv) 
of this section are met. The source shall submit temperature and other 
monitoring data that are recorded during the pretest operations.
    (i) The source must provide the Administrator written notice at 
least 60 days prior to undertaking an operational change that may 
adversely affect compliance with an applicable standard under this 
subpart, or as soon as practicable where 60 days advance notice is not 
feasible. Notice provided under this paragraph shall include a 
description of the planned change, the emissions standards that may be 
affected by the change, and a schedule for completion of the performance 
test required under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, including when the 
planned operational change period would begin.
    (ii) The performance test results must be documented in a test 
report according to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (iii) A test plan must be made available to the Administrator prior 
to testing, if requested.
    (iv) The performance test must be conducted, and it must be 
completed within 360 hours after the planned operational change period 
begins.

    (4) Periods of time when one-minute averages are not available shall 
be ignored when calculating three-hour rolling averages. When one-minute 
averages become available, the first one-minute average is added to the 
previous 179 values to calculate the three-hour rolling average.
    (5) When the operating status of the raw mill of the in-line kiln/
raw mill is changed from off to on, or from on to off, the calculation 
of the three-hour rolling average activated carbon injection rate must 
begin anew, without considering previous recordings.
    (6) The owner or operator must install, operate, calibrate and 
maintain a continuous monitor to record the activated carbon injection 
system carrier gas parameter (either the carrier gas flow rate or the 
carrier gas pressure drop) established during the mercury, THC or D/F 
performance test in accordance with paragraphs (g)(6)(i) through

    (i) Data or information justifying the request, such as the 
technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the 
required approach;
    (ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring 
requirement, including the operating parameter to be monitored, the 
monitoring approach and technique, the averaging period for the limit, 
and how the limit is to be calculated; and
    (iii) Data or information documenting that the alternative 
monitoring requirement would provide equivalent or better assurance of 
compliance with the relevant emission standard.
    (4) The Administrator will notify the owner or operator of the 
approval or denial of the application within 90 calendar days after 
receipt of the original request, or within 60 calendar days of the 
receipt of any supplementary information, whichever is later. The 
Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application 
unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance 
with the relevant emission standard. Before disapproving any alternate 
monitoring application, the Administrator will provide:
    (i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended 
disapproval is based; and
    (ii) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present 
additional supporting information before final action is taken on the 
application. This notice will specify how much additional time is 
allowed for the owner or operator to provide additional supporting 
information.

[[Page 415]]

    (5) The owner or operator is responsible for submitting any 
supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to 
consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither 
submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve 
or disapprove the application relieves the owner or operator of the 
responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart.
    (6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case 
basis that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative 
approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to 
demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.
    (m) The requirements under paragraph (e) of this section to conduct 
daily Method 22 testing shall not apply to any specific raw mill or 
finish mill equipped with a continuous opacity monitor COM or bag leak 
detection system (BLDS). If the owner or operator chooses to install a 
COM in lieu of conducting the daily visual emissions testing required 
under paragraph (e) of this section, then the COM must be installed at 
the outlet of the PM control device of the raw mill or finish mill, and 
the COM must be installed, maintained, calibrated, and operated as 
required by the general provisions in subpart A of this part and 
according to PS-1 of appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. To remain in 
compliance, the opacity must be maintained such that the 6-minute 
average opacity for any 6-minute block period does not exceed 10 
percent. If the average opacity for any 6-minute block period exceeds 10 
percent, this shall constitute a violation of the standard. If the owner 
or operator chooses to install a BLDS in lieu of conducting the daily 
visual emissions testing required under paragraph (e) of this section, 
the requirements in paragraphs (m)(1) through (9) of this section apply 
to each BLDS:
    (1) The BLDS must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of 
detecting PM emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual 
cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less. ``Certify'' 
shall mean that the instrument manufacturer has tested the instrument on 
gas streams having a range of particle size distributions and confirmed 
by means of valid filterable PM tests that the minimum detectable 
concentration limit is at or below 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter 
(0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
    (2) The sensor on the BLDS must provide output of relative PM 
emissions.
    (3) The BLDS must have an alarm that will activate automatically 
when it detects a significant increase in relative PM emissions greater 
than a preset level.
    (4) The presence of an alarm condition should be clearly apparent to 
facility operating personnel.
    (5) For a positive-pressure fabric filter, each compartment or cell 
must have a bag leak detector. For a negative-pressure or induced-air 
fabric filter, the bag leak detector must be installed downstream of the 
fabric filter. If multiple bag leak detectors are required (for either 
type of fabric filter), detectors may share the system instrumentation 
and alarm.
    (6) All BLDS must be installed, operated, adjusted, and maintained 
so that they are based on the manufacturer's written specifications and 
recommendations. The EPA recommends that where appropriate, the standard 
operating procedures manual for each bag leak detection system include 
concepts from EPA's ``Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-
454/R-98-015, September 1997).
    (7) The baseline output of the system must be established as 
follows:
    (i) Adjust the range and the averaging period of the device; and
    (ii) Establish the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
    (8) After initial adjustment, the range, averaging period, alarm set 
points, or alarm delay time may not be adjusted except as specified in 
the operations and maintenance plan required by paragraph (a) of this 
section. In no event may the range be increased by more than 100 percent 
or decreased by more than 50 percent over a 1 calendar year period 
unless a responsible official as defined in Sec. 63.2 certifies in 
writing to the Administrator that the fabric filter has been inspected 
and found to be in good operating condition.

[[Page 416]]

    (9) The owner or operator must maintain and operate the fabric 
filter such that the bag leak detector alarm is not activated and alarm 
condition does not exist for more than 5 percent of the total operating 
time in a 6-month block period. Each time the alarm activates, alarm 
time will be counted as the actual amount of time taken by the owner or 
operator to initiate corrective actions. If inspection of the fabric 
filter demonstrates that no corrective actions are necessary, no alarm 
time will be counted. The owner or operator must continuously record the 
output from the BLDS during periods of normal operation. Normal 
operation does not include periods when the BLDS is being maintained or 
during startup, shutdown or malfunction.
    (n) Any kiln or kiln/in-line raw mill using a control device (other 
then ACI) to comply with a mercury emissions limit or equipment standard 
will monitor the control device parameters as specified in 40 CFR part 
63 subpart SS.
    (o) For kilns and in-line kilns/raw mills complying with the 
requirements in Section 63.1344(g), each owner or operator must obtain a 
certification from the supplier for each shipment of fly ash received to 
demonstrate that the fly ash was not derived from a source in which the 
use of activated carbon, or any other sorbent, is used as a method of 
mercury emissions control. The certification shall include the name of 
the supplier and a signed statement from the supplier confirming that 
the fly ash was not derived from a source in which the use of activated 
carbon, or any other sorbent, is used as a method of emission control.
    (p) If the facility opts to use a fly ash derived from a source in 
which the use of activated carbon, or any other sorbent, is used as a 
method of mercury emissions control and demonstrate that the use of this 
fly ash does not increase mercury emissions, they must obtain daily fly 
ash samples, composites monthly, and analyze the samples for mercury.

<R05>
Sec. 63.1357  Temporary, conditioned exemption from particulate matter and 

opacity standards.

    (a) Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section, an owner or operator conducting PM CEMS correlation tests (that 
is, correlation with manual stack methods) is exempt from:
    (1) Any particulate matter and opacity standards of part 60 or part 
63 of this chapter that are applicable to cement kilns and in-line kiln/
raw mills.
    (2) Any permit or other emissions or operating parameter or other 
limitation on workplace practices that are applicable to cement kilns 
and in-line kiln raw mills to ensure compliance with any particulate 
matter and opacity standards of this part or part 60 of this chapter.
    (b) The owner or operator must develop a PM CEMS correlation test 
plan. The plan must be submitted to the Administrator for approval at 
least 90 days before the correlation test is scheduled to be conducted. 
The plan must include:
    (1) The number of test conditions and the number of runs for each 
test condition;
    (2) The target particulate matter emission level for each test 
condition;
    (3) How the operation of the affected source will be modified to 
attain the desired particulate matter emission rate; and
    (4) The anticipated normal particulate matter emission level.
    (c) The Administrator will review and approve or disapprove the 
correlation test plan in accordance with Sec. 63.7(c)(3)(i) and (iii). 
If the Administrator fails to approve or disapprove the correlation test 
plan within the time period specified in Sec. 63.7(c)(3)(iii), the plan 
shall be considered approved, unless the Administrator has requested 
additional information.
    (d) The stack sampling team must be on-site and prepared to perform 
correlation testing no later than 24 hours after operations are modified 
to attain the desired particulate matter emissions concentrations, 
unless the correlation test plan documents that a longer period is 
appropriate.
    (e) The PM and opacity standards and associated operating limits and 
conditions will not be waived for more than 96 hours, in the aggregate, 
for the purposes of conducting tests to correlate PM CEMS with manual 
method test results, including all runs and conditions, except as 
described in this

[[Page 420]]

paragraph. Where additional time is required to correlate a PM CEMS 
device, a source may petition the Administrator for an extension of the 
96-hour aggregate waiver of compliance with the PM and opacity 
standards. An extension of the 96-hour aggregate waiver is renewable at 
the discretion of the Administrator.
    (f) The owner or operator must return the affected source to 
operating conditions indicative of compliance with the applicable 
particulate matter and opacity standards as soon as possible after 
correlation testing is completed.

Subpart MMM_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for 
                 Pesticide Active Ingredient Production

    Source: 64 FR 33589, June 23, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1360  Applicability.

    (a) Definition of affected source. The affected source subject to 
this subpart is the facility-wide collection of pesticide active 
ingredient manufacturing process units (PAI process units) that process, 
use, or produce HAP, and are located at a plant site that is a major 
source, as defined in section 112(a) of the CAA. An affected source also 
includes waste management units, heat exchange systems, and cooling 
towers that are associated with the PAI process units. Exemptions from 
an affected source are specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) New source applicability. A new affected source subject to this 
subpart and to which the requirements for new sources apply is defined 
according to the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) An affected source for which construction or reconstruction 
commenced after November 10, 1997.
    (2) Any dedicated PAI process unit that meets the criteria specified 
in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) For which construction, as defined in Sec. 63.1361, commenced 
after November 10, 1997, or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 
2002.

[[Page 423]]

    (ii) That has the potential to emit 10 tons/yr of any one HAP or 25 
tons/yr of combined HAP.
    (c) General provisions. Table 1 of this subpart specifies the 
provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to an owner or operator 
of an affected source subject to this subpart, and clarifies specific 
provisions in subpart A of this part as necessary for this subpart.
    (d) Exemptions from the requirements of this subpart. The provisions 
of this subpart do not apply to:
    (1) Research and development facilities;
    (2) PAI process units that are subject to subpart F of this part;
    (3) Production of ethylene;
    (4) Coal tar distillation; and
    (5) The following emission points listed:
    (i) Storm water from segregated sewers;
    (ii) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems, including testing 
of such systems;
    (iii) Spills;
    (iv) Water from safety showers;
    (v) Noncontact steam boiler blowdown and condensate;
    (vi) Laundry water;
    (vii) Vessels storing material that contains no organic HAP or 
contains organic HAP as impurities only; and
    (viii) Equipment, as defined in Sec. 63.1363, that is intended to 
operate in organic HAP service for less than 300 hours during the 
calendar year.
    (e) Applicability of this subpart except during periods of startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction. (1) Each provision set forth in this subpart 
shall apply at all times except that emission limitations shall not 
apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as defined 
in Sec. 63.1361, if:
    (i) The startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of 
the owner or operator of an affected source to comply with one or more 
specific emission limitations to which a particular emission point is 
subject; and
    (ii) The owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of 
startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in Sec. Sec. 
63.1367(a)(3) and 63.1368(i).
    (2) The provisions set forth in Sec. 63.1363 shall apply at all 
times except during periods of nonoperation of the PAI process unit (or 
specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and 
depressurized resulting in the cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 
63.1363 applies.
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with the emissions 
limitations of this subpart during times when emissions (or, where 
applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such 
items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene emissions 
limitations of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment. This 
paragraph does not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning, or 
if the owner or operator must shut down the equipment to avoid damage 
due to a malfunction of the PAI process unit or portion thereof.
    (4) During startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emissions 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (e)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions. For purposes of this paragraph, ``excess emissions'' means 
emissions in excess of those that would have occurred if there were no 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction and the owner or operator complied 
with the relevant provisions of this subpart. The measures to be taken 
shall be identified in the applicable startup, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan, and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control 
technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or 
changes in the manner of operation of the source. Back-up control 
devices are not required, but may be used if available.
    (f) Storage vessel applicability determination. An owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) 
of this section to determine whether a storage vessel is part of the 
affected source to which this subpart applies.
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 
CFR part 63 on June 23, 1999, the storage vessel shall belong to the 
process unit subject to the other subpart.

[[Page 424]]

    (2) Unless otherwise excluded under paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, the storage vessel is part of a PAI process unit if either the 
input to the vessel from the PAI process unit is greater than or equal 
to the input from any other PAI or non-PAI process unit, or the output 
from the vessel to the PAI process unit is greater than or equal to the 
output to any other PAI or non-PAI process unit. If the greatest input 
to and/or output from a shared storage vessel is the same for two or 
more process units, including one or more PAI process units, the owner 
or operator must assign the storage vessel to any one of the PAI process 
units that meet this condition.
    (3) Unless otherwise excluded under paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section, where a storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a 
marine tank farm), the applicability of this subpart shall be determined 
according to the provisions in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (iii) of 
this section.
    (i) The storage vessel in the tank farm is not subject to the 
provisions of this subpart if the greatest input to or output from the 
storage vessel is for a non-PAI process unit. The input and output shall 
be determined among only those process units that share the storage 
vessel and that do not have an intervening storage vessel for that 
product (or raw material, as appropriate).
    (ii) Except for storage vessels in a tank farm excluded in 
accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, applicability of 
this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in 
paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, 
this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel in a tank farm if each 
PAI process unit that receives material from or sends material to the 
storage vessel has an intervening storage vessel for that material.
    (B) Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, 
a storage vessel in a tank farm shall be assigned to the PAI process 
unit that receives the greatest amount of material from or sends the 
greatest amount of material to the storage vessel and does not have an 
intervening storage vessel. If two or more PAI process units have the 
same input to or output from the storage vessel in the tank farm, then 
the storage vessel in the tank farm may be assigned to any one of the 
PAI process units that meet this condition.
    (C) As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraphs 
(f)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, even if an intervening storage 
vessel is present, an owner or operator may elect to assign a storage 
vessel in a tank farm to the PAI process unit that sends the most 
material to or receives the most material from the storage vessel. If 
two or more PAI process units have the same input to or output from the 
storage vessel in the tank farm, then the storage vessel in the tank 
farm may be assigned to any one of the PAI process units that meet this 
condition.
    (iii) With respect to a process unit, an intervening storage vessel 
means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping to the process unit and 
to the storage vessel in the tank farm so that the product or raw 
material entering or leaving the process flows into (or from) the 
intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the 
storage vessel in the tank farm.
    (4) If use varies from year to year, then use for the purposes of 
this subpart for existing sources shall be based on the utilization that 
occurred during the year preceding June 23, 1999, or if the storage 
vessel was not in operation during that year, the use shall be based on 
the expected use in the 5 years after startup. This determination shall 
be reported as part of an operating permit application or as otherwise 
specified by the permitting authority.
    (5) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) another process unit, or ceasing to receive material from 
(or send material to) a PAI process unit, or if there is a significant 
change in the use of the storage vessel, the owner or operator shall 
reevaluate the ownership determination for the storage vessel.
    (g) Designating production of an intermediate as a PAI process unit. 
Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, an owner or 
operator may elect to

[[Page 425]]

designate production of any intermediate that does not meet the 
definition of integral intermediate as a PAI process unit subject to 
this subpart. Any storage vessel containing the intermediate is assigned 
to a PAI process unit according to the procedures in paragraph (f) of 
this section. Any process tank containing the intermediate is part of 
the process unit used to produce the intermediate.
    (h) Applicability of process units included in a process unit group. 
An owner or operator may elect to develop process unit groups in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section. For the PAI process 
units in these process unit groups, the owner or operator may comply 
with the provisions in overlapping MACT standards, as specified in 
paragraphs (h)(2) through (4) of this section, as an alternative means 
of demonstrating compliance with the provisions of this subpart.
    (1) Develop, revise, and document changes in a process unit group in 
accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through 
(vi) of this section.
    (i) Initially identify a non-dedicated PAI process unit that is 
operating on December 23, 2003 or a date after December 23, 2003, and 
identify all processing equipment that is part of this PAI process unit, 
based on descriptions in operating scenarios.
    (ii) Add to the group any other non-dedicated PAI and non-dedicated 
non-PAI process units expected to be operated in the 5 years after the 
date specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, provided they 
satisfy the criteria specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) 
of this section. Also identify all of the processing equipment used for 
each process unit based on information from operating scenarios and 
other applicable documentation.
    (A) Each PAI process unit that is added to a group must have some 
processing equipment that is part of one or more PAI process units that 
are already in the process unit group.
    (B) Each non-PAI process unit that is added to a group must have 
some processing equipment that is also part of one or more of the PAI 
process units in the group.
    (C) No process unit may be part of more than one process unit group.
    (iii) The initial process unit group consists of all of the 
processing equipment for the process units identified in paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (iv) If compliance is to be demonstrated in accordance with 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, determine the primary product of the 
process unit group according to the procedures specified in paragraphs 
(h)(1)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) The primary product is the type of product (e.g., PAI, 
pharmaceutical product, thermoplastic resin, etc.) that is expected to 
be produced for the greatest operating time in the 5-year period 
specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
    (B) If the process unit group produces multiple products equally 
based on operating time, then the primary product is the product with 
the greatest production on a mass basis over the 5-year period specified 
in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
    (C) The primary product of the group must be redetermined if the 
owner or operator does not intend to make that product in the future or 
if it has not been made for 5 years. The results of the redetermination 
must be recorded as specified in Sec. 63.1367(b) and reported in a 
Periodic report no later than the report covering the period for the end 
of the 5th year as specified in Sec. 63.1368(g)(2). If the primary 
product changes, the owner or operator must either demonstrate 
compliance with the applicable subpart as specified in paragraph (h)(3) 
of this section or demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart MMM.
    (v) Add process units developed in the future in accordance with the 
conditions specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this 
section.
    (vi) Maintain records of changes in the process units in each 
process unit group as specified in Sec. 63.1367(b)(9), and maintain 
reports as specified in Sec. 63.1368(f)(9) and (g)(2)(ix).
    (2) If any of the products produced in the process unit group are 
subject to 40

[[Page 426]]

CFR part 63, subpart GGG (Pharmaceuticals MACT), the owner or operator 
may elect to comply with the requirements of subpart GGG for the PAI 
process unit(s) within the process unit group, except for the following:
    (i) The emission limit standard for process vents in Sec. 
63.1362(b)(2)(i) shall apply in place of Sec. 63.1254(a)(2);
    (ii) When the dates of April 2, 1997 and April 2, 2007 are provided 
in Sec. 63.1254(a)(3)(ii), the dates of November 10, 1997 and November 
10, 2007, respectively, shall apply for purposes of this subpart MMM; 
and
    (iii) Requirements in Sec. 63.1367(a)(5) regarding application for 
approval of construction or reconstruction shall apply in place of the 
provisions in Sec. 63.1259(a)(5).
    (3) If the primary product of a process unit group is determined to 
be a type of material that is subject to another subpart of 40 CFR part 
63 on June 23, 1999 or startup of the first process unit after formation 
of the process unit group, whichever is later, the owner or operator may 
elect to comply with the other subpart for any PAI process unit within 
the process unit group, subject to the requirement in this paragraph 
(h)(3). Emissions from PAI Group 1 process vents, as defined in Sec. 
63.1361, must be reduced in accordance with the control requirements for 
Group 1 vents as specified in the alternative subpart. The criteria in 
the alternative subpart for determining which process vents must be 
controlled do not apply for the purposes of this paragraph (h)(3).
    (4) The requirements for new and reconstructed sources in the 
alternative subpart apply to all PAI process units in the process unit 
group if, and only if, the affected source under the alternative subpart 
meets the requirements for construction or reconstruction.
    (i) Overlap with other regulations--(1) Compliance with other MACT 
standards. (i) After the compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, an 
affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart that is also 
subject to the provisions of any other subpart of 40 CFR part 63 may 
elect, to the extent the subparts are consistent, under which subpart to 
maintain records and report to EPA. The affected source shall identify 
in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 
63.1368(f) under which authority such records will be maintained.
    (ii) After the compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, at an 
offsite reloading or cleaning facility subject to Sec. 63.1362(b)(6), 
compliance with the emission standards and associated initial compliance 
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions of any other subpart 
of 40 CFR part 63 constitutes compliance with the provisions of Sec. 
63.1362(b)(6)(vii)(B) or (C). The owner or operator of the affected 
storage vessel shall identify in the Notification of Compliance Status 
report required by Sec. 63.1368(f) the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 with 
which the owner or operator of the offsite reloading or cleaning 
facility complies.
    (2) Overlap with RCRA subparts AA, BB, and/or CC. After the 
compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, if any affected source 
subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, 
and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subpart AA, BB, or CC, or 
is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 
265, subpart AA, BB, or CC, and the owner or operator complies with the 
periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264, subpart AA, BB, 
or CC that would apply to the device if the facility had final-permitted 
status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with the 
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this subpart, 
or with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 
CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this paragraph, which shall 
constitute compliance with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements of this subpart. If the owner or operator elects to comply 
with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR 
parts 264 and/or 265, the owner or operator shall report all excursions 
as required by Sec. 63.1368(g). The owner or operator shall identify in 
the Notification of Compliance Status report required by Sec. 
63.1368(f) the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting authority under 
which the owner or operator will comply.
    (3) Overlap with NSPS subpart Kb. After the compliance dates 
specified in

[[Page 427]]

Sec. 63.1364, a Group 1 or Group 2 storage vessel that is also subject 
to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, is required to comply 
only with the provisions of this subpart MMM.
    (4) Overlap with subpart I. After the compliance dates specified in 
Sec. 63.1364, for all equipment within a process unit that contains 
equipment subject to subpart I of this part, an owner or operator may 
elect to comply with either the provisions of this subpart MMM or the 
provisions of subpart H of this part. The owner or operator shall 
identify in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by 
Sec. 63.1368(f) the provisions with which the owner or operator elects 
to comply.
    (5) Overlap with RCRA regulations for wastewater. After the 
compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, the owner or operator of an 
affected wastewater stream that is also subject to provisions in 40 CFR 
parts 260 through 272 shall comply with the more stringent control 
requirements (e.g., waste management units, numerical treatment 
standards, etc.) and the more stringent testing, monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements that overlap between the 
provisions of this subpart and the provisions of 40 CFR parts 260 
through 272. The owner or operator shall keep a record of the 
information used to determine which requirements were the most stringent 
and shall submit this information if requested by the Administrator.
    (6) Overlap with NSPS subparts III, NNN, and RRR. After the 
compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.1364, if an owner or operator of 
a process vent subject to this subpart MMM that is also subject to the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart III, or subpart NNN, or subpart 
RRR, elects to reduce organic HAP emissions from the process vent by 98 
percent as specified in Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(iii)(A), then the owner or 
operator is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart 
MMM. Otherwise, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions 
in both this subpart MMM and the provisions in 40 CFR part 60, subparts 
III, NNN, and RRR, as applicable.
    (j) Meaning of periods of time. All terms in this subpart MMM that 
define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, 
monthly, quarterly, annual), unless specified otherwise in the section 
or subsection that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard 
calendar periods.
    (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in the subpart MMM for 
completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner and operator and the Administrator, as 
specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the 
compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the 
standard period). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the 
revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request 
is not necessary for each recurring period.
    (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar 
period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the 
period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified 
in paragraph (j)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
    (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard 
calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there 
remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 
2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for 
tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for 
tasks that must be performed annually; or
    (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end 
of the first full standard calendar period within which the initial 
compliance deadline occurs.
    (3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart MMM requires 
completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an 
owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the 
specified period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable 
interval after completion of the task in the previous period.

Sec. 63.1361  Definitions.

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in subpart A of 
this

[[Page 428]]

part, or in this section. If the same term is defined in subpart A of 
this part and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in this 
section for the purposes of this subpart MMM.
    Air pollution control device or control device means equipment 
installed on a process vent, storage vessel, wastewater treatment 
exhaust stack, or combination thereof that reduces the mass of HAP 
emitted to the air. The equipment may consist of an individual device or 
a series of devices. Examples include incinerators, carbon adsorption 
units, condensers, flares, boilers, process heaters, and gas absorbers. 
Process condensers are not considered air pollution control devices or 
control devices.
    Bag dump means equipment into which bags or other containers 
containing a powdered, granular, or other solid feedstock material are 
emptied. A bag dump is part of the process.
    Batch emission episode means a discrete venting episode that is 
associated with a single unit operation. A unit operation may have more 
than one batch emission episode. For example, a batch distillation unit 
operation may consist of batch emission episodes associated with 
charging and heating. Charging the vessel with HAP will result in one 
discrete batch emission episode that will last through the duration of 
the charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the 
charge. Another discrete batch emission episode will result from the 
expulsion of expanded vapor as the contents of the vessel are heated.
    Batch operation means a noncontinuous operation involving 
intermittent or discontinuous feed into PAI or integral intermediate 
manufacturing equipment, and, in general, involves the emptying of the 
equipment after the batch operation ceases and prior to beginning a new 
operation. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not 
occur simultaneously in a batch operation. A batch process consists of a 
series of batch operations.
    Bench-scale batch process means a batch process (other than a 
research and development facility) that is capable of being located on a 
laboratory bench top. This bench-scale equipment will typically include 
reagent feed vessels, a small reactor and associated product separator, 
recovery and holding equipment. These processes are only capable of 
producing small quantities of product.
    Block means a time period equal to, at a maximum, the duration of a 
single batch.
    Car seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to 
change the position of a valve (e.g., from opened to closed) in such a 
way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking 
the seal.
    Cleaning operation means routine rinsing, washing, or boil-off of 
equipment in batch operations between batches.
    Closed-loop system means an enclosed system that returns process 
fluid to the process and is not vented to the atmosphere except through 
a closed-vent system.
    Closed-purge system means a system or combination of system and 
portable containers, to capture purged liquids. Containers must be 
covered or closed when not being filled or emptied.
    Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere 
and is composed of piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, 
flow inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from an emission point 
to a control device.
    Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as a 
flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler, used for the combustion 
of organic HAP vapors.
    Connector means flanged, screwed, or other joined fittings used to 
connect two pipe lines or a pipe line and a piece of equipment. A common 
connector is a flange. Joined fittings welded completely around the 
circumference of the interface are not considered connectors for the 
purpose of this regulation. For the purpose of reporting and record 
keeping, connector means joined fittings that are not inaccessible, 
ceramic, or ceramic-lined as described in Sec. 63.1255(b)(1)(vii) and 
63.1255(f)(3).
    Construction means the onsite fabrication, erection, or installation 
of an affected source or dedicated PAI process unit. Addition of new 
equipment to an affected source does not constitute

[[Page 429]]

construction, provided the new equipment is not a dedicated PAI process 
unit with the potential to emit 10 tons/yr of any one HAP or 25 tons/yr 
of combined HAP, but it may constitute reconstruction of the affected 
source or PAI process unit if it satisfies the definition of 
reconstruction in this section. At an affected source, changing raw 
materials processed and reconfiguring non-dedicated equipment to create 
a non-dedicated PAI process unit do not constitute construction.
    Consumption means the quantity of all HAP raw materials entering a 
process in excess of the theoretical amount used as reactant, assuming 
100 percent stoichiometric conversion. The raw materials include 
reactants, solvents, and any other additives. If HAP are generated in 
the process as well as added as raw material, consumption includes the 
quantity generated in the process.
    Container, as used in the wastewater provisions, means any portable 
waste management unit that has a capacity greater than or equal to 0.1 
m\3\ in which a material is stored, transported, treated, or otherwise 
handled. Examples of containers are drums, barrels, tank trucks, barges, 
dumpsters, tank cars, dump trucks, and ships.
    Continuous process means a process where the inputs and outputs flow 
continuously throughout the duration of the process. Continuous 
processes typically approach steady state.
    Continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that 
completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and 
the edge of the floating roof. A continuous seal may be a vapor-mounted, 
liquid-mounted, or metallic shoe seal.
    Controlled HAP emissions means the quantity of HAP components 
discharged to the atmosphere from an air pollution control device.
    Cover, as used in the wastewater provisions, means a device or 
system which is placed on or over a waste management unit containing 
wastewater or residuals so that the entire surface area is enclosed to 
minimize air emissions. A cover may have openings necessary for 
operation, inspection, and maintenance of the waste management unit such 
as access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells provided that each 
opening is closed when not in use. Examples of covers include a fixed 
roof installed on a wastewater tank, a lid installed on a container, and 
an air-supported enclosure installed over a waste management unit.
    Dedicated PAI process unit means a PAI process unit constructed from 
equipment that is fixed in place and designed and operated to produce 
only a single product or co-products. The equipment is not designed to 
be reconfigured to create different process units, and it is not 
operated with different raw materials so as to produce different 
products.
    Double block and bleed system means two block valves connected in 
series with a bleed valve or line that can vent the line between the two 
block valves.
    Duct work means a conveyance system such as those commonly used for 
heating and ventilation systems. It is often made of sheet metal and 
often has sections connected by screws or crimping. Hard-piping is not 
ductwork.
    Equipment, for purposes of Sec. 63.1363, means each pump, 
compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection 
system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, and instrumentation 
system in organic hazardous air pollutant service.

cover that rests on the liquid surface in a storage tank or waste 
management unit with no fixed roof.
    FIFRA means the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
    Fill or filling means the introduction of organic HAP into a storage 
tank or the introduction of a wastewater stream or residual into a waste 
management unit, but not necessarily to complete capacity.
    First attempt at repair means to take action for the purpose of 
stopping or reducing leakage of organic material to the atmosphere.
    Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a waste management unit 
or storage tank in a stationary manner and that does not move with 
fluctuations in liquid level.
    Flame ionization detector (FID) means a device in which the measured 
change

[[Page 430]]

in conductivity of a standard flame (usually hydrogen) due to the 
insertion of another gas or vapor is used to detect the gas or vapor.
    Floating roof means a cover consisting of a double deck, pontoon 
single deck, internal floating cover or covered floating roof, which 
rests upon and is supported by the liquid being contained, and is 
equipped with a continuous seal or seals to close the space between the 
roof edge and waste management unit or storage vessel wall.
    Flow indicator means a device that indicates whether gas flow is, or 
whether the valve position would allow gas flow to be, present in a 
line.
    Formulation of pesticide products means the mixing, blending, or 
diluting of a PAI with one or more other PAI or inert ingredients.
    Group 1 process vent means any process vent from a process at an 
existing or new affected source for which the uncontrolled organic HAP 
emissions from the sum of all process vents are greater than or equal to 
0.15 Mg/yr and/or the uncontrolled hydogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine 
emissions from the sum of all process vents are greater than or equal to 
6.8 Mg/yr.
    Group 2 process vent means any process vent that does not meet the 
definition of a Group 1 process vent.
    Group 1 storage vessel means a storage vessel at an existing 
affected source with a capacity equal to or greater than 75 m\3\ and 
storing material with a maximum true vapor pressure greater than or 
equal to 3.45 kPa, a storage vessel at a new affected source with a 
capacity equal to or greater than 40 m\3\ and storing material with a 
maximum true vapor pressure greater than or equal to 16.5 kPa, or a 
storage vessel at a new affected source with a capacity greater than or 
equal to 75 m\3\ and storing material with a maximum true vapor pressure

processes may consist of a single process.
    Halogenated compounds means organic compounds that contain chlorine 
atoms.
    Halogenated vent stream means a process, storage vessel, or waste 
management unit vent stream determined to have a concentration of 
halogenated compounds of greater than 20 ppmv, as determined through 
process knowledge, test results using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A, or test results using any other test method that has been 
validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of 
this part.
    Hard-piping means piping or tubing that is manufactured and properly 
installed using good engineering judgment and standards, such as ANSI 
B31-3.
    Impurity means a substance that is produced coincidentally with the 
product(s), or is present in a raw material. An impurity does not serve 
a useful purpose in the production or use of the product(s) and is not 
isolated.

    (3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.

    Note: To definition of ``In light liquid service: Vapor pressures 
may be determined by the methods described in 40 CFR 60.485(e)(1).

    In liquid service means that a piece of equipment in organic HAP 
service is not in gas/vapor service.
    In organic hazardous air pollutant or in organic HAP service means 
that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or 
gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of total organic HAP as 
determined according to the provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) of subpart H 
of this part. The provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) of subpart H of this 
part also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in 
organic HAP service.
    In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal 
pressure which is at least 5 kPa below ambient pressure.
    In-situ sampling systems means nonextractive samplers or in-line 
samplers.
    Individual drain system means the stationary system used to convey 
wastewater streams or residuals to a waste management unit or to 
discharge or disposal. The term includes: hard piping; all process 
drains and junction boxes; and associated sewer lines, other junction 
boxes, manholes, sumps, and lift stations conveying wastewater streams 
or residuals. A segregated stormwater sewer system, which is a drain and 
collection system designed and operated for the sole purpose of 
collecting rainfall-runoff at a facility, and which is segregated from 
all other individual drain systems, is excluded from this definition.
    Instrumentation system means a group of equipment components used to 
condition and convey a sample of the process fluid to analyzers and 
instruments for the purpose of determining process operating conditions 
(e.g., composition, pressure, flow, etc.). Valves and connectors are the 
predominant type of equipment used in instrumentation systems; however, 
other types of equipment may also be included in these systems. Only 
valves nominally 0.5 inches and smaller and connectors nominally 0.75 
inches and smaller in diameter are considered instrumentation systems 
for the purposes of this subpart. Valves greater than nominally 0.5 
inches and connectors greater than nominally 0.75 inches associated with 
instrumentation systems are not considered part of instrumentation 
systems and must be monitored individually.
    Integral intermediate means an intermediate for which 50 percent or 
more of the annual production is used in on-site production of any 
PAI(s) and that is not stored before being used in the production of 
another integral intermediate or the PAI(s). For the purposes of this 
definition, an intermediate is stored if it is discharged to a storage 
vessel and at least one of the following conditions is met: the 
processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel is shutdown 
before the processing equipment that withdraws from the storage vessel 
is started up; during an annual period, the material must be stored in 
the vessel for at least 30 days before being used to make a PAI; or the 
processing equipment that discharges to the storage vessel is located in 
a separate building (or processing area) of the plant than the 
processing equipment that uses material from the storage vessel as a 
feedstock, and control equipment is not shared by the two processing 
areas. Any process unit that produces an intermediate and is subject to 
subpart F of this part is not an integral intermediate.
    Intermediate means an organic compound that is manufactured in a 
process and that is further processed or modified in one or more 
additional steps to ultimately produce a PAI.
    Internal floating roof means a cover that rests or floats on the 
liquid surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it) inside 
a storage tank or waste management unit that has a permanently affixed 
roof.
    Junction box means a manhole or access point to a wastewater sewer 
system line or a lift station.
    Large control device means a control device that controls process 
vents, and the total HAP emissions into the control device from all 
sources are greater than or equal to 10 tons/yr.
    Liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in 
contact with the liquid between the wall of the storage vessel or waste 
management

[[Page 432]]

unit and the floating roof. The seal is mounted continuously around the 
tank or unit.
    Liquids dripping means any visible leakage from the seal including 
dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, and ice formation. Indications of 
liquid dripping include puddling or new stains that are indicative of an 
existing evaporated drip.
    Maintenance wastewater means wastewater generated by the draining of 
process fluid from components in the PAI process unit into an individual 
drain system prior to or during maintenance activities. Maintenance 
wastewater can be generated through planned or unplanned shutdowns and 
during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities 
that can generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling of heat 
exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, 
draining of low legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an 
individual drain system, and draining of portions of the PAI process 
unit for repair.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, emissions 
monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a 
normal or usual manner which causes, or has the potential to cause, the 
emission limitations in an applicable standard to be exceeded. Failures 
that are caused all or in part by poor maintenance or careless operation 
are not malfunctions.
    Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure 
exerted by the total organic HAP in the stored or transferred liquid at 
the temperature equal to the highest calendar-month average of the 
liquid storage or transferred temperature for liquids stored or 
transferred above or below the ambient temperature or at the local 
maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather 
Service for liquids stored or transferred at the ambient temperature, as 
determined:
    (1) In accordance with methods described in Chapter 19.2 of the 
American Petroleum Institute's Manual of Petroleum Measurement 
Standards, Evaporative Loss From Floating-Roof Tanks (incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 63.14 in subpart A of this part); or
    (2) As obtained from standard reference texts; or
    (3) As determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials 
Method D2879-97, Test Method for Vapor Pressure-Temperature Relationship 
and Initial Decomposition Temperature of Liquids by Isoteniscope 
(incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14 of subpart A of 
this part); or
    (4) Any other method approved by the Administrator.
    Metallic shoe seal or mechanical shoe seal means metal sheets that 
are held vertically against the wall of the storage tank by springs, 
weighted levers, or other mechanisms and connected to the floating roof 
by braces or other means. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the 
annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.
    Non-dedicated PAI process unit means a process unit that is not a 
dedicated PAI process unit.
    Nonrepairable means that it is technically infeasible to repair a 
piece of equipment from which a leak has been detected without a process 
shutdown.
    Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except pressure relief 
valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid 
and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.
    Operating scenario, for the purposes of reporting and recordkeeping, 
means a description of a PAI process unit, including: identification of 
each wastewater point of determination (POD) and process vent, their 
associated emissions episodes and durations, and their associated level 
of control and control devices, as applicable; calculations and 
engineering analyses required to demonstrate compliance; and a 
description of operating and/or testing conditions for any associated 
control device.
    Organic compound, as used in the definitions of intermediate and 
PAI, means any compound that contains both carbon and hydrogen with or 
without other elements.
    Organic HAP means those HAP listed in section 112(b) of the CAA that 
are measured according to the procedures

[[Page 433]]

of Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
    Pesticide active ingredient or PAI means any material that is an 
active ingredient within the meaning of FIFRA section 2(a); that is used 
to produce an insecticide, herbicide, or fungicide end use pesticide 
product; that consists of one or more organic compounds; and that must 
be labeled in accordance with 40 CFR part 156 for transfer, sale, or 
distribution. These materials are typically described by North American 
Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Codes 325199 and 32532 (i.e., 
previously known as Standard Industrial Classification System Codes 2869 
and 2879). These materials are identified by product classification 
codes 01, 21, 02, 04, 44, 07, 08, and 16 in block 19 on EPA form 3540-
16, the Pesticides Report for Pesticide-Producing Establishments.
    Pesticide active ingredient manufacturing process unit (PAI process 
unit) means a process unit that is used to produce a material that is 
primarily used as a PAI or integral intermediate. A PAI process unit 
consists of: the process, as defined in this subpart; associated storage 
vessels, as determined by the procedures in Sec. 63.1360(f); equipment 
identified in Sec. 63.1362(k); connected piping and ducts; and 
components such as pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief 
devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, 
valves, connectors, and instrumentation systems. A material is primarily 
used as a PAI or integral intermediate if more than 50 percent of the 
projected annual production from a process unit in the 3 years after 
June 23, 1999 or startup, whichever is later, is used as a PAI or 
integral intermediate; recordkeeping is required if the material is used 
as a PAI or integral intermediate, but not as the primary use. If the 
primary use changes to a PAI or integral intermediate, the process unit 
becomes a PAI process unit unless it is already subject to the HON. If 
the primary use changes from a PAI or integral intermediate to another 
use, the process unit remains a PAI process unit. Any process tank 
containing an integral intermediate is part of the PAI process unit used 
to produce the integral intermediate. A process unit that produces an 
intermediate that is not an integral intermediate may be designated as a 
PAI process unit according to the procedures of Sec. 63.1360(g). 
Formulation of pesticide products is not considered part of a PAI 
process unit. Quality assurance and quality control laboratories are not 
considered part of a PAI process unit.
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Point of determination (POD) means each point where a wastewater 
stream exits the PAI process unit.

    Note to definition of ``point of determination'': The regulation 
allows determination of the characteristics of a wastewater stream: at 
the point of determination; or downstream of the point of determination 
if corrections are made for changes in flow rate and annual average 
concentration of Table 9 compounds as determined in Sec. 63.144 of 
subpart G of this part. Such changes include: losses by air emissions, 
reduction of annual average concentration or changes in flow rate by 
mixing with other water or wastewater streams, and reduction in flow 
rate or annual average concentration by treating or otherwise handling 
the wastewater stream to remove or destroy HAP.

    Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the 
system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure 
relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases 
over a short time period due to a malfunction in the process.
    Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to 
prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working 
pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a 
spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by 
a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or 
by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
    Process means a logical grouping of processing equipment which 
collectively function to produce a product. For the purpose of this 
subpart, a PAI

[[Page 434]]

process includes all, or a combination of, reaction, recovery, 
separation, purification, treatment, cleaning, and other activities or 
unit operations which are used to produce a PAI or integral 
intermediate. Ancillary activities are not considered a PAI process or 
any part of a PAI process. Ancillary activities include boilers and 
incinerators (not used to comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1362), 
chillers or refrigeration systems, and other equipment and activities 
that are not directly involved (i.e., they operate within a closed 
system and materials are not combined with process fluids) in the 
processing of raw materials or the manufacturing of a PAI. A PAI process 
and all integral intermediate processes for which 100 percent of the 
annual production is used in the production of the PAI may be linked 
together and defined as a single PAI process unit.
    Process condenser means a condenser whose primary purpose is to 
recover material as an integral part of a unit operation. The condenser 
must cause a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods during which the 
temperature of liquid in the process equipment is at or above its 
boiling or bubble point. Examples of process condensers include 
distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used in 
stripping or flashing operation. In a series of condensers, all 
condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas 
temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the liquid in the 
process equipment are considered to be process condensers. All 
condensers in line prior to the vacuum source are included in this 
definition.
    Process shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that 
stops production from a process or part of a process during which it is 
technically feasible to clear process material from a process or part of 
a process consistent with safety constraints and during which repairs 
can be effected. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure 
that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 
24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or 
operational procedure that would stop production from a process or part 
of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to 
clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the 
process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of 
leaking components until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a 
process shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible 
bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process 
shutdowns.
    Process tank means a tank that is used within a process to collect 
material discharged from a feedstock storage vessel or equipment within 
the process before the material is transferred to other equipment within 
the process or a product storage vessel. In many process tanks, unit 
operations such as reactions and blending are conducted. Other process 
tanks, such as surge control vessels and bottom receivers, however, may 
not involve unit operations.
    Process unit means the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or 
ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product.
    Process unit group means a group of process units that manufacture 
PAI and products other than PAI by alternating raw materials or 
operating conditions, or by reconfiguring process equipment. A process 
unit group is determined according to the procedures specified in Sec. 
63.1360(g).
    Process vent means a point of emission from processing equipment to 
the atmosphere or a control device. The vent may be the release point 
for an emission stream associated with an individual unit operation, or 
it may be the release point for emission streams from multiple unit 
operations that have been manifolded together into a common header. 
Examples of process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on 
condensers used for product recovery, bottom receivers, surge control 
vessels, reactors, filters, centrifuges, process tanks, and product 
dryers. A vent is not considered to be a process vent for a given 
emission episode if the undiluted and uncontrolled emission stream that 
is released through the vent contains less than 50 ppmv HAP, as 
determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the 
emission stream; using

[[Page 435]]

an engineering assessment as discussed in Sec. 63.1365(c)(2)(ii); from 
test data collected using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; or 
from test data collected using any other test method that has been 
validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of 
this part. Process vents do not include vents on storage vessels 
regulated under Sec. 63.1362(c), vents on wastewater emission sources 
regulated under Sec. 63.1362(d), or pieces of equipment regulated under 
Sec. 63.1363.
    Process wastewater means wastewater which, during manufacturing or 
processing, comes into direct contact with, or results from, the 
production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished 
product, by-product, or waste product. Examples include: product tank 
drawdown or feed tank drawdown; water formed during a chemical reaction 
or used as a reactant; water used to wash impurities from organic 
products or reactants; water used to clean process equipment; water used 
to cool or quench organic vapor streams through direct contact; and 
condensed steam from jet ejector systems pulling vacuum on vessels 
containing organics.
    Product means the compound(s) or chemical(s) that are produced or 
manufactured as the intended output of a process unit. Impurities and 
wastes are not considered products.
    Product dryer means equipment that is used to remove moisture or 
other liquid from granular, powdered, or other solid PAI or integral 
intermediate products prior to storage, formulation, shipment, or other 
uses. The product dryer is part of the process.
    Product dryer vent means a process vent from a product dryer through 
which a gas stream containing gaseous pollutants (i.e., organic HAP, 
HCl, or chlorine), particulate matter, or both are released to the 
atmosphere or are routed to a control device.
    Production-indexed HAP consumption factor (HAP factor) is the result 
of dividing the annual consumption of total HAP by the annual production 
rate, per process.
    Production-indexed VOC consumption factor (VOC factor) is the result 
of dividing the annual consumption of total VOC by the annual production 
rate, per process.
    Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) is defined at 40 CFR part 
403.3(0).
    Reactor means a device or vessel in which one or more chemicals or 
reactants, other than air, are combined or decomposed in such a way that 
their molecular structures are altered and one or more new organic 
compounds are formed.
    Reconfiguration means disassembly of processing equipment for a 
particular non-dedicated process unit and reassembly of that processing 
equipment in a different sequence, or in combination with other 
equipment, to create a different non-dedicated process unit.
    Reconstruction, as used in Sec. 63.1360(b), shall have the meaning 
given in Sec. 63.2, except that ``affected or previously unaffected 
stationary source'' shall mean either ``affected facility'' or ``PAI 
process unit.''
    Recovery device, as used in the wastewater provisions, means an 
individual unit of equipment capable of, and normally used for the 
purpose of, recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive 
heating value), use, reuse, or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. 
Examples of equipment that may be recovery devices include organic 
removal devices such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation 
units. To be a recovery device, a decanter and any other equipment based 
on the operating principle of gravity separation must receive only 
multi-phase liquid streams.
    Repaired means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to 
eliminate a leak as defined in the applicable paragraphs of Sec. 
63.1363.
    Research and development facility means any stationary source whose 
primary purpose is to conduct research and development, where the 
operations are under the close supervision of technically trained 
personnel, and is not engaged in the manufacture of products for 
commercial sale, except in a de minimis manner.
    Residual means any liquid or solid material containing Table 9 
compounds (as defined in Sec. 63.111 of subpart G of this part) that is 
removed from a

[[Page 436]]

wastewater stream by a waste management unit or treatment process that 
does not destroy organics (nondestructive unit). Examples of residuals 
from nondestructive wastewater management units include the organic 
layer and bottom residue removed by a decanter or organic-water 
separator and the overheads from a steam stripper or air stripper. 
Examples of materials which are not residuals include: silt; mud; 
leaves; bottoms from a steam stripper or air stripper; and sludges, ash, 
or other materials removed from wastewater being treated by destructive 
devices such as biological treatment units and incinerators.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent 
deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting 
gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine 
venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover 
such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this 
vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature 
fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position 
during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or 
another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting 
applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the 
owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable 
regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering 
codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of 
flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
    Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a 
process unit used during periods of representative operation to take 
samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take nonroutine grab 
samples is not considered a sampling connection system.
    Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the 
change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, 
pH, or liquid level.
    Set pressure means the pressure at which a properly operating 
pressure relief device begins to open to relieve atypical process system 
operating pressure.
    Sewer line means a lateral, trunk line, branch line, or other 
conduit including, but not limited to, grates, trenches, etc., used to 
convey wastewater streams or residuals to a downstream waste management 
unit.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of a continuous PAI 
process unit for any purpose. Shutdown also means the cessation of a 
batch PAI process unit or any related individual piece of equipment 
required or used to comply with this part or for emptying and degassing 
storage vessels for periodic maintenance, replacement of equipment, 
repair, or any other purpose not excluded from this definition. Shutdown 
does not apply to cessation of a batch PAI process unit at the end of a 
campaign or between batches (e.g., for rinsing or washing equipment), 
for routine maintenance, or for other routine operations.
    Small control device means a control device that controls process 
vents, and the total HAP emissions into the control device from all 
sources are less than 10 tons of HAP per year.
    Startup means the setting in operation of a continuous PAI process 
unit for any purpose, the first time a new or reconstructed batch PAI 
process unit begins production, or, for new equipment added, including 
equipment used to comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment 
is put into operation. For batch process units, startup does not apply 
to the first time the equipment is put into operation at the start of a 
campaign to produce a product that has been produced in the past, after 
a shutdown for maintenance, or when the equipment is put into operation 
as part of a batch within a campaign. As used in Sec. 63.1363, startup 
means the setting in operation of a piece of equipment or a control 
device that is subject to this subpart.

[[Page 437]]

    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
organic liquids that contain one or more HAP and that has been assigned, 
according to the procedures in Sec. 63.1360(f) or (g), to a PAI process 
unit that is subject to this subpart MMM. The following are not 
considered storage vessels for the purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels storing material that contains no organic HAP or 
contains organic HAP only as impurities;
    (4) Wastewater storage tanks;
    (5) Process tanks; and
    (6) Nonwastewater waste tanks.
    Supplemental gases means any nonaffected gaseous streams (streams 
that are not from process vents, storage vessels, equipment or waste 
management units) that contain less than 50 ppmv TOC and less than 50 
ppmv total HCl and chlorine, as determined through process knowledge, 
and are combined with an affected vent stream. Supplemental gases are 
often used to maintain pressures in manifolds or for fire and explosion 
protection and prevention. Air required to operate combustion device 
burner(s) is not considered a supplemental gas.
    Surface impoundment means a waste management unit which is a natural 
topographic depression, manmade excavation, or diked area formed 
primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with manmade 
materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquid wastes 
or waste containing free liquids. A surface impoundment is used for the 
purpose of treating, storing, or disposing of wastewater or residuals, 
and is not an injection well. Examples of surface impoundments are 
equalization, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures of Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    Treatment process means a specific technique that removes or 
destroys the organics in a wastewater or residual stream such as a steam 
stripping unit, thin-film evaporation unit, waste incinerator, 
biological treatment unit, or any other process applied to wastewater 
streams or residuals to comply with Sec. 63.138 of subpart G of this 
part. Most treatment processes are conducted in tanks. Treatment 
processes are a subset of waste management units.
    Uncontrolled HAP emissions means a gas stream containing HAP which 
has exited the process (or process condenser, if any), but which has not 
yet been introduced into an air pollution control device to reduce the 
mass of HAP in the stream. If the process vent is not routed to an air 
pollution control device, uncontrolled emissions are those HAP emissions 
released to the atmosphere.
    Unit operation means those processing steps that occur within 
distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare 
reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and 
recycle materials. Equipment used for these purposes includes, but is 
not limited to, reactors, distillation units, extraction columns, 
absorbers, decanters, dryers, condensers, and filtration equipment.
    Vapor-mounted seal means a continuous seal that completely covers 
the annular space between the wall of the storage tank or waste 
management unit and the edge of the floating roof, and is mounted such 
that there is a vapor space between the stored liquid and the bottom of 
the seal.
    Volatile organic compounds are defined in 40 CFR 51.100.
    Waste management unit means the equipment, structure(s), and/or 
device(s) used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams 
or residuals. Examples of waste management units include wastewater 
tanks, surface impoundments, individual drain systems, and biological 
wastewater treatment units. Examples of equipment that may be waste 
management units include containers, air flotation units, oil-water 
separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such 
as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. If such 
equipment is a recovery device,

[[Page 438]]

then it is part of a PAI process unit and is not a waste management 
unit.
    Wastewater means water that meets either of the conditions described 
in paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition and is discarded from a PAI 
process unit that is at an affected source:
    (1) Is generated from a PAI process or a scrubber used to control 
emissions from a PAI process and contains either:
    (i) An annual average concentration of compounds in Table 9 of 
subpart G of this part of at least 5 ppmw and has an average flow rate 
of 0.02 L/min or greater; or
    (ii) An annual average concentration of compounds in Table 9 of 
subpart G of this part of at least 10,000 ppmw at any flow rate;
    (2) Is generated from a PAI process unit as a result of maintenance 
activities and contains at least 5.3 Mg of compounds listed in Table 9 
of subpart G of this part per individual discharge event.
    Wastewater tank means a stationary waste management unit that is 
designed to contain an accumulation of wastewater or residuals and is 
constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, 
steel, plastic) which provide structural support. Wastewater tanks used 
for flow equalization are included in this definition.
    Water seal controls means a seal pot, p-leg trap, or other type of 
trap filled with water (e.g., flooded sewers that maintain water levels 
adequate to prevent air flow through the system) that creates a water 
barrier between the sewer line and the atmosphere. The water level of 
the seal must be maintained in the vertical leg of a drain in order to 
be considered a water seal.

this section and in Sec. 63.1363, as summarized in Table 2 of this 
subpart.
    (b) Process vents. (1) The owner or operator of an existing source

predominant HAP, of 50 ppmv or less, and an outlet concentration of HCl 
and Cl<INF>2</INF> of 50 ppmv or less.
    (5) Planned routine maintenance. The owner or operator is exempt 
from the specifications in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section 
during periods of planned routine maintenance of the control device that 
do not exceed 240 hr/yr. The owner or operator may submit an application 
to the Administrator requesting an extension of this time limit to a 
total of 360 hr/yr. The application must explain why the extension is 
needed, it must indicate that no material will be added to the storage 
vessel between the time the 240-hr limit is exceeded and the control 
device is again operational, and it must be submitted at least 60 days 
before the 240-hr limit will be exceeded.
    (6) Vapor balancing alternative. As an alternative to the 
requirements in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, the owner or 
operator of an existing or new affected source may implement vapor 
balancing in accordance with paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (vii) of this 
section.

written statement to the owner or operator of the affected storage tank 
giving at least 90 days notice that the certifying entity is rescinding 
acceptance of responsibility for compliance with the requirements of 
this paragraph (c)(6)(vii)(A).
    (B) If complying with paragraph (c)(6)(vi)(A) of this section, 
demonstrate initial compliance in accordance with Sec. 63.1365(d), 
demonstrate continuous compliance in accordance with Sec. 63.1366, keep 
records as specified in Sec. 63.1367, and prepare reports as specified

tank from which the liquid originates, and
    (2) Each time the vapor balancing system is used to comply with 
paragraph (c)(6)(vi)(B) of this section.
    (7) Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of 
this section is demonstrated using the initial compliance procedures in 
Sec. 63.1365(d) and the monitoring requirements in Sec. 63.1366. 
Compliance with the outlet concentrations in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section shall be determined by the initial compliance provisions in 
Sec. 63.1365(a)(5) and the continuous emission monitoring requirements 
of Sec. 63.1366(b)(5).

subpart G of this part, November 10, 1997 shall apply for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    (iii) When April 22, 1994 is referred to in Sec. 63.119 of subpart 
G of this part, June 23, 1999 shall apply for the purposes of this 
subpart.
    (iv) When the phrase ``the compliance date specified in Sec. 63.100 
of subpart F of this part'' is referred to in Sec. 63.120 of subpart G 
of this part, the phrase ``the compliance date specified in Sec. 
63.1364'' shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.
    (3) To request approval to monitor alternative parameters, as 
referred to in Sec. 63.146(a) of subpart G of this part, the owner or 
operator shall comply with the procedures in Sec. 63.8(f) of subpart A

and 63.147 of subpart G of this part, the Periodic report requirements 
contained in Sec. 63.1368(g) shall apply for the purposes of this 
subpart.
    (7) When the term ``process wastewater'' is referred to in 
Sec. Sec. 63.132 through 63.147 of subpart G of this part, the term 
``wastewater'' as defined in Sec. 63.1361 shall apply for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    (8) When the term ``Group 1 wastewater stream'' is used in

    (14) As an alternative to the management and treatment options 
specified in Sec. 63.132(g)(2), any Group 1 wastewater stream (or 
residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream) that contains less 
than 50 ppmw of HAP listed in Table 2 to subpart GGG of this part may be 
transferred offsite or to an on-

[[Page 443]]

site treatment operation not owned or operated by the owner or operator

impurities.
    (3) Gaseous HAP emissions from product dryers and bag dumps shall be 
controlled in accordance with the provisions for process vent emissions 
in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (f) Heat exchange systems. Unless one or more of the conditions 
specified in Sec. 63.104(a)(1) through (6) of subpart F of this part 
are met, an owner or operator shall monitor each heat exchange system 
that is used to cool process equipment in PAI process units that are 
part of an affected source as defined in Sec. 63.1360(a) according to 
the provisions in either Sec. 63.104(b) or (c) of subpart F of this

detected, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in 
Sec. 63.104(d) of subpart F of this part. Delay of repair of heat 
exchange systems for which leaks have been detected is allowed in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 63.104(e) of subpart F of this 
part.
    (g) Pollution prevention alternative. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section, for a process that has an initial 
startup before November 10, 1997, an owner or operator may choose to 
meet the pollution prevention alternative requirement specified in 
either paragraph (g)(2) or (3) of this section for any PAI process unit, 
in lieu of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and 
(e) of this section and in Sec. 63.1363. Compliance with the 
requirements of paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section shall be 
demonstrated through the procedures in Sec. Sec. 63.1365(g) and 
63.1366(f).
    (1) A HAP must be controlled according to the requirements of 
paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section and Sec. 63.1363 if 
it is generated in the PAI process unit or an associated control device 
and it is not part of the production-indexed HAP consumption factor (HAP 
factor).
    (2) The HAP factor shall be reduced by at least 85 percent from a 3-
year average baseline beginning no earlier than the 1987 through 1989 
calendar years. Alternatively, for a process that has been operating for 
less than 3 years but more than 1 year, the baseline factor may be 
calculated for the time period from startup of the process until the 
present. For any reduction in the HAP factor achieved by reducing a HAP 
that is also a VOC, an equivalent reduction in the production-indexed 
VOC consumption factor (VOC factor)

[[Page 444]]

is also required (the equivalence is determined on a mass basis, not a 
percentage basis). For any reduction in the HAP factor that is achieved 
by reducing a HAP that is not a VOC, the VOC factor may not be 
increased.
    (3) As an alternative to the provisions in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section, the owner or operator may combine pollution prevention with 
emissions control as specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) The HAP factor shall be reduced as specified in paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section except that a reduction of at least 50 percent shall 
apply for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (ii) The total annual HAP emissions from the PAI process unit shall 
be reduced by an amount that, when divided by the annual production rate 
and added to the reduction of the HAP factor yields a value of at least 
85 percent of the baseline HAP factor. The total annual VOC emissions 
from the process unit must be reduced by an amount equivalent to the 
reduction in HAP emissions for each HAP that is a VOC (the equivalence 
is determined on a mass basis). For HAP emissions reductions that are 
achieved by reducing a HAP that is not a VOC, the total annual VOC 
emissions may not be increased. The reduction in HAP air emissions must 
be achieved using one of the following control devices:
    (A) Combustion control devices such as incinerators, flares, or 
process heaters.
    (B) Control devices such as condensers and carbon adsorbers whose 
recovered product is destroyed or shipped offsite for destruction.
    (C) Any control device that does not ultimately allow for recycling 
of material back to the PAI process unit.
    (D) Any control device for which the owner or operator can 
demonstrate that the use of the device in controlling HAP emissions will 
have no effect on the HAP factor for the PAI process unit.
    (h) Emissions averaging provisions. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(h)(1) through (7) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing 
affected facility may choose to comply with the emission standards in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section by using emissions 
averaging procedures specified in Sec. 63.1365(h) for organic HAP 
emissions from any storage vessel, process, or waste management unit 
that is part of an affected source subject to this subpart.
    (1) A State may restrict the owner or operator of an existing source 
to use only the procedures in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section to comply with the emission standards where State authorities 
prohibit averaging of HAP emissions.
    (2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled as specified in 
paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section may not be used to 
calculate emissions averaging credits, unless the equipment is approved 
for use in a different manner from that specified in paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section, and a nominal efficiency has been assigned 
according to the procedures in Sec. 63.150(i). The nominal efficiency 
must exceed the percent reduction required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section for process vents and storage vessels, respectively, exceed

Sec. 63.1363  Standards for equipment leaks.

    (a) General equipment leak requirements. (1) The provisions of this 
section apply to ``equipment'' as defined in Sec. 63.1361. The 
provisions of this section also apply to any closed-vent systems and 
control devices required by this section.
    (2) Consistency with other regulations. After the compliance date 
for a process, equipment subject to both this section and either of the 
following will be required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart:
    (i) 40 CFR part 60.
    (ii) 40 CFR part 61.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) The provisions in Sec. 63.1(a)(3) of subpart A of this part do 
not alter the provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (5) Lines and equipment not containing process fluids are not 
subject to the provisions of this section. Utilities, and other 
nonprocess lines, such as heating and cooling systems which do not 
combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not 
considered to be part of a process.
    (6) The provisions of this section do not apply to bench-scale 
processes, regardless of whether the processes are located at the same 
plant site as a process subject to the provisions of this subpart MMM.
    (7) Each piece of equipment to which this section applies shall be 
identified such that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that 
is not subject to this section. Identification of the equipment does not 
require physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment 
may be identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by 
designation of process boundaries by some form of weatherproof 
identification. If changes are made to the affected source subject to 
the leak detection requirements, equipment identification for each type 
of component shall be updated, if needed, within 15 calendar days of the 
end of each monitoring period for that component.
    (8) Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the 
requirements of this section.
    (9) Equipment that is in organic HAP service, but is in such service 
less than 300 hours per calendar year, is excluded from the requirements 
of this section if it is identified as required in paragraph (g)(9) of 
this section.
    (10) When each leak is detected by visual, audible, or olfactory 
means, or by monitoring as described in Sec. 63.180(b) or (c) of 
subpart H of this part, the following requirements apply:

[[Page 447]]

    (i) A weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with 
the equipment identification number, shall be attached to the leaking 
equipment.
    (ii) The identification on a valve in light liquid or gas/vapor 
service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in 
paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, and no leak has been detected 
during the follow-up monitoring. If an owner or operator elects to 
comply with Sec. 63.174(c)(1)(i), the identification on a connector may 
be removed after it has been monitored as specified in Sec. 
63.174(c)(1)(i) and no leak is detected during that monitoring.
    (iii) The identification on equipment, except as specified in 
paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section, may be removed after it has been 
repaired.
    (b) References. The owner or operator shall comply with the 
provisions of subpart H of this part as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section. When the term ``process unit'' is used in

per year. The owner or operator may again elect to use the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D) or (G) of this section after a monitoring 
period in which less than 0.5 percent of the connectors are determined 
to be leaking.
    (G) Monitoring shall be required once every 8 years, if the percent 
leaking connectors in the group of process units was less than 0.25 
percent during the last required monitoring period. An owner or operator 
shall monitor at least 50 percent of the connectors in the first 4 years 
and the remainder of the connectors within the next 4 years. If the 
percent leaking connectors in the first 4 years is equal to or greater 
than 0.35 percent, the monitoring program shall revert at that time to 
the appropriate monitoring frequency specified in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii)(D), (E), or (F) of this section.

repair. The cap, blind flange, plug, or second valve shall be in place 
within 1 hour of cessation of operations requiring process fluid flow 
through the open-ended valve or line, or within 1 hour of cessation of 
maintenance or repair.
    (2) Each open-ended valve or line equipped with a second valve shall 
be operated in a manner such that the valve on the process fluid end is 
closed before the second valve is closed.
    (3) When a double block and bleed system is being used, the bleed 
valve or line may remain open during operations that require venting the 
line between the block valves but shall comply with paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section at all other times.
    (4) Open-ended valves or lines in an emergency shutdown system which 
are designed to open automatically in the event of a process upset are 
exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this 
section.
    (5) Open-ended valves or lines containing materials which would 
autocatalytically polymerize are exempt from the requirements of 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (6) Open-ended valves or lines containing materials which could 
cause an explosion, serious overpressure, or other safety hazard if 
capped or equipped with a double block and bleed system as specified in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section are exempt from the 
requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (e) Standards: valves in gas/vapor service and in light liquid 
service. (1) The provisions of this section apply to valves that are 
either in gas/vapor service or in light liquid service.
    (2) For existing and new affected sources, all valves subject to 
this section shall be monitored, except as provided in paragraph (f) of 
this section and in Sec. 63.177 of subpart H of this part, by no later 
than 1 year after the compliance date.
    (3) Monitoring. The owner or operator of a source subject to this 
section shall monitor all valves, except as provided in paragraph (f) of 
this section and in Sec. 63.177 of subpart H of this part, at the 
intervals specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section and shall comply 
with all other provisions of this section, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and Sec. Sec. 63.178 and 63.179 of 
subpart H of this part.
    (i) The valves shall be monitored to detect leaks by the method 
specified in Sec. 63.180(b) of subpart H of this part.
    (ii) An instrument reading of 500 parts per million or greater 
defines a leak.
    (4) Subsequent monitoring frequencies. After conducting the initial 
survey required in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the owner or 
operator shall monitor valves for leaks at the intervals specified 
below:
    (i) For a group of processes with 2 percent or greater leaking 
valves, calculated according to paragraph (e)(6) of this section, the 
owner or operator shall monitor each valve once per month, except as 
specified in paragraph (e)(9) of this section.
    (ii) For a group of processes with less than 2 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve once each 
quarter, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(4)(iii) through (v) of 
this section.
    (iii) For a group of processes with less than 1 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
2 quarters.

[[Page 452]]

    (iv) For a group of processes with less than 0.5 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
4 quarters.
    (v) For a group of processes with less than 0.25 percent leaking 
valves, the owner or operator may elect to monitor each valve once every 
2 years.
    (5) Calculation of percent leakers. For a group of processes to 
which this subpart applies, the owner or operator may choose to 
subdivide the valves in the applicable group of processes and apply the 
provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this section to each subgroup. If the 
owner or operator elects to subdivide the valves in the applicable group 
of processes, then the provisions of paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (viii) 
of this section apply.
    (i) The overall performance of total valves in the applicable group 
of processes must be less than 2 percent leaking valves, as detected 
according to paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section and as 
calculated according to paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (ii) The initial assignment or subsequent reassignment of valves to 
subgroups shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) 
(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) The owner or operator shall determine which valves are assigned 
to each subgroup. Valves with less than 1 year of monitoring data or 
valves not monitored within the last 12 months must be placed initially 
into the most frequently monitored subgroup until at least 1 year of 
monitoring data have been obtained.
    (B) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a less 
frequently monitored subgroup to a more frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned were monitored during the most 
recent monitoring period for the less frequently monitored subgroup. The 
monitoring results must be included with the less frequently monitored 
subgroup's monitoring event and associated next percent leaking valves 
calculation for that group.
    (C) Any valve or group of valves can be reassigned from a more 
frequently monitored subgroup to a less frequently monitored subgroup 
provided that the valves to be reassigned have not leaked for the period 
of the less frequently monitored subgroup (e.g., for the last 12 months, 
if the valve or group of valves is to be reassigned to a subgroup being 
monitored annually). Nonrepairable valves may not be reassigned to a 
less frequently monitored subgroup.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall determine every 6 months if the 
overall performance of total valves in the applicable group of processes 
is less than 2 percent leaking valves and so indicate the performance in 
the next Periodic report. If the overall performance of total valves in 
the applicable group of processes is 2 percent leaking valves or 
greater, the owner or operator shall revert to the program required in 
paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section. The overall performance 
of total valves in the applicable group of processes shall be calculated 
as a weighted average of the percent leaking valves of each subgroup 
according to Equation 4 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JN99.003

Where:

%V<INF>LO</INF> = overall performance of total valves in the applicable 
group of processes
%V<INF>Li</INF> = percent leaking valves in subgroup i, most recent 
value calculated according to the procedures in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) 
and (iii) of this section
V<INF>i</INF> = number of valves in subgroup i
n = number of subgroups

    (iv) Records. In addition to records required by paragraph (g) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall maintain records specified in 
paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Which valves are assigned to each subgroup,
    (B) Monitoring results and calculations made for each subgroup for 
each monitoring period,
    (C) Which valves are reassigned and when they were reassigned, and
    (D) The results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.

[[Page 453]]

    (v) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later 
than 30 days prior to the beginning of the next monitoring period of the 
decision to subgroup valves. The notification shall identify the 
participating processes and the valves assigned to each subgroup.
    (vi) Semiannual reports. In addition to the information required by 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit in 
the Periodic reports the information specified in paragraphs 
(e)(5)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Valve reassignments occurring during the reporting period, and
    (B) Results of the semiannual overall performance calculation 
required by paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (vii) To determine the monitoring frequency for each subgroup, the 
calculation procedures of paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section shall be 
used.
    (viii) Except for the overall performance calculations required by 
paragraphs (e)(5)(i) and (iii) of this section, each subgroup shall be 
treated as if it were a process for the purposes of applying the 
provisions of this section.
    (6)(i) The owner or operator shall decide no later than the 
implementation date of this subpart or upon revision of an operating 
permit how to group the processes. Once the owner or operator has 
decided, all subsequent percentage calculations shall be made on the 
same basis.
    (ii) Percent leaking valves for each group of processes or subgroup 
shall be determined using Equation 5 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JN99.004

Where:

%V<INF>L</INF> = percent leaking valves
V<INF>L</INF> = number of valves found leaking excluding nonrepairables 
as provided in paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(A) of this section
V<INF>T</INF> = total valves monitored, in a monitoring period excluding 
valves monitored as required by paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section

    (iii) When determining monitoring frequency for each group of 
processes or subgroup subject to monthly, quarterly, or semiannual 
monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last two 
monitoring periods. When determining monitoring frequency for each group 
of processes or subgroup subject to annual or biennial (once every 2 
years) monitoring frequencies, the percent leaking valves shall be the 
arithmetic average of the percent leaking valves from the last three 
monitoring periods.
    (iv)(A) Nonrepairable valves shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves the first time the valve is identified as leaking 
and nonrepairable and as required to comply with paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(B) 
of this section. Otherwise, a number of nonrepairable valves (identified 
and included in the percent leaking calculation in a previous period) up 
to a maximum of 1 percent of the total number of valves in organic HAP 
service at a process may be excluded from calculation of percent leaking 
valves for subsequent monitoring periods.
    (B) If the number of nonrepairable valves exceeds 1 percent of the 
total number of valves in organic HAP service at a process, the number 
of nonrepairable valves exceeding 1 percent of the total number of 
valves in organic HAP service shall be included in the calculation of 
percent leaking valves.
    (7) Repair provisions. (i) When a leak is detected, it shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 calendar days 
after the leak is detected, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section.
    (ii) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 
calendar days after each leak is detected.
    (iii) When a leak is repaired, the valve shall be monitored at least 
once within the first 3 months after its repair. Days that the valve is 
not in organic HAP service shall not be considered part of this 3-month 
period. The monitoring required by this paragraph is in addition to the 
monitoring required to satisfy the definitions of ``repaired'' and 
``first attempt at repair.''
    (A) The monitoring shall be conducted as specified in Sec. 
63.180(b) and (c) as appropriate, to determine whether the valve has 
resumed leaking.
    (B) Periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of 
this

[[Page 454]]

section may be used to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) 
of this section, if the timing of the monitoring period coincides with 
the time specified in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section. 
Alternatively, other monitoring may be performed to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, regardless of 
whether the timing of the monitoring period for periodic monitoring 
coincides with the time specified in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this 
section.
    (C) If a leak is detected by monitoring that is conducted pursuant 
to paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator shall 
follow the provisions of paragraphs (e)(7)(iii)(C)(1) and (2) of this 
section to determine whether that valve must be counted as a leaking 
valve for purposes of paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
    (1) If the owner or operator elects to use periodic monitoring 
required by paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of this section to satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, then the valve 
shall be counted as a leaking valve.
    (2) If the owner or operator elects to use other monitoring prior to 
the periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (e)(2) through (4) of 
this section to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of 
this section, then the valve shall be counted as a leaking valve unless 
it is repaired and shown by periodic monitoring not to be leaking.
    (8) First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the 
following practices where practicable:
    (i) Tightening of bonnet bolts,
    (ii) Replacement of bonnet bolts,
    (iii) Tightening of packing gland nuts, and
    (iv) Injection of lubricant into lubricated packing.
    (9) Any equipment located at a plant site with fewer than 250 valves 
in organic HAP service in the affected source is exempt from the 
requirements for monthly monitoring specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of 
this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall monitor each valve in 
organic HAP service for leaks once each quarter, or comply with 
paragraph (e)(4)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, except as provided 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) Unsafe to monitor, difficult-to-monitor, and inaccessible 
equipment. (1) Equipment that is designated as unsafe-to-monitor, 
difficult-to-monitor, or inaccessible is exempt from the requirements as 
specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section provided 
the owner or operator meets the requirements specified in paragraph 
(f)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, as applicable. All equipment, 
except connectors that meet the requirements in paragraph (f)(4) of this 
section, must be assigned to a group of processes. Ceramic or ceramic-
lined connectors are subject to the same requirements as inaccessible 
connectors.
    (i) For pumps and agitators, paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this 
section do not apply.
    (ii) For valves, paragraphs (e)(2) through (7) of this section do 
not apply.
    (iii) For connectors, Sec. 63.174(b) through (e) and paragraphs 
(b)(3)(iii)(C) through (G) of this section do not apply.
    (iv) For closed-vent systems, Sec. 63.172(f)(1), (f)(2), and (g) do 
not apply.
    (2) Equipment that is unsafe-to-monitor. (i) Valves, connectors, 
agitators, and any part of closed-vent systems may be designated as 
unsafe-to-monitor if the owner or operator determines that monitoring 
personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of 
complying with the monitoring requirements identified in paragraphs 
(f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, or the inspection requirements 
identified in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (ii) The owner or operator of equipment that is designated as 
unsafe-to-monitor must have a written plan that requires monitoring of 
the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times. 
For valves, connectors, and agitators, monitoring shall not be more 
frequent than the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable to 
the group of processes in which the equipment is located. For closed-
vent systems, inspections shall not be more frequent than annually.
    (3) Equipment that is difficult-to-monitor. (i) A valve, agitator, 
pump, or any part of a closed-vent system may be

[[Page 455]]

designated as difficult-to-monitor if the owner or operator determines 
that the equipment cannot be monitored or inspected without elevating 
the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters above a support surface or 
the equipment is not accessible in a safe manner when it is in organic 
HAP service;
    (ii) At a new affected source, an owner or operator may designate no 
more than 3 percent of valves as difficult-to-monitor.
    (iii) The owner or operator of valves, agitators, or pumps 
designated as difficult-to-monitor must have a written plan that 
requires monitoring of the equipment at least once per calendar year or 
on the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable to the group of 
processes in which the equipment is located, whichever is less frequent. 
For any part of a closed-vent system designated as difficult-to-monitor, 
the owner or operator must have a written plan that requires inspection 
of the closed-vent system at least once every 5 years.
    (4) Inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connectors. (i) A 
connector may be designated as inaccessible if it is:
    (A) Buried;
    (B) Insulated in a manner that prevents access to the equipment by a 
monitor probe;
    (C) Obstructed by equipment or piping that prevents access to the 
equipment by a monitor probe;
    (D) Unable to be reached from a wheeled scissor-lift or hydraulic-
type scaffold which would allow access to equipment up to 7.6 meters 
above the ground; or
    (E) Not able to be accessed at any time in a safe manner to perform 
monitoring. Unsafe access includes, but is not limited to, the use of a 
wheeled scissor-lift on unstable or uneven terrain, the use of a 
motorized man-lift basket in areas where an ignition potential exists, 
or access would require near proximity to hazards such as electrical 
lines, or would risk damage to equipment.
    (F) Would require elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 
meters above a permanent support surface or would require the erection 
of scaffold.
    (ii) At a new affected source, an owner or operator may designate no 
more than 3 percent of connectors as inaccessible.
    (iii) If any inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connector is 
observed by visual, audible, olfactory, or other means to be leaking, 
the leak shall be repaired as soon as practicable, but no later than 15 
calendar days after the leak is detected, except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
    (iv) Any connector that is inaccessible or that is ceramic or 
ceramic-lined is exempt from the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements of paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
    (g) Recordkeeping requirements. (1) An owner or operator of more 
than one group of processes subject to the provisions of this section 
may comply with the recordkeeping requirements for the groups of 
processes in one recordkeeping system if the system identifies with each 
record the program being implemented (e.g., quarterly monitoring) for 
each type of equipment. All records and information required by this 
section shall be maintained in a manner that can be readily accessed at 
the plant site. This could include physically locating the records at 
the plant site or accessing the records from a central location by 
computer at the plant site.
    (2) General recordkeeping. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of 
this section, the following information pertaining to all equipment 
subject to the requirements in this section shall be recorded:
    (i)(A) A list of identification numbers for equipment (except 
instrumentation systems) subject to the requirements of this section. 
Connectors, except those subject to paragraph (f) of this section, need 
not be individually identified if all connectors in a designated area or 
length of pipe subject to the provisions of this section are identified 
as a group, and the number of subject connectors is indicated. The list 
for each type of equipment shall be completed no later than the 
completion of the initial survey required for that component. The list 
of identification numbers shall be updated, if needed, to incorporate 
equipment changes within 15 calendar days of the completion of each 
monitoring survey for the type of equipment component monitored.

[[Page 457]]

    (v) ``Repair delayed'' and the reason for the delay if a leak is not 
repaired within 15 calendar days after discovery of the leak.
    (A) The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that 
identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. The written 
procedures may be included as part of the startup/shutdown/malfunction 
plan, required by Sec. 63.1367(a), for the source or may be part of a 
separate document that is maintained at the plant site. Reasons for 
delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the 
written procedure.
    (B) If delay of repair was caused by depletion of stocked parts, 
there must be documentation that the spare parts were sufficiently 
stocked onsite before depletion and the reason for depletion.
    (vi) If repairs were delayed, dates of process shutdowns that occur 
while the equipment is unrepaired.
    (vii)(A) If the alternative in Sec. 63.174(c)(1)(ii) of subpart H 
of this part is not in use for the monitoring period, identification, 
either by list, location (area or grouping), or tagging of connectors 
disturbed since the last monitoring period required in Sec. 63.174(b) 
of subpart H of this part, as described in Sec. 63.174(c)(1) of subpart 
H of this part.
    (B) The date and results of follow-up monitoring as required in

    (viii) The date and results of the monitoring required in Sec. 
63.178(c)(3)(i) of subpart H of this part for equipment added to a batch 
process since the last monitoring period required in Sec. 
63.178(c)(3)(ii) and (iii) of subpart H of this part. If no leaking 
equipment is found in this monitoring, the owner or operator shall 
record that the inspection was performed. Records of the actual 
monitoring results are not required.
    (ix) Copies of the periodic reports as specified in paragraph (h)(3) 
of this section, if records are not maintained on a computerized data 
base capable of generating summary reports from the records.
    (5) Records of pressure tests. The owner or operator who elects to 
pressure test a process equipment train and supply lines between storage 
and processing areas to demonstrate compliance with this section is 
exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (g)(2), (3), (4), and (6) of 
this section. Instead, the owner or operator shall maintain records of 
the following information:
    (i) The identification of each product, or product code, produced 
during the calendar year. It is not necessary to identify individual 
items of equipment in the process equipment train.
    (ii) Records demonstrating the proportion of the time during the 
calendar year the equipment is in use in the process that is subject to 
the provisions of this subpart. Examples of suitable documentation are 
records of time in use for individual pieces of equipment or average 
time in use for the process unit. These records are not required if the 
owner or operator does not adjust monitoring frequency by the time in 
use, as provided in Sec. 63.178(c)(3)(iii) of subpart H of this part.
    (iii) Physical tagging of the equipment to identify that it is in

tests. The dates

[[Page 458]]

and results of each compliance test required for compressors subject to 
the provisions in Sec. 63.164(i) of subpart H of this part and the 
dates and results of the monitoring following a pressure release for 
each pressure relief device subject to the provisions in Sec. 63.165(a) 
and (b) of subpart H of this part. The results shall include:
    (i) The background level measured during each compliance test.
    (ii) The maximum instrument reading measured at each piece of 
equipment during each compliance test.
    (7) Records for closed-vent systems. The owner or operator shall 
maintain records of the information specified in paragraphs (g)(7)(i)

Sec. 63.1365  Test methods and initial compliance procedures.

    (a) General. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, the procedures specified in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), and 
(g) of this section are required to demonstrate initial compliance with 
Sec. 63.1362(b), (c), (d), (f), and (g), respectively. The provisions 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to design evaluations that are 
used to demonstrate compliance with the standards for process vents and 
storage vessels. The provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
apply to performance tests that are specified in paragraphs (c), (d), 
and (e) of this section. The provisions in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section describe initial compliance

[[Page 461]]

procedures for flares. The provisions in paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section are used to demonstrate initial compliance with the alternative 
standards specified in Sec. 63.1362(b)(6) and (c)(4). The provisions in 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section are used to comply with the outlet 
concentration requirements specified in Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(iv)(A), 
(b)(3)(ii), (b)(4)(ii)(A), (b)(5)(ii), and (b)(5)(iii).
    (1) Design evaluation. To demonstrate that a control device meets 
the required control efficiency, a design evaluation must address the 
composition and HAP concentration of the vent stream entering the 
control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent stream 
characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in 
any one of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section, depending 
on the type of control device that is used. If the vent stream is not 
the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency demonstration also 
must consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, 
received by the control device.
    (i) For an enclosed combustion device used to comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(iv), (b)(4)(ii), (c)(2)(iv)(B), or 
(c)(3) with a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum 
temperature of 760 [deg]C, the design evaluation must document that 
these conditions exist.
    (ii) For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the design evaluation 
must document control efficiency and address the following 
characteristics, depending on the type of control device:
    (A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must 
consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, must consider 
the vent stream flow rate, and must establish the design minimum and 
average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone 
residence time.
    (B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation must 
consider the vent stream flow rate and must establish the design minimum 
and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and outlet.
    (C) For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation must 
consider the vent stream flow rate, must establish the design minimum 
and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time, 
and must describe the method and location where the vent stream is 
introduced into the flame zone.
    (iii) For a condenser, the design evaluation must consider the vent 
stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and must establish 
the maximum temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream and the 
corresponding outlet organic HAP compound concentration level or 
emission rate for which the required reduction is achieved.
    (iv) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the 
design evaluation must consider the vent stream flow rate, relative 
humidity, and temperature, and must establish the design exhaust vent 
stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, 
number of carbon beds and their capacities, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for the carbon beds, design total regeneration 
stream mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon 
bed regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after 
regeneration, design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service 
life of carbon. For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop must be 
included.
    (v) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon 
canister, the design evaluation must consider the vent stream mass or 
volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature, and must 
establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration 
level, capacity of the carbon bed, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for the carbon bed, and design carbon replacement 
interval based on the total carbon working capacity of the control 
device and source operating schedule.
    (vi) For a scrubber, the design evaluation must consider the vent 
stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, 
scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration,

[[Page 462]]

temperature, and the reaction kinetics of the constituents with the 
scrubbing liquid. The design evaluation must establish the design 
exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level and must 
include the additional information in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) and (B) 
of this section for trays and a packed column scrubber.
    (A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;
    (B) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and 
for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed 
section.
    (vii) For fabric filters, the design evaluation must include the 
pressure drop through the device and the net gas-to-cloth ratio (i.e., 
cubic feet of gas per square feet of cloth).
    (2) Calculation of TOC or total organic HAP concentration. The TOC 
concentration or total organic HAP concentration is the sum of the 
concentrations of the individual components. If compliance is being 
determined based on TOC, the owner or operator shall compute TOC for 
each run using Equation 6 of this subpart. If compliance is being 
determined based on total organic HAP, the owner or operator shall 
compute total organic HAP using Equation 6 of this subpart, except that 
only organic HAP compounds shall be summed; when determining compliance 
with the wastewater provisions of Sec. 63.1362(d), the organic HAP 
compounds shall consist of the organic HAP compounds in Table 9 of 
subpart G of this part.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20SE02.024

Where:

CG<INF>T</INF> = total concentration of TOC or organic HAP in vented gas 
stream, average of samples, dry basis, ppmv
CGS<INF>i, j</INF> = concentration of sample components in vented gas 
stream for sample j, dry basis, ppmv
n = number of compounds in the sample
m = number of samples in the sample run.

    (3) Initial compliance using flares. When a flare is used to comply 
with the standards, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
provisions in Sec. 63.11(b) of subpart A of this part.
    (i) The initial compliance determination shall consist of a visible 
emissions determination using Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, 
as described in Sec. 63.11(b)(4) of subpart A of this part, and a 
determination of net heating value of gas being combusted and exit 
velocity to comply with the requirements of Sec. 63.11(b)(6) through 
(8) of subpart A of this part. The net heating value and exit velocity 
shall be based on the results of performance testing under the 
conditions described in paragraphs (b)(10) and (11) of this section.
    (ii) An owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance 
test to determine percent emission reduction or outlet organic HAP or 
TOC concentration when a flare is used.
    (4) Exemptions from compliance demonstrations. An owner or operator 
using any control device specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (ii) 
of this section is exempt from the initial compliance provisions in 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
    (i) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 
44 megawatts or greater.
    (ii) A boiler or process heater into which the emission stream is 
introduced with the primary fuel.
    (5) Initial compliance with alternative standard. Initial compliance 
with the alternative standards in Sec. 63.1362(b)(6) and (c)(4) for 
combustion devices is demonstrated when the outlet TOC concentration is 
20 ppmv or less, and the outlet HCl and chlorine concentration is 20 
ppmv or less. Initial compliance with the alternative standards in Sec. 
63.1362(b)(6) and (c)(4) for noncombustion devices is demonstrated when 
the outlet TOC concentration is 50 ppmv or less, and the outlet HCl and 
chlorine concentration is 50 ppmv or less. To demonstrate initial 
compliance, the owner or operator shall be in compliance with the 
monitoring provisions in Sec. 63.1366(b)(5) on the initial compliance 
date. The owner or operator shall use Method 18 to determine the 
predominant organic HAP in the emission stream if the TOC monitor is 
calibrated on the predominant HAP.
    (6) Initial compliance with the 20 ppmv outlet limit. Initial 
compliance with the 20 ppmv TOC or total organic HAP concentration is 
demonstrated when the outlet TOC or total organic HAP concentration is 
20 ppmv or less. Initial

[[Page 463]]

compliance with the 20 ppmv HCl and chlorine concentration is 
demonstrated when the outlet HCl and chlorine concentration is 20 ppmv 
or less. To demonstrate initial compliance, the operator shall use 
applicable test methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of 
this section, and test under conditions described in paragraph (b)(10) 
or (11) of this section, as applicable. The owner or operator shall 
comply with the monitoring provisions in Sec. 63.1366(b)(1) through (5) 
on the initial compliance date.
    (7) Outlet concentration correction for supplemental gases. If 
supplemental gases are added to a vent stream for which compliance with 
an outlet concentration standard in Sec. 63.1362 or 63.1363 will be 
demonstrated, the owner or operator must correct the outlet 
concentration as specified in paragraphs (a)(7)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.

standard in Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(iv)(A), (b)(4)(ii)(A), (b)(6), 
(c)(2)(iv)(B), (c)(4), (d)(13), or Sec. 63.172, the actual TOC outlet 
concentration must be corrected to 3 percent oxygen.
    (B) If the inlet stream to the combustion device contains any HCl, 
chlorine, or halogenated compounds, and the owner or operator elects to 
comply with a total HCl and chlorine outlet concentration standard in 
Sec. 63.1362(b)(3)(ii), (b)(5)(ii), (b)(5)(iii), (b)(6), or (c)(4), the 
actual total HCl and chlorine outlet concentration must be corrected to 
3 percent oxygen.
    (C) The integrated sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the actual oxygen 
concentration (%O<INF>2d</INF>). The samples shall be taken during the 
same time that the TOC, total organic HAP, and total HCl and chlorine 
samples are taken. The concentration corrected to 3 percent oxygen 
(C<INF>d</INF>) shall be computed using Equation 7 of this subpart:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20SE02.025

Where:

C<INF>c</INF> = concentration of TOC, total organic HAP, or total HCl 
and chlorine corrected to 3 percent oxygen, dry basis, ppmv

using Method 1666 or 1671 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A, and comply 
with the sampling protocol requirements specified in Sec. 
63.144(b)(5)(ii). The validation requirements specified in Sec. 
63.144(b)(5)(iii) do not apply if an owner or operator uses Method 1666 
or 1671 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A.
    (ii) As an alternative to the methods specified in Sec. 
63.144(b)(5)(i), an owner or operator may use procedures specified in 
Method 8260 or 8270 in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, 
Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, 
September 1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. An owner or 
operator also may use any more recent, updated version of Method 8260 or 
8270 approved by EPA. For the purpose of using Method 8260 or 8270 to 
comply with this subpart, the owner or operator must maintain a formal 
quality assurance program consistent with either Section 8 of Method 
8260 or Method 8270. This program must include the elements related to 
measuring the concentrations of volatile compounds that are specified in 
paragraphs (b)(8)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) Documentation of site-specific procedures to minimize the loss 
of compounds due to volatilization, biodegradation, reaction, or 
sorption during the sample collection, storage, and preparation steps.
    (B) Documentation of specific quality assurance procedures followed 
during

[[Page 465]]

sampling, sample preparation, sample introduction, and analysis.
    (C) Measurement of the average accuracy and precision of the 
specific procedures, including field duplicates and field spiking of the 
material source before or during sampling with compounds having similar 
chemical characteristics to the target analytes.
    (9) Method 22 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to 
determine visible emissions from flares.
    (10) Testing conditions for continuous processes. Testing of process 
vents on equipment operating as part of a continuous process shall 
consist of three one-hour runs. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall 
be measured every 15 minutes during each 1-hour run. Organic HAP 
concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an 
integrated sample over the duration of each one-hour test run, or from 
grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements 
(every 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory 
analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect 
variations in flow rate. For continuous gas streams, the emission rate 
used to determine compliance shall be the average emission rate of the 
three test runs.
    (11) Testing conditions for batch processes. Testing of emissions on 
equipment where the flow of gaseous emissions is intermittent (batch 
operations) shall be conducted at absolute peak-case conditions or 
hypothetical peak-case conditions, as specified in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) 
and (ii) of this section, respectively. Gas stream volumetric flow rates 
shall be measured at 15-minute intervals. Organic HAP, TOC, or HCl and 
chlorine concentration shall be determined from samples collected in an 
integrated sample over the duration of the test, or from grab samples 
collected simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (every 15 
minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, 
the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations 
in flow rate. In all cases, a site-specific test plan shall be submitted 
to the Administrator for approval prior to testing in accordance with 
Sec. 63.7(c). The test plan shall include the emissions profile 
described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii) of this section. The term ``HAP mass 
loading'' as used in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section 
refers to the class of HAP, either organic or HCl and chlorine, that the 
control device is intended to control.
    (i) Absolute peak-case. If the most challenging conditions for the 
control device occur under maximum HAP load, the absolute peak-case 
conditions shall be characterized by the criteria presented in paragraph 
(b)(11)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, absolute peak-case 
conditions are defined by the conditions in paragraph (b)(11)(i)(C) of 
this section.
    (A) The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain 
at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP mass load that may be vented to 
the control device over any 8-hour period. An emission profile as 
described in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to 
identify the 8-hour period that includes the maximum projected HAP load.
    (B) A 1-hour period of time in which the inlet to the control device 
will contain the highest hourly HAP mass loading rate that may be vented 
to the control device. An emission profile as described in paragraph 
(b)(11)(iii)(A) of this section shall be used to identify the 1-hour 
period of maximum HAP loading.
    (C) The period of time when a condition other than the maximum HAP 
load is most challenging for the control device. These conditions 
include, but are not limited to the following:
    (1) Periods when the streams contain the highest combined VOC and 
HAP hourly load, as described by the emission profiles in paragraph 
(b)(11)(iii) of this section; or
    (2) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
the limits of solubility for scrubbing media; or
    (3) Periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach 
the limits of adsorptivity for carbon adsorption systems.
    (ii) Hypothetical peak-case. Hypothetical peak-case conditions are 
simulated test conditions that, at a minimum, contain the highest total 
average hourly HAP load of emissions that

[[Page 466]]

would be predicted to be vented to the control device from the emissions 
profile described in either paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(B) or (C) of this 
section.
    (iii) Emissions profile. The owner or operator may choose to perform 
tests only during those periods of the peak-case episode(s) that the 
owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required 
emission reduction. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(11)(iii)(D) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall develop an emission profile 
for the vent to the control device that describes the characteristics of 
the vent stream at the inlet to the control device under either absolute 
or hypothetical peak-case conditions. The emissions profile shall be 
developed based on the applicable procedures described in paragraphs 
(b)(11)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section, as required by paragraphs 
(b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (A) Emissions profile by process. The emissions profile must 
consider all emission episodes that could contribute to the vent stack 
for a period of time that is sufficient to include all processes venting 
to the stack and shall consider production scheduling. The profile shall 
describe the HAP load to the device that equals the highest sum of 
emissions from the episodes that can vent to the control device during 
the period of absolute peak-case conditions specified in paragraph 
(b)(11)(i)(A), (B), or (C) as appropriate. Emissions per episode shall 
be calculated using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. When complying with paragraph (b)(11)(i)(B) of this section, 
emissions per episode shall be divided by the duration of the episode if 
the duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour.
    (B) Emission profile by equipment. The emission profile must consist 
of emissions that meet or exceed the highest hourly HAP load that would 
be expected under actual processing conditions. The profile shall 
describe equipment configurations used to generate the emission events, 
volatility of materials processed in the equipment, and the rationale 
used to identify and characterize the emission events. The emissions may 
be based on using a compound more volatile than compounds actually used 
in the process(es), and the emissions may be generated from all 
equipment in the process(es) or only selected equipment.
    (C) Emission profile by capture and control device limitation. The 
emission profile shall consider the capture and control system 
limitations and the highest hourly emissions that can be routed to the 
control device, based on maximum flow rate and concentrations possible 
because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment (e.g., fans, 
LEL alarms and safety bypasses).
    (D) Exemptions. The owner or operator is not required to develop an 
emission profile under the circumstances described in paragraph 
(b)(11)(iii)(D)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) If all process vents for a process are controlled using a 
control device or series of control devices that reduce HAP emissions by 
98 percent or more, no other emission streams are vented to the control 
device when it is used to control emissions from the subject process, 
and the performance test is conducted over the entire batch cycle.
    (2) If a control device is used to comply with the outlet 
concentration limit for process vent emission streams from a single 
process (but not necessarily all of the process vents from that 
process), no other emission streams are vented to the control device 
while it is used to control emissions from the subject process, and the 
performance test is conducted over the entire batch cycle.
    (iv) Test duration. Three runs, at a minimum of 1 hour each, are 
required for performance testing. When complying with a percent 
reduction standard, each test run may be a maximum of either 24 hours or 
the duration of the longest batch controlled by the control device, 
whichever is shorter, and each run must include the same absolute or 
hypothetical peak-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(i) or 
(ii) of this section. When complying with an outlet concentration limit, 
each run must include the same absolute or hypothetical peak-case 
conditions, as defined in paragraph (b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section, 
and the duration of each run may not exceed the duration of the 
applicable peak-case condition.
    (c) Initial compliance with process vent provisions. The owner or 
operator of an

[[Page 467]]

standards in Sec. 63.1362(b) using the procedures described in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.

requirements specified in Sec. 63.1362(b)(2)(ii), (iii), and (b)(4)(ii) 
is demonstrated by determining controlled HAP emissions using the 
procedures described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, determining 
uncontrolled HAP emissions using the procedures described in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, and calculating the applicable percent 
reduction. As an alternative, if the conditions specified in paragraph

demonstrated by showing the control device reduces emissions by 98 
percent by weight or greater using the procedures specified in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (iv) Initial compliance with the HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> percent 
reduction requirements specified in Sec. 63.1362(b)(3)(ii), (b)(5)(ii),

20 ppmv or less and the outlet HCl and chlorine concentration is 20 ppmv 
or less. The owner or operator shall demonstrate compliance by 
fulfilling the requirements in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. If an

    (ii) Engineering assessments. The owner or operator shall conduct an 
engineering assessment to determine uncontrolled HAP emissions for each 
emission episode that is not due to vapor displacement, purging, 
heating, depressurization, vacuum systems, gas evolution, or air drying. 
For a given emission episode caused by any of these seven types of 
activities, the owner or operator also may request approval to determine 
uncontrolled HAP emissions based on an engineering assessment. Except as 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, all data, 
assumptions, and procedures used in the engineering assessment shall be 
documented in the Precompliance plan in accordance with Sec. 
63.1367(b). An engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, 
the information and procedures described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) 
through (D) of this section.
    (A) Test results, provided the tests are representative of current 
operating practices at the process unit. For process vents without 
variable emission stream characteristics, an engineering assessment 
based on the results of a previous test may be submitted in the 
Notification of Compliance Status report instead of the Precompliance 
plan. Results from a previous test of process vents with variable 
emission stream characteristics will be acceptable in place of values 
estimated using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this 
section if the test data show a greater than 20 percent discrepancy 
between the test value and the estimated value, and the results of the 
engineering assessment shall be included in the Notification of 
Compliance Status report. For other process vents with variable emission 
stream characteristics, engineering assessments based on the results of 
a previous test must be submitted in the Precompliance plan. For 
engineering assessments based on new tests, the owner or operator must 
comply with the test notification requirements in Sec. 63.1368(m), and 
the results of the engineering assessment may be submitted

[[Page 474]]

in the Notification of Compliance Status report rather than the 
Precompliance plan.

or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Use of material balances based on process stoichiometry to 
estimate maximum organic HAP concentrations;
    (2) Estimation of maximum flow rate based on physical equipment 
design such as pump or blower capacities; and

from devices described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section or from 
flares for which compliance is demonstrated in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section. If the owner or operator is complying with an 
outlet concentration standard and the control device uses supplemental 
gases, the outlet concentrations shall be corrected in accordance with 
the procedures described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (i) Small control devices, except condensers. Controlled emissions 
for each process vent that is controlled using a small control device, 
except for a condenser, shall be determined by using the design 
evaluation described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, or by 
conducting a performance test in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of 
this section.

documentation demonstrating that the control device being used achieves 
the required control efficiency under absolute or hypothetical peak-case 
conditions, as determined from the emission profile described in

determined from this design evaluation shall be applied to uncontrolled 
emissions to estimate controlled emissions. The documentation must be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. The design evaluation shall also include the value(s) and basis 
for the parameter(s) monitored under Sec. 63.1366.
    (B) Whenever a small control device becomes a large control device, 
the owner or operator must comply with the provisions in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section and submit the test report in the next 
Periodic report.
    (ii) Large control devices, except condensers. Controlled emissions 
for each process vent that is controlled using a large control device, 
except for a condenser, shall be determined by applying the control 
efficiency of the large control device to the estimated uncontrolled 
emissions. The control efficiency shall be determined by conducting a 
performance test on the control device as described in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, or by using the results of a 
previous performance test as described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of 
this section. If the control device is intended to control only HCl and 
chlorine, the owner or operator may assume the control efficiency of 
organic HAP is 0 percent. If the control device is intended to control 
only organic HAP, the owner or operator may assume the control 
efficiency for HCl and chlorine is 0 percent.
    (A) Performance test measurements shall be conducted at both the 
inlet and outlet of the control device for TOC, total organic HAP, and 
total HCl and chlorine, as applicable, using the test methods and

more than one operating condition at which the control device achieves 
the required control efficiency.
    (D) The owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance 
test for any control device for which a previous performance test was 
conducted, provided the test was conducted using the same procedures 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (11) of this section over 
conditions typical of the absolute or hypothetical peak-case, as defined 
in paragraphs (b)(11)(i) and (ii) of this section. The results of the 
previous performance test shall be used to demonstrate compliance.
    (iii) Condensers. The owner or operator using a condenser as a 
control device shall determine controlled emissions for each batch 
emission episode according to the engineering methodology in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(iii)(A) through (G) of this section. The owner or operator must 
establish the maximum outlet gas temperature and calculate the 
controlled emissions using this temperature in the applicable equation. 
Individual HAP partial pressures shall be calculated as specified in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
    (A) Emissions from vapor displacement due to transfer of material to 
a vessel shall be calculated using Equation 9 of this subpart with T set

    (a) To provide evidence of continued compliance with the standard, 
the owner or operator of any existing or new affected source shall 
install, operate, and maintain monitoring devices as specified in this 
section. During the initial compliance demonstration, maximum or minimum 
operating parameter levels, or other design and operating 
characteristics, as appropriate, shall be established for emission 
sources that will indicate the source is in compliance. Test data, 
calculations, or information from the evaluation of the control device 
design, as applicable, shall be used to establish the operating

control device, the owner or operator shall install and operate 
monitoring devices and operate within the established parameter levels 
to ensure continued compliance with the standard. Monitoring parameters 
are specified for control scenarios in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through 
(xii) of this section, and are summarized in Table 3 of this subpart.
    (i) Periodic verification. For control devices that control vent 
streams containing total HAP emissions less than 0.91 Mg/yr, before 
control, monitoring shall consist of a periodic verification that the

owner or operator shall monitor the temperature of the gas stream 
immediately before and after the catalyst bed, and calculate the 
temperature difference across the catalyst bed, at least once every 15 
minutes during the period in which the catalytic incinerator is 
controlling HAP from an emission stream subject to the standards in 
Sec. 63.1362.
    (A) The temperature monitoring devices must be accurate to within

to take a reading at least once every 15 minutes; or
    (B) If the bypass device valve installed at the inlet to the bypass 
device is secured in the closed position with a car-seal or lock-and-key 
type configuration, visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at 
least once every month to verify that the valve is maintained in the 
closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass 
line.

levels shall be established according to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, a 
daily (24-hour) or block average shall be calculated as the average of 
all values for a monitored parameter level set according to the 
procedures in (b)(3)(iii) of this section recorded during the operating 
day or block.
    (ii) The operating day or block shall be defined in the Notification 
of Compliance Status report. The operating day may be from midnight to 
midnight or another continuous 24-hour period. The operating block may 
be used as an averaging period only for vents from

[[Page 487]]

batch operations, and is limited to a period of time that is, at a 
maximum, equal to the time from the beginning to end of a series of 
consecutive batch operations.
    (iii) Monitoring values taken during periods in which the control 
devices are not controlling HAP from an emission stream subject to the 
standards in Sec. 63.1362, as indicated by periods of no flow or 
periods when only streams that are not subject to the standards in Sec. 
63.1362 are controlled, shall not be considered in the averages. Where 
flow to the device could be intermittent, the owner or operator shall 
install, calibrate and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet 
of the control device to identify periods of no flow.
    (3) Procedures for setting parameter levels for control devices used 
to control emissions from process vents. (i) Small control devices. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, for devices 
controlling less than 10 tons/yr of HAP for which a performance test is 
not required, the parameteric levels shall be set based on the design 
evaluation required in Sec. 63.1365(c)(3)(i)(A). If a performance test 
is conducted, the monitoring parameter level shall be established 
according to the procedures in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Large control devices. For devices controlling greater than or 
equal to 10 tons/yr of HAP for which a performance test is required, the 
parameter level must be established as follows:
    (A) If the operating parameter level to be established is a maximum 
or minimum, it must be based on the average of the average values from 
each of the three test runs.
    (B) The owner or operator may establish the parametric monitoring 
level(s) based on the performance test supplemented by engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing 
is not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected 
parameter values. The rationale for the specific level for each 
parameter, including any data and calculations used to develop the 
level(s) and a description of why the level indicates proper operation 
of the control device shall be provided in the Precompliance plan. 
Determination of the parametric monitoring level using these procedures 
is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
    (iii) Parameter levels for control devices controlling batch process 
vents. For devices controlling batch process vents alone or in 
combination with other streams, the level(s) shall be established in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) A single level for the batch process(es) shall be calculated 
from the initial compliance demonstration.
    (B) The owner or operator may establish separate levels for each 
batch emission episode or combination of emission episodes selected to 
be controlled. If separate monitoring levels are established, the owner 
or operator must provide a record indicating at what point in the daily 
schedule or log of processes required to be recorded per the 
requirements of Sec. 63.1367(b)(7), the parameter being monitored 
changes levels and must record at least one reading of the new parameter 
level, even if the duration of monitoring for the new parameter level is 
less than 15 minutes.
    (4) Requesting approval to monitor alternative parameters. The owner 
or operator may request approval to monitor parameters other than those 
required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (xiii) of this section. The 
request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f) of subpart A of this part or in the Precompliance report 
(as specified in Sec. 63.1368(e)).
    (5) Monitoring for the alternative standards. (i) For control 
devices that are used to comply with the provisions of Sec. 
63.1362(b)(6) and (c)(4), the owner or operator shall monitor and record 
the outlet TOC concentration and the outlet total HCl and chlorine 
concentration at least once every 15 minutes during the period in which 
the device is controlling HAP from emission streams subject to the 
standards in Sec. 63.1362. A TOC monitor meeting the requirements of 
Performance Specification 8 or 9 of appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 shall 
be installed, calibrated, and maintained, according to Sec. 63.8. The 
owner or operator need not monitor the total HCl and chlorine

compounds.
    (ii) If supplemental gases are introduced before the control device, 
the owner or operator must either correct for supplemental gases as 
specified in Sec. 63.1365(a)(7) or, if using a combustion control 
device, comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this 
section. If the owner or operator corrects for supplemental gases as 
specified in Sec. 63.1365(a)(7)(ii) for non-combustion control devices, 
the flow rates must be evaluated as specified in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) 
of this section.
    (A) Provisions for combustion devices. As an alternative to 
correcting for supplemental gases as specified in Sec. 63.1365(a)(7), 
the owner or operator may monitor residence time and firebox temperature 
according to the requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(A)(1) and (2) of 
this section. Monitoring of residence time may be accomplished by 
monitoring flow rate into the combustion chamber.
    (1) If complying with the alternative standard instead of achieving 
a control efficiency of 95 percent or less, the owner or operator must 
maintain a minimum residence time of 0.5 seconds and a minimum 
combustion chamber temperature of 760 [deg]C.
    (2) If complying with the alternative standard instead of achieving 
a control efficiency of 98 percent, the owner or operator must maintain 
a minimum residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum combustion 
chamber temperature of 816 [deg]C.
    (B) Flow rate evaluation for non-combustion devices. To demonstrate 
continuous compliance with the requirement to correct for supplemental 
gases as specified in Sec. 63.1365(a)(7)(ii) for non-combustion 
devices, the owner or operator must evaluate the volumetric flow rate of 
supplemental gases, V<INF>s</INF>, and the volumetric flow rate of all 
gases, V<INF>a</INF>, each time a new operating scenario is implemented 
based on process knowledge and representative operating data. The 
procedures used to evaluate the flow rates, and the resulting correction 
factor used in Equation 8 of this subpart, must be included in the 
Notification of Compliance Status report and in the next Periodic report 
submitted after an operating scenario change.
    (6) Exceedances of operating parameters. An exceedance of an 
operating parameter is defined as one of the following:
    (i) If the parameter level, averaged over the operating day or 
block, is below a minimum value established during the initial 
compliance demonstration.
    (ii) If the parameter level, averaged over the operating day or 
block, is above the maximum value established during the initial 
compliance demonstration.
    (iii) A loss of all pilot flames for a flare during an operating day 
or block. Multiple losses of all pilot flames during an operating day 
constitutes one exceedance.
    (iv) Each operating day or block for which the time interval between 
replacement of a nonregenerative carbon adsorber exceeds the interval 
established in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.
    (v) Each instance in which procedures to initiate the response to a 
bag leak detector alarm within 1 hour of the alarm as specified in the 
corrective action plan.
    (7) Excursions. Excursions are defined by either of the two cases 
listed in paragraph (b)(7)(i) or (ii) of this section. An excursion also 
occurs if the periodic verification for a small control device is not 
conducted as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (i) When the period of control device operation is 4 hours or 
greater in an operating day or block and monitoring data are 
insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as defined in paragraph 
(b)(7)(iii) of this section, for at least 75 percent of the operating 
hours.
    (ii) When the period of control device operation is less than 4 
hours in an operating day or block and more than 1 of the hours during 
the period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data due to 
insufficient monitoring data.
    (iii) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and (ii) of

[[Page 489]]

this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the required 
15-minute periods within the hour.
    (8) Violations. Exceedances of parameters monitored according to the 
provisions of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iv) through (ix), and (b)(5)(i)(A) 
of this section, or excursions as defined by paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and 
(ii) of this section, constitute violations of the operating limit 
according to paragraphs (b)(8)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section. 
Exceedances of the temperature limit monitored according to the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section or exceedances of 
the outlet concentrations monitored according to the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(1)(x) of this section constitute violations of the 
emission limit according to paragraphs (b)(8) (i), (ii), and (iv) of 
this section. Exceedances of the outlet concentrations monitored 
according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this section 
constitute violations of the emission limit according to the provisions 
of paragraphs (b)(8) (iii) and (iv) of this section.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for 
episodes occurring more than once per day, exceedances of established 
parameter limits or excursions will result in no more than one violation 
per operating day for each monitored item of equipment utilized in the 
process.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, for 
control devices used for more than one process in the course of an 
operating day, exceedances or excursions will result in no more than one 
violation per operating day, per control device, for each process for 
which the control device is in service.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, 
exceedances of the 20 or 50 ppmv TOC outlet emission limit, averaged 
over the operating day, will result in no more than one violation per 
day per control device. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of 
this section, exceedances of the 20 or 50 ppmv HCl and chlorine outlet 
emission limit, averaged over the operating day, will result in no more 
than one violation per day per control device.
    (iv) Periods of time when monitoring measurements exceed the 
parameter values as well as periods of inadequate monitoring data do not 
constitute a violation if they occur during a startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction, and the facility operates in accordance with Sec. 
63.6(e)(1).
    (c) Monitoring for uncontrolled emission rates. The owner or 
operator shall demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limit 
in Sec. 63.1362 (b)(2)(i) or (b)(4)(i) by calculating daily a 365-day 
rolling summation of uncontrolled emissions based on the uncontrolled 
emissions per emission episode, as calculated using the procedures in 
Sec. 63.1365(c)(2), and records of the number of batches produced. Each 
day that the summation for a process exceeds 0.15 Mg/yr is considered a 
violation of the emission limit.

is based on monitoring. All monitoring requirements for equipment leaks 
are specified in Sec. 63.1363.
    (e) Monitoring for heat exchanger systems. The standard for heat 
exchanger systems is based on monitoring. All monitoring requirements 
for heat exchanger systems are specified in Sec. 63.1362(f).
    (f) Monitoring for the pollution prevention alternative standard. 
The owner or operator of an affected source that chooses to comply with 
the requirements of Sec. 63.1362(g) (2) or (3) shall calculate annual 
rolling average values of the HAP and VOC factors in accordance with the 
procedures specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. If complying 
with Sec. 63.1362(g)(3), the owner or operator shall also comply with 
the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section 
for the applicable add-on air pollution control device.
    (1) Annual factors. The annual HAP and VOC factors shall be 
calculated in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs 
(f)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) The consumption of both total HAP and total VOC shall be divided 
by the production rate, per process, for 12-month periods at the 
frequency specified in either paragraph (f)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this 
section, as applicable.
    (ii) For continuous processes, the annual factors shall be 
calculated every

[[Page 490]]

30 days for the 12-month period preceding the 30th day (annual rolling 
average calculated every 30 days). A process with both batch and 
continuous operations is considered a continuous process for the 
purposes of this section.
    (iii) For batch processes, the annual factors shall be calculated 
every 10 batches for the 12-month period preceding the 10th batch 
(annual rolling average calculated every 10 batches). Additional annual 
factors shall be calculated every 12 months during the period before the 
10th batch if more than 12 months elapse before the 10th batch is 
produced.
    (2) Violations. Each rolling average that exceeds the target value 
established in Sec. 63.1365(g)(3) is considered a violation of the 
emission limit.
    (g) Monitoring for emissions averaging. The owner or operator of an 
affected source that chooses to comply with the requirements of Sec. 
63.1362(h) shall meet all monitoring requirements specified in paragraph

instrument shall meet the performance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR 
part 60, appendix A, except the instrument response factor criteria in 
section 3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for the average composition of 
the process fluid not each individual VOC in the stream. For process 
streams that contain nitrogen, air, or other inerts which are not 
organic HAP or VOC, the average stream response factor shall be 
calculated on an inert-free basis.
    (B) If no instrument is available at the plant site that will meet 
the performance criteria specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section, the instrument readings may be adjusted by multiplying by the 
average response factor of the process fluid, calculated on an inert-
free basis as described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.

a mixture of one or more of the compounds to be measured in air.
    (v) An owner or operator may elect to adjust or not adjust 
instrument readings for background. If an owner or operator elects to 
not adjust readings for background, all such instrument readings shall 
be compared directly to the applicable leak definition to determine 
whether there is a leak. If an owner or operator elects to adjust 
instrument readings for background, the owner or operator shall measure 
background concentration using the procedures in Sec. 63.180(b) and 
(c). The owner or operator shall subtract background reading from the 
maximum concentration indicated by the instrument.
    (vi) The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration 
indicated by the instrument and the background level shall be compared 
with 500 parts per million for determining compliance.
    (4) Leaks, as indicated by an instrument reading greater than 500 
parts per million above background or by visual inspections, shall be 
repaired as soon as practicable, except as provided in paragraph (h)(5) 
of this section.
    (i) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 calendar 
days after the leak is detected.
    (ii) Repair shall be completed no later than 15 calendar days after 
the leak is detected.
    (5) Delay of repair of a vapor collection system, closed-vent 
system, fixed roof, cover, or enclosure for which leaks have been 
detected is allowed if the repair is technically infeasible without a 
shutdown, as defined in Sec. 63.1361, or if the owner or operator 
determines that emissions resulting from immediate repair would be 
greater than the fugitive emissions likely to result from delay of 
repair. Repair of such equipment shall be complete by the end of the 
next shutdown.
    (6) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed-vent system, 
fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in 
Sec. 63.1367(f)(1), as unsafe-to-inspect are exempt from the inspection 
requirements of paragraphs (h)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section 
if:
    (i) The owner or operator determines that the equipment is unsafe-
to-inspect because inspecting personnel would be exposed to an imminent 
or potential danger as a consequence of complying with paragraph 
(h)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section; and
    (ii) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires 
inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-
inspect times. Inspection is not required more than once annually.
    (7) Any parts of the vapor collection system, closed-vent system, 
fixed roof, cover, or enclosure that are designated, as described in 
Sec. 63.1367(f)(2), as difficult-to-inspect are exempt from the 
inspection requirements of paragraphs (h)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii)(A) of 
this section if:

has been applied.
    Building insulation means bonded wool fiberglass insulation, having 
a loss on ignition of less than 8 percent and a density of less than 32 
kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m\3\) (2 pounds per cubic foot [lb/
ft\3\]).
    Cold top electric furnace means an all-electric glass-melting 
furnace that operates with a temperature of 120 [deg]C (250 [deg]F) or 
less as measured at a location 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) 
above the molten glass surface.
    Flame attenuation means a process used to produce wool fiberglass 
where molten glass flows by gravity from melting furnaces, or pots, to 
form filaments that are drawn down and attenuated by passing in front of 
a high-velocity gas burner flame.
    Glass-melting furnace means a unit comprising a refractory vessel in 
which raw materials are charged, melted at high temperature, refined, 
and conditioned to produce molten glass. The unit includes foundations, 
superstructure and retaining walls, raw material charger systems, heat 
exchangers, melter cooling system, exhaust system, refractory brick 
work, fuel supply and electrical boosting equipment, integral control 
systems and instrumentation, and appendages for conditioning and 
distributing molten glass to forming processes. The forming apparatus, 
including flow channels, is not considered part of the glass-melting 
furnace.
    Glass pull rate means the mass of molten glass that is produced by a 
single glass-melting furnace or that is used in the manufacture of wool 
fiberglass at a single manufacturing line in a specified time period.
    Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) means any air pollutant listed in or 
pursuant to section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act.
    Heavy-density product means bonded wool fiberglass insulation 
manufactured on a flame attenuation manufacturing line and having a loss 
on ignition of 11 to 25 percent and a density of 8 to 48 kg/m\3\ (0.5 to

Sec. 63.1384  Performance test requirements.

    (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall conduct a performance test to demonstrate compliance with the 
applicable emission limits in Sec. 63.1382. Compliance is demonstrated 
when the emission rate of the pollutant is equal to or less than each of 
the applicable emission limits in Sec. 63.1382. The owner or operator 
shall conduct the performance test according to the procedures in 40 CFR 
part 63, subpart A and in this section.
    (1) All monitoring systems and equipment must be installed, 
operational, and calibrated prior to the performance test.
    (2) Unless a different frequency is specified in this section, the 
owner or operator must monitor and record process and/or add-on control 
device parameters at least every 15 minutes during the performance 
tests. The arithmetic average for each parameter must be calculated 
using all of the recorded measurements for the parameter.

[[Page 511]]

    (3) During each performance test, the owner or operator must monitor 
and record the glass pull rate for each glass-melting furnace and, if 
different, the glass pull rate for each rotary spin manufacturing line 
and flame attenuation manufacturing line. Record the glass pull rate 
every 15 minutes during any performance test required by this subpart 
and determine the arithmetic average of the recorded measurements for 
each test run and calculate the average of the three test runs.
    (4) The owner or operator shall conduct a performance test for each 
existing and new glass-melting furnace.
    (5) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a glass-
melting furnace controlled by an ESP shall monitor and record the ESP 
parameter level(s), as specified in the operations, maintenance, and 
monitoring plan, and establish the minimum and/or maximum value(s) that 
will be used to demonstrate compliance after the initial performance 
test.
    (6) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a cold top 
electric furnace that is not equipped with an add-on control device for 
PM emissions control, must monitor and record the temperature 46 to 61 
centimeters (18 to 24 inches) above the molten glass surface to ensure 
that the maximum temperature does not exceed 120 [deg]C (250 [deg]F).
    (7) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a glass 
melting furnace (other than a cold top electric furnace) that is not 
equipped with an add-on control device for PM emissions control, must 
monitor and record the furnace parameter level, and establish the 
minimum and/or maximum value(s) that will be used to demonstrate 
compliance after the initial performance test.
    (8) The owner or operator must conduct a performance test for each 
rotary spin manufacturing line, subject to this subpart, while producing 
the building insulation with the highest LOI expected to be produced on 
that line; and for each flame attenuation manufacturing line, subject to 
this subpart, while producing the heavy-density product or pipe product 
with the highest LOI expected to be produced on the affected line.
    (9) The owner or operator of each rotary spin manufacturing line and 
flame attenuation manufacturing line regulated by this subpart must 
conduct performance tests using the resin with the highest free-
formaldehyde content. During the performance test of each rotary spin 
manufacturing line and flame attenuation manufacturing line regulated by 
this subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor and record the free-
formaldehyde content of the resin, the binder formulation used, and the 
product LOI and density.
    (10) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a rotary 
spin manufacturing line or flame attenuation manufacturing line who 
plans to use process modifications to comply with the emission limits in 
Sec. 63.1382 must monitor and record the process parameter level(s), as 
specified in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan, which 
will be used to demonstrate compliance after the initial performance 
test.
    (11) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a rotary 
spin manufacturing line or flame attenuation manufacturing line who 
plans to use a wet scrubbing control device to comply with the emission 
limits in Sec. 63.1382 must continuously monitor and record the 
pressure drop across the scrubber, the scrubbing liquid flow rate, and 
addition of any chemical to the scrubber, including the chemical feed 
rate, and establish the minimum and/or maximum value(s) that will be 
used to determine compliance after the initial performance test.
    (12) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a rotary 
spin manufacturing line or affected flame attenuation manufacturing line 
shall continuously record the operating temperature of each incinerator 
and record the average during each 1-hour test; the average operating 
temperature of the three 1-hour tests shall be used to monitor 
compliance.
    (13) Unless disapproved by the Administrator, an owner or operator 
of a rotary spin or flame attenuation manufacturing line regulated by 
this subpart may conduct short-term experimental production runs using 
binder formulations or other process modifications where the process 
parameter values

[[Page 512]]

would be outside those established during performance tests without 
first conducting performance tests. Such runs must not exceed 1 week in 
duration unless the Administrator approves a longer period. The owner or 
operator must notify the Administrator and postmark or deliver the 
notification at least 15 days prior to commencement of the short-term 
experimental production runs. The Administrator must inform the owner or 
operator of a decision to disapprove or must request additional 
information prior to the date of the short-term experimental production 
runs. Notification of intent to perform an experimental short-term 
production run shall include the following information:

Sec. Appendix A to Subpart NNN of Part 63--Method for the Determination 
                                 of LOI

                               1. Purpose

    The purpose of this test is to determine the LOI of cured blanket 
insulation. The method is applicable to all cured board and blanket 
products.

                              2. Equipment

    2.1 Scale sensitive to 0.1 gram.
    2.2 Furnace designed to heat to at least 540 [deg]C (1,000 [deg]F) 
and controllable to <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 [deg]C (50 [deg]F).
    2.3 Wire tray for holding specimen while in furnace.

                              3. Procedure

    3.1 Cut a strip along the entire width of the product that will 
weigh at least 10.0 grams. Sample should be free of dirt or foreign 
matter.

    Note: Remove all facing from sample.

    3.2 Cut the sample into pieces approximately 12 inches long, weigh 
to the nearest 0.1 gram and record. Place in wire tray. Sample should 
not be compressed or overhang on tray edges.

    Note: On air duct products, remove shiplaps and overspray.

    3.3 Place specimen in furnace at 540 [deg]C (1,000 [deg]F), <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) for 15 to 20 minutes to insure 
complete oxidation. After ignition, fibers should be white and should 
not be fused together.
    3.4 Remove specimen from the furnace and cool to room temperature.
    3.5 Weigh cooled specimen and wire tray to the nearest 0.1 gram. 
Deduct the weight of the wire tray and then calculate the loss in weight 
as a percent of the original specimen weight.

Sec. Appendix B to Subpart NNN of Part 63--Free Formaldehyde Analysis of 
            Insulation Resins by Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride

                                1. Scope

    This method was specifically developed for water-soluble phenolic 
resins that have a relatively high free-formaldehyde (FF) content such 
as insulation resins. It may also be suitable for other phenolic resins, 
especially those with a high FF content.

                              2. Principle

    2.1 a. The basis for this method is the titration of the 
hydrochloric acid that is liberated when hydroxylamine hydrochloride 
reacts with formaldehyde to form formaldoxine:

HCHO + NH2OH:HCl [rarr] CH2:NOH + H2O + HCl

    b. Free formaldehyde in phenolic resins is present as monomeric 
formaldehyde, hemiformals, polyoxymethylene hemiformals, and 
polyoxymethylene glycols. Monomeric formaldehyde and hemiformals react 
rapidly with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, but the polymeric forms of 
formaldehyde must hydrolyze to the monomeric state before they can 
react. The greater the concentration of free formaldehyde in a resin, 
the more of that formaldehyde will be in the polymeric form. The 
hydrolysis of these polymers is catalyzed by hydrogen ions.
    2.2 The resin sample being analyzed must contain enough free 
formaldehyde so that the initial reaction with hydroxylamine 
hydrochloride will produce sufficient hydrogen ions to catalyze the 
depolymerization of the polymeric formaldehyde within the time limits of 
the test method. The sample should contain approximately 0.3 grams free 
formaldehyde to ensure complete reaction within 5 minutes.

                              3. Apparatus

    3.1 Balance, readable to 0.01 g or better.
    3.2 pH meter, standardized to pH 4.0 with pH 4.0 buffer and pH 7 
with pH 7.0 buffer.
    3.3 50-mL burette for 1.0 N sodium hydroxide.
    3.4 Magnetic stirrer and stir bars.
    3.5 250-mL beaker.
    3.6 50-mL graduated cylinder.
    3.7 100-mL graduated cylinder.
    3.8 Timer.

                               4. Reagents

    4.1 Standardized 1.0 N sodium hydroxide solution.
    4.2 Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, 100 grams per liter, pH 
adjusted to 4.00.
    4.3 Hydrochloric acid solution, 1.0 N and 0.1 N.
    4.4 Sodium hydroxide solution, 0.1 N.

[[Page 518]]

    4.5 50/50 v/v mixture of distilled water and methyl alcohol.

                              5. Procedure

    5.1 Determine the sample size as follows:
    a. If the expected FF is greater than 2 percent, go to Part A to 
determine sample size.
    b. If the expected FF is less than 2 percent, go to Part B to 
determine sample size.
    c. Part A: Expected FF <ls-thn-eq>= 2 percent.

Grams resin = 60/expected percent FF

    i. The following table shows example levels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Sample
                Expected % free formaldehyde                 size, grams
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2..........................................................         30.0
5..........................................................         12.0
8..........................................................          7.5

12.........................................................          5.0
15.........................................................          4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ii. It is very important to the accuracy of the results that the 
sample size be chosen correctly. If the milliliters of titrant are less 
than 15 mL or greater than 30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and 
repeat the tests.
    d. Part B: Expected FF < 2 percent

Grams resin = 30/expected percent FF

    i. The following table shows example levels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Sample
                Expected % free formaldehyde                 size, grams

1..........................................................           30
0.5........................................................           60
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ii. If the milliliters of titrant are less than 5 mL or greater than 
30 mL, reestimate the needed sample size and repeat the tests.
    5.2 Weigh the resin sample to the nearest 0.01 grams into a 250-mL 
beaker. Record sample weight.
    5.3 Add 100 mL of the methanol/water mixture and stir on a magnetic 
stirrer. Confirm that the resin has dissolved.
    5.4 Adjust the resin/solvent solution to pH 4.0, using the 
prestandardized pH meter, 1.0 N hydrochloric acid, 0.1 N hydrochloric 
acid, and 0.1 N sodium hydroxide.
    5.5 Add 50 mL of the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, measured 
with a graduated cylinder. Start the timer.
    5.6 Stir for 5 minutes. Titrate to pH 4.0 with standardized 1.0 N 
sodium hydroxide. Record the milliliters of titrant and the normality.

             Emissions: Manufacture of Amino/Phenolic Resins

    Source: 65 FR 3290, Jan. 20, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 63.1400  Applicability and designation of affected sources.

    (a) Applicability. The provisions of this subpart apply to the owner 
or operator of processes that produce amino/phenolic resins and that are 
located at a plant site that is a major source as defined in Sec. 63.2.
    (b) Affected source. The affected source is:
    (1) The total of all amino/phenolic resin process units (APPU);
    (2) The associated heat exchange systems;
    (3) Equipment required by, or utilized as a method of compliance 
with, this subpart which may include control devices and recovery 
devices;
    (4) Equipment that does not contain organic hazardous air pollutants 
(HAPs) and is located within an APPU that is part of an affected source;
    (5) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contain no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only;
    (6) Equipment that is intended to operate in organic HAP service for 
less than 300 hours during the calendar year;
    (7) Each waste management unit; and
    (8) Maintenance wastewater.
    (c) Existing affected source. The affected source to which the 
existing source provisions of this subpart apply is defined in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (d) New affected source. The affected source to which the new source 
provisions of this subpart apply is:
    (1) Each affected source defined in paragraph (b) of this section 
that commences construction or reconstruction after December 14, 1998;
    (2) Each additional group of one or more APPU and associated heat 
exchange systems that has the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more 
of any organic HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of 
organic HAP that commences construction after December 14, 1998; or
    (3) Each group of one or more process units and associated heat 
exchange systems that are converted to APPUs after December 14, 1998, 
that has the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of any organic 
HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of organic HAP.
    (e) APPUs without organic HAP. An APPU that is part of an affected 
source, as defined in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, but that 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP, is not subject to any other 
provisions of this subpart and is not required to comply with the 
provisions of subpart A of this part. When requested by the 
Administrator, the owner or operator shall demonstrate that the APPU 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP. Types of information that 
could document this determination include, but are not limited to, 
records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process 
stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
    (f) Exemption from equipment leak provisions. Affected sources with 
actual annual production of amino/phenolic resin equal to or less than 
800 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) for the 12-month period preceding 
December 14, 1998 are exempt from the equipment leak provisions 
specified in Sec. 63.1410. The owner or operator utilizing this 
exemption shall recheck the actual annual production of amino/phenolic 
resins for each 12-month period following December 14, 1998. The 
beginning of each 12-month period shall be the anniversary of December 
14, 1998. If the actual annual production of amino/phenolic resins is 
greater than 800 Mg/yr for any 12-month period, the owner or operator 
shall comply with Sec. 63.1410 for the life of the affected source or 
until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this 
subpart.

[[Page 520]]

    (g) Primary product determination and applicability. For purposes of 
this paragraph, amino resins and phenolic resins shall be considered to 
be the same product and production time or production mass of amino and 
phenolic resins shall be combined for purposes of determining the 
primary product under this paragraph (g). If the owner or operator 
determines that a process unit is not an APPU under paragraphs (g)(1) 
through (4) of this section, the owner or operator shall, when requested 
by the Administrator, demonstrate that the process unit is not an APPU.
    (1) Applicability determinations for process units producing 
multiple products. A process unit that produces more than one intended 
product at the same time is an APPU if amino/phenolic resin production 
accounts for the greatest percent of the annual design capacity on a 
mass basis. If a process unit has the same annual design capacity on a 
mass basis for two or more products, the process unit shall be an APPU 
if amino/phenolic resins are one of those products.
    (2) Flexible operations process unit determination based on 
operating time. A flexible operations process unit is an APPU if amino/
phenolic resins will be produced for the greatest operating time over 
the 5 years following December 14, 1998 at existing process units, or 
for the first year after the process unit begins production of any 
product for new process units.
    (3) Flexible operations process unit determination based on mass 
production basis. A flexible operations process unit that will 
manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time is an APPU 
if amino/phenolic resins account for the greatest percentage of the 
expected production on a mass basis over the 5 years following December 
14, 1998 at existing process units, or for the first year after the 
process unit begins production of any product for new process units.
    (4) Flexible operations process unit default determination. If the 
owner or operator cannot determine whether or not amino/phenolic resins 
are the primary product of a flexible operations process unit in 
accordance with paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, the flexible 
operations process unit shall be designated as an APPU if amino/phenolic 
resins were produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating 
time since December 14, 1998 for existing process units. The flexible 
operations process unit shall be designated as an APPU if the owner or 
operator anticipates that amino/phenolic resins will be manufactured in 
the flexible operations process unit at any time in the first year after 
the date the unit begins production of any product for new process 
units.
    (5) Annual applicability determination for non-APPUs that have 
produced amino/phenolic resins. Once per year beginning December 14, 
2003, the owner or operator of each flexible operations process unit 
that is not designated as an APPU, but that has produced amino/phenolic 
resins at any time in the preceding 5-year period or since the date that 
the unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall 
perform an evaluation to determine whether the process unit has become 
an APPU. A flexible operations process unit has become an APPU if amino/
phenolic resins were produced for the greatest operating time over the 
preceding 5-year period or since the date that the process unit began 
production of any product, whichever is shorter.
    (6) Applicability determination for non-APPUs that have not produced 
amino/phenolic resins. The owner or operator that anticipates the 
production of amino/phenolic resins in a process unit that is not 
designated as an APPU, and in which no amino/phenolic resins have been 
produced in the previous 5-year period or since the date that the 
process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, 
shall determine if the process unit will become an APPU. The owner or 
operator shall use the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of 
this section to determine if the process unit is designated as an APPU, 
with the following exception: for existing process units, production 
shall be projected for the 5 years following the date that the owner or 
operator anticipates initiating the production of amino/phenolic resins, 
instead of the 5 years following December 14, 1998.
    (7) Redetermination of applicability to APPU that are flexible 
operations process

[[Page 521]]

units. Whenever changes in production occur that could reasonably be 
expected to cause a flexible operations process unit to no longer be an 
APPU (i.e., amino/phenolic resins will no longer be the primary product 
according to the determination procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) through 
(4) of this section), the owner or operator shall reevaluate the status 
of the process unit as an APPU. A flexible operations process unit has 
ceased to be an APPU subject to this subpart if the following criteria 
are met:
    (i) If amino/phenolic resins were not produced for the greatest 
operating time over the preceding 5-year period or since the date that 
the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter;
    (ii) If the new primary product, which is not amino/phenolic resins, 
is subject to another subpart of this part; and
    (iii) If the owner or operator has notified the Administrator of the 
pending change in status for the flexible operations process unit, as 
specified in Sec. 63.1417(h)(4).
    (8) APPU terminating production of all amino/phenolic resins. If an 
APPU terminates the production of all amino/phenolic resins and does not 
anticipate the production of any amino/phenolic resins in the future, 
the process unit is no longer an APPU and is not subject to this subpart 
after notification is made to the Administrator, as specified in Sec. 
63.1417(h)(4).
    (h) Storage vessel applicability determination. The owner or 
operator of a storage vessel at a new affected source shall determine 
assignment to a process unit as follows:
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 
part 63 on January 20, 2000, said storage vessel shall continue to be 
assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart.
    (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
    (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the 
same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into 
or output from the storage vessel (i.e., said process unit has the 
predominant use of the storage vessel).
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units, and if one or more of those process 
units is an APPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be 
assigned to any of the APPUs.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the use as 
follows:
    (i) For existing affected sources, use shall be determined based on 
the following:
    (A) The year preceding January 20, 2000; or
    (B) The expected use for the 5 years following January 20, 2000.
    (ii) For new affected sources, use shall be determined based on the 
first 5 years after initial start-up.
    (7) Where the storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a 
marine tank farm), the assignment of the storage vessel shall be 
determined according to paragraphs (h)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section. 
Only those storage vessels where a portion or all of the input into or 
output from the storage vessel is hardpiped directly to one or more 
process units are covered by this paragraph.
    (i) The storage vessel is assigned to a process unit if the product 
or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows directly into 
(or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm without passing through 
any intervening storage vessel. An intervening storage vessel means a 
storage vessel connected by hardpiping both to the process unit and to 
the storage vessel in the tank farm.
    (ii) If there are two or more process units that meet the criteria 
of paragraph (h)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, 
the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units 
according to the provisions of paragraphs (h)(3) through (6) of this 
section.
    (8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from (or

[[Page 522]]

send material to) a process unit, the owner or operator shall reevaluate 
the applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel according to the 
procedures in paragraphs (h)(3) through (7) of this section.
    (i) Applicability of other subparts to this subpart. Paragraphs 
(i)(1) through (5) describe the applicability of other subparts to this 
subpart.
    (1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage 
vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart 
that is also subject to and complying with the provisions of 40 CFR part 
60, subpart Kb, shall continue to comply with 40 CFR part 60, subpart 
Kb. After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage 
vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart 
that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, 
but the owner or operator has not been required to apply controls as 
part of complying with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, is required to comply 
only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates 
specified in this section, said storage vessel shall no longer be 
subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb.
    (2) Affected sources subject to this subpart that are also subject 
to the provisions of subpart Q of this part shall comply with both 
subparts.
    (3) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an 
affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the 
provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, or the provisions of subpart H 
of this part, is required to comply only with the provisions of this 
subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said 
source shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, or 
subpart H of this part, as appropriate.
    (4) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, 
if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a 
standard identified in paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, 
compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in 
paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance 
with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat 
exchange system.
    (i) Subpart F of this part.
    (ii) A subpart of this part that requires compliance with Sec. 
63.104 (e.g., subpart U of this part).
    (5) After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, if any 
combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to this 
subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, or CC, or is subject 
to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 265, 
subparts AA, BB, or CC, and the owner or operator complies with the 
periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, 
or CC, that would apply to the device if the facility had final-
permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with 
the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this 
subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this 
paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart. If the owner 
or operator elects to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, the owner or 
operator shall report all information required by Sec. 63.1417(f), 
Periodic Reports, as part of complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 
parts 264 and/or 265.
    (j) Applicability of General Provisions. Table 1 of this subpart 
specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply and do not 
apply to owners and operators of affected sources subject to this 
subpart.
    (k) Applicability of this subpart during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation. Paragraphs (k)(1) through (4) 
of this section shall be followed during periods of start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or non-operation of the affected source or any part 
thereof.
    (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the 
emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or 
specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to

[[Page 523]]

which this subpart applies. The emission limitations of this subpart and 
the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall not apply 
during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction. However, if a 
start-up, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation of one 
portion of an affected source does not affect the ability of a 
particular emission point to comply with the emission limitations to 
which it is subject, then that emission point shall still be required to 
comply with the applicable emission limitations of this subpart during 
the start-up, shutdown, malfunction, or period of non-operation. For 
example, if there is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage 
vessel that is part of the affected source would still be required to be 
controlled in accordance with Sec. 63.1404.
    (2) The emission limitations set forth in 40 CFR part 63, subpart 
UU, as referred to in Sec. 63.1410, shall apply at all times except 
during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific 
portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized 
resulting in cessation of the emissions to which Sec. 63.1410 applies, 
or during periods of start-up, shutdown, malfuncton, or process unit 
shutdown.
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction; or during times when 
emissions are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown 
would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items 
of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if the item of equipment is 
malfunctioning. This paragraph also does not apply if the owner or 
operator shuts down the compliance equipment (other than monitoring 
systems) to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction of the affected source or portion thereof. If the owner or 
operator has reason to believe that monitoring equipment would be 
damaged due to a contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of 
the affected source or portion thereof, the owner or operator shall 
provide documentation supporting such a claim in the Precompliance 
Report as provided in Sec. 63.1417(d)(9) or in a supplement to the 
Precompliance Report. Once approved by the Administrator in accordance 
with Sec. 63.1417(d)(9), the provision for ceasing to collect, during a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would otherwise 
be required by the provisions of this subpart shall be incorporated into 
the start-up, shutdown, malfunction plan for the affected source, as 
stated in paragraph (k) of this section.
    (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (k)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``excess emissions'' means emissions in excess of those that would 
have occurred if there were no start-up, shutdown, or malfunction and 
the owner or operator complied with the relevant provisions of this 
subpart. The measures to be taken shall be identified in the applicable 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan, and may include, but are not 
limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, 
work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the 
manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are 
not required, but may be used if available.

Sec. 63.1401  Compliance schedule.

    (a) New affected sources that commence construction or 
reconstruction after December 14, 1998, shall be in compliance with this 
subpart upon initial start-up or January 20, 2000, whichever is later.
    (b) Existing affected sources shall be in compliance with this 
subpart no later than 3 years after January 20, 2000.
    (c) If an affected source using the exemption provided in Sec. 
63.1400(f) has an actual annual production of amino/phenolic resins 
exceeding 800 Mg/yr for any 12-month period, the owner or operator shall 
comply with the provisions of Sec. 63.1410 for the affected source 
within 3

[[Page 524]]

years. The starting point for the 3-year compliance time period shall be 
the end of the 12-month period in which actual annual production for 
amino/phenolic resins exceeds 800 Mg/yr.
    (d) Pursuant to section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act, an owner 
or operator may request an extension allowing the existing affected 
source up to 1 additional year to comply with section 112(d) standards. 
For purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall be 
submitted to the permitting authority as part of the operating permit 
application or to the Administrator as a separate submittal or as part 
of the Precompliance Report.
    (1) Requests for extensions shall be submitted no later than 120 
days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section and shall include the data described in Sec. 
63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D). The dates specified in Sec. 63.6(i) for 
submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply to this subpart.
    (2) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request 
less than 120 days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section provided that the need for the compliance 
extension arose after that date, and the need arose due to circumstances 
beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request shall 
include, in addition to the information specified in Sec. 
63.6(i)(6)(i)(A), (B), and (D), a statement of the reasons additional 
time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first learned of 
the circumstances necessitating a request for compliance extension.
    (e) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for 
completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), 
unless specified otherwise, refer to the standard calendar periods.
    (1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for 
completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as 
specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the 
compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the 
standard calendar period). For each time period that is changed by 
agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is 
changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.
    (2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar 
period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the 
period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified 
in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate:
    (i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard 
calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there 
remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 
2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for 
tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for 
tasks that must be performed annually; or
    (ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end 
of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which 
the initial compliance deadline occurs.
    (3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires 
completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an 
owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the 
specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable 
interval after completion of the task during the previous period.

or WW and in this section, it shall have the meaning given in this 
section for purposes of this subpart.
    Aggregate batch vent stream means a process vent containing 
emissions from at least one reactor batch process vent and at least one 
additional reactor or non-reactor batch process vent where the emissions 
are ducted, hardpiped, or otherwise connected together for a continuous 
flow.
    Amino resin means a thermoset resin produced through the reaction of 
formaldehyde, or a formaldehyde containing solution (e.g., aqueous 
formaldehyde), with compound(s) that contain the amino group; these 
compounds include melamine, urea, and urea derivatives. Formaldehyde 
substitutes are exclusively aldehydes.
    Amino/phenolic resin means one or both of the following:
    (1) Amino resin; or
    (2) Phenolic resin.
    Amino/phenolic resin. Process unit (APPU) means a collection of 
equipment assembled and connected by hardpiping or ductwork used to 
process raw materials and to manufacture an amino/phenolic resin as its 
primary product. This collection of equipment includes unit operations; 
process vents; storage vessels, as determined in Sec. 63.1400(h); and 
the equipment that is subject to the equipment leak provisions as 
specified in Sec. 63.1410. Utilities, lines and equipment not 
containing process fluids, and other non-process lines, such as heating 
and cooling systems which do not combine their materials with those in 
the processes they serve, are not part of the amino/phenolic resin 
process unit. An amino/phenolic resin process unit consists of more than 
one unit operation.
    Batch cycle means the operational step or steps, from start to 
finish, that occur as part of a batch unit operation.
    Batch emission episode means a discrete emission venting episode 
associated with a single batch unit operation. Multiple batch emission 
episodes may occur from a single batch unit operation.
    Batch mode means the discontinuous bulk movement of material through 
a unit operation. Mass, temperature, concentration, and other properties 
may vary with time. For a unit operation operated in a batch mode (i.e., 
batch unit operation), the addition of material and withdrawal of 
material do not typically occur simultaneously.

[[Page 526]]

    Batch process vent means a process vent from a batch unit operation 
within an affected source. Batch process vents are either reactor batch 
process vents or non-reactor batch process vents.
    Batch unit operation means a unit operation operated in a batch 
mode.
    Block means the time period that comprises a single batch cycle.
    Combustion device burner means a device designed to mix and ignite 
fuel and air to provide a flame to heat and oxidize waste organic vapors 
in a combustion device.
    Continuous mode means the continuous movement of material through a 
unit operation. Mass, temperature, concentration, and other properties 
typically approach steady-state conditions. For a unit operation 
operated in a continuous mode (i.e., continuous unit operation), the 
simultaneous addition of raw material and withdrawal of product is 
typical.
    Continuous process vent means a process vent from a continuous unit 
operation within an affected source. Process vents that are serving as 
control devices are not subject to additional control requirements.
    Continuous record means documentation, either in hard copy or 
computer readable form, of data values measured at least once every 15 
minutes and recorded at the frequency specified in Sec. 63.1416(c) or 
(h).
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device that either 
records an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes or 
records 1 hour or more frequent block average values.
    Continuous unit operation means a unit operation operated in a 
continuous mode.
    Control device means any combustion device, recovery device, or 
recapture device. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, 
absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, incinerators, flares, boilers, 
and process heaters. For continuous process vents, recapture devices are 
considered control devices but recovery devices are not considered 
control devices. Condensers operating as process condensers are not 
considered control devices. For a condenser that sometimes operates as a 
process condenser to be considered a control device, it shall not be 
operating as a process condenser for a given batch emission episode, and 
it shall recycle of the recovered material within the process.
    Control technology means any process modification or use of 
equipment that reduces organic HAP emissions. Examples include, but are 
not limited to, product reformulation to reduce solvent content and/or 
use, batch cycle time reduction to reduce the duration of emissions, 
reduction of nitrogen purge rate, and the lowering of process condenser 
coolant temperatures.
    Controlled organic HAP emissions means the quantity of organic HAP 
discharged to the atmosphere from a control device.
    Emission point means an individual continuous process vent, batch 
process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, storage vessel, equipment 
leak, or heat exchange system.
    Equipment means , for the purposes of the provisions in Sec. 
63.1410, each pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, 
sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, 
and instrumentation system in organic HAP service; and any control 
devices or systems required by Sec. 63.1410. For purposes of this 
subpart, surge control vessels and bottom receivers are not equipment 
for purposes of regulating equipment leak emissions. Surge control 
vessels and bottoms receivers are regulated as non-reactor batch process 
vents for the purposes of this subpart.
    Equipment leak means emissions of organic HAP from a pump, 
compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection 
system, open-ended valve or line, valve, or instrumentation system that 
either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 5 
percent by weight of total organic HAP.
    Existing process unit means any process unit that is not a new 
process unit.
    Flexible operations process unit means a process unit that 
periodically manufactures different chemical products, polymers, or 
resins by alternating raw materials or operating conditions. These units 
are also referred to as campaign plants or blocked operations.

[[Page 527]]

    Heat exchange system means any cooling tower system or once-through 
cooling water system (e.g., river or pond water) designed and intended 
to operate to not allow contact between the cooling medium and process 
fluid or gases (i.e., a noncontact system). A heat exchange system may 
include more than one heat exchanger and may include recirculating or 
once-through cooling systems.
    Highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe of the product 
with the highest total mass of organic HAP charged to the reactor during 
the production of a single batch of product.
    Initial start-up means the first time a new or reconstructed 
affected source begins production, or, for equipment added or changed, 
the first time the equipment is put into operation. Initial start-up 
does not include operation solely for testing equipment. Initial start-
up does not include subsequent start-ups of an affected source or 
portion thereof following malfunctions or shutdowns, or following 
changes in product for flexible operation process units, or following 
recharging of equipment in batch operation. Further, for purposes of 
Sec. Sec. 63.1401 and 63.1410, initial start-up does not include 
subsequent start-ups of affected sources or portions thereof following 
malfunctions or process unit shutdowns.
    Inprocess recycling means a recycling operation in which recovered 
material is used by a unit operation within the same affected source. It 
is not necessary for recovered material to be used by the unit operation 
from which they were recovered.
    Maintenance wastewater means wastewater generated by the draining of 
process fluid from components in the APPU into an individual drain 
system prior to or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater 
can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during 
periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can 
generate maintenance wastewaters include descaling of heat exchanger 
tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, draining of low 
legs and high point bleeds, draining of pumps into an individual drain 
system, and draining of portions of the APPU for repair. The generation 
of wastewater from the routine rinsing or washing of equipment in batch 
operation between batches is not maintenance wastewater for the purposes 
of this subpart.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment or process 
equipment, or failure of a process to operate in a normal or usual 
manner, or opening of a safety device which causes, or has the potential 
to cause, the emission limitations in an applicable standard to be 
exceeded. Failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or 
careless operation are not malfunctions.
    Maximum representative operating conditions means, for purposes of 
testing or measurements required by Sec. 63.1413, those conditions 
which reflect the highest organic HAP emissions reasonably expected to 
be vented to the control device or emitted to the atmosphere. For 
affected sources that produce the same product(s) using multiple 
recipes, the production of the highest-HAP recipe is reflective of 
maximum representative operating conditions.
    Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure 
exerted by the total organic HAP in the stored liquid at the temperature 
equal to the highest calendar-month average of the liquid storage 
temperature for liquids stored above or below the ambient temperature, 
or at the local maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the 
National Weather Service for liquids stored at the ambient temperature, 
as determined:
    (1) In accordance with methods described in American Petroleum 
Institute Publication 2517, Evaporative Loss From External Floating-Roof 
Tanks (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14); or
    (2) As obtained from standard reference texts; or
    (3) As determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials 
Method D2879-83 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14); 
or
    (4) Any other method approved by the Administrator.

[[Page 528]]

vapor contains more than one compound.
    Net heating value means the difference between the heat value of the 
recovered chemical stream and the minimum heat value required to ensure 
a stable flame in the combustion device. This difference must have a 
positive value when used in the context of ``recovering chemicals for 
fuel value'' (e.g., in the definition of ``recovery device'' in this 
section).
    New process unit means a process unit for which the construction or 
reconstruction commenced after December 14, 1998.

maintained by this subpart or required by another subpart referenced by 
this subpart, records are stored at a location within a major source 
which encompasses the affected source. On-site includes, but is not 
limited to, storage at the affected source or APPU to which the records 
pertain, or storage in central files elsewhere at the major source.
    Operating day means the period defined by the owner or operator in 
the Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec. 63.1417(e). The 
operating day is the period for which daily average monitoring values 
and batch cycle daily average monitoring values are determined.
    Organic hazardous air pollutant(s) (organic HAP) means one or more 
of the chemicals listed in Table 2 of this subpart or any other chemical

material as an integral part of a unit operation(s). A process condenser 
shall support a vapor-to-liquid phase change for periods of equipment 
operation that are at or above the boiling or bubble point of 
substance(s) at the liquid surface. Examples of process condensers 
include distillation condensers, reflux condensers, and condensers used 
in stripping or flashing operations. In a series of condensers, all 
condensers up to and including the first condenser with an exit gas 
temperature below the boiling or bubble point of the substance(s) at the 
liquid surface are considered to be process condensers. All condensers 
in line prior to a vacuum source are considered process condensers when 
the vacuum source is being operated. A condenser may be a process 
condenser for some batch emission episodes and, when meeting certain 
conditions, may be a control device for other batch emission episodes.
    Process unit means a collection of equipment assembled and connected 
by hardpiping or ductwork used to process raw materials and to 
manufacture a product.
    Process vent means a gaseous emission stream from a unit operation 
where the gaseous emission stream is discharged to the atmosphere either 
directly or after passing through one or more control, recovery, or 
recapture devices. Unit operations that may have process vents are 
condensers, distillation units, reactors, or other unit operations 
within the APPU. Emission streams that are undiluted and uncontrolled 
containing less than 50 parts per million volume (ppmv) organic HAP, as 
determined through process knowledge that no organic HAP are present in 
the emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in 
Sec. 63.1414(d)(6); test data using the

[[Page 529]]

test methods specified in Sec. 63.1414(a); or any other test method 
that has been validated according to the procedures in Method 301 of 
appendix A of this part are not considered process vents. Process vents 
exclude relief valve discharges, gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas 
system(s), and leaks from equipment regulated under Sec. 63.1410. 
Process vents that are serving as control devices are not subject to 
additional control requirements.
    Product means a resin, produced using the same monomers and varying 
in additives (e.g., initiators, terminators, etc.), catalysts, or in the 
relative proportions of monomers, that is manufactured by a process 
unit. With respect to resins, more than one recipe may be used to 
produce the same product. Product also means a chemical that is not a 
resin that is manufactured by a process unit. By-products, isolated 
intermediates, impurities, wastes, and trace contaminants are not 
considered products.
    Reactor batch process vent means a batch process vent originating 
from a reactor.
    Recapture device means an individual unit of equipment capable of 
and used for the purpose of recovering chemicals, but not normally for 
use, reuse, or sale. For example, a recapture device may recover 
chemicals primarily for disposal. Recapture devices include, but are not 
limited to, absorbers, carbon adsorbers, and condensers.
    Recipe means a specific composition from among the range of possible 
compositions that may occur within a product, as defined in this 
section. A recipe is determined by the proportions of monomers and, if 
present, other reactants and additives that are used to make the recipe. 
For example, a methylated amino resin and a non-methylated amino resin 
are both different recipes of the same product, amino resin.
    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment capable of and 
normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, 
fuel value (i.e., net heating value); or for sale for use, reuse, or 
fuel value (i.e., net heating value). Examples of equipment that may be 
recovery devices include absorbers, carbon adsorbers, condensers, oil-
water separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices 
such as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. For the 
purposes of the monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements of 
this subpart, recapture devices are considered recovery devices.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent 
deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting 
gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine 
venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover 
such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this 
vapor headspace in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature 
fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position 
during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or 
another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting 
applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the 
owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable 
regulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering 
codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of 
flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
    Shutdown means for purposes including, but not limited to, periodic 
maintenance, replacement of equipment, or repair, the cessation of 
operation of an affected source, an APPU(s) within an affected source, 
or equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, or the 
emptying or degassing of a storage vessel. For purposes of the batch 
process vent provisions in Sec. Sec. 63.1406 through 63.1408, the 
cessation of equipment in batch operations is not a shutdown, unless the 
equipment undergoes maintenance, is replaced, or is repaired.
    Solvent-based resin means an amino/phenolic resin that consumes a 
solvent (i.e., methanol, xylene) as a reactant in the resin producing 
reaction. The use

[[Page 530]]

of a solvent as a carrier (i.e., adding methanol to the product/water 
solution after the reaction is complete) does not meet this definition.
    Start-up means the setting into operation of an affected source, an 
APPU(s) within an affected source, a unit operation within an affected 
source, or equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, or a 
storage vessel after emptying and degassing. For both continuous and 
batch unit operations, start-up includes initial start-up and operation 
solely for testing equipment. For both continuous and batch unit 
operations, start-up does not include the recharging of equipment in 
batch operation. For continuous unit operations, start-up includes 
transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible operation 
process units. For batch unit operations, start-up does not include 
transitional conditions due to changes in product for flexible operation 
process units.
    Steady-state conditions means that all variables (temperatures, 
pressures, volumes, flow rates, etc.) in a process do not vary 
significantly with time; minor fluctuations about constant mean values 
may occur.
    Storage vessel means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
liquids that contain one or more organic HAP. Storage vessels do not 
include:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels with capacities smaller than 38 cubic meters;
    (4) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that 
contains no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only;
    (5) Wastewater storage tanks;
    (6) Surge control vessels or bottoms receivers; and
    (7) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling amino/phenolic 
resin.
    Supplemental combustion air means the air that is added to a vent 
stream after the vent stream leaves the unit operation. Air that is part 
of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is 
not considered supplemental combustion air. Air required to operate 
combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental combustion 
air.
    Uncontrolled organic HAP emissions means the organic HAP emitted 
from a unit operation prior to introduction of the emission stream into 
a control device. Uncontrolled HAP emissions are determined after any 
condenser that is operating as a process condenser. If an emission 
stream is not routed to a control device, uncontrolled organic HAP 
emissions are those organic HAP emissions released to the atmosphere.
    Vent stream, as used in reference to batch process vents, aggregate 
batch vent streams, continuous process vents, and storage vessels, means 
the emissions from that emission point.
    Waste management unit means the equipment, structure(s), and/or 
device(s) used to convey, store, treat, or dispose of wastewater streams 
or residuals. Examples of waste management units include: wastewater 
tanks, surface impoundments, individual drain systems, and biological 
wastewater treatment units. Examples of equipment that may be waste 
management units include containers, air flotation units, oil-water 
separators or organic-water separators, or organic removal devices such 
as decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. If such 
equipment is used for recovery, then it is part of an APPU and is not a 
waste management unit.
    Wastewater is either a process wastewater or maintenance wastewater 
and means water that:
    (1) Contains either:
    (i) An annual average concentration of organic HAP, as indicated on 
Table 2 of this subpart, of at least 5 parts per million by weight and 
has an annual average flow rate of 0.02 liter per minute or greater; or

Table 2 of this subpart, of at least 10,000 parts per million by weight 
at any flow rate.
    (2) Is discarded from an APPU that is part of an affected source.
    (3) Does not include:

alternative to complying with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, 
an owner or operator may comply with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator of an aggregate batch vent stream located 
at a new affected source shall:
    (i) Vent all emissions of organic HAP to a flare; or
    (ii) Reduce organic HAP emissions by 95 weight percent or to a 
concentration of 20 ppmv when using a combustion control device or to a 
concentration of 50 ppmv when using a non-combustion control device, 
whichever is less stringent, on a continuous basis.
    (2) The owner or operator of an aggregate batch vent stream located 
at an existing affected source shall:
    (i) Vent all emissions of organic HAP to a flare; or
    (ii) Reduce organic HAP emissions by 83 weight percent or to a

Sec. 63.1409  Heat exchange system provisions.

    (a) Unless one or more of the conditions specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (6) of this section are met, owners and operators of 
sources subject to this subpart shall monitor each heat exchange system 
used to cool process equipment in an affected source, according to the 
provisions in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. Whenever a 
leak is detected, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.

[[Page 536]]

    (1) The heat exchange system is operated with the minimum pressure 
on the cooling water side at least 35 kilopascals greater than the 
maximum pressure on the process side.
    (2) There is an intervening cooling fluid, containing less than 5 
percent by weight of total HAP listed in column A of Table 2 of this 
subpart, between the process and the cooling water. This intervening 
fluid serves to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid, and 
the intervening fluid is not sent through a cooling tower or discharged. 
For purposes of this section, discharge does not include emptying for 
maintenance purposes.
    (3) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to a National 
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit with an allowable 
discharge limit of 1 part per million or less above influent 
concentration or 10 percent or less above influent concentration, 
whichever is greater.
    (4) The once-through heat exchange system is subject to an NPDES 
permit that:
    (i) Requires monitoring of a parameter(s) or condition(s) to detect 
a leak of process fluids into cooling water;
    (ii) Specifies or includes the normal range of the parameter or 
condition;
    (iii) Requires monitoring for the parameters selected as leak 
indicators no less frequently than monthly for the first 6 months and 
quarterly thereafter; and
    (iv) Requires the owner or operator to report and correct leaks to 
the cooling water when the parameter or condition exceeds the normal 
range.
    (5) The recirculating heat exchange system is used to cool process 
fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in 
column A of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (6) The once-through heat exchange system is used to cool process 
fluids that contain less than 5 percent by weight of total HAP listed in 
column B of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (b) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring the cooling water for the 
presence of one or more organic HAP or other representative substances 
whose presence in cooling water indicate a leak shall comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section. 
The cooling water shall be monitored for total HAP, total volatile 
organic compounds, total organic carbon, one or more speciated HAP 
compounds, or other representative substances that would indicate the 
presence of a leak in the heat exchange system.
    (1) The cooling water shall be monitored monthly for the first 6 
months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
    (2)(i) For recirculating heat exchange systems (cooling tower 
systems), the monitoring of speciated HAP or total HAP refers to the HAP 
listed in column A of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (ii) For once-through heat exchange systems, the monitoring of 
speciated HAP or total HAP refers to the HAP listed in column B of Table 
2 of this subpart.
    (3) The concentration of the monitored substance(s) in the cooling 
water shall be determined using any EPA-approved method listed in part 
136 of this chapter, as long as the method is sensitive to 
concentrations as low as 10 parts per million and the same method is 
used for both entrance and exit samples. Alternative methods may be used 
upon approval by the Administrator.
    (4) The samples shall be collected either at the entrance and exit 
of each heat exchange system or at locations where the cooling water 
enters and exits each heat exchanger or any combination of heat 
exchangers.
    (i) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of recirculating heat 
exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water 
leaves the cooling tower prior to being returned to the process 
equipment, and the exit is the point at which the cooling water is 
introduced to the cooling tower after being used to cool the process 
fluid.
    (ii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of once-through heat 
exchange systems, the entrance is the point at which the cooling water 
enters, and the exit is the point at which the cooling water exits the 
plant site or chemical manufacturing process units.
    (iii) For samples taken at the entrance and exit of each heat 
exchanger

[[Page 537]]

or any combination of heat exchangers, the entrance is the point at 
which the cooling water enters the individual heat exchanger or group of 
heat exchangers, and the exit is the point at which the cooling water 
exits the heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers.
    (5) A minimum of three sets of samples shall be taken at each 
entrance and exit as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The 
average entrance and exit concentrations shall then be calculated. The 
concentration shall be corrected for the addition of any makeup water or 
for any evaporative losses, as applicable.
    (6) A leak is detected if the exit mean concentration is found to be 
greater than the entrance mean concentration using a one-sided 
statistical procedure at the 0.05 level of significance, and the amount 
by which it is greater is at least 1 part per million or 10 percent of 
the entrance mean, whichever is greater.
    (c) The owner or operator who elects to comply with the requirement 
of paragraph (a) of this section by monitoring using a surrogate 
indicator of heat exchange system leaks shall comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. 
Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable 
monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, 
conductivity or other representative indicators.
    (1) The owner or operator shall prepare and implement a monitoring 
plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of 
process fluids into cooling water. The plan shall require monitoring of 
one or more surrogate indicators or monitoring of one or more process 
parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. Monitoring that is 
already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the 
requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) A description of the parameter or condition to be monitored and 
an explanation of how the selected parameter or condition will reliably 
indicate the presence of a leak.
    (ii) The parameter level(s) or conditions(s) that constitute a leak. 
This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the 
selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The 
monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of 
parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the 
selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, a leak is 
indicated.
    (iii) The monitoring frequency which shall be no less frequent than 
monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.
    (iv) The records that will be maintained to document compliance with 
the requirements of this section.
    (2) If a substantial leak is identified by methods other than those 
described in the monitoring plan and the method(s) specified in the plan 
could not detect the leak, the owner or operator shall revise the plan 
and document the basis for the changes. The owner or operator shall 
complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after 
discovery of the leak.
    (3) The owner or operator shall maintain, at all times, the 
monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be 
maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. If the monitoring plan is superseded, the owner or operator 
shall retain the most recent superseded plan at least until 5 years from 
the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site 
(or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that 
provides access within 2 hours after a request) for at least 6 months 
after its creation.
    (d) If a leak is detected according to the criteria of paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, except as 
provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (1) The leak shall be repaired as soon as practical but not later 
than 45 calendar days after the owner or operator receives results of 
monitoring tests indicating a leak. The leak shall be repaired unless 
the owner or operator demonstrates that the results are due to a 
condition other than a leak.

[[Page 538]]

    (2) Once the leak has been repaired, the owner or operator shall 
confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired within 7 
calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later.
    (e) Delay of repair of heat exchange systems for which leaks have 
been detected is allowed if the equipment is isolated from the process. 
Delay of repair is also allowed if repair is technically infeasible 
without a shutdown and any one of the conditions in paragraph (e)(1) or 
(2) of this section are met. All time periods in paragraphs (e)(1) and 
(2) of this section shall be determined from the date when the owner or 
operator determines that delay of repair is necessary.
    (1) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months, a special 
shutdown before that planned shutdown is not required.
    (2) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months, the 
owner or operator may delay repair as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or 
(ii) of this section. Documentation of a decision to delay repair shall 
state the reasons repair was delayed and shall specify a schedule for 
completing the repair as soon as practical.
    (i) If a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the 
potential emissions from delaying repair, the owner or operator may 
delay repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated 
with the leaking heat exchanger. The owner or operator shall document 
the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause 
greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delaying 
repair as specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) The owner or operator shall calculate the potential emissions 
from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of 
total HAP listed in column A of Table 2 of this subpart in the cooling 
water from the leaking heat exchanger by the flowrate of the cooling 
water from the leaking heat exchanger by the expected duration of the 
delay. The owner or operator may calculate potential emissions using 
total organic carbon concentration instead of total HAP listed in column 
A of Table 2 of this subpart.
    (B) The owner or operator shall determine emissions from purging and 
depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled 
shutdown for the repair.
    (ii) If repair is delayed for reasons other than those specified in 
paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may delay 
repair up to a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner shall demonstrate 
that the necessary parts or personnel were not available.

    The owner or operator of each affected source shall comply with the 
requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart UU (national emission standards 
for equipment leaks (control level 2)) for all equipment, as defined 
under Sec. 63.1402, that contains or contacts 5 weight-percent HAP or 
greater and operates 300 hours per year or more. The weight-percent HAP 
is determined for equipment using the organic HAP concentration 
measurement methods specified in Sec. 63.1414(a). When complying with 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS, as referred to by 40 CFR 
part 63, subpart UU, the following apply for purposes of this subpart:
    (a) Design evaluations are allowed for control devices that control 
emission points with total emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP 
per year before control (i.e., small control devices).
    (b) When 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS refers to specific test methods 
for the measurement of organic HAP concentration, the test methods 
presented in Sec. 63.1414(a) shall be used.
    (c) The option to measure TOC instead of organic HAP, as a basis for 
demonstrating compliance, is not allowed.
    (d) Excused excursions are not allowed.
    (e) The provisions in Sec. 63.1403(b), rather than the provisions 
in Sec. 63.982(f), are to be followed for combined vent streams.
    (f) When a scrubber is used as a control device, the owner or 
operator shall follow the guidance provided in this subpart for design 
evaluations or performance tests, as appropriate, and for monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting.

[[Page 539]]

    (g) When there are conflicts between the due dates for reports 
presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this subpart, reports shall 
be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.
    (h) When there are conflicts between the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements presented in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and this subpart, 
the owner or operator shall either follow both sets of requirements 
(i.e., follow the requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS for 
emission points covered by 40 CFR part 63, subpart SS and follow the 
requirements of this subpart for emission points covered by this 
subpart) or shall follow the set of requirements they prefer. If an 
owner or operator chooses to follow just one set of requirements, the 
owner or operator shall identify which set of requirements are being 
followed and which set of requirements are being disregarded in the 
appropriate report.

Sec. 63.1413  Compliance demonstration procedures.

    (a) General. For each emission point, the owner or operator shall 
meet three stages of compliance, with exceptions specified in this 
subpart. First, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test 
or design evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the control 
device or control technology being used. Second, the owner or operator 
shall meet the requirements for demonstrating initial compliance (e.g., 
a demonstration that the required percent reduction is achieved). Third, 
the owner or operator shall meet the requirements for demonstrating 
continuous compliance through some form of monitoring (e.g., continuous 
monitoring of operating parameters).
    (1) Large control devices and small control devices. A large control 
device is a control device that controls emission points with total 
emissions of 10 tons of organic HAP per year or more before control. A 
small control device is a control device that controls emission points 
with total emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP per year before 
control.
    (i) Large control devices. Owners or operators are required to 
conduct a performance test for a large control device. The establishment 
of parameter monitoring levels shall be based on data obtained during 
the required performance test.
    (ii) Small control devices. Owners or operators are required to 
conduct a design evaluation for a small control device. An owner or 
operator may choose to conduct a performance test for a small control 
device and such a performance test shall follow the procedures specified 
in this section, as appropriate. Whenever a small control device becomes 
a large control device, the owner or operator shall conduct a 
performance test following the procedures specified in this section, as 
appropriate. Notification that such a performance test is required, the 
site-specific test plan, and the results of the performance test shall 
be provided to the Administrator as specified in Sec. 63.1417. Except 
as provided in Sec. 63.1415(a)(2), the parameter monitoring levels for 
small control devices shall be set based on the design evaluation 
required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Further, when setting the 
parameter monitoring level(s) based on the design evaluation, the owner 
or operator shall submit the information specified in Sec. 
63.1417(d)(7) for review and approval as part of the Precompliance 
Report.

[[Page 542]]

    (2) Performance tests. Performance testing shall be conducted in 
accordance with the General Provisions at Sec. 63.7(a)(1), (a)(3), (d), 
(e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(4), (g), and (h), with the exceptions specified in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Data shall be reduced in accordance 
with the EPA approved methods specified in this subpart or, if other 
test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according 
to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of this part.
    (i) Additional control devices not requiring performance tests. An 
owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test when 
using one of the following control devices:
    (A) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 
44 megawatts or greater.
    (B) A boiler or process heater into which the vent stream is 
introduced with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.
    (C) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the 
owner or operator:
    (1) Has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and 
complies with the requirements of 40 CFR part 266, subpart H; or
    (2) Has certified compliance with the interim status requirements of 
40 CFR part 266, subpart H.
    (D) A hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator 
has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 and complies with 
the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or has certified 
compliance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, 
subpart O.
    (E) A control device for which a performance test was already 
conducted for determining compliance with another regulation promulgated 
by the EPA, provided the test was conducted using the same Methods 
specified in this section, and either no deliberate process changes have 
been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that 
the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, 
reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. Parameter 
monitoring levels established based on such a performance test may be 
used for purposes of demonstrating continuous compliance with this 
subpart.
    (ii) Exceptions to performance test requirements in the General 
Provisions. (A) Performance tests shall be conducted at maximum 
representative operating conditions achievable during either the 6-month 
period ending 2 months before the Notification of Compliance Status 
required by Sec. 63.1417(e) is due, or during the 6-month period 
surrounding the date of the performance test (i.e., the period beginning 
3 months prior to the performance test and ending 3 months after the 
performance test). In achieving maximum representative operating 
conditions, an owner or operator is not required to cause damage to 
equipment, make a product that does not meet an existing specification 
for sale to a customer, or make a product in excess of demand.
    (B) When Sec. 63.7(g) references the Notification of Compliance 
Status requirements in Sec. 63.9(h), the requirements in Sec. 
63.1417(e) shall apply for purposes of this subpart.
    (C) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days 
after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for 
the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status), 
rather than according to the time periods in Sec. 63.7(a)(2).
    (3) Design evaluations. To demonstrate the organic HAP removal 
efficiency for a control device or control technology, a design 
evaluation shall address the composition and organic HAP concentration 
of the vent stream(s) entering the control device or control technology, 
the operating parameters of the control device or control technology, 
and other conditions or parameters that reflect the performance of the 
control device or control technology. A design evaluation also shall 
address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating 
parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vi) 
of this section, depending on the type of control device that is used. 
If the vent stream(s) is not the only inlet to the control device, the 
efficiency demonstration also shall consider all other vapors, gases, 
and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.

stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish 
the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design 
average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design 
average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and 
outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser shall be 
measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.
    (iii) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite in the control device, such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the 
design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative 
humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent 
stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, 
number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream 
mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed 
regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, 
design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon. 
For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included.
    (iv) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device, such as a carbon 
canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream mass or 
volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall 
establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration 
level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated 
carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based 
on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source 
operating schedule.
    (v) For an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time 
of 0.5 seconds and a minimum temperature of 760 C, the design evaluation 
shall document that these conditions exist.
    (vi) For a combustion control device that does not satisfy the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section, the design evaluation 
shall address the following characteristics, depending on the type of 
control device:
    (A) For a thermal vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall 
consider the autoignition temperature of the organic HAP, shall consider 
the vent stream flow rate, and shall establish the design minimum and 
average temperature in the combustion zone and the combustion zone 
residence time.
    (B) For a catalytic vapor incinerator, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate and shall establish the design 
minimum and average temperatures across the catalyst bed inlet and 
outlet.
    (C) For a boiler or process heater, the design evaluation shall 
consider the vent stream flow rate, shall establish the design minimum 
and average flame zone temperatures and combustion zone residence time, 
and shall describe the method and location where the vent stream is 
introduced into the flame zone.
    (4) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or 
operator of a control device that has one or more parameter monitoring 
level requirements specified under this subpart, or specified under 
subparts referenced by this subpart, shall establish a maximum or 
minimum level, as denoted on Table 4 of this subpart, for each measured 
parameter using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) or (ii) 
of this section. Except as otherwise provided in

[[Page 544]]

this subpart, the owner or operator shall operate control devices such 
that the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average of 
monitored parameters, established as specified in this paragraph, 
remains above the minimum level or below the maximum level, as 
appropriate.
    (i) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests--(A) Emission points other than batch process vents. 
During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be 
continuously monitored during the required 1-hour test runs. The 
monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the average of the 
maximum (or minimum) point values from the three test runs. The average 
of the maximum values shall be used when establishing a maximum level, 
and the average of the minimum values shall be used when establishing a 
minimum level.
    (B) Aggregate batch vent streams. For aggregate batch vent streams 
the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
    (C) Batch process vents. The monitoring level(s) shall be 
established using the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(C)(1) 
or (2) of this section. For batch process vents complying with the 
percent reduction standards specified in Sec. 63.1406 or Sec. 63.1407, 
parameter monitoring levels shall be established by the design 
evaluation, or during the performance test so that the specified percent 
reduction from Sec. 63.1406 or Sec. 63.1407, as appropriate, is met.
    (1) If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion 
of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single 
level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:
    (i) During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter 
shall be monitored continuously and recorded once every 15 minutes at 
all times when batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected to 
be controlled are vented to the control device. A minimum of three 
recorded values shall be obtained for each batch emission episode, or 
portion thereof, regardless of the length of time emissions are 
occurring.
    (ii) The average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for 
each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, in the batch cycle 
selected to be controlled. The average shall be based on all values 
measured during the required performance test.
    (iii) If the level to be established is a maximum operating 
parameter, the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average 
parameter values from each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, 
in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the batch 
emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the lowest 
parameter value in order to assure compliance; the average parameter 
value that is necessary to assure compliance for that batch emission 
episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all batch emission 
episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that are selected to 
be controlled).
    (iv) If the level to be established is a minimum operating 
parameter, the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average 
parameter values from each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, 
in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the batch 
emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the highest 
parameter value in order to assure compliance; the average parameter 
value that is necessary to assure compliance for that batch emission 
episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all batch emission 
episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that are selected to 
be controlled).
    (v) Alternatively, an average monitored parameter value shall be 
calculated for the entire batch cycle based on all values recorded 
during each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be 
controlled.
    (2) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch cycle, as 
described in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C)(1) of this section, an owner or 
operator may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, 
or portion thereof, selected to be controlled. Each level shall be 
determined as specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(C)(1)(i) through (v) of 
this section.

[[Page 545]]

    (3) The batch cycle shall be defined in the Notification of 
Compliance Status, as specified in Sec. 63.1417(e)(2). Said definition 
shall include an identification of each batch emission episode. The 
definition of batch cycle shall also include the information required to 
determine parameter monitoring compliance for partial batch cycles 
(i.e., when part of a batch cycle is accomplished during 2 different 
operating days) for those parameters averaged on a batch cycle daily 
average basis.
    (ii) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests, engineering assessments, and/or manufacturer's 
recommendations. Parameter monitoring levels may be established based on 
the parameter values measured during the performance test supplemented 
by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. 
Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire 
range of expected parameter values. When setting the parameter 
monitoring level(s) using the procedures specified in this paragraph, 
the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in Sec. 
63.1417(d)(7) for review and approval as part of the Precompliance 
Report.

[[Page 546]]

in Sec. 63.1408(b)(2) shall be demonstrated following the procedures in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (e) Initial and continuous compliance for batch process vents--(1) 
Compliance with percent reduction standards. Owners or operators opting 
to comply with the percent reduction standards specified in Sec. 
63.1406(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) or Sec. 63.1407(a)(2)(ii) and 
(a)(3)(ii) shall select portions of the batch process vent emissions 
(i.e., select batch emission episodes or portions of batch emission 
episodes) to be controlled such that the specified percent reduction is 
achieved for the batch cycle. Paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this 
section specify how the performance of a control device or control 
technology is to be determined. Paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section 
specifies how to demonstrate that the required percent emission 
reduction is achieved for the batch cycle.
    (i) Design evaluation. The design evaluation shall comply with the 
provisions in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The design evaluation 
shall include the value(s) and basis for the parameter monitoring 
level(s) required by Sec. 63.1415. The design evaluation shall 
determine either of the following:
    (A) Each batch emission episode. The control device efficiency for 
each batch emission episode that the owner or operator selects to 
control.
    (B) One or more representative batch emission episodes. The control 
device efficiency for one or more batch emission episodes provided that 
the owner or operator demonstrates that the control device achieves the 
same or higher efficiency for all other batch emission episodes that the 
owner or operator selects to control.
    (ii) Performance test. An owner or operator shall conduct 
performance tests following the procedures in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section, the procedures in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, 
or a combination of the two procedures. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section, a performance test is conducted for each batch emission 
episode selected for control. Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this 
section, an owner or operator groups together several batch emission 
episodes and conducts a single performance test for the batch emission 
episode that is the most challenging, in terms of achieving emission 
reductions, for the control device or control technology; thereby 
demonstrating that the achieved emission reduction for the tested batch 
emission episode is the minimum control device or control technology 
performance expected for each batch emission episode in the group. An 
owner or operator may use the concept provided by paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for several different groups of batch 
emission episodes.
    (A) Testing each batch emission episode. A performance test shall be 
performed for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, that the 
owner or operator selects to control. Performance tests shall be 
conducted using the testing procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(a) and 
(b) and the following procedures:
    (1) Only one test (i.e., only one run) is required for each batch 
emission episode selected by the owner or operator for control.
    (2) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A)(3) of this 
section, the performance test shall be conducted over the entire period 
of emissions selected by the owner or operator for control.
    (3) An owner or operator may choose to test only those periods of 
the batch emission episode during which the emission rate for the entire 
batch emission episode can be determined or during which the organic HAP 
emissions are greater than the average emission rate of the batch 
emission episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options 
shall develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate 
(kilogram per unit time) over the entire batch emission episode, based 
on either process knowledge or test data, to demonstrate that test 
periods are representative. Examples of information that could 
constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material 
balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to 
develop the emission profile provided the results are still relevant to 
the current batch process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be 
included in the site-specific test plan required by Sec. 63.1417(h)(2).

[[Page 547]]

    (4) When choosing sampling sites using the methods specified in 
Sec. 63.1414(a)(1), inlet sampling sites shall be located as specified 
in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)(A)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. Outlet 
sampling sites shall be located at the outlet of the control device 
prior to release to the atmosphere.
    (i) The control device inlet sampling site shall be located at the 
exit from the batch unit operation after any condensers operating as 
process condensers and before any control device.
    (ii) If a batch process vent is introduced with the combustion air 
or as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design 
capacity less than 44 megawatts, selection of the location of the inlet 
sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total organic HAP 
concentrations in all batch process vents and primary and secondary 
fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.
    (B) Testing only the most challenging batch emission episode. Under 
this paragraph, an owner or operator groups together several batch 
emission episodes and conducts a single performance test for the batch 
emission episode that is the most challenging, in terms of achieving 
emission reductions, for the control device or control technology; 
thereby demonstrating that the achieved emission reduction for the 
tested batch emission episode is the minimum control device or control 
technology performance expected for each batch emission episode in the 
group. The owner or operator shall use the control device efficiency 
determined from the performance test for all the other batch emission 
episodes in that group for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this 
section. Performance tests shall be conducted using the testing 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(a) and (b) and the following 
procedures:
    (1) The procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A)(2) through 
(4) of this section.
    (2) Develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate 
(kilogram/unit time) for each period of emissions to be addressed by the 
performance test. The emission profile shall be based on either process 
knowledge or test data. Examples of information that could constitute 
process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and 
process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to develop the 
emission profile provided the results are still relevant to the current 
batch process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be included in 
the site-specific test plan required by Sec. 63.1417(h)(2).
    (3) Provide rationale for why the control device efficiency for all 
the other batch emission episodes in the group will be greater than or 
equal to the control device efficiency achieved during the tested period 
of the most challenging batch emission episode in the group, as 
specified in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by 
Sec. 63.1417(e).
    (iii) Batch cycle percent reduction. The percent reduction for the 
batch cycle for an individual reactor batch process vent and the overall 
percent reduction for the collection of non-reactor batch process vents 
within the affected source shall be determined using Equation 1 of this 
section and the control device efficiencies specified in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(iii)(A) through (C) of this section. All information used to 
calculate the batch cycle percent reduction for an individual reactor 
batch process vent, including a definition of the batch cycle 
identifying all batch emission episodes, shall be recorded as specified 
in Sec. 63.1416 (d)(1)(ii). All information used to calculate the 
overall percent reduction for the collection of non-reactor batch 
process vents within the affected source, including a list of all batch 
emission episodes from the collection of non-reactor batch process vents 
within the affected source, shall be recorded as specified in Sec. 
63.1416 (d)(1)(ii). This information shall include identification of 
those batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected for 
control. This information shall include estimates of uncontrolled 
organic HAP emissions for those batch emission episodes, or portions 
thereof, that are not selected for control, determined as specified in 
paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(D) or (E) of this section.

the control device shall be determined following the procedures in Sec. 
63.1414(b)(4).
    (B) For combustion control devices listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) 
and (B) of this section and for flares, the control efficiency in 
Equation 1 of this section shall be 98 percent.
    (C) If a performance test is not required, the control efficiency 
shall be based on the design evaluation specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (D) For batch process vents estimated through engineering 
assessment, as described in Sec. 63.1414(f)(6), to emit less than 10 
tons per year of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, the owner or 
operator may use in Equation 1 of this section the emissions determined 
using engineering assessment or may determine organic HAP emissions 
using any of the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(d).
    (E) For batch process vents estimated through engineering 
assessment, as described in Sec. 63.1414(d)(6), to emit 10 tons per 
year or greater of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, organic HAP 
emissions shall be estimated following the procedures specified in Sec.

as a process condenser, as a control device shall conduct inprocess 
recycling and follow the recordkeeping requirements specified in Sec. 
63.1416(d)(1)(vi).
    (iv) Initial compliance with percent reduction standards. Initial 
compliance with the percent reduction standards specified in Sec. 
63.1406(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) and Sec. 63.1407(a)(2)(ii) and (3)(ii) is 
achieved when the owner or operator demonstrates, following the 
procedures in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, that 
the required percent reduction is achieved.
    (v) Continuous compliance with percent reduction standards. 
Continuous compliance with the percent reduction standards specified in 
Sec. 63.1406(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) and Sec. 63.1407(a)(2)(ii) and 
(3)(ii) shall be demonstrated following the continuous monitoring 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.1415.
    (2) Compliance with mass emission limit standards. Each owner or 
operator shall determine initial and continuous compliance with the mass 
emission limits specified in Sec. 63.1406 (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii), 
according to the following procedures, as appropriate:
    (i) If production at an affected source is exclusively non-solvent-
based amino/phenolic resin or is exclusively solvent-based amino/
phenolic resin, or an owner or operator chooses to meet the non-solvent-
based emission limit, the owner or operator shall demonstrate initial 
and continuous compliance as follows:
    (A) Initial compliance. Initial compliance shall be based on the 
average of the first 6 monthly average emission rate data points. The 6-
month average shall be compared to the mass emission limit specified in 
Sec. 63.1406 (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii), as appropriate.
    (B) Continuous compliance. For the first year of compliance, 
continuous compliance shall be based on a cumulative average monthly 
emission rate calculated each month based on the available monthly 
emission rate data points (e.g., 7 data points after 7 months of 
operation, 8 data points after 8 months of operation) beginning the 
first month after initial compliance is demonstrated. The first 
continuous compliance cumulative average monthly emission rate shall be 
calculated using the first 7 monthly average emission rate data points. 
After the first year of compliance, a 12-month rolling average monthly 
emission rate shall be calculated each month based on the previous 12 
monthly emission rate data points. Continuous compliance shall be 
determined by comparing the cumulative average monthly emission rate or 
the 12-month

[[Page 549]]

rolling average monthly emission rate to the mass emission limit 
specified in Sec. 63.1406 (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii), as appropriate.
    (C) Procedures to determine the monthly emission rate. The monthly 
emission rate, kilograms of organic HAP per megagram of product, shall 
be determined at the end of each month using Equation 2 of this section:

    (1) The monthly emission rate of organic HAP, in kilograms per 
month, from an individual batch process vent (E<INF>i</INF>) shall be 
determined using Equation 3 of this section. Once organic HAP emissions 
for a batch cycle (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) have been estimated, as specified 
in either paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C)(2) or (3) of this section, the owner or 
operator may use the estimated organic HAP emissions 
(E<INF>cyclei</INF>) to determine E<INF>i</INF> using Equation 3 of this 
section until the estimated organic HAP emissions (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) 
are no longer representative due to a process change or other reasons 
known to the owner or operator. If organic HAP emissions for a batch 
cycle (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) are determined to no longer be 
representative, the owner or operator shall redetermine organic HAP 
emissions for the batch cycle (E<INF>cyclei</INF>) following the 
procedures in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C)(2) or (3) of this section, as 
appropriate.

organic HAP from the batch process vent.

    (2) For reactor batch process vents estimated through engineering 
assessment, as described in Sec. 63.1414(d)(6), to emit less than 10 
tons per year of uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, the owner or 
operator may use the emissions determined using engineering assessment 
in Equation 3 of this section or may determine organic HAP emissions 
using any of the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1414(d). For reactor 
batch process vents estimated through engineering assessment, as 
described in Sec. 63.1414(d)(6), to emit 10 tons per year or greater of 
uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, uncontrolled organic HAP emissions

    (B) Initial compliance. For purposes of determining initial 
compliance, the site-specific emission limit shall be based on 
production for the first 6 months beginning January 20, 2000 or the 
first 6 months after initial start-up, whichever is later. Using the 
site-specific emission limit, initial compliance shall be demonstrated

limit shall be determined each month based on production for the 
cumulative period. For purposes of determining continuous compliance 
after the first year of production, the site-specific emission limit 
shall be determined each month based on production for a 12-month 
rolling period. Using the site-specific emission limit, continuous 
compliance shall be demonstrated using the procedures in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, as appropriate.

less when using a non-combustion control device. To demonstrate initial 
and continuous compliance, the owner or operator shall follow the test 
method specified in Sec. 63.1414(a)(6) and shall be in compliance with 
the monitoring provisions in Sec. 63.1415(e) no later than the initial

    (g) Flare compliance demonstrations. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this subpart, if an owner or operator of an affected source 
uses a flare to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart, the 
owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of 
this section. When using

[[Page 551]]

a flare to comply, the owner or operator is not required to conduct a 
performance test to determine percent emission reduction or outlet 
organic HAP concentration. If a compliance demonstration has been 
conducted previously for a flare, using the techniques specified in 
paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section, that compliance 
demonstration may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph 
if either no deliberate process changes have been made since the

    (3) Determine the exit velocity using the techniques specified in 
either Sec. 63.11(b)(7)(i) (and Sec. 63.11(b)(7)(iii), where 
applicable) or Sec. 63.11(b)(8), as appropriate.
    (h) Deviations. Paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section 
describe deviations from the emission limits, the operating limits, the 
work practice standards, and the emission standard, respectively. 
Paragraph (h)(5) of this section describes situations that are not 
deviations. Paragraph (h)(6) of this section describes periods that are 
excluded from compliance determinations.
    (1) Deviations from the emission limit. The following are deviations 
from the emission limit:
    (i) Exceedance of the condenser outlet gas temperature limit (i.e., 
having an average value higher than the established maximum level) 
monitored according to the provisions of Sec. 63.1415(b)(3);
    (ii) Exceedance of the outlet concentration (i.e., having an average 
value higher than the established maximum level) monitored according to 
the provisions of Sec. 63.1415(b)(8);
    (iii) Exceedance of the mass emission limit (i.e., having an average 
value higher than the specified limit) monitored according to the 
provisions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
    (iv) Exceedance of the organic HAP outlet concentration limit (i.e., 
having an average value higher than the specified limit) monitored 
according to the provisions of Sec. 63.1415(e).
    (2) Deviations from the operating limit. Exceedance of the 
parameters monitored according to Sec. 63.1415(b)(1), (b)(2), and 
(b)(4) through (7) are considered deviations from the operating limit. 
An exceedance of the monitored parameter has occurred if:
    (i) The parameter, averaged over the operating day or block, is 
below a minimum value established during the initial compliance 
demonstration; or (ii) The parameter, averaged over the operating day or 
block, is above the maximum value established during the initial 
compliance demonstration.
    (3) Deviations from the work practice standard. If all flames at the 
pilot light of a flare are absent, there has been a deviation from the 
work practice standard.
    (4) Deviation from the emission standard. If an affected source is 
not operated during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction in 
accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1), there has been a deviation from the 
emission standard. If monitoring data are insufficient, as described in 
paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, there has been a 
deviation from the emission standard.
    (i) The period of control device or control technology operation is 
4 hours or greater in an operating day, and monitoring data are 
insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as defined in paragraph 
(h)(4)(iii) of this section, for at least 75 percent of the operating 
hours;
    (ii) The period of control device or control technology operation is 
less than 4 hours in an operating day, and more than one of the hours 
during the period of operation does not constitute a valid hour of data 
due to insufficient monitoring data; and
    (iii) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, if 
measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within 
the hour. For data compression systems approved under Sec. 
63.1417(k)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid 
hour of

[[Page 552]]

data if there are less than four data measurements made during the hour.
    (5) Situations that are not deviations. If an affected source is 
operated during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction in 
accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1), and any of the situations listed in 
paragraphs (h)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section occur, such situations 
shall not be considered to be deviations.
    (i) The daily average value of a monitored parameter is above the 
maximum level or below the minimum level established;
    (ii) Monitoring data cannot be collected during monitoring device 
calibration check or monitoring device malfunction;
    (iii) Monitoring data are not collected during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction; and
    (iv) Monitoring data are not collected during periods of 
nonoperation of the affected source or portion thereof (resulting in 
cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies).
    (6) Periods not considered to be part of the period of control or 
recovery device operation. The periods listed in paragraphs (h)(6)(i) 
through (v) of this section are not considered to be part of the period 
of control or recovery device operation for purposes of determining 
averages or periods of control device or control technology operation.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of nonoperation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.

only those periods of the batch emission episode for which the emission 
rate for the entire episode can be determined or for which the emissions 
are greater than the average emission rate of the batch emission 
episode. The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall 
develop an emission profile illustrating the emission rate (kilogram per 
unit time) over the entire batch emission episode, based on either 
process knowledge or test data, to demonstrate that test periods are 
representative. Examples of information that could constitute process 
knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process 
stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used to develop the emission 
profile provided the results are still relevant to the current batch 
process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be included in the 
site-specific test plan required by Sec. 63.1417(h)(2).
    (6) Emissions determined by engineering assessment. To use 
engineering assessment to estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch 
emission episode, owners or operators shall comply with paragraphs 
(d)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) If the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(6)(i)(A), (B), and 
(C) of this section are met for a specific batch emission episode, the 
owner or operator may use engineering assessment to estimate organic HAP 
emissions from that batch emission episode.
    (A) Previous test data, where the measurement of organic HAP 
emissions was an outcome of the test, that show a greater than 20 
percent discrepancy between the test value and the value estimated using 
the applicable equations in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this 
section. Paragraphs (d)(6)(i)(A)(1) and (2) of this section describe 
test data that will be acceptable under this paragraph.
    (1) Test data for the batch emission episode obtained during 
production of the product for which the demonstration is being made.
    (2) Test data obtained for a batch emission episode from another 
process train where the test data were obtained during production of the 
product for which the demonstration is being made. Test data from 
another process train may be used only if the owner or operator can 
demonstrate that the data are representative of the batch emission 
episode for which the demonstration is being made, taking into account 
the nature, size, operating conditions, production rate, and sequence of 
process steps (e.g., reaction, distillation, etc.) of the equipment in 
the other process train.
    (B) Previous test data for the batch emission episode with the 
highest organic HAP emissions on a mass basis where the measurement of 
organic HAP emissions was an outcome of the test, where data were 
obtained during the production of the product for which the 
demonstration is being made, and where the data show a greater than 20 
percent discrepancy between the test value and the value estimated using 
the applicable equations in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this 
section. If the criteria in this paragraph are met, then

[[Page 558]]

engineering assessment may be used for all batch emission episodes 
associated with that batch cycle for the batch unit operation.
    (C) The owner or operator has requested and been granted approval to 
use engineering assessment to estimate organic HAP emissions from a 
batch emissions episode. The request to use engineering assessment to 
estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch emissions episode shall 
contain sufficient information and data to demonstrate to the 
Administrator that engineering assessment is an accurate means of 
estimating organic HAP emissions for that particular batch emissions 
episode. The request to use engineering assessment to estimate organic 
HAP emissions for a batch emissions episode shall be submitted in the 
Precompliance Report, as required by Sec. 63.1417(d).
    (ii) Engineering assessment includes, but is not limited to, the 
following:
    (A) Previous test results, provided the tests are representative of 
current operating practices;
    (B) Bench-scale or pilot-scale test data obtained under conditions 
representative of current process operating conditions;
    (C) Flow rate or organic HAP emission rate specified or implied 
within a permit limit applicable to the batch process vent; and
    (D) Design analysis based on accepted chemical engineering

Sec. 63.1417(e)(9).
    (B) The request for approval to use engineering assessment to 
estimate organic HAP emissions from a batch emissions episode as allowed 
under paragraph (d)(6)(i)(C) of this section, and sufficient data or 
other information for demonstrating to the Administrator that 
engineering assessment is an accurate means of estimating organic HAP 
emissions for that particular batch emissions episode shall be submitted 
with the Precompliance Report, as required by Sec. 63.1417(d).
    (7) Emissions for a single batch cycle. For each batch process vent, 
the organic HAP emissions associated with a single batch cycle shall be 
calculated using Equation 15 of this section:

available, the owner or operator may use any of the options in paragraph 
(d)(9)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
    (A) Experimentally obtained activity coefficients, Henry's law 
constants, or solubility data;
    (B) Models, such as group-contribution models, to predict activity 
coefficients; or

Sec. 63.1415  Monitoring requirements.

    (a) General requirements. Each owner or operator of an emission 
point located at an affected source that uses a control device to comply 
with the requirements of this subpart and has one or more parameter 
monitoring level requirement specified under this subpart, shall install 
the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (b) of this section in 
order to demonstrate continued compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, 
maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications or 
other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the 
equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
    (1) This monitoring equipment shall be in operation at all times 
when organic HAP emissions that are required to be controlled as part of 
complying with the emission limits specified in Sec. Sec. 63.1404, 
63.1405, 63.1406, 63.1407, and 63.1408 are vented to the control device.
    (2) For control devices controlling less than 1 ton per year of 
uncontrolled organic HAP emissions, monitoring shall consist of a daily 
verification that the control device is operating properly. If the 
control device is used to control batch process vents alone or in 
combination with other emission points, the verification may be on a per 
batch cycle basis. This verification shall include, but not be limited 
to, a daily or per batch demonstration that the control device is 
working as designed. The procedure for this demonstration shall be 
submitted for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report, 
as required by Sec. 63.1417(d)(10).
    (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring 
parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable 
provisions of subpart A, F, or G of this part.
    (b) Monitoring equipment. The monitoring equipment specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section shall be installed as 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The parameters to be 
monitored are specified in Table 3 of this subpart.

    (ii) A flow measurement device equipped with a continuous recorder 
shall be located at the scrubber influent for liquid flow. Gas stream 
flow shall be determined using one of the following procedures:
    (A) The owner or operator may determine gas stream flow using the 
design blower capacity with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop.
    (B) If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264 
through 266 that required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/G) 
ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the 
owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had 
been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was 
conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized 
to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.
    (C) The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream 
flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will 
be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require 
determination of gas

[[Page 560]]

stream flow by a method which will at least provide a value for either a 
representative or the highest gas stream flow anticipated in the 
scrubber during representative operating conditions other than start-
ups, shutdowns, or malfunctions. The plan shall include a description of 
the methodology to be followed and an explanation of how the selected 
methodology will reliably determine the gas stream flow, and a 
description of the records that will be maintained to document the 
determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator shall maintain 
the plan as specified in Sec. 63.1416(a).
    (2) Where an absorber is used, a scrubbing liquid temperature

pressure, or better, capable of recording the total regeneration steam 
flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure (gauge or absolute) for each 
regeneration cycle; and a carbon bed temperature monitoring device, 
capable of recording the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration 
and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle are required.
    (5) Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device 
equipped with a continuous recorder is required.
    (i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, 
the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or 
in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position 
before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
    (ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring 
devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and 
after the catalyst bed.

thermocouple, ultra-violet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of 
continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required.
    (7) Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts 
design heat input capacity is used, a temperature monitoring device in 
the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder is required. Any boiler 
or process heater in which all vent streams are introduced with the 
primary fuel or are used as the primary fuel is exempt from this 
requirement.
    (8) As an alternate to paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this 
section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device 
equipped with a continuous recorder. Said organic monitoring device 
shall meet the requirements of Performance Specification 8 or 9 of 40 
CFR part 60, appendix B, and shall be installed, calibrated, and 
maintained according to Sec. 63.6.
    (c) Alternative monitoring parameters. An owner or operator may 
request approval to monitor parameters other than those specified in 
Table 3 of this subpart. The request shall be submitted according to the 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.1417(j). Approval shall be requested if 
the owner or operator:
    (1) Uses a control device or control technology other than those 
included in paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (2) Uses one of the control devices included in paragraph (b) of 
this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those 
specified in Table 3 of this subpart.
    (d) Monitoring of bypass lines. Owners or operators using a vent 
system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from 
a control device or control technology used to comply with the 
provisions of this subpart shall comply with either paragraph (d)(1) or 
(2) of this section. Equipment such as low leg drains, high point 
bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief 
valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph.
    (1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that 
takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be 
generated as specified in Sec. 63.1416(d)(3). The flow indicator shall

<R05>
Sec. 63.1416  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each 
owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all 
applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 
years, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with the 
exception listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that 
they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall 
be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained 
offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable 
form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, 
floppy disk, CD-ROM, optical disc, magnetic tape, or microfiche.
    (2) If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the 
appropriate EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required 
to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the 
requirement of Sec. 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, 
the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of those 
reports.
    (b) Start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan and records. The owner 
or operator of an affected source shall develop a startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan as specified in Sec. 63.6(e)(3) and shall keep the 
plan on-site. Records shall be kept as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
and (2) of this section. Records are not required for emission points 
that do not require control under this subpart.
    (1) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment, or control 
devices, or recovery devices, or continuous monitoring systems, or 
control technologies used to comply with this subpart during which 
excess emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1400(k)(4)) occur.
    (2) For each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during which excess 
emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1400(k)(4)) occur, records reflecting 
whether the procedures specified in the affected source's start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed and documentation of 
actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing 
a control device to a backup control device (e.g., a halogenated stream 
could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control 
device is out of service), records shall be kept of whether the plan was 
followed. These records may take the form of a ``checklist'' or other 
form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
    (c) Monitoring records. Owners or operators required to comply with 
Sec. 63.1415 and, therefore, required to keep continuous records shall 
keep records as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this 
section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data 
value or average values for 1 hour or shorter

[[Page 562]]

periods calculated from all measured data values during each period. If 
values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value 
for each minute may be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) 
average instead of all measured values. Owners or operators of batch 
process vents shall record each measured data value; if values are 
measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each 
minute may be recorded instead of all measured values.
    (2) Daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average 
values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for 
each operating day as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section, except as specified in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this 
section. The option of conducting parameter monitoring for batch process 
vents on a batch cycle daily average basis or a block average basis is 
described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (i) The daily average value, batch cycle daily average, or block 
average shall be calculated as the average of all parameter values 
recorded during the operating day, or batch cycle, as appropriate, 
except as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. For batch 
process vents, only parameter values recorded during those batch 
emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle that the 
owner or operator has selected to control in order to comply shall be 
used to calculate the average. The calculated average shall cover a 24-
hour period if operation is continuous, or the number of hours of 
operation per operating day if operation is not continuous for daily 
average values or batch cycle daily average values. The calculated 
average shall cover the entire period of the batch cycle for block 
average values. As specified in Sec. 63.1413(a)(4)(i)(C)(3), the owner 
or operator shall provide the information needed to calculate batch 
cycle daily averages for operating days that include partial batch 
cycles.
    (ii) The operating day shall be the period the owner or operator 
specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance 
Status for purposes of determining daily average values or batch cycle 
daily average values of monitored parameters. The block shall be the 
entire period of the batch cycle, as specified by the owner or operator 
in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status for 
purposes of determining block average values of monitored parameters.
    (3) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an 
operating day or block are above the minimum level or below the maximum 
level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating 
permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the 
minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and 
recording a daily average, or block average, for that operating day. For 
these operating days or blocks, the records required in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section shall also be retained for 5 years.
    (4) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs 
(c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section shall not be included in any 
average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times 
and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process 
or control device or recovery device or control technology operation 
when monitors are not operating:
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; and
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring 
applies.
    (5) The owner or operator who has received approval to monitor 
different parameters, under Sec. 63.1417(j) as allowed under Sec. 
63.1415(e), than those specified for storage vessels, continuous process 
vents, or batch process vents shall retain for a period of 5 years each 
record specified in their approved Alternative Monitoring Parameters 
request.
    (6) The owner or operator who has received approval to use 
alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions as 
specified in Sec. 63.1417(k) shall retain for a period of 5 years each 
record specified in their approved Alternative Continuous Monitoring 
request.

subpart, or for alternate parameters and/or parameters for alternate 
control devices or control technologies monitored according to Sec. 
63.1417(j) as allowed under Sec. 63.1415(e), maintain documentation 
showing the establishment of the level that indicates proper operation 
of the control device or control technology as required by Sec. 
63.1415(c) for parameters specified in Sec. 63.1415(b) and as required 
by Sec. 63.1417(j) for alternate parameters. An owner or operator may 
choose to monitor operating parameters for batch process vents on a 
batch cycle daily average basis or on a block average basis. The batch 
cycle daily average is based on parameter monitoring accomplished during 
the operating day

[[Page 564]]

(i.e., a 24-hour basis). The block average is based on the parameter 
monitoring accomplished during a single batch cycle. As defined in Sec.

section as alternatives to the provisions specified in this subpart for 
storage vessels, continuous process vents, batch process vents, or 
aggregate batch vent streams. The owner or operator shall retain for a 
period of 5 years each record required by paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of 
this section.
    (1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average, batch 
cycle daily average, or block average value, and is not required to 
retain more frequent values, for a parameter with respect to an item of 
equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (vi) of 
this section are met. An owner or operator electing to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall notify the 
Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required 
under Sec. 63.1417(e) or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has 
already been submitted, in the Periodic Report immediately preceding 
implementation of the requirements of this paragraph as specified in 
Sec. 63.1417(f)(10).
    (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or 
impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, 
shutdowns, or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of -200 [deg]C 
on a boiler) and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The 
owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the 
alarm or other alert in an operating day or block constitute a single 
occurrence.
    (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly 
throughout each operating day, a running average of the parameter values 
that have been obtained during that operating day or block, and the 
capability to observe this running average is readily available on-site 
to the Administrator during the operating day. The owner or operator 
shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. All instances in 
an operating day or block constitute a single occurrence:
    (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established limits;
    (B) The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average 
values; and
    (C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data 
during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns, or 
malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging 
data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., 
pH in some scrubbers) and will alert the operator by alarm or other 
means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances 
of the alarm or other

[[Page 568]]

alert in an operating day or block constitute a single occurrence.
    (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an 
alarm or other means if the running average parameter value calculated 
under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is 
appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is 
being monitored.
    (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the 
monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements 
of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, at the times 
specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (C). The owner or operator 
shall document that the required verifications occurred.
    (A) Upon initial installation.
    (B) Annually after initial installation.
    (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting 
the monitoring system which might reasonably be expected to alter the 
monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Identification of each parameter for each item of equipment for 
which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s) and how 
compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The description shall identify 
the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) for each 
required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall 
retain, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided 
in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section, both the current and the 
most recent superseded description.
    (C) A description and the date of any change to the monitoring 
system that would reasonably be expected to impair its ability to comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as 
long as the description is current. The current description shall, at 
all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location 
by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a 
request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions 
for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded 
descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central 
location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours 
after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, 
superseded descriptions may be stored off-site.
    (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a parameter with 
respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 consecutive months has 
passed without any deviation as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this 
section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily 
average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value for any 
operating day when the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or 
block average value is less than the maximum or greater than the minimum 
established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data 
generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited 
toward the period of 6 consecutive months if the parameter limit and the 
monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance date 
were required and/or approved by the Administrator.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average, 
batch cycle daily average, or block average values, the owner or 
operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as 
specified in Sec. 63.1417(f)(11). The notification shall identify the 
parameter and unit of equipment.
    (ii) If, on any operating day or during any block after the owner or 
operator has ceased recording the daily average, batch cycle daily 
average, or block average values as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section, there is a deviation as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining

[[Page 569]]

the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value for 
each operating day and shall notify the Administrator in the next 
Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each 
daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value until 
another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without a deviation as 
defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for the duration 
specified in paragraph (h) of this section. For any calendar week, if 
compliance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does 
not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or 
measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain 
at least one value during a period of operation other than a start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iv) For purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of this section, a deviation 
means that the daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block 
average value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the 
maximum, or less than the minimum established value, except that the 
daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block average value during 
any startup, shutdown, or malfunction shall not be considered a 
deviation, if the owner or operator operates the source during such 
periods in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1).

[[Page 577]]

monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control or recovery 
device operating conditions, considering typical variability of the 
specific process and control or recovery device operating parameter 
being monitored.
    (3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated 
data compression recording system that does not record monitored 
operating parameter values at a set frequency (for example, once every 
15 minutes) but records all values that meet set criteria for variation 
from previously recorded values, in accordance with paragraphs (k)(3)(i) 
and (ii) of this section.
    (i) The requested system shall be designed to:
    (A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once every 15

    (D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not 
functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;
    (E) Calculate daily average, batch cycle daily average, or block 
average values of the monitored operating parameter based on all 
measured data; and
    (F) If the daily average is not a deviation, as defined in Sec. 
63.1413(h), from the operating parameter, the data for that operating 
day may be converted to hourly average values, and the four or more 
individual records for each hour in the operating day may be discarded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression 
recording system, including the criteria used to determine which 
monitored values are recorded and retained;
    (B) The method for calculating daily averages and batch cycle daily 
averages; and
    (C) A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph 
(k)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other 
alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.8(f)(4).

<R05>
Sec. 63.1420  Applicability and designation of affected sources.

    (a) Definition of affected source. The provisions of this subpart 
apply to each affected source. Affected sources are described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) An affected source is either an existing affected source or a 
new affected source. Existing affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, and new affected source is defined in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section.
    (2) An existing affected source is defined as the group of one or 
more polyether polyol manufacturing process units (PMPUs) and associated 
equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that is not 
part of a new affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, and that is located at a plant site that is a major source.
    (3) A new affected source is defined as a source that meets the 
criteria of paragraph (a)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. The 
situation described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is distinct 
from those situations described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (iii) of 
this section.
    (i) At a site without organic HAP emission points before September 
4, 1997 (i.e., a ``greenfield'' site), the group of one or more PMPUs 
and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, 
that is part of a major source, and on which construction for the 
PMPU(s) commenced after September 4, 1997;
    (ii) The group of one or more PMPUs meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section; or
    (iii) A reconstructed affected source meeting the criteria in 
paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
    (4) The affected source also includes the emission points and 
equipment specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (vi) of this section 
that are associated with a PMPU (or a group of PMPUs) making up an 
affected source, as defined in Sec. 63.1423.
    (i) Each waste management unit.
    (ii) Maintenance wastewater.
    (iii) Each heat exchange system.
    (iv) Equipment required by or utilized as a method of compliance 
with this subpart which may include control techniques and recovery 
devices.
    (v) Product finishing operation.
    (vi) Each feed or catalyst operation.
    (b) PMPUs without organic HAP. The owner or operator of a PMPU that 
is part of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section, but that does not use or manufacture any organic HAP during the 
production of one or more products is only subject to the provisions of 
this subpart as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as 
applicable. Products or raw material(s) containing organic HAP as 
impurities only are not considered organic HAP for the purposes of this 
paragraph.
    (1) If an organic HAP is not used or manufactured in the production 
of polyether polyols, the PMPU is not subject to any provisions of this 
subpart, except that the owner or operator shall comply with either 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. The owner or operator is 
not required to comply with the provisions of 40 CFR

[[Page 585]]

part 63, subpart A (the General Provisions) for that PMPU.
    (i) Retain information, data, and analyses used to document the 
basis for the determination that the PMPU does not use or manufacture 
any organic HAP. Types of information that could document this 
determination include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals 
purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, 
engineering calculations, or process knowledge.
    (ii) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the PMPU 
does not use or manufacture any organic HAP.
    (2) If an organic HAP is used or manufactured in the production of 
polyether polyols, but an organic HAP is not used in the production of 
one or more products that are not polyether polyols, the PMPU is not 
subject to any provision of this subpart other than paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
or (ii) of this section during the production of the non-polyether 
polyol products that do not use or manufacture any organic HAP.
    (c) Emission points included in the affected source but not subject 
to the provisions of this subpart. The affected source includes the 
emission points listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (12) of this 
section, but these emission points are not subject to the requirements 
of this subpart or the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.
    (1) Equipment that does not contain organic HAP or that contains 
organic HAP as impurities only and is located at a PMPU that is part of 
an affected source.
    (2) Stormwater managed in segregated sewers.
    (3) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems in segregated 
sewers.
    (4) Spills.
    (5) Water from safety showers.
    (6) Water from testing of deluge systems.
    (7) Water from testing of firefighting systems.
    (8) Vessels that store and/or handle material that contains no 
organic HAP or organic HAP as impurities only.
    (9) Equipment that operates in organic HAP service for less than 300 
hours during the calendar year.
    (10) Loading racks, loading arms, or loading hoses that only 
transfer liquids containing HAP as impurities.
    (11) Loading racks, loading arms, or loading hoses that vapor 
balance during all loading operations.
    (12) Utility fluids, such as heat transfer fluids.
    (d) Processes exempted from the affected source. The processes 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section are not part 
of the affected source and are exempted from the requirements of both 
this subpart and subpart A of this part.
    (1) Research and development facilities.
    (2) Solvent reclamation, recovery, or recycling operations at 
hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDF) 
requiring a permit under 40 CFR part 270 that are not part of a PMPU to 
which this subpart applies.
    (3) Reactions or processing that occur after the epoxide 
polymerization is complete and after all catalyst removal steps, if any, 
are complete.
    (e) Primary product determination and applicability. An owner or 
operator of a process unit that produces or plans to produce a polyether 
polyol shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in 
accordance with this paragraph.
    (1) Initial primary product determination. The owner or operator 
shall initially determine the primary product of each process unit in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

the process unit, or
    (B) If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on 
a mass basis for two or more products and if one of those products is a

[[Page 586]]

polyether polyol, then the polyether polyol shall represent the primary 
product of the process unit.
    (iii) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible 
operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in 
paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the anticipated 
operations for the 5 years following September 4, 1997 for existing 
process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins 
production of any product for the new process units. If operations 
cannot be anticipated sufficiently to allow the determination of the 
primary product for the specified period, applicability shall be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for 
the greatest operating time over the specified 5-year period for 
existing process units, or the specified 1-year period for new process 
units, then that product shall represent the primary product of the 
flexible operation unit.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple 
products equally based on operating time, then the product with the 
greatest expected production on a mass basis over the specified 5-year 
period for existing process units, or the specified 1-year period for 
new process units shall represent the primary product of the flexible 
operation unit.
    (iv) If, according to paragraph (e)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section, the primary product of a process unit is a polyether polyol, 
then that process unit shall be designated as a PMPU. If the plant site 
is a major source, that PMPU and associated equipment, as listed in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source or part 
of an affected source comprised of one or more other PMPUs and 
associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and 
subject to this subpart. If the primary product of a process unit is not 
a polyether polyol, then that process unit is not a PMPU.
    (2) Provisions if primary product cannot be determined. If the 
primary product cannot be determined for a flexible operation unit in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, applicability 
shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.
    (i) If the owner or operator can determine that a polyether polyol 
is not the primary product, then that flexible operation unit is not a 
PMPU.
    (ii) If the owner or operator cannot determine that a polyether 
polyol is not the primary product as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of 
this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
    (A) If the flexible operation unit is an existing process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a PMPU if a polyether 
polyol was produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating time 
of the flexible operation unit since September 4, 1997.
    (B) If the flexible operation unit is a new process unit, the 
flexible operation unit shall be designated as a PMPU if the owner or 
operator anticipates that a polyether polyol will be manufactured in the 
flexible operation unit at any time in the first year after the date the 
unit begins production of any product.
    (3) Annual applicability determination for non-PMPUs that have 
produced a polyether polyol. Once per year beginning June 1, 2004, the 
owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not designated 
as a PMPU, but that has produced a polyether polyol at any time in the 
preceding 5-year period or since the date that the unit began production 
of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the evaluation 
described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section. 
However, an owner or operator that does not intend to produce any 
elastomer product in the future, in accordance with paragraph (e)(9) of 
this section, is not required to perform the evaluation described in 
paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the 
owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time 
over which the product was produced during the preceding 5-year period.
    (ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the 
product with the highest percentage of total

[[Page 587]]

operating time for the preceding 5-year period.
    (iii) If the primary product identified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) is a 
polyether polyol, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as a 
PMPU. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later than 
45 days after determining that the flexible operation unit is a PMPU, 
and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in accordance 
with paragraph (g)(1) of this section for the flexible operation unit.
    (4) Applicability determination for non-PMPUs that have not produced 
a polyether polyol. The owner or operator that anticipates the 
production of a polyether polyol in a process unit that is not 
designated as a PMPU, and in which no polyether polyol products have 
been produced in the previous 5-year period or since the date that the 
process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, 
shall use the procedures in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section to 
determine if the process unit is designated as a PMPU, with the 
exception that for existing process units, owners or operators shall 
project production for the 5 years following the date that the owner or 
operator anticipates initiating the production of a polyether polyol, 
instead of the 5 years following September 4, 1997. If the unit is 
designated as a PMPU, the owner or operator shall comply in accordance 
with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (5) Applicability of requirements for PMPUs that are flexible 
operation units. The owner or operator of PMPUs that are flexible 
operation units shall comply with the provisions of this subpart in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Control requirements. The owner or operator shall comply with 
the control requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraphs 
(e)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) During periods when the PMPU produces polyether polyols, the 
owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of this subpart.
    (B) During periods when the PMPU produces products other than 
polyether polyols, the owner or operator is not required to install 
additional combustion, recovery, or recapture devices (to otherwise 
demonstrate compliance). However, the owner or operator shall continue 
to operate any existing combustion, recovery, or recapture devices that 
are required for compliance during the production of polyether polyols, 
with the exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. If 
extended cookout (ECO) is the control technique chosen for epoxide 
emission reduction, then ECO or a control technique providing an 
equivalent reduction in epoxide emissions should continue to be used for 
epoxide emission reduction, if the non-polyether polyol being produced 
uses epoxide monomers.
    (ii) Monitoring requirements. The owner or operator shall comply 
with the monitoring requirements of this subpart in accordance with 
paragraphs (e)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, and paragraph 
(e)(5)(ii)(C) of this section if applicable.
    (A) The owner or operator shall establish a single parameter 
monitoring level (for each parameter required to be monitored at each 
device subject to monitoring requirements) in accordance with Sec. 
63.1438(a) based on emission point and control technique characteristics 
when polyether polyol is being produced.
    (B) The owner or operator shall monitor each parameter at each 
device subject to monitoring requirements at all times (during periods 
when the PMPU produces polyether polyols, and during periods when the 
PMPU produces products other than polyether polyols), with the 
exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.
    (C) If ECO is used to reduce epoxide emissions, a parameter 
monitoring level shall be established for the production of non-
polyether polyol products as the average of the established parameter 
levels for all product classes produced. During periods when products 
other than polyether polyols are produced, the ECO shall be performed so 
that the parameter monitoring level established for the production of 
non-polyether polyol products is maintained when the ECO is used as a 
control technique.
    (iii) Group determinations. For emission points where the owner or 
operator is required to determine if the emission point is Group 1 
according the definitions in Sec. 63.1423 (storage vessels,

[[Page 588]]

process vents for nonepoxide organic HAP emissions used to make or 
modify the product, and wastewater), the owner or operator shall 
determine the group status based on emission point characteristics when 
polyether polyol is being manufactured. Group 1 emission points shall be 
controlled in accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section.
    (iv) Exceptions. During periods when products described in 
paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section are produced, the owner 
or operator is not required to comply with the provisions of this 
subpart.
    (A) Products in which no organic HAP is used or manufactured, 
provided that the owner or operator comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (B) Products that make the PMPU subject to 40 CFR part 63, subpart 
GGG (Pharmaceuticals Production NESHAP).
    (6)-(7) [Reserved]
    (8) Requirements for process units that are not PMPUs. If it is 
determined that a process unit is not subject to this subpart, the owner 
or operator shall either retain all information, data, and analysis used 
to document the basis for the determination that the process unit is not 
a PMPU, or, when requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the 
process unit is not a PMPU.
    (9) PMPUs terminating production of all polyether polyols. If a PMPU 
terminates the production of all polyether polyols, and the owner or 
operator does not anticipate the production of any polyether polyols in 
the future in that PMPU, the process unit is no longer a PMPU and is not 
subject to this subpart after notification is made to the Administrator. 
This notification shall be accompanied by a rationale for why it is 
anticipated that no polyether polyols will be produced in the process 
unit in the future.
    (10) Redetermination of applicability to PMPUs that are flexible 
operation units. Whenever changes in production occur that could 
reasonably be expected to change the primary product of a PMPU that is 
operating as a flexible operation unit from a polyether polyol to a 
product that would make the process unit subject to another subpart of 
this part, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the primary product, 
in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the 
conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section are 
met, the flexible operation unit shall no longer be designated as a PMPU 
after the compliance date of the other subpart, and shall no longer be 
subject to the provisions of this subpart after the date that the 
process unit is required to be in compliance with the provisions of the 
other subpart. If the conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) 
of this section are not met, the flexible operation unit shall continue 
to be considered a PMPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    (i) The product identified as the primary product is not polyether 
polyol;
    (ii) The production of the product identified as the primary product 
is subject to another subpart of this part; and
    (iii) The owner or operator submits a notification to the 
Administrator of the pending change in applicability.
    (f) Storage vessel ownership determination. The owner or operator 
shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) 
of this section to determine to which process unit a storage vessel 
shall be assigned.
    (1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 
CFR part 63 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
for Source Categories) on June 1, 1999, that storage vessel shall be 
assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart, and none of 
the other provisions in this subpart shall apply to that storage vessel.
    (2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.
    (3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the 
storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the 
same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into 
or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit that has the 
predominant use of the storage vessel.)
    (4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if only one of those process 
units is a PMPU

[[Page 589]]

subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that 
PMPU.
    (5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel 
that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process 
units are PMPUs that have different primary products and that are 
subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the 
storage vessel to any one of the PMPUs sharing the storage vessel.
    (6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to 
year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization 
that occurred during the year preceding June 1, 1999 or based on the 
expected utilization for the 5 years following June 1, 1999 for existing 
affected sources, whichever is more representative of the expected 
operations for that storage vessel, and based on the expected 
utilization for the 5 years after initial start-up for new affected 
sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the 
Notification of Compliance Status, as required by Sec. 
63.1439(e)(5)(v).
    (7) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that 
includes one or more process units which place material into or receive 
material from the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a 
tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this 
subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs 
(f)(7)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that 
utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage 
vessel for that product (or raw materials, as appropriate). With respect 
to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage 
vessel connected by hard-piping to both the process unit and the storage 
vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or 
leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage 
vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in 
the tank farm.
    (ii) If there is no process unit at the major source that meets the 
criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a 
storage vessel, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel.
    (iii) If there is only one process unit at the major source that 
meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect 
to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that 
process unit.
    (iv) If there are two or more process units at the major source that 
meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect to 
a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those 
process units according to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(3) through 
(6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only 
those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of 
this section.
    (8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending 
material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial 
determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) 
a process unit that was included in the initial determination, the owner 
or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that 
storage vessel.
    (g) Changes or additions to plant sites. The provisions of this 
paragraph apply to the owner or operator that changes or adds to their 
plant site or affected source.
    (1) Adding a PMPU to a plant site. The provisions of paragraphs 
(g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to the owner or operator that 
adds one or more PMPUs to a plant site. A PMPU may be added to a plant 
site by constructing or reconstructing a process unit to produce 
polyether polyols. A PMPU may also be added to a plant site due to 
changes in production (anticipated production or actual past production) 
such that a polyether polyol becomes the primary product of a process 
unit that was not previously a PMPU.
    (i) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, the 
added group of one or more PMPUs and their associated equipment, as 
listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall be a new affected 
source and shall comply

[[Page 590]]

with the requirements for a new affected source in this subpart upon 
initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is later, if the added 
group of one or more PMPUs meets the criteria specified in paragraph 
(g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and either meets the criteria in paragraph 
(g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section.
    (A) The process units are new process units, as defined in Sec. 
63.1423.
    (B) The added group of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, 
as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, has the potential to emit 
10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year) or more of any organic HAP or 
25 tons per year (22.7 megagrams per year) or more of any combination of 
organic HAP, and polyether polyols are currently produced at the plant 
site as the primary product of an affected source.
    (C) A polyether polyol is not currently produced at the plant site 
as the primary product of an affected source, and the plant site meets, 
or after the addition is constructed will meet, the General Provisions' 
definition of a major source in Sec. 63.2.
    (ii) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, and 
the added group of one or more PMPUs does not meet the criteria 
specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and one of the 
criteria specified in either paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this 
section, and the plant site meets, or after the addition will meet, the 
definition of a major source, the owner or operator of the added group 
of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section, shall comply with the requirements for an 
existing affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up; by June 
1, 2002; or by 6 months after notifying the Administrator that a process 
unit has been designated as a PMPU (in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) 
of this section), whichever is later.
    (2) Adding emission points or making process changes to existing 
affected sources. The provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(i), (ii), and 
(iii) of this section apply to the owner or operator that adds emission 
points or makes process changes to an existing affected source.
    (i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of 
this section are met, the entire affected source shall be a new affected 
source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source 
upon initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is later.
    (A) The replacement of components meets the definition of 
reconstruction in Sec. 63.1423(b). For purposes of determining whether 
the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the 
fixed capital cost that would be required to construct an entire 
affected source, the equivalent capital cost shall be the entire 
potentially affected source; and
    (B) Such reconstruction commenced after September 4, 1997.
    (ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source 
such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of 
this section are not met and that replacement of components creates one 
or more emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission 
points or emission points that change from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes 
any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, 
heat exchange systems subject to Sec. 63.1435, or equipment leak 
components subject Sec. 63.1434), the resulting emission point(s) shall 
be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected 
source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance upon 
initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.1422 (i.e., December 1, 1999 for most equipment leak components 
subject to Sec. 63.1434, and June 1, 2002 for emission points other 
than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
    (iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process 
change that solely replaces components) is made that creates one or more 
Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission 
points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 
1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 
emission points, heat exchange systems subject to Sec. 63.1435, or 
equipment leak components subject to Sec. 63.1434), the resulting 
emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements

[[Page 591]]

for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall 
be in compliance by initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance 
date specified in Sec. 63.1422 (i.e., December 1, 1999 for most 
equipment leak components subject to Sec. 63.1434, and June 1, 2002 for 
emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.
    (3) Determining what are and are not process changes. For purposes 
of paragraph (g) of this section, examples of process changes include, 
but are not limited to, additions in process equipment resulting in 
changes in production capacity; production of a product outside the 
scope of the compliance demonstration; or whenever there is a 
replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of 
paragraph (g) of this section, process changes do not include: process 
upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not 
alter the equipment configuration and operating conditions.
    (4) Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or 
add to their plant site or affected source. An owner or operator that 
changes or adds to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in 
paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as 
specified in Sec. 63.1439(e)(7)(iii).
    (h) Applicability of this subpart during periods of start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or non-operation. Paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) 
of this section shall be followed during periods of start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, and non-operation of the affected source or any part 
thereof.
    (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the 
emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all 
times except during periods of nonoperation of the affected source (or 
specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which this subpart applies. These emission limitations shall not apply 
during periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, except as provided 
in paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section. However, if a start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or period of nonoperation of one portion of an 
affected source does not affect the ability of a particular emission 
point to comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, 
then that emission point shall still be required to comply with the 
applicable emission limitations of this subpart during the start-up, 
shutdown, malfunction, or period of nonoperation. For example, if there 
is an overpressure in the reactor area, a storage vessel that is part of 
the affected source would still be required to be controlled in 
accordance with the storage tank provisions in Sec. 63.1432. Similarly, 
the degassing of a storage vessel would not affect the ability of a 
process vent to meet the emission limitations for process vents in 
Sec. Sec. 63.1425 through 63.1430.
    (2) The emission limitations set forth in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H, 
as referred to in the equipment leak provisions in Sec. 63.1434, shall 
apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the 
affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are 
drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to 
which Sec. 63.1434 applies, or during periods of start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction, or process unit shutdown (as defined in Sec. 63.161).
    (3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment 
that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during times when 
emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are 
being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene 
requirements applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does 
not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning. This paragraph 
also does not apply if the owner or operator shuts down the compliance 
equipment (other than monitoring systems) to avoid damage due to a 
contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of the affected 
source or portion thereof. If the owner or operator has reason to 
believe that monitoring equipment would be damaged due to a 
contemporaneous start-up, shutdown, or malfunction of the affected 
source or portion thereof, the owner or operator shall provide 
documentation supporting such a claim in the Precompliance Report or in 
a supplement to the Precompliance Report,

[[Page 592]]

as provided for in Sec. 63.1439(e)(4). Once approved by the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 63.1439(e)(4)(vii), the provision 
for ceasing to collect, during a start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, 
monitoring data that would otherwise be required by the provisions of 
this subpart shall be incorporated into the start-up, shutdown, 
malfunction plan for that affected source, as stated in Sec. 
63.1439(b)(1).
    (4) During start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions when the emission 
limitations of this subpart do not apply pursuant to paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall implement, to 
the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess 
emissions to the extent practical. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
term ``excess emissions'' means emissions greater than those allowed by 
the emissions limitation which would apply during operational periods 
other than start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. The measures to be taken 
shall be identified in the applicable start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan, and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution 
control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution 
prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the 
affected source. Use of back-up control techniques is not required, but 
is allowed, if available.

provisions, is determined by the procedures in Sec. 63.144(c).
    Batch cycle means the step or steps, from start to finish, that 
occur in a batch unit operation.
    Batch unit operation means a unit operation involving intermittent 
or discontinuous feed into equipment, and, in general, involves the 
emptying of equipment after the batch cycle ceases and prior to 
beginning a new batch cycle. Mass, temperature, concentration and other 
properties of the process may vary with time. Addition of raw material 
and withdrawal of product do not simultaneously occur in a batch unit 
operation.
    Catalyst extraction means the removal of the catalyst using either 
solvent or physical extraction method.
    Construction means the on-site fabrication, erection, or 
installation of an affected source. Construction also means the on-site 
fabrication, erection, or installation of a process unit or a 
combination of process units which subsequently becomes an affected 
source or part of an affected source due to a change in primary product.
    Continuous record means documentation, either in hard copy or 
computer readable form, of data values measured at least once during 
approximately equal intervals of 15 minutes and recorded at the 
frequency specified in Sec. 63.1439(d).
    Continuous recorder is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that when the 
definition in Sec. 63.111 reads ``or records 15-minute or more frequent 
block average values,'' the phrase ``or records 1-hour or more frequent 
block average values'' shall apply for purposes of this subpart.
    Continuous unit operation means a unit operation where the inputs 
and outputs flow continuously. Continuous unit operations typically 
approach steady-state conditions. Continuous unit operations typically 
involve the simultaneous addition of raw material and withdrawal of the 
product.
    Control technique means any equipment or process control used for 
capturing, recovering, or oxidizing organic hazardous air pollutant 
vapors. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, absorbers, 
adsorbers, boilers, condensers, flares, incinerators, process heaters, 
and scrubbers, or any combination thereof. Process control includes 
extended cookout (as defined in this section). Condensers operating as 
reflux condensers that are necessary for processing, such as liquid 
level control, temperature control, or distillation operation, shall be 
considered inherently part of the process and will not be considered 
control techniques.
    Emission point means an individual process vent, storage vessel, 
wastewater stream, or equipment leak.
    Epoxide means a chemical compound consisting of a three-membered 
cyclic ether. Only emissions of epoxides listed in Table 4 of this 
subpart (i.e., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and

[[Page 597]]

epichlorohydrin) are regulated by the provisions of this subpart.
    Equipment leak means emissions of organic HAP from a connector, 
pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection 
system, open-ended valve or line, valve, surge control vessel, bottoms 
receiver, or instrumentation system in organic HAP service.
    Extended Cookout (ECO) means a control technique that reduces the 
amount of unreacted ethylene oxide (EO) and/or propylene oxide (PO) 
(epoxides) in the reactor. This is accomplished by allowing the product 
to react for a longer time period, thereby having less unreacted 
epoxides and reducing epoxides emissions that may have otherwise 
occurred.
    Flexible operation unit means a process unit that manufactures 
different chemical products by periodically alternating raw materials 
fed to the process unit or operating conditions at the process unit. 
These units are also referred to as campaign plants or blocked 
operations.

accordance with Sec. 63.1428(b), of 11,800 kg/yr or greater, and
    (2) Has a cutoff flow rate, determined in accordance with Sec. 
63.1428(e), that is greater than or equal to the annual average flow 
rate, determined in accordance with Sec. 63.1428(d).
    Group 2 combination of batch process vents means a collection of 
process vents in a PMPU from batch unit operations that are associated 
with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product 
that is not classified as a Group 1 combination of batch process vents.

meters per minute,
    (2) Has a total organic HAP concentration greater than or equal to 
50 parts per million by volume, and
    (3) Has a total resource effectiveness index value, calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 63.1428(h)(1), less than or equal to 1.0.
    Group 2 continuous process vent means a process vent from a 
continuous unit operation that is associated with the use of a 
nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product that is not 
classified as a Group 1 continuous process vent.
    Group 1 storage vessel means a storage vessel that meets the 
applicability criteria specified in Table 3 of this subpart.
    Group 2 storage vessel means a storage vessel that does not fall 
within the definition of a Group 1 storage vessel.
    Group 1 wastewater stream means a process wastewater stream at an 
existing or new affected source that meets the criteria for Group 1

listed on Table 4 of this subpart only).
    Group 2 wastewater stream means any process wastewater stream at an 
existing affected source or new affected source that does not meet the 
definition (in this section) of a Group 1 wastewater stream.

(liquid or gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of total organic 
HAP (as defined in this section), as determined according to the 
provisions of Sec. 63.180(d). The provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) also 
specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP 
service.
    Initial start-up means the first time a new or reconstructed 
affected source begins production, or, for equipment added or changed as 
described in Sec. 63.1420(g), the first time the equipment is put into 
operation to produce a polyether polyol. Initial start-up does not 
include operation solely for testing

[[Page 598]]

equipment. Initial start-up does not include subsequent start-ups of an 
affected source or portion thereof following malfunctions or shutdowns 
or following changes in product for flexible operation units. Further, 
for purposes of Sec. 63.1422, initial start-up does not include 
subsequent start-ups of affected sources or portions thereof following 
malfunctions or process unit shutdowns.
    Maintenance wastewater is defined in Sec. 63.101, except that the 
term ``polyether polyol manufacturing process unit'' shall apply 
whenever the term ``chemical manufacturing process unit'' is used. 
Further, the generation of wastewater from the routine rinsing or 
washing of equipment in batch operation between batches is not 
maintenance wastewater, but is considered to be process wastewater, for 
the purposes of this subpart.
    Make or modify the product means to produce the polyether polyol by 
polymerization of epoxides or other cyclic ethers with compounds having 
one or more reactive hydrogens, and to incorporate additives (e.g., 
preservatives, antioxidants, or diluents) in order to maintain the 
quality of the finished products before shipping. Making and modifying 
the product for this regulation does not include grafting, polymerizing 
the polyol, or reacting it with compounds other than EO or PO.
    Maximum true vapor pressure is defined in Sec. 63.111, except that 
the terms ``transfer'' and ``transferred'' shall not apply for the 
purposes of this subpart.
    New process unit means a process unit for which the construction or 
reconstruction commenced after September 4, 1997.
    On-site or on site means, with respect to records required to be 
maintained by this subpart or required by another subpart referenced by 
this subpart, a location within the plant site where the affected source 
is located. On-site storage of records includes, but is not limited to, 
a location at the affected source or PMPU to which the records pertain 
or a location elsewhere at the plant site where the affected source is 
located.
    Operating day refers to the 24-hour period defined by the owner or 
operator in the Notification of Compliance Status required by Sec. 
63.1439(e)(5). That 24-hour period may be from midnight to midnight or 
another 24-hour period. The operating day is the 24-hour period for 
which daily average monitoring values are determined.
    Organic hazardous air pollutant(s) (organic HAP) means one or more 
of the chemicals listed in Table 4 of this subpart, or any other 
chemical which:
    (1) Is knowingly produced or introduced into the manufacturing 
process other than as an impurity; and
    (2) Is listed in Table 2 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart F in the HON.
    Polyether polyol means a compound formed through the polymerization 
of EO or PO or other cyclic ethers with compounds having one or more 
reactive hydrogens (i.e., a hydrogen atom bonded to nitrogen, oxygen, 
phosphorus, sulfur, etc.) to form polyethers (i.e., compounds with two 
or more ether bonds). This definition of polyether polyol excludes 
cellulose ethers (such as methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, 
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl 
methyl cellulose) and materials regulated under 40 CFR part 63, subparts 
F, G, and H (the HON), such as glycols and glycol ethers.
    Polyether polyol manufacturing process unit (PMPU) means a process 
unit that manufactures a polyether polyol as its primary product, or a 
process unit designated as a polyether polyol manufacturing unit in 
accordance with Sec. 63.1420(e)(2). A polyether polyol manufacturing 
process unit consists of more than one unit operation. This collection 
of equipment includes purification systems, reactors and their 
associated product separators and recovery devices, distillation units 
and their associated distillate receivers and recovery devices, other 
associated unit operations, storage vessels, surge control vessels, 
bottoms receivers, product transfer racks, connected ducts and piping, 
combustion, recovery, or recapture devices or systems, and the equipment 
(i.e., all pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, 
sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, 
connectors, and instrumentation systems that are associated with the 
PMPU) that are subject

[[Page 599]]

to the equipment leak provisions as specified in Sec. 63.1434.
    Pressure decay curve is the graph of the reactor pressure versus 
time from the point when epoxide feed is stopped until the reactor 
pressure is constant, indicating that most of the epoxide has reacted 
out of the vapor and liquid phases. This curve shall be determined with 
no leaks or vents from the reactor.
    Primary product is defined in and determined by the procedures 
specified in Sec. 63.1420(e).
    Process unit means a collection of equipment assembled and connected 
by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture a product.
    Process vent means a point of emission from a unit operation having 
a gaseous stream that is discharged to the atmosphere either directly or 
after passing through one or more combustion, recovery, or recapture 
devices. A process vent from a continuous unit operation is a gaseous 
emission stream containing more than 0.005 weight-percent total organic 
HAP. A process vent from a batch unit operation is a gaseous emission 
stream containing more than 225 kilograms per year (500 pounds per year) 
of organic HAP emissions. Unit operations that may have process vents 
are condensers, distillation units, reactors, or other unit operations 
within the PMPU. Process vents exclude pressure relief valve discharges, 
gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s), and leaks from equipment 
regulated under Sec. 63.1434. A gaseous emission stream is no longer 
considered to be a process vent after the stream has been controlled and 
monitored in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart.
    Process wastewater means wastewater which, during manufacturing or 
processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the 
production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished 
product, by-product, or waste product. Examples are product tank 
drawdown or feed tank drawdown; water formed during a chemical reaction 
or used as a reactant; water used to wash impurities from organic 
products or reactants; equipment washes between batches in a batch 
process; water used to cool or quench organic vapor streams through 
direct contact; and condensed steam from jet ejector systems pulling 
vacuum on vessels containing organics.
    Product means a compound or material which is manufactured by a 
process unit. By-products, isolated intermediates, impurities, wastes, 
and trace contaminants are not considered products.
    Product class means a group of polyether polyols with a similar 
pressure decay curve (or faster pressure decay curves) that are 
manufactured within a given set of operating conditions representing the 
decline in pressure versus time. All products within a product class 
shall have an essentially similar pressure decay curve, and operate 
within a given set of operating conditions. These operating conditions 
are: a minimum reaction temperature; the number of -OH groups in the 
polyol; a minimum catalyst concentration; the type of catalyst (e.g., 
self-catalyzed, base catalyst, or acid catalyst); the epoxide ratio, or 
a range for that ratio; and the reaction conditions of the system (e.g., 
the size of the reactor, or the size of the batch).
    Reactor liquid means the compound or material made in the reactor, 
even though the substance may be transferred to another vessel. This 
material may require further modifications before becoming a final 
product, in which case the reactor liquid is classified as an 
``intermediate.'' This material may be complete at this stage, in which 
case the reactor liquid is classified as a ``product.''
    Reconstruction means the replacement of components of an affected 
source or of a previously unaffected stationary source that becomes an 
affected source as a result of the replacement, to such an extent that:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent 
of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a

(minus methane and ethane) concentrations in all process vent streams 
and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or process 
heater.
    (ii) To determine compliance with a parts per million by volume 
total epoxide or TOC limit in Sec. 63.1425(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(iii), 
the sampling site shall be located at the outlet of the combustion, 
recovery, or recapture device.

    (3) Testing conditions and calculation of TOC or total organic HAP 
concentration. (i) Testing conditions shall be as specified in 
paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) through (E) of this section, as appropriate.
    (A) Testing of process vents from continuous unit operations shall 
be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions, as 
described in Sec. 63.1437(a)(1). Each test shall consist of three l-
hour runs. Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall be measured at 
approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes during each 1-hour 
run. The organic HAP concentration (of the HAP of concern) shall be 
determined from samples collected in an integrated sample over the 
duration of each l-hour test run, or from grab samples collected 
simultaneously with the flow rate measurements (at approximately equal 
intervals of about 15 minutes). If an integrated sample is collected for 
laboratory analysis, the sampling rate shall be adjusted proportionally 
to reflect variations in flow rate. For gas streams from continuous unit 
operations, the organic HAP concentration or control efficiency used to 
determine compliance shall be the average organic HAP concentration or 
control efficiency of the three test runs.
    (B) Testing of process vents from batch unit operations shall be 
conducted at absolute worst-case conditions or hypothetical worst-case 
conditions, as defined in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)(1) through (5) of this 
section. Worst-case conditions are limited to the maximum production 
allowed in a State or Federal permit or regulation and the conditions 
specified in Sec. 63.1437(a)(1). Gas stream volumetric flow rates shall 
be measured at 15-minute intervals, or at least once during the emission 
episode. The organic HAP or TOC concentration shall be determined from 
samples collected in an integrated sample over the duration of the test, 
or from grab samples collected simultaneously with the flow rate 
measurements (at approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes). If 
an integrated sample is collected for laboratory analysis, the sampling 
rate shall be adjusted proportionally to reflect variations in flow 
rate.
    (1) Absolute worst-case conditions are defined by the criteria 
presented in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section if the 
maximum load is the most challenging condition for the control device. 
Otherwise, absolute worst-

[[Page 607]]

case conditions are defined by the conditions in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(B)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (i) The period in which the inlet to the control device will contain 
at least 50 percent of the maximum HAP load (in lbs) capable of being 
vented to the control device over any 8-hour period. An emission profile 
as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3)(i) of this section shall be 
used to identify the 8-hour period that includes the maximum projected 
HAP load.
    (ii) A period of time in which the inlet to the control device will 
contain the highest HAP mass loading rate capable of being vented to the 
control device. An emission profile as described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(B)(3)(i) of this section shall be used to identify the period 
of maximum HAP loading.
    (iii) The period of time when the HAP loading or stream composition 
(including non-HAP) is most challenging for the control device. These 
conditions include, but are not limited to the following: periods when 
the stream contains the highest combined VOC and HAP load described by 
the emission profiles in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section; 
periods when the streams contain HAP constituents that approach limits 
of solubility for scrubbing media; or periods when the streams contain 
HAP constituents that approach limits of adsorptivity for carbon 
adsorption systems.
    (2) Hypothetical worst-case conditions are simulated test conditions 
that, at a minimum, contain the highest hourly HAP load of emissions 
that would be predicted to be vented to the control device from the 
emissions profile described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3)(ii) or (iii) of 
this section.
    (3) The owner or operator shall develop an emission profile for the 
vent to the control device that describes the characteristics of the 
vent stream at the inlet to the control device under worst case 
conditions. The emission profile shall be developed based on any one of 
the procedures described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) (i) through (iii) 
of this section, as required by paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
    (i) The emission profile shall consider all emission episodes that 
could contribute to the vent stack for a period of time that is 
sufficient to include all processes venting to the stack and shall 
consider production scheduling. The profile shall describe the HAP load 
to the device that equals the highest sum of emissions from the episodes 
that can vent to the control device in any given period, not to exceed 1 
hour. Emissions per episode shall be divided by the duration of the 
episode only if the duration of the episode is longer than 1 hour, and 
emissions per episode shall be calculated using the procedures specified 
in Equation 1:

configurations used to generate

[[Page 608]]

the emission events, volatility of materials processed in the equipment, 
and the rationale used to identify and characterize the emission events. 
The emissions may be based on using compounds more volatile than 
compounds actually used in the process(es), and the emissions may be 
generated from all equipment in the process(es) or only selected 
equipment.
    (iii) The emission profile shall consider the capture and control 
system limitations and the highest emissions that can be routed to the 
control device, based on maximum flow rate and concentrations possible 
because of limitations on conveyance and control equipment (e.g., fans, 
LEL alarms and safety bypasses).
    (4) Three runs, each at a minimum of the complete duration of the 
batch venting episode or 1 hour, whichever is shorter, and a maximum of 
8 hours, are required for performance testing. Each run shall occur over 
the same worst-case conditions, as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of 
this section.
    (5) If a condenser is used to control the process vent stream(s), 
the worst case emission episode(s) shall represent a period of time in 
which a process vent from the batch cycle or combination of cycles (if 
more than one cycle is vented through the same process vent) will 
require the maximum heat removal capacity, in Btu/hr, to cool the 
process vent stream to a temperature that, upon calculation of HAP 
concentration, will yield the required removal efficiency for the entire 
cycle. The calculation of maximum heat load shall be based on the 
emission profile described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(3) of this section 
that will allow calculation of sensible and latent heat loads.

computed according to Equation 2, except that only the organic HAP 
species shall be summed.
    (iii) The concentration of TOC or total organic HAP shall be 
corrected to 3 percent oxygen if a combustion device is used.
    (A) The emission rate correction factor or excess air, integrated 
sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B of 40 CFR part 60,

the TOC (minus methane or ethane) or total organic HAP samples are 
taken.

unit operations associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to 
make or modify the product is subject to the Group 1 requirements of 
Sec. 63.1425(c)(1), the owner or operator is not required to determine

extraction that are subject to the organic emission reduction 
requirements of Sec. 63.1425(d)(2) are controlled at all times using a 
combustion, recovery, or recapture device, the owner or operator is not

63.1425(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1)(ii), or (d)(2) using Equation 7. 
The organic HAP emission reduction shall be determined for each group of 
process vents subject to the same paragraph (i.e., paragraph (b), (c), 
or (d)) of Sec. 63.1425. For instance, process vents that emit epoxides 
are subject to paragraph (b) of Sec. 63.1425. Therefore, if the owner 
or operator of an existing affected source is complying with the 98 
percent reduction requirement in Sec. 63.1425(b)(2)(ii), the organic 
HAP (i.e., epoxide) emission reduction shall be determined for the group

the HAP emissions from a process vent already controlled by ECO, then 
the owner or operator shall also comply with the testing, monitoring, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements associated with the additional 
control device, as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.1426, 63.1429, and 
63.1430, respectively.
    (1) For each product class, the owner or operator shall determine 
the batch cycle percent epoxide emission reduction for the most 
difficult to control product in the product class, where the most 
difficult to control product is the polyether polyol that is 
manufactured with the slowest pressure decay curve.

epoxide emission reduction by directly measuring the concentration of 
the unreacted epoxide, or by using process knowledge, reaction kinetics, 
and engineering knowledge, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of 
this section.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects to use any method other than 
direct measurement, the epoxide concentration shall be determined by 
direct measurement for one product from each product class and compared 
with the epoxide concentration determined using the selected estimation 
method, with the exception noted in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section. If the difference between the directly determined epoxide 
concentration and the calculated epoxide concentration is

[[Page 614]]

less than 25 percent, then the selected estimation method will be 
considered to be an acceptable alternative to direct measurement for 
that class.
    (ii) If uncontrolled epoxide emissions prior to the end of the ECO 
are less than 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year), the owner or

reactants have been added to the reactor. This reactor epoxide partial 
pressure shall be determined in accordance with the procedures in 
paragraph (g) of this section.

    (c) Define the onset of the ECO. The owner or operator shall 
calculate the uncontrolled emissions for the batch cycle by calculating 
the epoxide emissions, if any, prior to the onset of the ECO, plus the 
epoxide emissions at the onset of the ECO. The onset of the ECO is 
defined as the point in time when the combined unreacted epoxide 
concentration in the reactor liquid is equal to 25 percent of the 
concentration of epoxides at the end of the epoxide feed, which was 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

Sec. 63.1428  Process vent requirements for group determination of PMPUs using 

a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product.

    (a) Process vents from batch unit operations. The owner or operator 
shall determine, for each PMPU located at an

[[Page 621]]

affected source, if the combination of all process vents from batch unit 
operations that are associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to 
make or modify the product is a Group 1 combination of batch process 
vents, as defined in Sec. 63.1423. The annual uncontrolled nonepoxide 
organic HAP emissions, determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, and annual average flow rate, determined in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, shall be determined for all process 
vents from batch unit operations associated with the use of a nonepoxide 
organic HAP to make or modify the product, with the exception of those 
vents specified in paragraph (i) of this section, at the location after 
all applicable control techniques have been applied to reduce epoxide 
emissions in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) If the owner or operator is using a combustion, recovery, or 
recapture device to reduce epoxide emissions, this location shall be at 
the exit of the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
    (2) If the owner or operator is using ECO to reduce epoxide 
emissions, this location shall be at the exit from the batch unit 
operation. For the purpose of these determinations, the primary 
condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or distillation 
column shall be considered part of the unit operation.
    (b) Determination of annual nonepoxide organic HAP emissions. The 
owner or operator shall determine, for each PMPU, the total annual 
nonepoxide organic HAP emissions from the combination of all process 
vents from batch unit operations that are associated with the use of a 
nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product in accordance with 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) The annual nonepoxide organic HAP emissions for each process 
vent from a batch unit operation associated with the use of a nonepoxide 
organic HAP to make or modify the product shall be determined using the 
batch process vent procedures in the NESHAP for Group I Polymers and 
Resins (40 CFR part 63, subpart U), Sec. 63.488(b).
    (2) The owner or operator shall sum the annual nonepoxide organic 
HAP emissions from all individual process vents from batch unit 
operations in a PMPU, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, to obtain the total nonepoxide organic HAP emissions from 
the combination of process vents associated with the use of a nonepoxide 
organic HAP to make or modify the product, for the PMPU.
    (c) Minimum emission level exemption. If the annual emissions of TOC 
or nonepoxide organic HAP from the combination of process vents from 
batch unit operations that are associated with the use of nonepoxide 
organic HAP to make or modify a polyether polyol for a PMPU are less 
than 11,800 kg/yr, the owner or operator of that PMPU is not required to 
comply with the provisions in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
    (d) Determination of average flow rate and annual average flow rate. 
The owner or operator shall determine, for each PMPU, the total annual 
average flow rate for the combination of all process vents from batch 
unit operations that are associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic 
HAP to make or modify a product in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(2) of this section.
    (1) The annual average flow rate for each process vent from batch 
unit operations that is associated with the use of nonepoxide organic 
HAP to make or modify the product shall be determined using the batch 
process vent procedures in the NESHAP for Group I Polymers and Resins 
(40 CFR part 63, subpart U), Sec. 63.488(e).
    (2) The owner or operator shall sum the annual average flow rates 
from the individual process vents from batch unit operations in a PMPU, 
determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to 
obtain the total annual average flow rate for the combination of process 
vents associated with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or 
modify the product, for the PMPU.
    (e) Determination of cutoff flow rate. For each PMPU at an affected 
source that uses nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product, 
the owner or operator shall calculate the cutoff flow rate using 
Equation 14.

    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Process changes affecting Group 2 combinations of process vents 
in a PMPU that are from batch unit operations. Whenever process changes, 
as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, are made that affect a 
Group 2 combination of batch process vents and that could reasonably be 
expected to change the group status from Group 2 to Group 1, the owner 
or operator shall comply with paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section.
    (1) Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, 
increases in production capacity or production rate, changes in 
feedstock type or catalyst type; or whenever there is replacement, 
removal, or modification of recovery equipment considered part of the 
batch unit operation. Any change that results in an increase in the 
annual nonepoxide organic HAP emissions from the estimate used in the 
previous group determination constitutes a process change for the 
purpose of these provisions. Process changes do not include: process 
upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; and changes that are 
within the margin of variation on which the original group determination 
was based.
    (2) For each process affected by a process change, the owner or 
operator shall redetermine the group status by repeating the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, as applicable, 
and determining if the combination of process vents is a Group 1 
combination of batch process vents, as defined in Sec. 63.1423. 
Alternatively, engineering assessment, as described in Sec. 
63.488(b)(6)(i), may be used to determine the effects of the process 
change.
    (3) Based on the results of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the 
owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (g)(3)(i) or (ii) 
of this section.
    (i) If the redetermination described in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section indicates that the group status of the combination of process 
vents from batch unit operations in a PMPU that are associated with the 
use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product changes from 
Group 2 to Group 1 as a result of the process change, the owner or 
operator shall submit a report as specified in Sec. 
63.1439(e)(6)(iii)(D)(1) and shall comply with Group 1 combination of 
batch process vents provisions in this subpart, as specified in Sec. 
63.1425(c)(1).
    (ii) If the redetermination described in paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section indicates no change in group status, the owner or operator is 
not required to submit a report.
    (h) Process vents from continuous unit operations. (1) The owner or 
operator shall determine the total resource effectiveness (TRE) index 
value for each process vent from a continuous unit operation that is 
associated with the use of nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the 
product. To determine the TRE index value, the owner or operator shall 
conduct a TRE determination and calculate the TRE index value according 
to the HON process vent group determination procedures in Sec. 
63.115(d)(1) or (2) and the TRE equation in Sec. 63.115(d)(3). The TRE 
index value shall be determined at the location after all applicable 
control techniques have been applied to reduce epoxide emissions in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
    (i) If the owner or operator uses one or more nonepoxide recovery 
devices after all control techniques to reduce epoxide emissions, this 
location shall be after the last nonepoxide recovery device.
    (ii) If the owner or operator does not use a nonepoxide recovery 
device after a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to reduce 
epoxide emissions,

[[Page 623]]

this location shall be at the exit of the combustion, recovery, or 
recapture device.
    (iii) If the owner or operator does not use a nonepoxide recovery 
device after extended cookout to reduce epoxide emissions, this location 
shall be at the exit from the continuous unit operation. For the purpose 
of these determinations, the primary condenser operating as a reflux 
condenser on a reactor or distillation column shall be considered part 
of the unit operation.
    (2) The owner or operator of a Group 2 continuous process vent shall 
recalculate the TRE index value as necessary to determine whether the 
process vent is Group 1 or Group 2, whenever process changes are made 
that could reasonably be expected to change the process vent to Group 1. 
Examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, increases 
in production capacity or production rate, changes in feedstock type or 
catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition of 
recovery equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, process changes do 
not include: process upsets; unintentional, temporary process changes; 
and changes that are within the range on which the original TRE 
calculation was based.
    (i) The TRE index value shall be recalculated based on measurements 
of process vent stream flow rate, TOC, and nonepoxide organic HAP 
concentrations, and heating values as specified in the HON process vent 
group determination procedures in Sec. 63.115(a), (b), (c), and (d), as 
applicable, or on best engineering assessment of the effects of the 
change. Engineering assessments shall meet the specifications in Sec. 
63.115(d)(1).
    (ii) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
1.0, or, where the TRE index value before the process change was greater 
than 4.0 and the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
4.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall submit a report as 
specified in the process vent reporting and recordkeeping provisions in 
Sec. 63.1430(j) or (k), and shall comply with the appropriate 
provisions in the process vent control requirements in Sec. 63.1425 by 
the dates specified in Sec. 63.1422 (the section describing compliance 
dates for sources subject to this subpart).
    (iii) Where the recalculated TRE index value is greater than 4.0, 
the owner or operator is not required to submit a report.
    (i) Combination of process vents from batch unit operations and 
process vents from continuous unit operations. If an owner or operator 
combines a process vent from a batch unit operation that is associated 
with the use of a nonepoxide organic HAP to make or modify the product 
with a process vent from a continuous unit operation that is associated 
with the use of a nonepoxide prior to the epoxide control technique, or 
prior to a nonepoxide recovery device that is after the epoxide control 
technique, then the provisions in paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this 
section shall apply.
    (1) The process vent from the batch unit operation is not required 
to be included in the group determination required by paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section.
    (2) The TRE index value of the combined stream shall be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and the TRE index 
value shall be calculated during a period when nonepoxide organic HAP 
emissions are being generated by the batch unit operation.

temperature monitoring device, capable of recording the carbon bed 
temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing 
any cooling cycle are required.
    (7) As an alternative to paragraphs (a)(4) through (6) of this 
section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device 
equipped with a continuous recorder.
    (b) Alternative parameters. An owner or operator of a process vent 
may request approval to monitor parameters other than those listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section. The request shall be submitted according 
to the procedures specified in the process vent reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements in Sec. 63.1430(j) and the alternative 
parameter monitoring reporting requirements in Sec. 63.1439(f). 
Approval shall be requested if the owner or operator:
    (1) Uses a combustion device other than an incinerator, boiler, 
process heater, or flare; or
    (2) For a Group 2 continuous process vent, maintains a TRE greater 
than 1.0 but less than or equal to 4.0 without a recovery device or with 
a recovery device other than the recovery devices listed in paragraph 
(a) of this section; or
    (3) Uses one of the combustion, recovery, or recapture devices 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section, but seeks to monitor a 
parameter other than those specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Monitoring of bypass lines. The owner or operator of a process 
vent using a process vent system that contains bypass lines that could 
divert a process vent stream away from the combustion, recovery, or 
recapture device used to comply with the process vent control 
requirements in Sec. 63.1425(b), (c), or (d) shall comply with 
paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

[[Page 625]]

Equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, 
open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety 
purposes are not subject to paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that 
takes a reading at least once at approximately equal intervals of about 
15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in the process vent 
reporting and recordkeeping provisions in Sec. 63.1430(d)(3). The flow 
indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that 
could divert emissions away from the combustion, recovery, or recapture 
device and to the atmosphere; or
    (2) Secure the bypass line valve in the non-diverting position with 
a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of 
the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every 
month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the non-diverting 
position and emissions are not diverted through the bypass line. Records 
shall be generated as specified in the process vent reporting and 
recordkeeping provisions in Sec. 63.1430(d)(4)(i).
    (d) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. Parameter 
monitoring levels for process vents from continuous or batch unit 
operations using a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to comply 
with the process vent control requirements in Sec. 63.1425(b), (c), or 
(d) shall be established as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) 
of this section.
    (1) For each parameter monitored under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall establish a level, defined as 
either a maximum or minimum operating parameter as denoted in Table 5 of 
this subpart (the table listing the monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting requirements for process vents from batch unit operations), 
that indicates that the combustion, recovery, or recapture device is 
operated in a manner to ensure compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart. The level shall be established in accordance with the 
procedures specified in the process vent control requirements in Sec. 
63.1430(d). The level may be based upon a prior performance test 
conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by 
the EPA, and the owner or operator is not required to conduct a 
performance test under the process vent requirements for determining 
organic HAP concentration, control efficiency, and aggregated organic 
HAP emission reductions in Sec. 63.1426, provided that the prior 
performance test meets the conditions of Sec. 63.1426(b)(3).
    (2) The established level, along with supporting documentation, 
shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status or the 
operating permit application as required in the Notification of 
Compliance Status requirements in Sec. 63.1439(e)(5) or in the 
operating permit application requirements in Sec. 63.1439(e)(8), 
respectively.
    (3) The operating day shall be defined as part of establishing the 
parameter monitoring level and shall be submitted with the information 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The definition of operating day 
shall specify the time(s) at which an operating day begins and ends.

combination of process vents is Group 1 or Group 2).
    (vi) If the combination of all process vents from batch unit 
operations associated with the use of an organic HAP to make or modify 
the product is subject to the Group 1 batch process vent control 
requirements for nonepoxide HAP emissions from making or modifying the 
product in Sec. 63.1425((c)(1), none of the records in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(i) through (v) of this section are required.
    (vii) If the total annual emissions from the combination of process

and the additions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) Performance tests shall be conducted according to the general 
provisions' performance testing requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and 
(2), except that for all emission sources except process vents from 
batch unit operations, performance tests shall be conducted during 
maximum representative operating conditions for the process achievable 
during one of the time periods described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this 
section, without causing any of the situations described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section to occur. For process vents from 
batch unit operations, performance tests shall be conducted either at 
absolute worst-case conditions or hypothetical worst-case conditions, as 
defined in Sec. 63.1426(c)(3)(i)(B), that are achievable during one of 
the time periods described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, 
without causing any of the situations described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) 
or (iii) of this section to occur.
    (i) The 6-month period that ends 2 months before the Notification of 
Compliance Status is due, according to Sec. 63.1439(e)(5); or the 6-
month period that begins 3 months before the performance test and ends 3 
months after the performance test.
    (ii) Causing damage to equipment; necessitating that the owner or 
operator make a product that does not meet an existing specification for 
sale to a customer; or necessitating that the owner or operator make a

or operator of an affected source uses a flare to comply with any of the 
requirements of this subpart, the owner or operator shall comply with 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator is 
not required to conduct a performance test to determine percent emission 
reduction or outlet organic HAP or TOC concentration. If a compliance 
demonstration has been conducted previously for a flare, using the 
techniques specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, 
that compliance demonstration may be used to satisfy the requirements of 
this paragraph if either no deliberate process changes have been made 
since the compliance demonstration, or the results of the compliance 
demonstration reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.
    (1) Conduct a visible emission test using the techniques specified 
in Sec. 63.11(b)(4) of the General Provisions;
    (2) Determine the net heating value of the gas being combusted,

Sec. 63.1438  Parameter monitoring levels and excursions.

    (a) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or 
operator of a combustion, recovery, or recapture device that has one or 
more parameter monitoring level requirements specified under this 
subpart shall establish a maximum or minimum level for each measured 
parameter. If a performance test is required by this subpart for a 
combustion, recovery, or recapture device, the owner or operator shall 
use the procedures in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to 
establish the parameter monitoring level(s). If a performance test is 
not required by this subpart for a combustion, recovery, or recapture 
device, the owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (b), 
(c), or (d) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring 
levels. When using the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall submit the information 
specified in Sec. 63.1439(e)(4)(viii) for review and approval, as part 
of the Precompliance Report.
    (1) The owner or operator shall operate combustion, recovery, and 
recapture devices such that the daily average value of monitored 
parameters remains at or above the minimum established level, or remains 
at or below the maximum established level, except as otherwise provided 
in this subpart.
    (2) As specified in Sec. 63.1439(e)(5)(ii), all established levels, 
along with their supporting documentation and the definition of an 
operating day, shall be submitted as part of the Notification of 
Compliance Status.
    (3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring 
parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable 
provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subparts A, F, G, or H.

[[Page 639]]

    (b) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based exclusively 
on performance tests. In cases where a performance test is required by 
this subpart, or the owner or operator of the affected source elects to 
do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 
and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring 
level for a combustion, recovery, or recapture device based exclusively 
on parameter values measured during the performance test, the owner or 
operator of the affected source shall comply with the procedures in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.
    (1) Process vents from continuous unit operations. During initial 
compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be continuously 
monitored during the required 1-hour runs for process vents from 
continuous unit operations. The monitoring level(s) shall then be 
established as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from 
the three 1-hour test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be 
used when establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum 
values shall be used when establishing a minimum level.
    (2) Process vents from batch unit operations. For process vents from 
batch unit operations, during initial compliance testing, the 
appropriate parameter shall be monitored continuously during the entire 
test period. The monitoring level(s) shall be those established during 
from the compliance test.
    (c) Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on 
performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or 
manufacturer's recommendations. Parameter monitoring levels established 
under this paragraph shall be based on the parameter values measured 
during the performance test supplemented by engineering assessments and/
or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required 
to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values. The 
information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section shall 
be provided in the Notification of Compliance Status.
    (1) The specific level of the monitored parameter(s) for each 
emission point.
    (2) The rationale for the specific level for each parameter for each 
emission point, including any data and calculations used to develop the 
level and a description of why the level indicates proper operation of 
the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.
    (d) Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. If a performance test 
is not required by this subpart for a combustion, recovery, or recapture 
device, the maximum or minimum level may be based solely on engineering 
assessments and/or manufacturers' recommendations. As required in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the determined level and all 
supporting documentation shall be provided in the Notification of 
Compliance Status.
    (e) Monitoring violations. (1) With the exception of excursions 
excused in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, each 
excursion, as defined in paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (f)(2)(i)(A), (f)(2)(ii), 
(f)(3)(i), and (f)(4) of this section, constitutes a violation of the 
provisions of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i), (ii), 
or (iii) of this section.
    (i) For each condenser, each excursion constitutes a violation of 
the emission limit.
    (ii) For each recovery or recapture device other than a condenser, 
where an organic monitoring device is used to monitor concentration, 
each excursion constitutes a violation of the emission limit.
    (iii) For each combustion, recovery, or recapture device other than 
a condenser, each excursion constitutes a violation of the operating 
limit.
    (2) With the exception of excursions excused in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section, each excursion, as defined in paragraphs 
(f)(1)(ii), (f)(1)(iii), (f)(2)(i)(B), and (f)(3)(ii) of this section 
constitutes a violation of the operating limit.
    (f) Parameter monitoring excursion definitions. Parameter monitoring 
excursions are defined in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.

[[Page 640]]

    (1) With respect to storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring 
plan specifies continuous monitoring), process vents from continuous 
unit operations using combustion, recovery, or recapture devices for 
purposes of compliance, and for process wastewater streams, an excursion 
means any of the three cases listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) The daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is 
above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the 
given parameters.
    (ii) The period of combustion, recovery, or recapture device 
operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this 
section, is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data 
are insufficient, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, to 
constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating 
hours.
    (iii) The period of combustion, recovery, or recapture device 
operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this 
section, is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than 2 of the 
hours during the period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of 
data due to insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph 
(f)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (iv) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of 
data, as used in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, if 
measured values are unavailable due to monitoring system breakdowns, 
repairs, calibrated checks, or zero (low-level) and high level 
adjustments, for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data 
compression systems approved under Sec. 63.1439(g)(3), monitoring data 
are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less 
than four data measurements made during the hour.
    (v) The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(v)(A) through (D) of 
this section are not considered to be part of the period of combustion, 
recovery, or recapture device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs 
(f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (A) Start-ups;
    (B) Shutdowns;
    (C) Malfunctions; or
    (D) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (2) For storage vessels where the applicable monitoring plan does 
not specify continuous monitoring, an excursion is defined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
    (i) If the monitoring plan specifies monitoring a parameter and 
recording its value at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes or 
every hour), either of the cases listed in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) or (B) 
of this section is considered a single excursion for the combustion 
device.
    (A) When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over 
the time during which the storage vessel is being filled (i.e., when the 
liquid level in the storage vessel is being raised), is above the 
maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given 
parameters.
    (B) When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be 
considered insufficient when measured values are not available, due to 
monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero (low-
level) and high-level adjustments, for at least 75 percent of the 
specific intervals at which parameters are to be monitored and recorded, 
according to the storage vessel's monitoring plan, during which the 
storage vessel is being filled.
    (ii) If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter 
and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the 
relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon 
canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring 
plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating 
requirement.
    (3) With respect to process vents from batch unit operations, an 
excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters 
is above the maximum or below the minimum established level for the 
given parameters.
    (ii) When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. 
Monitoring

data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not 
available, due to monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration 
checks, or zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments, for at least 75 
percent of the 15-minute periods when batch emission episodes selected 
to be controlled are being vented to the control device during the 
operating day, using the procedures specified in paragraphs 
(f)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when 
batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to 
the control device.
    (B) Subtract the time during the periods listed in paragraphs 
(f)(3)(ii)(B)(1) through (4) of this section from the total amount of 
time determined above in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, to 
obtain the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are 
insufficient.
    (1) Start-ups;
    (2) Shutdowns;
    (3) Malfunctions; or
    (4) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the

time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was 
determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (D) If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of 
the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph 
(f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for 
the operating day.
    (4) With respect to process vents using ECO to reduce epoxide 
emissions, an excursion means any of the situations described in Sec. 
63.1427(i)(3)(i) through (v). For each excursion, the owner or operator 
shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart, 
in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, except as provided in 
paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) Excused excursions. A number of excused excursions shall be 
allowed for each combustion, recovery, or recapture device for each 
semiannual period. The number of excused excursions for each semiannual 
period is specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section. 
This paragraph applies to affected sources required to submit Periodic 
Reports semiannually or quarterly. The first semiannual period is the 6-
month period starting the date the Notification of Compliance Status is 
due.
    (1) For the first semiannual period--six excused excursions.

Sec. 63.1439  General recordkeeping and reporting provisions.

    (a) Data retention. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the 
owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all 
applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 
years. All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that 
they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall 
be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by 
computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a 
request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained 
offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable 
form including, but not limited to, on microfilm, computer, floppy disk, 
magnetic tape, or microfiche. If an owner or operator submits copies of 
reports to the applicable EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is 
not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office 
has waived the requirement of Sec. 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of 
copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain 
copies of reports.
    (b) Subpart A requirements. The owner or operator of an affected 
source shall comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A (the General

[[Page 642]]

Provisions) as specified in Table 1 of this subpart. These requirements 
include, but are not limited to, the requirements specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan. The owner or operator 
of an affected source shall develop a written startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan as specified in Sec. 63.6(e)(3). This plan shall 
describe, in detail, procedures for operating and maintaining the 
affected source during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction 
and a program for corrective action for malfunctioning process and air 
pollution control equipment used to comply with this subpart. A 
provision for ceasing to collect, during a start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction, monitoring data that would otherwise be required by the 
provisions of this subpart may be included in the start-up, shutdown, 
and malfunction plan only if the owner or operator has demonstrated to 
the Administrator, through the Precompliance Report or a supplement to 
the Precompliance Report, that the monitoring system would be damaged or 
destroyed if it were not shut down during the start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction. The owner or operator of the affected source shall keep the 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan on site. In addition, if the 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan is revised, the owner or 
operator shall keep previous (i.e., superseded) versions of the start-
up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for a period of 5 years after each 
revision to the plan. If the new version of the start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction plan includes a provision for ceasing to collect, during a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, monitoring data that would otherwise 
be required, the owner or operator shall submit a supplement to the 
Precompliance Report to the Administrator for the Administrator's 
approval, documenting that the monitoring system would be damaged or 
destroyed if it were not shut down during the start-up, shutdown, or 
malfunction. Records associated with the plan shall be kept as specified 
in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. Reports related to 
the plan shall be submitted as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
    (i) The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or 
combustion, recovery, or recapture devices or continuous monitoring 
systems used to comply with this subpart during which excess emissions 
(as defined in Sec. 63.1420(h)(4)) occur.
    (B) For each start-up, shutdown, or malfunction during which excess 
emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.1420(h)(4)) occur, records reflecting 
whether the procedures specified in the affected source's start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of 
actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a 
start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing 
a combustion, recovery, or recapture device to a backup combustion, 
recovery, or recapture device, records shall be kept of whether the plan 
was followed. These records may take the form of a ``checklist,'' or 
other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.
    (ii) Reports of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction. For the 
purposes of this subpart, the semiannual start-up, shutdown, and 
malfunction reports shall be submitted on the same schedule as the 
Periodic Reports required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section instead 
of according to the general provisions' Periodic Reporting schedule 
specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(i). The reports shall include the 
information specified in Sec. 63.10(d)(5)(i).
    (2) Application for approval of construction or reconstruction. For 
new affected sources, the owner or operator shall comply with the 
General Provisions' requirements for the application for approval of 
construction or reconstruction, as specified in Sec. 63.5, excluding 
the provisions specified in Sec. 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H), (d)(1)(iii), 
(d)(2), and (d)(3)(ii).
    (c) Subpart H requirements. The owner or operator of an affected 
source shall comply with the HON equipment leak

[[Page 643]]

reporting and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H, 
except as specified in Sec. 63.1434(b) through (g).
    (d) Recordkeeping and documentation. The owner or operator required 
to keep continuous records shall keep records as specified in paragraphs 
(d)(1) through (7) of this section, unless an alternative recordkeeping 
system has been requested and approved as specified in paragraph (g) of 
this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. 
If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to Sec. 63.1432(i) 
requires continuous records, the monitoring plan shall specify which 
provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through (7) of this section 
apply. As described in Sec. 63.1432(i), certain storage vessels are not 
required to keep continuous records as specified in this paragraph. The 
owner or operator of such storage vessels shall keep records as 
specified in the monitoring plan required by Sec. 63.1432(i).
    (1) The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once 
during approximately equal 15-minute intervals.
    (2) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data 
value or block average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated 
from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured 
more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may 
be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average 
instead of all measured values. The owner or operator of process vents 
from batch unit operations shall record each measured data value.
    (3) Daily average values of each continuously monitored parameter 
shall be calculated for each operating day as specified in paragraphs 
(d)(3)(i) through (ii) of this section, except as specified in 
paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section.
    (i) The daily average value shall be calculated as the average of 
all parameter values recorded during the operating day, except as 
specified in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The calculated average 
shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous. If intermittent 
emissions episodes occur resulting in emissions being vented to a 
combustion, recapture, or recovery device for a period of less than 24 
hours in the operating day, the daily average shall be calculated based 
only on the period when emissions are being vented to the combustion, 
recapture, or recovery device. For example, if a batch unit operation 
operates such that emissions are vented to a combustion device for 6 
hours, then the daily average is the average of the temperature 
measurements taken during those 6 hours.
    (ii) The operating day shall be the 24-hour period that the owner or 
operator specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of 
Compliance Status, for purposes of determining daily average values.
    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an 
operating day are above the minimum level or below the maximum level 
established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating 
permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the 
minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and 
recording a daily average for that operating day.
    (7) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs 
(d)(7)(i) through (v) of this section shall not be included in any 
average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times 
and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process 
or combustion, recovery, or recapture device operation when monitors are 
not operating.
    (i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;
    (ii) Start-ups;
    (iii) Shutdowns;
    (iv) Malfunctions; or
    (v) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion 
thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the 
monitoring applies.
    (8) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this 
subpart, records documenting the completion of calibration checks, and 
records documenting the maintenance of continuous monitoring systems 
that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or that are 
specified in other

[[Page 644]]

written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment 
would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.
    (9) The owner or operator of an affected source granted a waiver of 
recordkeeping or reporting requirements under the General Provisions' 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements in Sec. 63.10(f) shall 
maintain the information, if any, specified by the Administrator as a 
condition of the waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
    (e) Reporting and notification. In addition to the reports and 
notifications required by 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, as specified in 
this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall prepare 
and submit the reports listed in paragraphs (e)(3) through (8) of this 
section, as applicable. All reports required by this subpart, and the 
schedule for their submittal, are listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    (1) Violation of reporting requirements. Owners and operators shall 
not be in violation of the reporting requirements of this paragraph (e) 
for failing to submit information required to be included in a specified 
report if the owner or operator meets the requirements in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. Examples of circumstances where 
this paragraph may apply include information related to newly-added 
equipment or emission points, changes in the process, changes in 
equipment required or utilized for compliance with the requirements of 
this subpart, or changes in methods or equipment for monitoring, 
recordkeeping, or reporting.

in which the information is required, the owner or operator shall submit 
the information as a supplement to that report. The information shall be 
submitted no later than 60 days after it is obtained, unless otherwise 
specified in this subpart.
    (B) If this subpart does not expressly provide for supplements, but 
the owner or operator must submit a request for revision of an operating 
permit pursuant to the State operating permit programs in part 70 or the 
Federal operating permit programs in part 71, due to circumstances to 
which the information pertains, the owner or operator shall submit the 
information with the request for revision to the operating permit.
    (C) In any case not addressed by paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall submit the information with 
the first Periodic Report, as required by this subpart, which has a 
submission deadline at least 60 days after the information is obtained.
    (2) Submittal of reports. All reports required under this subpart 
shall be sent to the Administrator at the applicable address listed in 
the General Provisions' list of addresses of State air pollution control 
agencies and EPA Regional Offices, in Sec. 63.13. If acceptable to both 
the Administrator and the owner or operator of a source, reports may be 
submitted on electronic media.

monitoring plan (required to be submitted under the HON Notification of 
Compliance Status requirements for storage vessels in Sec. 
63.120(d)(3)) specifies compliance with the parameter monitoring 
provisions of Sec. 63.1438, the owner or operator shall provide the 
information specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(ii)(A) through (C) of this 
section for each monitoring parameter. For those storage vessels for 
which the parameter monitoring plan required to be submitted under the 
HON Notification of Compliance Status requirements for storage vessels 
in Sec. 63.120(d)(2) does not require compliance with the provisions of 
Sec. 63.1438, the owner or operator shall provide the information 
specified in Sec. 63.120(d)(3) as part of the Notification of 
Compliance Status.
    (A) The required information shall include the specific maximum or 
minimum level of the monitored parameter(s) for each emission point.
    (B) The required information shall include the rationale for the

conditions in paragraph (e)(6)(viii)(A)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) A combustion, recovery, or recapture device for a particular 
emission point or process section has more excursions, as defined in 
Sec. 63.1438(f), than the number of excused excursions allowed under 
Sec. 63.1438(g) for a semiannual reporting period; or
    (2) The Administrator requests the owner or operator to submit 
quarterly reports for that emission point or process section.
    (B) The quarterly reports shall include all information specified in 
paragraphs (e)(6)(iii) through (vii) of this section, as applicable to 
the emission point or process section for which quarterly reporting is 
required under paragraph (e)(6)(viii)(A) of this section. Information

63.1420(g)(2)(ii) or (iii) shall submit a report no later than 180 days 
prior to the compliance date for those emission points.
    (8) Operating permit application. An owner or operator who submits 
an operating permit application instead of a Precompliance Report shall 
submit the information specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, as 
applicable, with the operating permit application.
    (f) Alternative monitoring parameters. The owner or operator who has 
been directed by any section of this subpart, or any section of another 
subpart referenced by this subpart, that specifically references this 
paragraph to set unique monitoring parameters, or who requests approval 
to monitor a different parameter than those listed in Sec. 63.1432 for 
storage vessels, Sec. 63.1427 for ECO, Sec. 63.1429 for process vents, 
or Sec. 63.143 for process wastewater shall submit the information 
specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section in the 
Precompliance Report, as required by paragraph (e)(4) of this section. 
The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years each record 
required by paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) The required information shall include a description of the 
parameter(s) to be monitored to ensure the combustion, recovery, or 
recapture device; control technique; or pollution prevention measure is 
operated in conformance with its design and achieves the specified 
emission limit, percent reduction, or nominal efficiency, and an 
explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).
    (2) The required information shall include a description of the 
methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the 
parameter indicates proper operation, the schedule for this 
demonstration, and a statement that the owner or operator will establish 
a level for the monitored parameter as part of the Notification of 
Compliance Status report required in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, 
unless this information has already been included in the operating 
permit application.
    (3) The required information shall include a description of the 
proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting system, to include the 
frequency and content of monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. 
Further, the rationale for the proposed monitoring, recordkeeping, and 
reporting system shall be included if either condition in paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section is met:
    (i) If monitoring and recordkeeping is not continuous; or
    (ii) If reports of daily average values will not be included in 
Periodic Reports when the monitored parameter value is above the maximum 
level or below the minimum level as established in the operating permit 
or the Notification of Compliance Status.
    (g) Alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping. An owner or 
operator choosing not to implement the continuous parameter operating 
and recordkeeping provisions listed in Sec. 63.1429 for process vents, 
and Sec. 63.1433 for wastewater, may instead request approval to use 
alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions according 
to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this 
section. Requests shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report as 
specified in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section, and shall contain the 
information specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)

[[Page 651]]

and (g)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable.
    (1) The provisions in the General Provisions requirements for the 
use of an alternative monitoring method in Sec. 63.8(f)(5)(i) shall 
govern the review and approval of requests.
    (2) An owner or operator of an affected source that does not have an 
automated monitoring and recording system capable of measuring parameter 
values at least once during approximately equal 15-minute intervals and 
that does not generate continuous records may request approval to use a 
nonautomated system with less frequent monitoring, in accordance with 
paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) The requested system shall include visual reading and recording 
of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than 
once per hour. Daily averages shall be calculated from these hourly 
values and recorded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the planned monitoring and recordkeeping 
system;
    (B) Documentation that the affected source does not have an 
automated monitoring and recording system;
    (C) Justification for requesting an alternative monitoring and 
recordkeeping system; and
    (D) Demonstration that the proposed monitoring frequency is 
sufficient to represent combustion, recovery, or recapture device 
operating conditions, considering typical variability of the specific 
process and combustion, recovery, or recapture device operating 
parameter being monitored.
    (3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated 
data compression recording system that does not record monitored 
operating parameter values at a set frequency (for example, once at 
approximately equal intervals of about 15 minutes), but that records all 
values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded 
values, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) The requested system shall be designed to:
    (A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once during 
approximately equal 15-minute intervals;
    (B) Record at least four values each hour during periods of 
operation;
    (C) Record the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;
    (D) Recognize unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not 
functioning properly, alert the operator, and record the incident;
    (E) Calculate daily average values of the monitored operating 
parameter based on all measured data; and
    (F) If the daily average is not an excursion, as defined in Sec. 
63.1438(f), the data for that operating day may be converted to hourly 
average values and the four or more individual records for each hour in 
the operating day may be discarded.
    (ii) The request shall contain:
    (A) A description of the monitoring system and data compression 
recording system, including the criteria used to determine which 
monitored values are recorded and retained;
    (B) The method for calculating daily averages; and
    (C) A demonstration that the system meets all criteria in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other 
alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in 
the General Provisions' requirements for using an alternative monitoring 
method in Sec. 63.8(f)(4).
    (h) Reduced recordkeeping program. For any parameter with respect to 
any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the 
recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section as 
alternatives to the continuous operating parameter monitoring and 
recordkeeping provisions that would otherwise apply under this subpart. 
The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years each record 
required by paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average value, 
and is not required to retain more frequent monitored operating 
parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of 
equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of 
this section are met. An owner

[[Page 652]]

or operator electing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) 
of this section shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of 
Compliance Status or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has 
already been submitted, in the Periodic Report immediately preceding 
implementation of the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or 
impossible data during periods of operation other than start-ups, 
shutdowns or malfunctions (e.g., a temperature reading of -200 [deg]C on 
a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The 
owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the 
alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
    (ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly 
throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring 
values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the 
capability to observe this running average is readily available to the 
Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator 
shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. All instances in 
an operating day constitute a single occurrence.
    (A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum 
established limits;
    (B) The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average 
values; and
    (C) The running average reflects a period of operation other than a 
start-up, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data 
during periods of operation other than start-ups, shutdowns or 
malfunctions, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging 
data are the expected operating condition based on past experience 
(e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or 
other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All 
instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a 
single occurrence.
    (iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an 
alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated 
under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is 
appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is 
being monitored.
    (v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the 
monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements 
of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, at the times specified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (C) of this section. The owner or 
operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.
    (A) Upon initial installation.
    (B) Annually after initial installation.
    (C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting 
the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the 
monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this 
section.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in 
paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section.
    (A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, 
for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.
    (B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and how 
compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs 
(h)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The description shall identify 
the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) for each 
required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall 
retain both the current and the most recent superseded description, as 
specified in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.
    (C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring 
system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
    (D) The owner or operator subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this 
section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as 
long as the

[[Page 653]]

description is current. The current description shall, at all times, be 
retained on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or 
other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The 
owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions for at least 
5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded descriptions shall 
be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer 
or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request) for 
at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, superseded 
descriptions may be stored off-site.
    (2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a monitored 
parameter with respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 
consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in 
paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer 
required to record the daily average value, for any operating day when 
the daily average is less than the maximum, or greater than the minimum 
established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data 
generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited 
toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and 
the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance 
date was required and/or approved by the Administrator.
    (i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average 
values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next 
Periodic Report. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit 
of equipment.
    (ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased 
recording daily average values as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining 
the daily average value for each operating day and shall notify the 
Administrator in the next Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall 
continue to retain each daily average value until another period of 6 
consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in 
paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, for the duration specified in 
paragraph (h) of this section. For any calendar week, if compliance with 
paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does not result in 
retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter 
value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one 
parameter value during a period of operation other than a start-up, 
shutdown, or malfunction.
    (iv) For the purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, an excursion 
means that the daily average of monitoring data for a parameter is 
greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value, 
except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if the owner or operator operates the 
source during such periods in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1).
    (B) An excused excursion, as described in Sec. 63.1438(g), shall 
not be considered an excursion for the purposes of paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section.
