                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

must, at the time of filing the document, also file a written statement 
certifying service on each interested party, showing the document 
involved, the name and address of the party served, and the date of 
service.
    (b) If an appeal is filed with the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, 
a copy of the notice of appeal shall also be sent to the Assistant 
Secretary--Indian Affairs. The notice of appeal sent to the Interior 
Board of Indian Appeals shall certify that a copy has been sent to the 
Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs.
    (c) If the appellant is an Indian or Indian tribe not represented by 
counsel, the official with whom the appeal is filed (i.e., official 
making the decision being appealed) shall, in the manner prescribed in 
this section, personally or by mail serve a copy of all appeal documents 
on the official who will decide the appeal and on each interested party 
known to the official making such service.
    (d) Service of any document under this part shall be by personal 
delivery or by mail to the record address as specified in Sec. 2.14. 
Service on a tribe shall be to the principal or designated tribal 
official or to the governing body.
    (e) In all cases where a party is represented by an attorney in an 
appeal, service of any document on the attorney is service on the party 
represented. Where a party is represented by more than one attorney, 
service on any one attorney is sufficient. The certificate of service on 
an attorney shall include the name of the party whom the attorney 
represents and indicate that service was made on the attorney 
representing that party.
    (f) When an official deciding an appeal determines that there has 
not been service of a document affecting a person's interest, the 
official shall either serve the document on the person or direct the 
appropriate legal counsel to serve the document on the person and allow 
the person an opportunity to respond.

document shall forward the document to the proper office promptly. If a

appeal document to an incorrect address, no extension of time should be 
allowed because of the time necessary for a Bureau office to redirect 
the document to the correct address.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an official 
deciding an appeal shall allow late filing of a misdirected document, 
including a notice of appeal, where the official finds that the

do so.

PART 10_INDIAN COUNTRY DETENTION FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS--Table of Contents



Sec.
10.1 Why are policies and standards needed for Indian country detention 
          programs?

          operation, services, and physical plant/construction of Indian

          facilities?
10.6 How is the BIA assured that the policies and standards are being

10.7 Where do I find help or receive technical assistance in complying 
          with the policies and standards?

          detention, community residential, or holding facility in 
          Indian country?

          representative, get the BIA policies and standards?

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 25 U.S.C. 2, 9, 13, 2417, 2453, and 2802.

    Source: 61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 10.1  Why are policies and standards needed for Indian country detention programs?

    Policies and standards are required to ensure that all Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA) and tribal entities that receive Federal funding 
for the operation, maintenance, design and construction or renovation of 
detention facilities, community residential, or holding facilities are 
supporting constitutional rights and are complying with the Indian Law 
Enforcement Reform Act of 1990. Self-governance tribes and tribes with 
limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this 
part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. The provision for funding 
tribes for detention programs under the Indian Alcohol and Substance 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Public Law 99-570, (25 U.S.C. 2453) 
requires standards and procedures for such facilities.

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 10.2  Who is responsible for developing and maintaining the policies and standards for detention and holding facilities in Indian country?

    The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services who reports to the 
Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs, BIA, establishes policies, 
procedures, and standards for the operations, design, planning, 
maintenance, renovation, and construction of detention programs in the 
BIA and by tribal contract under Indian Self-Determination and Education 
Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450.


<R05>
Sec. 10.3  Who must follow these policies and standards?

    You must follow these minimum policies, standards, and guides if you 
are part of the BIA or tribal detention or rehabilitation program 
receiving Federal funding. Self-governance tribes and tribes with 
limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this 
part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. Detention officers, guards, 
cooks and other staff conducting business in the facilities must meet 
minimum standards of law enforcement personnel as prescribed in 25 CFR 
part 12, subpart D, ``Qualifications and Training Requirements.'' Those 
tribal programs not receiving Federal funding under the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93-638, as 
amended) who wish to be accredited are encouraged to use the policies 
and standards in that

[[Page 18]]

part since they have been modified and approved for Indian country.


<R05>
Sec. 10.4  What happens if the policies and standards are not followed?

    The risk for human and civil rights violations due to lack of common 
standards will subject the operation and/or facility to unnecessary 
exposure to liability. Lack of employee standards, particularly for 
training and background checks, will increase the risk of misconduct and 
vicarious liability of the tribes and the Federal government through 
tort claims. Funding sources for detention programs may become scarce to 
nonexistent because of contract noncompliance. The tribes' opportunity 
to receive funding from potential resource sharing agreements with other 
law enforcement agencies may be damaged because the facility may have to 
be closed for cause due to violation of the life safety codes.


<R05>
Sec. 10.5  Where can I find the policies and standards for the administration, operation, services, and physical plant/construction of Indian country 
          detention, community residential, and holding facilities?

    The Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, maintains 
a manual of policies and procedures called the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
Manual (BIAM). The chapter 69 BIAM titled ``Indian Country Detention 
Facilities and Programs,'' contains the BIA's policies, procedures, and 
standards for detention and holding programs in Indian country. The 
standards for the programs within the BIAM are in handbook format for 
easy field reference and use. Copies of the chapter 69 BIAM and 
handbooks may be obtained from the Director, Office of Law Enforcement 
Services.

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 10.6  How is the BIA assured that the policies and standards are being applied uniformly and facilities are properly accredited?

    The tribes and BIA programs will use a phased approach to meeting 
all non-mandatory detention standards and will document progress on 
uniform reporting. The BIA Office of Law Enforcement Services will 
conduct periodic operational evaluations for oversight.


<R05>
Sec. 10.7  Where do I find help or receive technical assistance in complying with the policies and standards?

    The BIA has a trained Detention Specialist on the staff of the 
Office of Law Enforcement Services, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who is 
available to conduct evaluations and provide technical assistance or 
guidance in all facets of Indian country detention programs.


<R05>
Sec. 10.8  What minimum records must be kept and reports made at each detention, community residential, or holding facility in Indian country?

    The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services, BIA, will develop 
all necessary requirements for maintaining records, reporting data, and 
archiving information. These requirements will be published in 69 BIAM, 
``Indian Country Detention Facilities and Programs.''

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 10.9  If a person is detained or incarcerated in an Indian country detention, community residential, or holding facility, how would they know what their 
          rights, privileges, safety, protection and expected behavior 
          would be?

    When an individual is incarcerated in an Indian country detention, 
community residential, or holding facility, he/she will be given, or in 
some cases notified of the availability of, an Inmate Handbook. This 
book of guidelines describes in detail the inmate's rights, privileges, 
protection and safety, cleanliness and sanitation, and general health 
and nutritional standards. The Inmate Handbook describes the emergency 
evacuation procedures, medical, counseling, rehabilitation services, 
visitation procedures, and other appropriate information. The Inmate 
Handbook is published by the Director, Office of Law Enforcement 
Services and maintained by the detention facility administrator at each 
facility location.

[61 FR 34374, July 2, 1996; 61 FR 65473, Dec. 13, 1996]

[[Page 19]]


<R05>
Sec. 10.10  What happens if I believe my civil rights have been violated while incarcerated in an Indian country detention or holding facility?

    All allegations of civil rights violations must be reported 
immediately to the Internal Affairs Branch of the Office of Law 
Enforcement Services. This office will ensure that such allegations are 
immediately reported to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department 
of Justice through established procedures. The BIA Internal Affairs 
Branch may also investigate alleged violations and make recommendations 
for additional action as necessary. Detailed instructions on the 
procedure to report violations can be found in the Inmate Handbook.


<R05>
Sec. 10.11  How would someone detained or incarcerated, or their representative, get the BIA policies and standards?

    At each detention, community residential, or holding facility 
located in a tribal jurisdiction where federal funds are used for 
operations or maintenance programs, the BIA's policies, standards, and 
procedures will be made available upon request. The Inmate Handbook will 
be made available to all persons at the time they are incarcerated or 
detained in a facility. There may be times when this may be delayed due 
to the physical or mental condition of the person at time of 
incarceration. In these cases, the Inmate Handbook will be made 
available when the person is deemed receptive and cognizant by the 
detention officer in charge. All policies, standards, procedures, and 
guidelines are available at each facility to the public or by writing to 
the Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services.

court shall place the minor in a foster care or shelter care facility 
which has been approved by the tribe, and follow the adoption procedures 
of the tribe, or, in their absence, the adoption procedures of the state 
within which it is located.
    (2) If parental rights to a child are not terminated, the children's 
court shall make a disposition according to Sec. 11.1112 of this part.
    (g) The termination order constitutes a final order for purposes of 
appeal.
    (h) No adjudication of termination of parental rights shall affect

    (b) Public reporting for this information collection is estimated to 
average .25 hours per response, including the time for reviewing 
instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and 
reviewing the information collection. Direct comments regarding the 
burden estimate or any other aspect of this information collection to 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Information Collection Clearance Officer, 
Room 336-SIB, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240; and the Office

<R04>
                       Subpart A_Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 12.1  Who is responsible for the Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement function?

    The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, or in the absence of a 
Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner, is responsible for Bureau of 
Indian Affairs-operated and contracted law enforcement programs, and for 
overall policy development and implementation of the Indian Law 
Enforcement Reform Act, Public Law 101-379 (25 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 12.2  What is the role of the Bureau of Indian Affairs Director of Law Enforcement Services?

    The Director of the Office of Law Enforcement Services for the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (Director) has been delegated the 
responsibility for the development of law enforcement and detention 
policies, standards, and management of all Bureau of Indian Affairs 
(BIA) criminal investigations, drug enforcement, training, internal 
affairs, inspection and evaluation, emergency response forces, and other 
national level Indian country law enforcement initiatives. The Director 
publishes these policies and standards in law enforcement manuals and 
handbooks. The Director is also directly responsible for developing 
crime prevention and outreach programs within Indian country law 
enforcement.


<R05>
Sec. 12.3  Who supervises Bureau of Indian Affairs criminal investigators?

    All BIA criminal investigators are supervised by other criminal 
investigators within the Office of Law Enforcement Services.

[[Page 60]]


<R05>
Sec. 12.4  Who supervises the Bureau of Indian Affairs uniformed police, detention, and conservation enforcement functions?

    The agency superintendent is directly responsible for the operation 
and management of BIA uniformed police operations, detention facilities, 
and conservation enforcement operations at any agency having these 
programs. The agency superintendent must also ensure technical support 
is provided to any agency contracting the law enforcement and/or 
detention program.


<R04>
                    Subpart B_Policies and Standards


<R05>
Sec. 12.11  Do I have to follow these regulations?

    You must follow the minimum standards outlined in the regulations in 
this part if you are part of a BIA or tribal law enforcement program 
receiving Federal funding or operating under a BIA law enforcement 
commission.


<R05>
Sec. 12.12  What about self-determination?

    The regulations in this part are not intended to discourage 
contracting of Indian country law enforcement programs under the Indian 
Self-determination and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638, as 
amended, 25 U.S.C. 450). The Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs will 
ensure minimum standards are maintained in high risk activities where 
the Federal government retains liability and the responsibility for 
settling tort claims arising from contracted law enforcement programs. 
It is not fair to law abiding citizens of Indian country to have 
anything less than a professional law enforcement program in their 
community. Indian country law enforcement programs that receive Federal 
funding and/or commissioning will be subject to a periodic inspection or 
evaluation to provide technical assistance, to ensure compliance with 
minimum Federal standards, and to identify necessary changes or 
improvements to BIA policies.


<R05>
Sec. 12.13  What happens if I do not follow the rules in this part?

    Your BIA law enforcement commission may be revoked, your law 
enforcement contract may be canceled, and you may no longer be eligible 
for tribal shares allocated from the law enforcement budget.


<R05>
Sec. 12.14  Where can I find specific policies and standards for law enforcement functions in Indian country?

    BIA will ensure that all Indian country law enforcement programs are 
provided a copy of the most current policy manuals and handbooks. Every 
Indian country law enforcement program covered by the regulations in 
this part must maintain an effective and efficient law enforcement 
program meeting minimal qualitative standards and procedures specified 
in chapter 68 Bureau of Indian Affairs Manual (BIAM) and the Law 
Enforcement Handbook.


<R04>
                  Subpart C_Authority and Jurisdiction


<R05>
Sec. 12.21  What authority is given to Indian country law enforcement officers to perform their duties?

    BIA law enforcement officers are commissioned under the authority 
established in 25 U.S.C. 2803. BIA may issue law enforcement commissions 
to other Federal, State, local and tribal full-time certified law 
enforcement officers to obtain active assistance in enforcing applicable 
Federal criminal statutes, including Federal hunting and fishing 
regulations, in Indian country.
    (a) BIA will issue commissions to other Federal, State, local and 
tribal full-time certified law enforcement officers only after the head 
of the local government or Federal agency completes an agreement with 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs asking that BIA issue delegated 
commissions. The agreement must include language that allows the BIA to 
evaluate the effectiveness of these special law enforcement commissions 
and to investigate any allegations of misuse of authority.
    (b) Tribal law enforcement officers operating under a BIA contract 
or compact are not automatically commissioned as Federal officers; 
however, they may be commissioned on a case-by-case basis.

[[Page 61]]


<R05>
Sec. 12.22  Can Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement officers enforce tribal laws?

    BIA officers will enforce tribal laws only with the permission of 
the tribe. Local programs are encouraged to make arrangements and 
agreements with local jurisdictions to facilitate law enforcement 
objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 12.23  What are the jurisdictional limits in Indian country?

    The Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice must 
maintain and periodically review and update a memorandum of 
understanding describing the relationship between the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the investigation and 
prosecution of major crimes in Indian country. Any law enforcement 
programs performing duties under the authority of 25 U.S.C. 2803 must 
follow the guidelines in the memorandum of understanding and any local 
United States Attorney's guidelines for the investigation and 
prosecution of Federal crimes.


<R04>
           Subpart D_Qualifications and Training Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 12.31  Are there any minimum employment standards for Indian country law enforcement personnel?

    The Director must develop, maintain, and periodically review the 
qualification standards, including medical qualification standards, for 
all BIA law enforcement, detention, and conservation enforcement 
occupational series. The standards will be no less stringent than the 
minimum standards established by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) for these occupational series, and may exceed the OPM standards. 
BIA standards are available for review at any BIA personnel office. All 
tribal programs are encouraged to develop standards at least as 
stringent as those established for BIA officers.


<R05>
Sec. 12.32  Do minimum employment standards include a background investigation?

    Law enforcement authority is only entrusted to personnel possessing 
adequate education and/or experience, training, aptitude, and high moral 
character. All Indian country law enforcement programs receiving Federal 
funding and/or authority must ensure that all law enforcement officers 
successfully complete a thorough background investigation no less 
stringent than required of a Federal officer performing the same duties. 
The background investigations of applicants and employees must be 
adjudicated by trained and qualified security professionals. All 
background investigations must be documented and available for 
inspection by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 12.33  Are Indian country law enforcement officers paid less than other law enforcement officers?

    An officer's pay is determined by his/her grade and classification. 
The Commissioner of Indian Affairs must ensure that all BIA law 
enforcement officer positions are established at no lower grade level on 
the Federal scale than similar Federal law enforcement officer positions 
in other agencies. No BIA position performing commissioned law 
enforcement duties will be classified in other than the GS 0083, police 
officer series, for uniformed officers and the GS 1811, criminal 
investigating series, for criminal investigators.


<R05>
Sec. 12.34  Do minimum salaries and position classifications apply to a tribe that has contracted or compacted law enforcement under self-determination?

    Any contract or compact with the BIA to provide law enforcement 
services for an Indian tribe must require a law enforcement officer to 
be paid at least the same salary as a BIA officer performing the same 
duties.


<R05>
Sec. 12.35  Do Indian country law enforcement officers complete any special training?

    Law enforcement personnel of any program funded by the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs must not perform law enforcement duties until they have 
successfully completed a basic law enforcement training course 
prescribed by the Director. The Director will also prescribe mandatory 
supplemental and in-service training courses.

[[Page 62]]


<R05>
Sec. 12.36  Does other law enforcement training count?

    All requests for evaluation of equivalent training must be submitted 
to the Indian Police Academy for review, with final determination made 
by the Director. Requests for a waiver of training requirements to use 
personnel before completing the required courses of instruction must be 
submitted to the Director and approved or disapproved by the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In no case will such a waiver allow 
personnel to be used in any position for more than one year without 
achieving training standards. Failure to complete basic training 
requirements will result in removal from a law enforcement position.


<R04>
                    Subpart E_Records and Information


<R05>
Sec. 12.41  Who keeps statistics for Indian country law enforcement activities?

    The Director maintains a criminal justice information system for 
Indian country. The Director will prescribe the types of data to be 
collected and the reporting format to be used to collect information and 
assemble reports on crime reported in Indian country. These reports may 
be provided to the Department of Justice. Any law enforcement program 
receiving funding from the BIA must use the same reporting format and 
submit the same statistical reports to the Office of Law Enforcement 
Services as prescribed by the Director and as are required of all BIA 
law enforcement programs.


<R05>
Sec. 12.42  Do Indian country law enforcement programs share information with their own communities or other agencies?

    At intervals established by the Director, each BIA criminal 
investigations program, and any investigations program receiving BIA 
funds will consult with local tribal leaders and managers of local 
patrol and detention programs. They will discuss the quality of the 
local investigations program and offer feedback and technical 
assistance. There will be no requirement to disclose confidential 
investigative information or to compromise ongoing investigations during 
this process.


<R04>
                            Subpart F_Conduct


<R05>
Sec. 12.51  Must Indian country law enforcement officers follow a code of conduct?

    All law enforcement programs receiving Bureau of Indian Affairs 
funding or commissioning must establish a law enforcement code of 
conduct which establishes specific guidelines for conduct on and off 
duty, impartiality, and professional conduct in the performance of duty, 
and acceptance of gifts or favors. Each officer must acknowledge in 
writing receiving and understanding of this code of conduct. The 
acknowledgment will remain on file with the law enforcement program 
manager as long as the officer is employed there. Training will be 
conducted on this code of conduct and other ethics issues at least once 
each year.


<R05>
Sec. 12.52  How do I report misconduct?

    The Director will develop and maintain a reporting system that 
allows any resident of or visitor to Indian country to report officer 
misconduct. Each law enforcement program in Indian country will maintain 
instructions on how to register a complaint. An overview of these steps 
must be posted for public viewing at each law enforcement facility in 
Indian country.


<R05>
Sec. 12.53  Who investigates officer misconduct?

    The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services maintains an 
internal affairs program that investigates all allegations of misconduct 
by BIA officers, and any officer receiving funding and/or authority from 
the BIA. All allegations of misconduct must be thoroughly investigated 
and appropriate action taken when warranted. Any person having knowledge 
of officer misconduct must report that information to the officer's 
supervisor. The supervisor must immediately report allegations to the 
internal affairs unit. Depending upon the severity of the allegation, 
the matter may be dealt with locally or it will be investigated by the 
internal affairs unit. Failure of any BIA employee to report known 
allegations may be considered misconduct in

[[Page 63]]

itself. Citizens may report officer misconduct directly to the internal 
affairs unit if that is more practical.


<R05>
Sec. 12.54  What can I do if I believe my civil rights have been violated?

    All allegations of civil rights violations must be reported 
immediately to the internal affairs unit. That office will ensure that 
allegations are immediately reported to the Civil Rights Division of the 
U. S. Department of Justice through established procedures. BIA's 
internal affairs unit may also investigate the matter and make 
recommendations for additional action as necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 12.55  Are there any limits on how much force an officer can use when performing law enforcement duties?

    The Director will develop and maintain the use of force policy for 
all BIA law enforcement personnel, and for programs receiving BIA 
funding or authority. Training in the use of force, to include non-
lethal measures, will be provided annually. All officers will 
successfully complete a course of instruction in firearms, to include 
judgement pistol shooting, approved by the Indian Police Academy before 
carrying a firearm on or off duty.


<R04>
                       Subpart G_Support Functions


<R05>
Sec. 12.61  Can I be paid for information that helps solve a crime?

    The Director can spend money to purchase evidence or information, or 
to offer a reward, in the investigation of a crime. This is subject to 
the availability of funds. This authority may be delegated in writing to 
supervisory criminal investigators within the Office of Law Enforcement 
Services in the BIA. The Director must develop policies and procedures 
for the expenditure, control, and audit of these funds before their use.


<R05>
Sec. 12.62  Who decides what uniform an Indian country law enforcement officer can wear and who pays for it?

    Each local law enforcement program must establish its own uniform 
requirements for patrol and detention personnel. Uniformed BIA police 
officers may be paid an annual uniform allowance not to exceed $400. 
Local programs may provide uniforms and related equipment to officers in 
lieu of this payment. All law enforcement officers must also have their 
official identification on their person at all times when performing law 
enforcement duties. Uniforms, when worn, will be plainly distinguishable 
from the uniforms of any non-law enforcement personnel working on the 
reservation.


<R05>
Sec. 12.63  Do Indian country law enforcement officers perform other duties as well?

    Law enforcement commissions will only be issued by the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs to persons occupying positions as full-time officers. 
Bureau of Indian Affairs funded or commissioned criminal investigators 
will not be responsible for supervising or managing any patrol, 
detention, or other uniformed police programs.

                            Subpart A_Purpose


<R05>
Sec. 13.1  Purpose.

    (a) The regulations of this part establish the procedures by which 
an Indian tribe that occupies a reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 
1903(10) over which a state asserts any jurisdiction pursuant to the 
provisions of the Act of August 15, 1953 (67 Stat. 588) Pub. L. 83-280, 
or

[[Page 64]]

pursuant to any other federal law (including any special federal law 
applicable only to a tribe or tribes in Oklahoma), may reassume 
jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings as authorized by the 
Indian Child Welfare Act, Pub. L. 95-608, 92 Stat. 3069, 25 U.S.C. 1918.
    (b) On some reservations there are disputes concerning whether 
certain federal statutes have subjected Indian child custody proceedings 
to state jurisdiction or whether any such jurisdiction conferred on a 
state is exclusive of tribal jurisdiction. Tribes located on those 
reservations may wish to exercise exclusive jurisdiction or other 
jurisdiction currently exercised by the state without the necessity of 
engaging in protracted litigation. The procedures in this part also 
permit such tribes to secure unquestioned exclusive, concurrent or 
partial jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters without 
relinquishing their claim that no Federal statute had ever deprived them 
of that jurisdiction.
    (c) Some tribes may wish to join together in a consortium to 
establish a single entity that will exercise jurisdiction over all their 
members located on the reservations of tribes participating in the 
consortium. These regulations also provide a procedure by which tribes 
may reassume jurisdiction through such a consortium.
    (d) These regulations also provide for limited reassumptions 
including jurisdiction restricted to cases transferred from state courts 
under 25 U.S.C. 1911(b) and jurisdiction over limited geographical 
areas.
    (e) Unless the petition for reassumption specifically states 
otherwise, where a tribe reassumes jurisdiction over the reservation it 
occupies, any land or community occupied by that tribe which 
subsequently acquires the status of reservation as defined in 25 U.S.C. 
1903(10) also becomes subject to tribal jurisdiction over Indian child 
custody matters.


<R05>
Sec. 13.2  Information collection.

    The information collection requirement contained in Sec. 13.11 has 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1076-0112. The information is 
being collected when federally recognized tribes request reassumption of 
jurisdiction over child custody proceedings. The information will be 
used to determine if reassumption of jurisdiction over Indian child 
custody proceedings is feasible. Response is required to obtain a 
benefit.

                         Subpart B_Reassumption


<R05>
Sec. 13.11  Contents of reassumption petitions.

    (a) Each petition to reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody 
proceedings and the accompanying plan shall contain, where available,

to determine whether reassumption is feasible:
    (1) Full name, address and telephone number of the petitioning tribe 
or tribes.
    (2) A resolution by the tribal governing body supporting the 
petition and plan. If the territory involved is occupied by more than 
one tribe and jurisdiction is to be reassumed over all Indians residing 
in the territory, the governing body of each tribe involved must adopt 
such a resolution. A tribe that shares territory with another tribe or 
tribes may reassume jurisdiction only over its own members without 
obtaining the consent of the other tribe or tribes. Where a group of 
tribes form a consortium to reassume jurisdiction, the governing body of 
each participating tribe must submit a resolution.
    (3) The proposed date on which jurisdiction would be reassumed.
    (4) Estimated total number of members in the petitioning tribe or 
tribes, together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.
    (5) Current criteria for membership in the tribe or tribes.

child custody proceeding may determine whether a particular individual 
is a member of a petitioning tribe.
    (7) Citation to provision in tribal constitution or similar 
governing document, if any, that authorizes the tribal

[[Page 65]]

governing body to exercise jurisdiction over Indian child custody 
matters.
    (8) Description of the tribal court as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(12) 
that has been or will be established to exercise jurisdiction over 
Indian child custody matters. The description shall include an 
organization chart and budget for the court. The source and amount of 
non-tribal funds that will be used to fund the court shall be 
identified. Funds that will become available only when the tribe 
reassumes jurisdiction may be included.
    (9) Copy of any tribal ordinances or tribal court rules establishing 
procedures or rules for the exercise of jurisdiction over child custody 
matters.
    (10) Description of child and family support services that will be 
available to the tribe or tribes when jurisdiction reassumed. Such 
services include any resource to maintain family stability or provide 
support for an Indian child in the absence of a family--regardless of 
whether or not they are the type of services traditionally employed by 
social services agencies. The description shall include not only those 
resources of the tribe itself, but also any state or federal resources 
that will continue to be available after reassumption of jurisdiction.
    (11) Estimate of the number of child custody cases expected during a 
year together with an explanation of how the number was estimated.
    (12) Copy of any tribal agreements with states, other tribes or non-
Indian local governments relating to child custody matters.
    (b) If the petition is for jurisdiction other than transferral 
jurisdiction under 25 U.S.C. 1911(b), the following information shall 
also be included in the petition and plan:
    (1) Citation of the statute or statutes upon which the state has 
based its assertion of jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters.
    (2) Clear and definite description of the territory over which 
jurisdiction will be reassumed together with a statement of the size of 
the territory in square miles.
    (3) If a statute upon which the state bases its assertion of 
jurisdiction is a surplus land statute, a clear and definite description 
of the reservation boundaries that will be reestablished for purposes of 
the Indian Child Welfare Act.
    (4) Estimated total number of Indian children residing in the 
affected territory together with an explanation of how the number was 
estimated.


<R05>
Sec. 13.12  Criteria for approval of reassumption petitions.

    (a) The Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs shall approve a tribal 
petition to reassume jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters if:
    (1) Any reservation, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903(10), presently 
affected by the petition is presently occupied by the petitioning tribe 
or tribes;
    (2) The constitution or other governing document, if any, of the 
petitioning tribe or tribes authorizes the tribal governing body or 
bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Indian child custody matters;
    (3) The information and documents required by Sec. 13.11 of this 
part have been provided;

Rights Act, 25 U.S.C. 1302;
    (5) Child care services sufficient to meet the needs of most 
children the tribal court finds must be removed from parental custody 
are available or will be available at the time of reassumption of 
jurisdiction; and
    (6) The tribe or tribes have established a procedure for clearly 
identifying persons who will be subject to the jurisdiction of the tribe 
or tribes upon reassumption of jurisdiction.
    (b) If the technical assistance provided by the Bureau to the tribe 
to correct any deficiency which the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs 
has identified as a basis for disapproving a petition for reassumption 
of exclusive jurisdiction has proved unsuccessful in eliminating 
entirely such problem, the Bureau, at the request of the tribe, shall 
assist the tribe to assert whatever partial jurisdiction as provided in 
25 U.S.C. 1918(b) that is feasible and desired by the tribe. In the 
alternative,

[[Page 66]]

the Bureau, if requested by the concerned tribe, shall assist the tribe 
to enter into agreements with a state or states regarding the care and 
custody of Indian children and jurisdiction over Indian child custody 
proceedings, including agreements which may provide for the orderly 
transfer of jurisdiction to the tribe on a case-by-case basis or 
agreements which provide for concurrent jurisdiction between the state 
and the Indian tribe.


<R05>
Sec. 13.13  Technical assistance prior to petitioning.

    (a) Upon the request of a tribe desiring to reassume jurisdiction 
over Indian child custody matters, Bureau agency and Area Offices shall 
provide technical assistance and make available any pertinent documents, 
records, maps or reports in the Bureau's possession to enable the tribe 
to meet the requirements for Secretarial approval of the petition.

available, the Bureau may provide funding under the procedures 
established under 25 CFR 23.22 to assist the tribe in developing the 
tribal court and child care services that will be needed when 
jurisdiction is reassumed.


<R05>
Sec. 13.14  Secretarial review procedure.

    (a) Upon receipt of the petition, the Assistant Secretary--Indian 
Affairs shall cause to be published in the Federal Register a notice 
stating that the petition has been received and is under review and that 
it may be inspected and copied at the Bureau agency office that serves 
the petitioning tribe or tribes.
    (1) No final action shall be taken until 45 days after the petition

representation shall be undertaken to the extent that the Field 
Solicitor in his discretion shall consider necessary to discharge said 
duties, with due regard to the complexity of the legal action 
contemplated, the availability of staff attorneys for such purposes, the 
value and extent of the restricted interests involved, possible 
conflicts between Indians claiming to be owners of such interests, the 
preference of such owners concerning legal representation, the financial 
resources available to such owners, the extent to which such owners 
require similar legal services in connection with their unrestricted 
properties, and any other factor appropriate for consideration.

Tribes for whom legal assistance should be rendered pursuant to the 
regulations in this part. Similarly, to the extent that such information 
may be useful for Bureau action or records, the Field Solicitor shall 
advise the Bureau of court proceedings, information received, and

action taken in furnishing legal services pursuant to the regulations in 
this part.

Sec. 16.5  Acceptance and acknowledgement of service of process.

    Service by the Field Solicitor or any other person of any process or

acknowledged by the Field Solicitor, or by any attorney authorized to 
perform the duties specified in Sec. 16.3, on behalf of the Secretary

of the official to be served (such as the Secretary, superintendent for 
the Five Civilized Tribes, Probate Attorney, etc.).

Sec. 16.6  Authority of attorneys in State court litigation.

    Attorneys authorized to perform the duties specified in Sec. 16.3

including but not limited to the filing or decision against filing of 
initial, responsive, or supplemental pleadings and appeals from adverse 
judgments, the exercise or decision against exercise of a preferential 
right to purchase property subject to sale, the removal or decision 
against removal of actions to Federal courts, and the waiver or decision 
against waiver of the failure to make timely service of process or 
notice.


<R05>
Sec. 16.7  Performance of Federal functions by successor State courts.

    All authority to perform functions relating to Indians of the Five 
Civilized Tribes which by express provisions of Federal statute had been 
conferred upon probate or county courts of Oklahoma before such county 
courts were abolished on January 12, 1969, has since that date been 
vested in the successor district courts of that State, and all rights of 
litigants continue undiminished in the successor forum, including the 
right to appeal from adverse decisions rendered therein to the successor 
appellate court.

    Where information, furnished by the Bureau pursuant to Sec. 16.4 or 
otherwise obtained, reveals that the estate of a deceased Indian of the 
Five Civilized Tribes contains no restricted land but consists of a 
restricted interest in funds not exceeding $500 on deposit to the credit 
of the decedent, the Field Solicitor shall, in the absence of any final 
decree determining the heirs or legatees of the decedent, prepare and 
furnish to the Bureau a finding and order of distribution, based on 
affidavit or other proof of death and heirship or bequest, setting forth 
the facts of death and heirship or bequest and the amount payable from 
the estate to each person determined to be an heir or legatee of the 
decedent. The Field Solicitor shall mail to each person considered a 
possible claimant to any portion of the estate, as an heir or legatee or 
otherwise, a copy of the order with a notice that the order shall become 
final 30 days after the date of mailing thereof unless within that 
period the officer by whom the order was signed shall have received a 
written request for reconsideration of the order. After final action on

of any final decree determining that the decedent died without heirs or 
devisees, prepare and furnish to the Bureau a finding and order of 
escheat, based on affidavit or other proof

[[Page 79]]

of intestate death without heirs, setting forth the restricted interests 
in lands or rents or profits therefrom which have by escheat vested in 
the tribe which allotted the lands. The Field Solicitor shall mail to 
each person considered a possible claimant to any portion of the estate, 
as an heir or devisee or otherwise, a copy of the order with a notice 
that the order shall become final 30 days after the date of mailing 
thereof unless within that period the officer by whom the order was 
signed shall have received a written request for reconsideration of the 
order. After final action on any order has been taken by the Field 
Solicitor, the Bureau shall cause a certified copy thereof to be filed 
in the land records of each county within which are located any 
escheated lands described therein and shall cause the tribe to be 
credited with any funds in said estate which arose from rents or profits 
from such lands, unless a timely appeal therefrom has been filed in

    (1) All eligible Indians residing within the service area will be 
served; and
    (2) The proposed service area will not include counties or parts 
thereof that have reasonably available comparable services.
    (b) Additional documentation showing that:
    (1) The area is administratively feasible (that is, an adequate 
level of services can be provided to the eligible Indians residing in 
the area.);

recommendations to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary can 
make a determination to approve or disapprove and publish notice of the 
designation of service area and the Indians to be served in the Federal 
Register. Tribes currently providing services are not required to 
request designation for service areas unless they make a decision to 
modify their existing service areas.

Office of Self-Governance will establish a tentative funding level based 
upon best estimates for caseload and expenditures.
    (c) A Bureau servicing office can administer a tribal redesign plan 
as requested by a tribal resolution.


<R05>
Sec. 20.206  Must a tribe get approval for a tribal redesign plan?

    (a) Under Public Law 104-193, the Bureau must use the same TANF 
payment standard (and any associated rateable reduction) that exists in 
the state or service area where the applicant or recipient resides. This 
payment standard is the amount from which the Bureau subtracts net 
income and resources to determine General Assistance eligibility and 
payment levels;
    (b) If the state does not have a standard for an adult, we will use 
either the difference between the standard for a child and the standard 
for a household of two, or one-half of the standard for a household of 
two, whichever is greater; and
    (c) If the state does not have a TANF program, we will use the AFDC

Sec. 23.3  Policy.

    In enacting the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-608, 
the Congress has declared that it is the policy of this Nation to 
protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the 
stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the 
establishment of minimum Federal standards to prevent the arbitrary 
removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure 
that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed 
in child custody proceedings (25 U.S.C. 1902). Indian child and family 
service programs receiving title II funds and operated by federally 
recognized Indian tribes and off-reservation Indian organizations shall 
reflect the unique values of Indian culture and promote the stability 
and security of Indian children, Indian families and Indian communities. 
It is the policy of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to emphasize and 
facilitate the comprehensive design, development and implementation of 
Indian child and family service programs in coordination with other 
Federal, state, local, and tribal programs which strengthen and preserve 
Indian families and Indian tribes.

    (a) Grants awarded under this subpart are for the establishment and 
operation of tribally designed Indian child and family service programs. 
The objective of every Indian child and family service program shall be 
to prevent the breakup of Indian families and to ensure that the

Indian parent or Indian custodian shall be a last resort. Such child and 
family service programs may include, but need not be limited to:
    (1) A system for licensing or otherwise regulating Indian foster and 
adoptive homes, such as establishing tribal standards for approval of 
on-reservation foster or adoptive homes;

treatment of Indian families and for the temporary custody of Indian 
children with the goal of strengthening Indian families and preventing 
parent-child separations;

protective day care and afterschool care, recreational activities, 
respite care, and employment support services with the goal of 
strengthening Indian families and contributing to family stability;

preventing the removal of children due to

[[Page 116]]

unsafe home environments by making homes safer, but not to make 
extensive structural home improvements;
    (5) The employment of professional and other trained personnel to 
assist the tribal court in the disposition of domestic relations and 
child welfare matters, but not to establish tribal court systems;
    (6) Education and training of Indians, including tribal court judges 
and staff, in skills relating to child and family assistance and service 
programs;
    (7) A subsidy program under which Indian adoptive children not 
eligible for state or BIA subsidy programs may be provided support 
comparable to that for which they could be eligible as foster children, 
taking into account the appropriate state standards of support for 
maintenance and medical needs;
    (8) Guidance, legal representation and advice to Indian families 
involved in tribal, state, or Federal child custody proceedings; and
    (9) Other programs designed to meet the intent and purposes of the 
Act.
    (b) Grants may be provided to tribes in the preparation and 
implementation of child welfare codes within their jurisdiction or 
pursuant to a tribal-state agreement.
    (c) Grantees under this subpart may enhance their capabilities by 
utilizing ICWA funds as non-Federal matching shares in connection with 
funds provided under titles IV-B, IV-E and XX of the Social Security Act 
or other Federal programs which contribute to and promote the intent and 
purposes of the Act through the provision of comprehensive child and 
family services in coordination with other tribal, Federal, state, and 
local resources available for the same purpose.
    (d) Program income resulting from the operation of programs under 
this subpart, such as day care operations, may be retained and used for 
purposes similar to those for which the grant was awarded.

child and family service programs emphasizing the prevention of Indian 
family breakups, proper and current documented evidence that repeated 
attempts to obtain services have been unsuccessful;

of the proposed program or services and their overall relation to the 
organization's funding base, activities, and mission;
    (12) The degree to which the detailed annual budget and 
justification for the requested funds are consistent with, and clearly 
supported by, the proposed plan and by appropriate program services and 
activities for the applicable grant year;
    (13) The applicant's identification of any consultants and/or

will be prioritized in accordance with announcements made in the Federal 
Register pursuant to Sec. 23.31 (b) for the applicable year(s).
    (e) Continued annual funding of a multi-year grant award to an off-
reservation ICWA program under this subpart shall be contingent upon the 
availability of appropriated funds and upon the existing grant program 
receiving a satisfactory program evaluation from the area social 
services office for the previous year of operation. A copy of this

persons eligible under the Act to request such information. The chief 
tribal enrollment officer of the BIA is authorized to disclose 
enrollment information relating to an adopted Indian child where the 
biological parents have by affidavit

that the child's parentage and other circumstances entitle the child to 
enrollment consideration under the criteria established by the tribe.

               Subpart A_Defining Adequate Yearly Progress


<R05>
Sec. 30.102  Does the Act require the Secretary of the Interior to develop a definition of AYP for Bureau-funded schools?

    Yes, the Act requires the Secretary to develop a definition of AYP 
through negotiated rulemaking. In developing the Secretary's definition 
of AYP, the No Child Left Behind Negotiated Rulemaking Committee 
(Committee) considered a variety of options. In choosing the definition 
in Sec. 30.104, the Committee in no way intended to diminish the 
Secretary's trust responsibility for Indian education or any statutory 
rights in law. Nothing in this part:
    (a) Affects in any way the sovereign rights of tribes; or
    (b) Terminates or changes the trust responsibility of the United 
States to Indian tribes or individual Indians.


<R05>
Sec. 30.103  Did the Committee consider a separate Bureau definition of AYP?

    Yes, the Committee considered having the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
develop a separate Bureau definition of AYP. For a variety of reasons, 
the Committee reached consensus on the definition in Sec. 30.104. This 
definition is in no way intended to diminish the United States' trust 
responsibility for Indian education nor is it intended to give States 
authority over Bureau-funded schools.


<R05>
Sec. 30.104  What is the Secretary's definition of AYP?

    The Secretary defines AYP as follows. The definition meets the 
requirements in 20 U.S.C. 6311(b).
    (a) Effective in the 2005-2006 school year, the academic content and 
student achievement standards, assessments, and the definition of AYP 
are those of the State where the school is located, unless an 
alternative definition of AYP is proposed by the tribal governing body 
or school board and approved by the Secretary.
    (1) If the geographic boundaries of the school include more than one 
State, the tribal governing body or school board may choose the State 
definition it desires. Such decision shall be communicated to the 
Secretary in writing.
    (2) This section does not mean that the school is under the 
jurisdiction of the State for any purpose, rather a reference to the 
State is solely for the purpose of using the State's assessment, 
academic content and student achievement standards, and definition of 
AYP.
    (3) The use of the State's definition of AYP does not diminish or 
alter the Federal Government's trust responsibility for Indian 
education.
    (b) School boards or tribal governing bodies may seek a waiver that 
may include developing their own definition of AYP, or adopting or 
modifying an existing definition of AYP that has been accepted by the 
Department of Education. The Secretary is committed to providing 
technical assistance to a school, or a group of schools, to develop an 
alternative definition of AYP.

                      Alternative Definition of AYP


<R05>
Sec. 30.105  May a tribal governing body or school board use another definition of AYP?

    Yes. A tribal governing body or school board may waive all or part 
of the Secretary's definition of academic content and achievement 
standards, assessments, and AYP. However, unless an alternative 
definition is approved

[[Page 136]]

under Sec. 30.113, the school must use the Secretary's definition of 
academic content and achievement standards, assessments, and AYP.


<R05>
Sec. 30.106  How does a tribal governing body or school board propose an alternative definition of AYP?

    If a tribal governing body or school board decides that the 
definition of AYP in Sec. 30.104 is inappropriate, it may decide to 
waive all or part of the definition. Within 60 days of the decision to 
waive, the tribal governing body or school board must submit to the 
Secretary a proposal for an alternative definition of AYP. The proposal 
must meet the requirements of 20 U.S.C. 6311(b) and 34 CFR 200.13-
200.20, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of the 
school or schools and the students served.


<R05>
Sec. 30.107  What must a tribal governing body or school board include in its alternative definition of AYP?

    (a) An alternative definition of AYP must meet the requirements of 
20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(2) of the Act and 34 CFR 200.13-200.20, taking into 
account the unique circumstances and needs of the school or schools and 
the students served.
    (b) In accordance with 20 U.S.C. 6311(b) of the Act and 34 CFR 
200.13-200.20, an alternative definition of AYP must:
    (1) Apply the same high standards of academic achievement to all 
students;
    (2) Be statistically valid and reliable;
    (3) Result in continuous and substantial academic improvement for 
all students;
    (4) Measure the progress of all students based on a high-quality 
assessment system that includes, at a minimum, academic assessments in 
mathematics and reading or language arts;
    (5) Measure progress separately for reading or language arts and for 
mathematics;
    (6) Unless disaggregation of data cannot yield statistically 
reliable information or reveals personally identifiable information, 
apply the same annual measurable objectives to each of the following:
    (i) The achievement of all students; and
    (ii) The achievement of economically disadvantaged students, 
students from major racial or ethnic groups, students with disabilities, 
and students with limited English proficiency;
    (7) Establish a starting point;
    (8) Create a timeline to ensure that all students are proficient by 
the 2013-2014 school year;
    (9) Establish annual measurable objectives;
    (10) Establish intermediate goals;
    (11) Include at least one other academic indicator which, for any 
school with a 12th grade, must be graduation rate; and
    (12) Ensure that at least 95 percent of the students enrolled in 
each group under Sec. 30.107(b)(6) are assessed.
    (c) If a Bureau-funded school's alternative definition of AYP does 
not use a State's academic content and student achievement standards and 
academic assessments, the school must include with its alternative 
definition the academic standards and assessment it proposes to use. 
These standards and assessments must meet the requirements in 20 U.S.C. 
6311(b) and 34 CFR 200.1-200.9.


<R05>
Sec. 30.108  May an alternative definition of AYP use parts of the Secretary's definition?

    Yes, a tribal governing body or school board may take part of the 
Secretary's definition and propose to waive the remainder. The proposed 
alternative definition of AYP must, however, include both the parts of 
the Secretary's AYP definition the tribal governing body or school board 
is adopting and those parts the tribal governing body or school board is 
proposing to change.

                          Technical Assistance


<R05>
Sec. 30.109  Will the Secretary provide assistance in developing an alternative AYP definition?

    Yes, the Secretary through the Bureau, shall provide technical 
assistance either directly or through contract to the tribal governing 
body or the school board in developing an alternative AYP definition. A 
tribal governing body or school board needing assistance must submit a 
request to the Director of

[[Page 137]]

OIEP under Sec. 30.110. In providing assistance, the Secretary may 
consult with the Secretary of Education and may use funds supplied by 
the Secretary of Education in accordance with 20 U.S.C. 7301.


<R05>
Sec. 30.110  What is the process for requesting technical assistance to develop an alternative definition of AYP?

    (a) The tribal governing body or school board requesting technical 
assistance to develop an alternative definition of AYP must submit a 
written request to the Director of OIEP, specifying the form of 
assistance it requires.
    (b) The Director of OIEP must acknowledge receipt of the request for 
technical assistance within 10 days of receiving the request.
    (c) No later than 30 days after receiving the original request, the 
Director of OIEP will identify a point of contact. This contact will 
immediately begin working with the tribal governing body or school board 
to jointly develop the specifics of the technical assistance, including 
identifying the form, substance, and timeline for the assistance.


<R05>
Sec. 30.111  When should the tribal governing body or school board request technical assistance?

    In order to maximize the time the tribal governing body or school 
board has to develop an alternative definition of AYP and to provide 
full opportunity for technical assistance, the tribal governing body or 
school board should request technical assistance before formally 
notifying the Secretary of its intention to waive the Secretary's 
definition of AYP.

                   Approval of Alternative Definition


<R05>
Sec. 30.113  How does the Secretary review and approve an alternative definition of AYP?

    (a) The tribal governing body or school board submits a proposed 
alternative definition of AYP to the Director, OIEP within 60 days of 
its decision to waive the Secretary's definition.
    (b) Within 60 days of receiving a proposed alternative definition of 
AYP, OIEP will notify the tribal governing body or the school board of:
    (1) Whether the proposed alternative definition is complete; and
    (2) If the definition is complete, an estimated timetable for the 
final decision.
    (c) If the proposed alternative definition is incomplete, OIEP will 
provide the tribal governing body or school board with technical 
assistance to complete the proposed alternative definition of AYP, 
including identifying what additional items are necessary.
    (d) The Secretaries will review the proposed alternative definition 
of AYP to determine whether it is consistent with the requirements of 20 
U.S.C. 6311(b). This review must take into account the unique 
circumstances and needs of the schools and students.
    (e) The Secretaries shall approve the alternative definition of AYP 
if it is consistent with the requirements of 20 U.S.C. 6311(b), taking 
into consideration the unique circumstances and needs of the school or 
schools and the students served.
    (f) If the Secretaries approve the alternative definition of AYP:
    (1) The Secretary shall promptly notify the tribal governing body or 
school board; and
    (2) The alternate definition of AYP will become effective at the 
start of the following school year.
    (g) The Secretaries will disapprove the alternative definition of 
AYP if it is not consistent with the requirements of 20 U.S.C. 6311(b). 
If the alternative definition is disapproved, the tribal governing body 
or school board will be notified of the following:
    (1) That the definition is disapproved; and
    (2) The reasons why the proposed alternative definition does not 
meet the requirements of 20 U.S.C. 6311(b).
    (h) If the Secretaries deny a proposed definition under paragraph 
(g) of this section, they shall provide technical assistance to overcome 
the basis for the denial.

              Subpart B_Assessing Adequate Yearly Progress


<R05>
Sec. 30.114  Which students must be assessed?

    All students in grades three through eight and at least once in 
grades ten

[[Page 138]]

through twelve who are enrolled in a Bureau-funded school must be 
assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 30.115  Which students' performance data must be included for purposes of AYP?

    The performance data of all students assessed pursuant to Sec. 
30.114 must be included for purposes of AYP if the student is enrolled 
in a Bureau-funded school for a full academic year as defined by the 
Secretary or by an approved alternative definition of AYP.


<R05>
Sec. 30.116  If a school fails to achieve its annual measurable objectives, what other methods may it use to determine whether it made AYP?

    A school makes AYP if each group of students identified in Sec. 
30.107(b)(6) meets or exceeds the annual measurable objectives and 
participation rate identified in Sec. Sec. 30.107(b)(9) and 
30.107(b)(12) respectively, and the school meets the other academic 
indicators identified in Sec. 30.107(b)(11). If a school fails to 
achieve its annual measurable objectives for any group identified in 
Sec. 30.107(b)(6), there are two other methods it may use to determine 
whether it made AYP:
    (a) Method A--``Safe Harbor.'' Under ``safe harbor,'' the following 
requirements must be met for each group referenced under Sec. 
30.107(b)(6) that does not achieve the school's annual measurable 
objectives:
    (1) In each group that does not achieve the school's annual 
measurable objectives, the percentage of students who were below the 
``proficient'' level of academic achievement decreased by at least 10 
percent from the preceding school year; and
    (2) The students in that group made progress on one or more of the 
other academic indicators; and
    (3) Not less than 95 percent of the students in that group 
participated in the assessment.
    (b) Method B--Uniform Averaging Procedure. A school may use uniform 
averaging. Under this procedure, the school may average data from the 
school year with data from one or two school years immediately preceding 
that school year and determine if the resulting average makes AYP.

Tribes and Alaska Native villages with the Federal Government as 
affirmed by the

[[Page 143]]

United States Constitution, U.S. Supreme Court decisions, treaties, 
Federal statutes, and Executive Orders, and as set out in the 
Congressional declaration in sections 2 and 3 of the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638; 88 Stat. 
2203; 25 U.S.C. 450 and 450a), it is the responsibility and goal of the 
Federal government to provide comprehensive education programs and 
services for Indians and Alaska Natives. As acknowledged in section 5 of 
the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-608; 92 Stat. 3069; 25 
U.S.C. 1901), in the Federal Government's protection and preservation of 
Indian Tribes and Alaska Native villages and their resources, there is 
no resource more vital to such Tribes and villages than their young 
people and the Federal Government has a direct interest, as trustee, in 
protecting Indian and Alaska Native children, including their education. 
The mission of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Indian Education 
Programs, is to provide quality education opportunities from early 
childhood through life in accordance with the Tribes' needs for cultural 
and economic well-being in keeping with the wide diversity of Indian 
Tribes and Alaska Native villages as distinct cultural and governmental 
entities. The Bureau shall manifest consideration of the whole person, 
taking into account the spiritual, mental, physical and cultural aspects 
of the person within family and Tribal or Alaska Native village 
contexts.


<R05>
Sec. 32.4  Policies.

    In carrying out its Education mission, the Assistant Secretary for

    (i) Choice of school. Afford Indian and Alaska Native students the 
opportunity to attend local day schools and other schools of choice and

81-874), Johnson-O'Malley, and all Elementary and Secondary Education

    (s) Planning, maintenance and use of facilities. (1) Ensure that the 
needs of the students and Tribal or Alaska Native community will receive

differential shall only be authorized in writing when the Director 
determines that:
    (i) It is warranted by the geographic isolation of the work site or 
other unusually difficult environmental working or living conditions 
and/or,
    (ii) It is necessary as a recruitment or retention incentive. This 
staffing differential is to be computed on the basic schedule rate 
before any other additions are computed.
    (2) Special rates may be established for recruitment and retention 
applicable only to a specific position or to specific types of positions 
in specific locations based on a formally documented request by an ASE 
or AEPA and submitted to the Director for approval.
    (f) Payment of compensation to educators. This section applies to

Pub. L. 95-561 or title 5 U.S.C.
    (1) Pay periods. Educators shall be paid on the basis of a biweekly 
pay period during the term of the contract. Chapter 55 of title 5 U.S.C.

with respect to the receipt of pay by educators during summer recess 
under certain circumstances.

the end of the academic school term.
    (iii) No educator shall suffer a loss of pay or benefits because of 
elections made under this section.

additional activities to provide services to students or otherwise 
support the school's academic and social programs.
    (i) The Director is authorized to establish a schedule of stipends 
for each Bureau Area, taking into consideration types of activities to 
be compensated and payments provided by public school districts in or 
near the Area.

Sec. 38.7  Appointment of educators.

    (a) Local school employees. Local Bureau school employees shall be 
appointed only by the school supervisor. Before the local school 
employee is employed, the school board shall be consulted. An 
individual's appointment may be finalized only upon receipt of a formal 
written determination certified by the local school board under such 
uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school 
board should be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 
30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall 
have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The local school 
board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an appointment. 
The school supervisor may appeal to the ASE, or, where appropriate, to 
the AEPA, any determination by the local school board concerning an 
individual's appointment. A written statement of appeal describing the 
action and the reasons the supervisor believes such action should be 
overturned must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the action from 
the local school board. A copy of such statement shall be submitted to 
the school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to 
respond, not to exceed 10 calendar days, in writing, to the appeal. 
After reviewing such written appeal and response, the ASE or AEPA may, 
for cause, overturn the action of the local school board. The ASE or 
AEPA must transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a 
written opinion) to the board and to the supervisor identifying the 
reasons for overturning the action within 10 calender days. Failure to 
act within the 10 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving 
the local school board's determination.
    (b) School supervisors. School supervisors may be appointed only by 
the ASE, except the AEPA shall appoint school supervisors for off-
reservation boarding schools and those few other schools supervised by 
the AEPA. The school board shall be consulted before the school 
supervisor is employed. The appointment may be finalized upon receipt of 
a formal written determination certified by the school board under any 
uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by the school 
board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 
days. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall have 
the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The school board shall 
use the same procedure to disapprove an appontment. Within 20 calendar 
days of receipt of any determination by the school board concerning an 
individual's appointment, the ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, may appeal to 
the Director by filing a written statement describing the determination 
and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination should be 
overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the local 
school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to respond, 
within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such an appeal. The Director may 
reverse the determination for cause set out in writing to the school 
board. Within 20 calendar days of the school board's response, the 
Director

[[Page 175]]

shall transmit the determination of the appeal (in the form of a written 
opinion) to the board and to the ASE or AEPA identifying the reasons for 
overturning the determination. Failure by the Director to act within the 
20 calendar day period shall have the effect of approving the school 
board's determination.
    (c) Agency office education program employees. Appointments to 
Agency office education positions may be made only by the ASE. The 
Agency school board shall be consulted before the agency education 
employee is employed, and the appointment may be finalized upon receipt 
of a formal, written determination certified by the Agency school board 
under any uniform procedures as it may adopt. Written determination by 
the school board shall be received within a reasonable period, but not 
to exceed 30 days. Failure of the school board to act within this period 
shall have the effect of approving the proposed appointment. The Agency 
school board shall use the same written procedure to disapprove an 
appointment. Within 20 calendar days of receipt of any determination by 
the school board concerning an individual's appointment, the ASE may 
appeal to the Director by filing a written statement describing the 
determination and the reasons the supervisor believes the determination 
should be overturned. A copy of the statement shall be submitted to the 
Agency school board and the board shall be afforded an opportunity to 
respond, within 10 calendar days, in writing, to such appeal. After 
reviewing the written appeal and response, the Director may, for cause, 
overturn the determination of the Agency school board. Within 20 days of 
the board's response, the Director shall transmit the determination of 
the appeal (in the form of a written opinion) to the board and to the 
ASE identifying the reasons for overturning the determination. Failure 
of the Director to act within the 20 calendar day period shall have the 
effect of approving the school's board's determination.
    (d) Employment contracts. The Bureau shall issue employment 
contracts each year for individuals employed in contract education 
positions at the Agency or school levels.
    (e) Absence of local school boards. Where a local school board has 
not been established in accordance with section 1139(7) Pub. L. 95-561 
with respect to a Bureau school, or where a school board is not 
operational, and the local school board is required to be given a notice 
or required to be consulted by statute or these regulations, the 
official involved shall notify or consult with the Agency school board 
serving the tribe(s) to which the parents of the Indian children 
atending that school belong, or, in that absence, the tribal 
organization(s) of the tribe(s) involved.
    (f) Provisional contracts. Provisional certification or other 
limited certificates from the State are not considered full 
certification and only a provisional contract may be issued. There may 
be circumstances when no individual who has met the full certification 
or experience requirements is available for a professional position or 
when a status quo employee who does not meet full certification or 
experience requirements desires to convert to contract. When this 
situation exists, a provisional contract may be issued in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) The contract will be made only:
    (i) After it is determined that an individual already meeting 
certification or experience requirements is not available; or
    (ii) For conversion of a status quo employee who does not yet meet 
all established position requirements.
    (2) Consultation with the appropriate school board is required prior 
to the contract.
    (3) The contract may be of 12-month or school-term duration.
    (4) The employee will be required to make satisfactory progress 
toward meeting full qualification requirements.
    (5) If the employee fails to meet the requirements established under 
Sec. 38.7(f)(4), the contract will be terminated. Such termination 
cannot be grieved or appealed.
    (g) Conditional appointment. As provided in section 1131(d)(4), Pub. 
L. 95-561, if an individual who has applied at both the national and 
local levels is appointed from a local list of applicants, the 
appointment shall be conditional

[[Page 176]]

for 90 days. During that period, the individual's application and 
background shall be examined to determine if there is a more qualified 
individual for the position. Removal during this period is not subject 
to discharge, hearing or grievance procedures.
    (h) Short-term contracts. (1) There may be circumstances where 
immediate action is necessary and it is impossible to consult with the 
local school board. When this situation exists short-term contracts may 
be made by the school supervisor in accordance with the following:
    (i) The length of the contract will not exceed 60 days, or the next 
regularly scheduled school board meeting, whichever comes first.
    (ii) If the board meets and does not take action on the individual 
in question, the short-term contract may be extended for the duration of 
the school year.
    (iii) It shall be the responsibility of the school supervisor to 
fully inform the local school board of all such short-term contracts. 
Failure to do so may be cited as reason to discharge the school 
supervisor if so requested by the board.
    (2) The local school board may authorize the school supervisor to 
make an emergency short-term contract to classroom, dormitory and other 
positions directly related to the health and safety of students. When 
this situation exists, short-term contracts may be made in accordance 
with the following:
    (i) If local and agency lists of qualified applicants are exhausted, 
short-term contracts may be made without regard to qualifications for 
the position;
    (ii) The pay level will be based on the qualifications of the 
individual employed rather than the requirements of the position, if the 
qualifications of the individual are lower than required;
    (iii) The short-term contract may not exceed the school term and may 
not be renewed or extended;
    (iv) Every 60 days the school supervisor will determine if qualified 
individuals have been placed on the local or agency lists. If a 
qualified individual on the list accepts employment, the school 
supervisor must terminate the emergency appointment at the time the 
qualified individual is appointed.
    (i) Temporary contracts. There may be circumstances where a specific 
position is needed for a period of one year or less. Under these 
conditions a position may be advertised as a temporary position and be 
filled under a temporary contract. Such contract requires the same 
school board approval as a school year contract. If required for the 
completion of the activities specified in the original announcement, the 
position, may with school board approval be extended for up to one 
additional year. Temporary contracts may be terminated at any time and 
this action is not subject to approval or grievance procedures.
    (j) Waiver of Indian preference. Notwithstanding any provision of 
the Indian preference laws, such laws shall not apply in the case of any 
personnel action within the purview of this section respecting an 
application or employee not entitled to Indian preference if each tribal 
organization concerned grants, in writing, a waiver of the application 
of such laws with respect to such personnel action, where such a waiver 
is in writing deemed to be a necessity by the tribal organization, 
except that this shall in no way relieve the Bureau of its 
responsibility to issue timely and adequate announcements and 
advertisements concerning any such personnel action if it is intended to 
fill a vacancy (no matter how such vacancy is created). When a waiver is 
granted, it shall apply only to that particular position and as long as 
the employee remains in that position.
    (k) Prohibited reappointment. An educator who voluntarily terminates 
employment before the end of the school term may not be appointed to 
another Bureau education position before the beginning of the following 
school term. An educator will not be deemed to have voluntarily 
terminated employment if transferred elsewhere with the consent of the 
local school or Agency boards.
    (l) Contract renewals. The appropriate school board shall be 
notified in writing by the school supervisor and/or ASE or AEPA not less 
than 90 days before the end of the school term whether or not an 
individual's contract is recommended for renewal.

[[Page 177]]

    (1) If the school board disagrees with the school supervisor's or 
ASE's or AEPA's recommendations, the board will submit a formal, written 
certification of its determinations to the school supervisor or ASE or 
AEPA within 25 days. If the board's determinations are not received 
within the 25 days, the school supervisor or ASE or AEPA shall issue the 
60 day notification of renewal or nonrenawal to the individual as 
required under Sec. 38.8.
    (2) When the school board submits its determination within the 25 
days and determines that a contract will be renewed, or nonrenewed, the 
appropriate official shall issue the required renewal notice, or 
nonrenawal, or appeal the determination of the school board to the 
appropriate official who will make a determination in accordance with 
the appeal procedure is Sec. 38.7(a) of this part. After the 
probationary period, if the determination is that the contract will not 
be renewed, the procedures specified in Sec. 38.8 shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 38.8  Nonrenewal of contract.

    Where the determination is made that an employee's contract shall 
not be renewed for the following year, the following procedure will 
apply to those employees who have completed three full continuous school 
terms of service under consecutive contract appointments and 
satisfactory performance in the same or comparable education positions.
    (a) The employee will be given a written notice of the action and 
the reasons thereof not less than 60 days before the end of the school 
term.
    (b) The employee will be given 10 calendar days to request an 
informal hearing before the appropriate official or body. Upon request, 
the employee may be given official time, not to exceed eight hours, to 
prepare a written response to the reason(s).
    (c) If so requested, an informal hearing shall be held within 30 
calendar days of receipt of the request.
    (d) The appropriate official or body will render a written 
determination within seven calendar days after the informal hearing.
    (e) The employee has a right to request an administrative review by 
the ASE or AEPA of the determination within 10 calendar days of that 
determination. The ASE or AEPA then has 20 calendar days to render a 
final decision. Where the employee is the supervisor of the school or an 
agency education employee, any appeal of the ASE or AEPA would be 
addressed to the Director for a decision. If the Director or ASE's or 
AEPA's decision overturns the appropriate official or bodies 
determination, the appropriate official or body will be notified of the 
reasons in writing. Failure by the Director or ASE or AEPA to act within 
the 20 days will sustain the determination. This completes the 
administrative appeal process.
    (f) Failure of any of the parties to meet the requirements of the 
above procedures will serve to negate the particular action sought by 
the negligent party.
    (g) Those employees with less than three full continuous school 
terms of consecutive contract appointments are serving a probationary 
period. Nonrenewal of his/her contract will be considered a continuation 
of the examining process. This action cannot be appealed or grieved.
    (h) Independent of the procedures outlined in this section, the 
school supervisor or ASE or AEPA, for applicable positions, shall be 
required to submit to the ASE or AEPA or appropriate higher authority 
all nonrenewal actions. Within 60 days, the ASE or AEPA shall review the 
nonrenewal actions and may overturn the determination of nonrenewal. In 
the event that the ASE or AEPA makes a decision to overturn the school 
board determination, the ASE or AEPA shall notify the school board in 
writing of his/her reasons for doing so.
    (i) No more than the substantial standard of evidence shall be 
required to sustain the nonrenewal.
    (j) A procedural error shall not be grounds for overturning a 
determination of nonrenewal unless the employee shows harmful error in 
the application of the Agency's procedures in arriving at such a 
decision. For purposes of this section, ``harmful error'' means error by 
the Agency in the application of its procedures which, in the absence or 
cure of the error, might have caused

[[Page 178]]

the Agency to reach a conclusion different than the one reached. The 
burden is upon the appellant to show that based upon the record as a 
whole, the error was harmful. i.e., caused substantial harm or prejudice 
to his/her rights.
    (k) Nonrenewal of a contract is not discharge and will not follow 
the discharge procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 38.9  Discharge of educators.

    (a) Discharge for cause. Educators covered under the provision of 
this section are excluded from coverage under 5 U.S.C. 7511 and 4303. In 
order to provide due process for educators, the Director shall publish 
in 62 BIAM representative conditions that could result in the discharge 
of educators for cause and procedures to be followed in discharge cases.
    (b) Discharge for inadequate performance. Action to remove educators 
for inadequate performance will be taken for failure to meet performance 
standards established under 5 U.S.C. 4302. Performance standards for all 
educators will include, among others, lack of student achievement. 
Willful failure to exercise properly assigned supervisory 
responsibilities by supervisors shall also be cause for discharge.
    (c) Other discharge. The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM a 
description of the budgetary and programmatic conditions that may result 
in the discharge of educators for other than cause during the school 
term. The individual's personnel record will clearly reflect that the 
action taken is based upon budgetary or programmatic restraints and is 
not a reflection on the employee's performance.
    (d) Procedures for discharge for cause. The Director shall publish 
in 62 BIAM the procedural steps to be followed by school supervisors, 
ASE's, and AEPA's in discharge for cause cases. These procedures shall 
provide (among other things) for the following:
    (1) The educator to be discharged shall receive a written notice of 
the proposal, specifying the causes or complaints upon which the 
proposal is based, not less than 30 calendar days before the discharge. 
However, this shall not prohibit the exclusion of the individual from 
the education facility in cases where exclusion is required for the 
safety of the students or the orderly operation of the facility.
    (2) A reasonable time, but not less than 10 calendar days, will be 
allotted for the individual to make written and/or oral responses to the 
charge.
    (3) An opportunity will be afforded the individual to review the 
material relied upon to support the charge.
    (4) Official time, not to exceed eight hours, will be provided to 
the individual to prepare a response to the charge.
    (5) The educator may elect to have a representative and shall 
furnish the identity of any representative to the ASE or AEPA. The ASE 
or AEPA may disallow, as an employee representative, any individual 
whose activities as a representative would cause a conflict of interest 
or position, or an employee whose release from his or her official 
position would give rise to unreasonable costs to the Government, or 
when priority work assignment precludes his or her release from official 
duties. The terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and 
5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(5) shall govern representation of employees in an 
exclusive bargaining unit.
    (6) The individual has a right to a final decision made by the 
appropriate level of supervision.
    (7) The individual has a right to appeal the final decision and have 
the merits of the case reviewed by a Departmental official not 
previously involved in the case. This right includes entitlement to a 
hearing upon request under procedures in accordance with the 
requirements of due process under section 1131(e)(1)(B) of Pub. L. 95-
561.
    (e) School board action. (1) The appropriate school board shall be 
notified as soon as possible, but in no case later than 10 calendar days 
from the date of issue of the notice of intent to discharge.
    (2) The appropriate school board, under any uniform procedure as it 
may adopt, may issue a formal written certification to the school 
supervisor, ASE, or AEPA either approving or disapproving the discharge 
before the expiration of the notice period and before actual discharge. 
Failure to respond

[[Page 179]]

before the expiration of the notice period will have the effect of 
approving the discharge.
    (3) The school supervisor initiating a discharge action may appeal 
the board's determination to the ASE or AEPA within 10 calendar days of 
receipt of the board's notice. The ASE or AEPA initiating a discharge 
may appeal the board's determination to the Director within 10 calendar 
days of receipt of the board's notice. Within 20 calendar days following 
the receipt of an appeal, the reviewing official may, for good cause, 
reverse the school board's determination by a notice in writing to the 
board. Failure to act within 20 calendar days shall have the effect of 
approving the board's determination.
    (f) School board recommendations for discharge. School boards may 
recommend in writing to school supervisors, ASE's, or AEPA's, and the 
Director that individuals in the education program be discharged. These 
written recommendations may follow any procedures formally established 
internally by the school board or tribal government. However, the 
written recommendations must contain specific causes or complaints that 
may be verified or established by investigation of factual situations. 
The official receiving a board recommendation for discharge of an 
individual shall acknowledge the recommendation in writing within 10 
calendar days of receipt and proceed with a fact finding investigation. 
The official who finally disposes of the recommendation shall notify the 
school board of the disposition in writing within 60 calendar days of 
initiation of the fact finding investigation.


<R05>
Sec. 38.10  Conditions of employment of educators.

    (a) Supervision not delegated to school boards. School boards may 
not direct, control, or interrupt the day-to-day activities of BIA 
employees carrying out Bureau-operated education programs.
    (b) Employee handbook. Employee handbook and recruiting guides shall 
be developed by each local school or agency to provide specific 
information regarding:
    (1) The working and hiring conditions for various tribal 
jurisdictions and Bureau locations;
    (2) The need for all education personnel to adapt to local 
situations; and
    (3) The requirement of all education personnel to comply with and 
support duly adopted school board policies, including those relating to 
tribal culture or language.
    (c) Contract renewal notification. Employees will be notified 60 
calendar days before the end of the school term of the intent to renew 
or not renew their contract. If an individual's contract is to be 
renewed, the individual must agree in writing to serve for the next 
school term. This agreement must be received within 14 calendar days of 
the date of the notice in order to complete the contract renewal. If 
this agreement is not received by the fourteenth day, the employee has 
voluntarily forfeited his or her right to continuing employment. If an 
individual agrees to serve for the next school term and fails to report 
for duty at the beginning of the next school term, the contract will be 
terminated and the individual's future appointment will be subject to 
the restriction in Sec. 38.7(k) of this part.
    (d) Dual compensation. An employee accepting a renewal of a school 
term contract may be appointed to another Federal position during the 
school recess period without regard to the dual compensation regulations 
in 5 U.S.C. 5533.
    (e) Discrimination complaints. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
procedures established under 29 CFR part 1613 are applicable to contract 
employees under this part. It is the policy of the BIA that all 
employees and applicants for employment shall be treated equally when 
considered for employment or benefits of employment, regardless of race, 
color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or mental or physical health 
(handicap), within the parameters of Indian preference.
    (f) Grievance procedures. The Director shall publish in 62 BIAM 
procedures for the rapid and equitable resolution of grievances. In 
locations and for positions covered by an exclusive bargaining 
agreement, the negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive

[[Page 180]]

avenue of redress for all matters within the scope of the negotiated 
grievance procedure.
    (g) Performance evaluation. The minimum number of times a supervisor 
shall meet with an employee to discuss performance and suggest 
improvements shall be once every three months for the educator's first 
year at a school or Agency, and twice annually thereafter during the 
school term.


<R05>
Sec. 38.11  Length of the regular school term.

    The length of the regular school term shall be at least 180 student 
instructional days, unless a waiver has been granted under the 
provisions of 25 CFR 36.61.


<R05>
Sec. 38.12  Leave system for education personnel.

    (a) Full-time school-term employees. Employees on a full-time 
school-term contract are authorized the following types of leave:
    (1) Personal leave. A school-term employee will receive 28 hours of 
personal leave to be used for personal reasons and 12 hours of emergency 
leave. This leave only accrues provided the length of the contract 
exceeds 24 weeks.
    (i) The school-term employee will request the use of this leave in 
advance when it is for personal use or personal business (e.g., going to 
the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for emergency purposes 
(e.g., death in immediate family), it will be requested immediately 
after the emergency is known, if possible, by the employee and before 
leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports to work on the 
official work day.
    (ii) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be 
taken only during the school term. No compensation for or carryover of 
unused leave is authorized.
    (2) Sick leave. Sick leave is an absence approved by the supervisor 
for incapacity from duty due to injury or illness, not related to or 
incurred on-the-job and not covered by the Federal Employee's 
Compensation Act Regulations. Medical and dental appointments may be 
included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental 
appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.
    (i) Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of four hours each biweekly 
pay period in pay status during the term of the contract; and no 
precredit or advance of sick leave is authorized.
    (ii) Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be 
recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of 
separation.
    (3) School vacation. School term employees may receive up to 136 
hours of school vacation time for use when school is not in session. 
School vacations are scheduled on the annual school calendar during the 
instructional year and may not be scheduled before the first day of 
student instruction or after the last day of student instruction. School 
vacations are not a right of the employee and cannot be paid for or 
carried over if the employee is required to work during the school 
vacation time or if the program will not permit school term employees to 
take such vacation time.
    (b) Leave for full-time, year-long employees. Employees who are on a 
full-time, year-long contract are authorized the following types of 
leave:
    (1) Vacation leave. Absence approved in advance by the supervisor 
for rest and relaxation or other personal reasons is authorized on a per 
year basis of Federal Government service as follows: years 1 and 2 of 
employment--120 hours; years 3-5 of employment--160 hours; 6 or more 
years--200 hours. The supervisor will determine when vacation leave may 
be used. Vacation leave is to be scheduled and used to the greatest 
extent possible during periods when school is not in session and the 
students are not in the dormitories. Vacation leave is credited to an 
employee on the day following his or her date of employment, provided 
the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks. An employee may carry into 
succeeding years up to 200 hours of vacation leave. Leave unused at the 
time of separation is forfeited.
    (2) Sick leave. Sick leave accumulation and use is authorized on the 
same basis as for school term employees under Sec. 38.12(a)(2) of this 
part.
    (c) Leave for part-time year-long employees. Employees who are on 
part-

[[Page 181]]

time year-long contracts exceeding 20 hours per week are authorized the 
following types of leave:
    (1) Vacation leave. Absence approved in advance by the supervisor 
for rest and relaxation or other personal reasons is authorized on a per 
year basis of Federal Government service as follows: years 1 and 2 of 
employment--64 hours; years 3-5 of employment--80 hours; 6 or more 
years--104 hours. The supervisor shall determine when vacation leave may 
be used. Vacation leave is to be scheduled and used to the greatest 
extent possible during periods when school is not in session and the 
students are not in the dormitories. Vacation leave is credited to an 
employee on the day following his or her date of employment provided the 
length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks and may not be accumulated in 
excess of 104 hours from year to year. An employee may carry over up to 
104 hours from one contract year to the next. Leave unused at the time 
of separation is forfeited.
    (2) Sick leave. Sick leave is accumulated on the basis of three 
hours each biweekly pay period in pay status; no precredit or advance of 
sick leave is authorized. Accumulated sick leave at the time of 
separation will be recredited to an educator who is reemployed within 
three years of separation.
    (d) Leave for school term employees on a part-time work schedule in 
excess of 20 hours per week. (1) Employees on a part-time work schedule 
in excess of 20 hours per week may receive a maximum of 102 hours of 
school vacation time; 20 hours of personal/emergency leave; and 63 hours 
of sick leave accrued at three hours per pay period for the first 21 pay 
periods of their contracts. Personal/emergency leave only accrues 
provided the length of the contract exceeds 24 weeks.
    (2) The part-time employee will request the use of this leave in 
writing in advance when it is for personal use or personal business 
(e.g., going to the bank, etc.). When this leave is requested for 
emergency purposes (e.g., death in immediate family), it will be 
requested immediately after the emergency is known, if possible, by the 
employee and before leave is taken or as soon as the supervisor reports 
to work on the official work day.
    (3) Final approval rests with the supervisor. This leave shall be 
taken only during the school year. No compensation for or carryover of 
unused leave is authorized.
    (4) Sick leave. Sick leave is an absence approved by the supervisor 
for incapacity from duty due to injury or illness, not related to or 
incurred on-the-job and not covered by the Federal Employee's 
Compensation Act Regulations. Medical and dental appointments may be 
included under this part. However, whenever possible, medical and dental 
appointments should be scheduled after instructional time.
    (i) Sick leave shall accrue at the rate of three hours each biweekly 
pay period in pay status for the first 21 pay periods of their contract; 
no precredit or advance for sick leave is authorized.
    (ii) Accumulated sick leave at the time of separation will be 
recredited to an educator who is reemployed within three years of 
separation.
    (5) School vacation time. Part-time employees may receive up to 102 
hours of school vacation time for use when school is not in session. 
Approval for the use of this time will be administratively determined by 
the school supervisor, ASE or AEPA, and this time may not be scheduled 
before the start of school or after the end of school.
    (i) All school vacation time for part-time employees will be 
approved at the convenience of the program and not as a right of the 
employee.
    (ii) Vacation time cannot be paid for or carried over for a part-
time employee if the employee is required to work during the school 
vacation time or if the program will not permit part-time employees to 
take such vacation time.
    (e) Accountable absences for all contract employees. The following 
are considered accountable absences:
    (1) Approved absence. If prescheduled and approved by the school 
supervisor, ASE or AEPA, as appropriate, an employee may be on leave 
without pay.
    (2) Absence without leave. Any absence is not prescheduled or 
approved in advance or excused by the supervisor is considered absence 
without leave.

[[Page 182]]

    (3) Court and military leave. Employees are entitled to paid absence 
for jury or witness service and military duty as a member of the 
National Guard or Reserve under the same terms or conditions as outlined 
in sections 6322 and 6323 of title 5 U.S.C., and corresponding 
provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual, when the absence occurs 
during the regular contract period. Employees may be requested to 
schedule their military leave at times other than when school is in 
session.
    (4) Administrative leave. Administrative leave is an excused absence 
from duty administratively authorized without loss of pay or without 
charge to leave. This leave is not a substitute for other paid or unpaid 
leave categories. Administrative leave usually is authorized on an 
individual basis except when a school is closed or a group of employees 
are excused from work for a particular purpose. The school supervisor, 
ASE or AEPA will grant administrative leave. A school closing must be 
approved by the ASE or AEPA.
    (f) Educators serving with contracts with work weeks of 20 hours a 
week or less are not eligible for any type of paid leave.
    (g) For school term educators, no paid leave is earned nor may 
accumulated leave be used during any period of employment with the 
Bureau between school terms.
    (h) Employees issued contracts for intermittent work are not 
eligible for any type of paid leave.
    (i) Leave transferred in. Annual leave credited to an employee's 
accrued leave balance immediately before conversion to a contract 
education position or appointment under this part will be carried over 
and made available to the employee. Sick leave credited to an employee's 
accrued sick leave balance immediately before conversion to a contract 
education position or appointment under this part shall be credited to 
the employee's sick leave account under the system in Sec. 38.12(a)(2) 
and (b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 38.13  Status quo employees in education positions.

    (a) Status quo employees. Individuals who were Bureau employees on 
October 31, 1979, with an appointment in either the competitive or 
excepted service without time limitation, and who are serving in an 
education position, shall be continued in their positions under the 
terms and conditions of that appointment with no change in their status 
or positions. Such employees are entitled to receive any changes in 
compensation attached to the position. Although such employees occupy 
``education positions'' as defined in this part, the terms and 
conditions of their appointment, status, and entitlements are determined 
by competitive service regulations and procedures. Under applicable 
procedures, these employees are eligible for consideration for movement 
to other positions that are defined as ``contract education'' positions. 
Such movement shall change the terms and conditions of their appointment 
to the terms and conditions of employment established under this part.
    (b) If the tribe or school board waives the Indian preference law, 
the employee loses the early-out retirement eligibility under Pub. L. 
96-135, ``early-out for non-Indians,'' if they are entitled to the 
early-out retirement. A memorandum for the record on BIA letterhead 
shall be signed by the employee and placed on the permanent side of his/
her Official Personnel Folder, along with the tribal resolution, if the 
tribe/school board has waived the Indian preference law to employ the 
non-Indian.''
    (c) Conversion of status quo employees to contract positions. Status 
quo employees may request in writing to the school supervisor, ASE or 
AEPA, as applicable, that their position be converted to contract. The 
appropriate school board will be consulted and a determination made by 
such school board whether such individual should be converted to a 
contract employee.
    (1) Written determination by the school board should be received 
within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 30 days from receipt of 
the request. Failure of the school board to act within this period shall 
have the effect of disapproving the proposed conversion.
    (2) With school board approval, an involuntary change in position 
shall not affect the current status of status quo education employees.

[[Page 183]]


<R05>
Sec. 38.14  Voluntary services.

    (a) Scope. An ASE or AEPA may, subject to the approval of the local 
school board concerned, accept voluntary services on behalf of Bureau 
schools from the private sector, including individuals, groups, or 
students. Voluntary service shall be for all non-hazardous activities 
where public services, special projects, or school operations are 
improved and enhanced. Volunteer service is limited to personal services 
received without compensation (salary or wages) by the Bureau from 
individuals, groups, and students. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to require Federal employees to work without compensation or 
to allow the use of volunteer services to displace or replace Federal 
employees.
    (b) Volunteer service agreement. An agreement is a written document, 
jointly completed by the volunteer, the Bureau school supervisor, and 
the school board, that outlines the responsibilities of each. In the 
case of students receiving credit for their work (i.e., student 
teaching) from an education institution, the agreement will be jointly 
completed by the student, a representative of the institution, and the 
Bureau school supervisor. In the case of volunteer groups, the agreement 
shall be signed by an official of the volunteering organization, the 
Bureau school supervisor, and the school board and a list of signatures 
and emergency telephone numbers of all participants shall be attached.
    (c) Eligibility. Although no minimum age requirement exists for 
volunteers, schools shall comply with appropriate Federal and State laws 
and standards on using the services of minors. All volunteers under the 
age of 18 must obtain written permission from their parents or guardians 
to perform volunteer activities.
    (d) Status. Volunteers participating under this part are not 
considered Federal employees for any purpose other than:
    (1) Title 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, dealing with compensation for 
injuries sustained during the performance of work assignments.
    (2) Federal tort claims provisions published in 28 U.S.C. chapter 
171.
    (3) Department of the Interior Regulations Governing 
Responsibilities and Conduct.
    (e) Travel and other expenses. The decision to reimburse travel and 
other incidental expenses, as well as the amount of reimbursement, shall 
be made by the school supervisor, ASE, AEPA, and the respective school 
board. Payment is made in the same manner as for regular employees. 
Payment of travel and per diem expenses to a volunteer on a particular 
assignment must be supported by a specific travel authorization and 
cannot exceed the cost of employing a temporary employee of comparable 
qualification at the school for which a travel authorization is 
considered.
    (f) Annual report. School supervisors shall submit reports on 
volunteers to the ASE or AEPA by October 31 of each year for the 
preceding year.


<R05>
Sec. 38.15  Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute.

    (a) The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute has an independent 
personnel system established under Public Law 105-337, the 
Administrative Systems Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3171. The details of this 
system are in the Indian Affairs Manual (IAM) at Part 20. This manual 
system may be found in Bureau of Indian Affairs Regional and Agency 
Offices, Education Line Offices, and the Central Office in Washington, 
DC.
    (b) The personnel system is in the excepted service and addresses 
the areas of classification, staffing, pay, performance, discipline, and 
separation. Other areas of personnel such as leave, retirement, life 
insurance, health benefits, thrift savings, etc., remain under the 
jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management.

    No. Only miles generated by ISEP-eligible students enrolled in and 
attending a school are eligible for student transportation funding.

                    Calculating Transportation Miles


<R05>
Sec. 39.710  How does a school calculate annual bus transportation miles for day students?

    To calculate the total annual bus transportation miles for day 
students, a school must use the appropriate formula from this section. 
In the formulas, Tu = Miles driven on Tuesday of the transportation 
mileage count week, W = Miles driven on Wednesday of the transportation 
mileage count week, and Th = Miles driven on Thursday of the 
transportation mileage count week.
    (a) For ISEP-eligible day students whose route is entirely over 
improved roads, calculate miles using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP05.087

    (b) For ISEP-eligible day students whose route is partly over 
unimproved roads, calculate miles using the following three steps.
    (1) Step 1. Apply the following formula to miles driven over 
improved roads only:

[[Page 203]]

    (2) Step 2. Apply the following formula to miles driven over 
unimproved roads only:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP05.089

    (3) Step 3. Add together the sums from steps 1 and 2 to obtain the 
total annual transportation miles.


<R05>
Sec. 39.711  How does a school calculate annual bus transportation miles

for residential students?

    To calculate the total annual transportation miles for residential 
students, a school must use the procedures in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (a) The school can receive funds for the following trips:
    (1) Transportation to the school at the start of the school year;
    (2) Round trip home at Christmas; and
    (3) Return trip to home at the end of the school year.
    (b) To calculate the actual miles driven to transport students from 
home to school at the start of the school year, add together the miles 
driven for all buses used to transport students from their homes to the 
school. If a school transports students over unimproved roads, the 
school must separate the number of miles driven for each bus into 
improved miles and unimproved miles. The number of miles driven is the 
sum of:
    (1) The number of miles driven on improved roads; and
    (2) The number of miles driven on unimproved roads multiplied by 
1.2.
    (c) The annual miles driven for each school is the sum of the 
mileage from paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section multiplied by 
4.

                         Reporting Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 39.720  Why are there different reporting requirements for transportation data?

transportation programs that the school provides. To allocate 
transportation funds OIEP:
    (a) Multiplies the one-way commercial costs for all schools by four 
to identify the total commercial costs for all schools;
    (b) Subtracts the commercial cost total from the appropriated 
transportation funds and allocates the balance of the transportation 
funds to each school with a per-mile rate;
    (c) Divides the balance of funds by the sum of the annual day miles 
and the annual residential miles to identify a per-mile rate;
    (d) For day transportation, multiplies the per-mile rate times the 
annual day miles for each school; and
    (e) For residential transportation, multiplies the per mile rate 
times the annual transportation miles for each school.

  Subpart H_Determining the Amount Necessary To Sustain an Academic or 
                           Residential Program

    Source: 70 FR 22205, Apr. 28, 2005, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 39.801  What is the formula to determine the amount necessary to 

sustain a school's academic or residential program?

    (a) The Secretary's formula to determine the minimum annual amount 
necessary to sustain a Bureau-funded school's academic or residential 
program is as follows:

Student Unit Value x Weighted Student Unit = Annual Minimum Amount per 
student.

    (b) Sections 39.802 through 39.807 explain the derivation of the 
formula in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) If the annual minimum amount calculated under this section and 
Sec. Sec. 39.802 through 39.807 is not fully funded, OIEP will pro rate 
funds distributed to schools using the Indian School Equalization 
Formula.


<R05>
Sec. 39.802  What is the student unit value in the formula?

    The student unit value is the dollar value applied to each student 
in an academic or residential program. There are two types of student 
unit values: the student unit instructional value (SUIV) and the student 
unit residential value (SURV).
    (a) The student unit instructional value (SUIV) applies to a student 
enrolled in an instructional program. It is an annually established 
ratio of 1.0 that represents a student in grades 4 through 6 of a 
typical non-residential program.
    (b) The student unit residential value (SURV) applies to a 
residential student. It is an annually established ratio of 1.0 that 
represents a student in grades 4 through 6 of a typical residential 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 39.803  What is a weighted student unit in the formula?

    A weighted student unit is an adjusted ratio using factors in the 
Indian

[[Page 205]]

School Equalization Formula to establish educational priorities and to 
provide for the unique needs of specific students, such as:
    (a) Students in grades kindergarten through 3 or grades 7 through 
12;
    (b) Special education students;
    (c) Gifted and talented students;
    (d) Distance education students;
    (e) Vocational and industrial education students;
    (f) Native Language Instruction students;
    (g) Small schools;
    (h) Personnel costs;
    (i) Alternative schooling; and
    (j) Early Childhood Education programs.


<R05>
Sec. 39.804  How is the SUIV calculated?

    The SUIV is calculated by the following 5-step process:
    (a) Step 1. Use the adjusted national average current expenditures 
(ANACE) of public and private schools determined by data from the U.S. 
Department of Education-National Center of Education Statistics (NCES) 
for the last school year for which data is available.
    (b) Step 2. Subtract the average specific Federal share per student 
(title I part A and IDEA part B) of the total revenue for Bureau-funded 
elementary and secondary schools for the last school year for which data 
is available as reported by NCES (15%).
    (c) Step 3. Subtract the administrative cost grant/agency area 
technical services revenue per student as a percentage of the total 
revenue (current expenditures) of Bureau-funded schools from the last 
year data is available.
    (d) Step 4. Subtract the day transportation revenue per student as a 
percentage of the total revenue (current revenue) Bureau-funded schools 
for the last school year for which data is available.
    (e) Step 5. Add Johnson O'Malley funding. (See the table, in Sec. 
39.805)


<R05>
Sec. 39.805  What was the student unit for instruction value (SUIV)

for the school year 1999-2000?

    The process described in Sec. 39.804 is illustrated in the table 
below, using figures for the 1999-2000 school year:

Step 1.........................................     $8,030  ANACE.
Step 2.........................................      -1205  Average specific Federal share of total revenue for
                                                             Bureau-funded schools.
Step 3.........................................       -993  Cost grant/technical services revenue as a
                                                             percentage total revenue.
Step 4.........................................       -658  Transportation revenue as a percentage of the total
                                                             revenue.
Step 5.........................................         85  Johnson O'Malley funding.
������������������������������������������������
 


<R05>
Sec. 39.806  How is the SURV calculated?

    (a) The SURV is the adjusted national average current expenditures 
for residential schools (ANACER) of public and private residential 
schools. This average is determined using data from the Association of 
Boarding Schools.
    (b) Applying the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
SURV for school year 1999-2000 was $11,000.


<R05>
Sec. 39.807  How will the Student Unit Value be adjusted annually?

    (a) The student unit instructional value (SUIV) and the student unit 
residential value (SURV) will be adjusted annually to derive the current 
year Student Unit Value (SUV) by dividing the calculated SUIV and the 
SURV into two parts and adjusting each one as shown in this section.
    (1) The first part consists of 85 percent of the calculated SUIV and 
the SURV. OIEP will adjust this portion using the personnel cost of 
living increase of the Department of Defense schools for each year.
    (2) The second part consists of 15 percent the calculated SUIV and 
the SURV. OIEP will adjust this portion using the Consumer Price Index-
Urban of the Department of Labor.
    (b) If the student unit value amount is not fully funded, the 
schools will receive their pro rata share using the Indian School 
Equalization Formula.

            Subpart A_Tribally Controlled Community Colleges


<R05>
Sec. 41.1  Purpose.

    The policy of the Department of the Interior is to support and 
encourage the establishment, operation, and improvement of tribally 
controlled community colleges to ensure continued and expanded 
educational opportunities for Indian students. The regulations in this 
subpart prescribe procedures for providing financial and technical 
assistance to this end under the Tribally Controlled Community College 
Assistance Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-471, 92 Stat. 1325, 25 U.S.C. 1801 et 
seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 41.2  Scope.

    The regulations in this subpart are applicable to the provision of 
financial

[[Page 210]]

and technical assistance to Community Colleges under title I of the Act. 
They do not apply to the provision of assistance to Navajo Community 
College. Subpart B of this part applies to assistance to Navajo 
Community College under title II of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 41.3  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart A:
    (a) Academic term means a semester, trimester, or other such period 
(not less than six (6) weeks in duration) into which a community college 
normally subdivides its academic year, but does not include a summer 
term.
    (b) Academic year means a twelve month period established by a 
community college and approved by the Director of Education as the 
annual period for the operation of the college's education programs.
    (c) The Act means the Tribally Controlled Community College 
Assistance Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-471, 92 Stat. 1325, 25 U.S.C. 1801 et 
seq.).
    (d) Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary for Indian 
Affairs of the Department of the Interior, or his/her duly authorized 
representative.
    (e) Community College means an institution of higher education which 
(1) is formally controlled or operated and managed by the governing body 
of an Indian Tribe or by the governing bodies of two or more Indian 
Tribes, or (2) is established or is otherwise sanctioned or chartered by 
resolution, ordinance, or other official action (which is still in full 
force and effect) of such governing body or bodies. However, for 
purposes of this definition, only one such institution shall be 
recognized with respect to any one Tribe. A Community College that meets 
the requirements of this definition with respect to more than one Tribe 
must meet such requirements with respect to at least one Tribe that has 
no other currently formally controlled, operated and managed, 
established, sanctioned, or chartered Community College.
    (f) Director of Education means the Director of the Office of Indian 
Education Programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or his/her duly 
authorized representative.
    (g) Full time equivalent or FTE, means the number of Indian students 
(1) enrolled full-time for an entire academic term at a community 
college, calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the 
conclusion of the sixth week of an academic term, plus (2) the full-time 
equivalent of the number of other Indian students who are enrolled part-
time for an entire academic term at a community college (determined on 
the basis of the quotient of the sum of credit hours for which all such 
part-time students are registered during such academic term, divided by 
twelve (12)), calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at 
the conclusion of the sixth week of an academic term. The formula for 
calculating the Indian FTE for an academic term is expressed 
mathematically as FTE=FT+PTCR/12 where FT is the number of full time 
Indian students (those carrying 12 or more credit hours at the end of 
the sixth week of the academic term) and PTCR is the number of credit 
hours for which part-time Indian students are registered at the end of 
the sixth week of an academic term.
    (h) Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe and is 
eligible to receive services from the Secretary of the Interior because 
of his/her status as an Indian.
    (i) Indian Tribe means an Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, 
rancheria, or other organized group or community, including any Alaskan 
Native Village or regional or village corporation as defined in or 
established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is 
recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by 
the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.
    (j) Institution of higher education as defined in Pub. L. 95-471 
(incorporating in part 1201 of the Higher Education Act of 1965), means 
an educational institution in any State which
    (1) Admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of

    (4) Is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or 
association or, if not so accredited,
    (A) Is an institution with respect to which the Commissioner of 
Education has determined that there is satisfactory assurance, 
considering the resources available to the institution, the period of 
time, if any, during which it has operated, the effort it is making to 
meet accreditation standards and the purpose for which this 
determination is being made, that the institution will meet the 
accreditation standards of such an agency or association within a 
reasonable time, or
    (B) Is an institution whose credits are accepted, on transfer, by 
not less than three institutions which are so accredited, for credit on 
the same basis as if transferred from an institution so accredited.

Such term also includes any school which provides not less than a one-
year program of training to prepare students for gainful employment in a 
recognized occupation and which meets the provisions of clauses (1), 
(2), (3), and (4). Such term also includes a public or nonprofit private 
educational institution in any State which, in lieu of the requirement

finding shall be effective earlier than 30 days after publication.
    (l) Operating expenses of education programs means the obligations 
and expenditures of a community college for post-secondary activities, 
including administration, instruction, attendance, health and other 
student services, operation, maintenance and repair of plant, fixed 
charges, and other related expenses, but not including expenditures for 
the acquisition or construction of academic facilities. (The term 
academic facilities means structures suitable for use as classrooms, 
laboratories, libraries, and related facilities necessary or appropriate 
for instruction of students, or for research, or for administration of 
the educational or research programs of an institution of higher 
education or as dormitories or student services buildings, and

<R05>
Sec. 41.7  Feasibility studies.

    (a) Grants under Sec. 41.8 of this subpart may be made to a 
Community College only after a positive determination of feasibility as 
provided in this section.
    (b) Within thirty (30) days of receiving a resolution or other duly 
authorized request from the governing body of one or more Indian Tribes, 
the Director of Education shall initiate a feasibility study to 
determine whether there is justification to encourage and maintain a 
Community College for such tribe or tribes. The feasibility study shall 
give consideration to the following factors:
    (1) Financial feasibility based upon potential enrollment;
    (2) Evidence of low tribal levels of tribal matriculation in and 
graduation from postsecondary educational institutions;
    (3) Tribal, linguistics, or cultural differences;
    (4) Isolation;
    (5) Presence of alternate education sources;
    (6) Proposed curriculum;
    (7) The benefits of continued and expanded educational opportunities 
for Indian students.
    (c) The Director of Education will issue detailed guidelines for 
conducting and analyzing the feasibility studies.
    (d) Feasibility studies under this section shall be conducted in 
consultation with the tribal governing body or bodies involved or their 
designated representatives. Each feasibility study shall be completed 
and filed by the Director of Education within sixty (60) days after the 
feasibility study has been initiated. The study shall be filed with (1) 
the Assistant Secretary, (2) the tribal governing body or bodies 
requesting the studies, and (3) with the board of directors, regents, or 
trustees of the Community College, if already established.
    (e) In the case of any feasibility study which results in a negative 
determination by the Director of Education, a Tribe requesting the study 
may within thirty (30) days of receipt of the study or of notice of such 
determination file a notice of appeal with the Assistant Secretary. 
Following the timely filing of a Tribe's notice of appeal, the Tribe and 
Community College shall have a right to a formal review of the 
feasibility study, including a hearing upon reasonable notice within 
sixty (60) days before the Assistant Secretary (or his/her designee, 
other than the Director of Education or any federal employee under the 
Director's supervision). At the hearing, the appealing Tribe or the 
Community College (or both) may present additional evidence or arguments 
to justify feasibility. Within thirty (30) days of the hearing, the 
Assistant Secretary shall issue a written ruling either confirming, 
modifying, or reversing the original determination. The ruling, which 
shall be final for the Department, shall be mailed or otherwise 
delivered to the appealing Tribe and the Community College within one 
week of its issuance. In any case where the original negative 
determination is not reversed, the Assistant Secretary's ruling shall 
specify the grounds for the decision and state the manner in which the 
determination related to each of the factors specified.

[[Page 213]]

    (f) A negative determination shall not prevent a Tribe from 
requesting another feasibility study, but no more than one feasibility 
study shall be requested for any given Community College per year.

    (c)(1) Within thirty (30) days of receiving an application required 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the Director of Education shall 
review the application submitted by the Community College and any 
comments with respect thereto filed by the Tribe(s) or by any national 
Indian organization(s) whose assistance has been requested by the 
Community College, and make a grant award in an amount determined under 
paragraph (d) of this section to the Community College if the 
application qualifies the Community College to receive a grant.
    (2) In the case of any Community College whose application is not 
approved, the Director shall promptly send a notice of such action to 
the Community College. Such notice shall include a statement of the 
specific reasons for not approving the application and a statement

FTE Indian students in attendance at such college during each academic 
term divided by the number of academic terms in the academic year, 
except that no such grant shall exceed the annual operating expenses of 
the education programs provided by the Community College. The 
mathematical formula for calculating the base grant is BG (Base Grant)=
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.120


where FTE is the Indian FTE for each of the academic terms during the 
academic year calculated in conformity with Sec. 41.3(g) of this 
subpart and N is the number of academic terms in the academic year.
    (2) For the first Federal fiscal year for which funds are 
appropriated for grants under this subpart, not less than eight (8) nor 
more than fifteen (15) grants shall be approved; priority in awarding 
such grants shall be given to Community Colleges which are operating on 
October 17, 1978, and which have a history of service to the Indian 
people. (If more than fifteen (15) Community Colleges meeting these two 
(2) conditions submit applications for the first fiscal year, a further 
priority for awarding grants among them shall be given to those who 
appear to be in the best position to fulfill the purpose of the Act and 
to those whose continued existence would be threatened if they did not 
receive such a grant).
    (3) All grants under this section shall be subject to the 
availability of appropriations and the amount thereof shall be ratably 
reduced for all Community Colleges if the sums appropriated for any 
fiscal year for financial assistance under this subpart are not 
sufficient to pay the full amounts to which the eligible Community 
Colleges are otherwise entitled under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) The Director of Education shall authorize payments to each such 
Community College in advance installments by letter of credit or 
Treasury check in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the grant 
amount available for allotment to such Community College for such 
academic year under paragraph (d) of this section on or before October 
1st of such College's academic year (except for 1979-80) or the first 
day on which appropriations for the fiscal year beginning on such date 
are available for obligation by BIA whichever occurs later, based on the 
number of FTE Indian students calculated on the basis of registrations 
as in effect at the conclusion of the sixth week of the final academic 
term of the preceding academic year. On or before January 1st (or such 
other date that is the first day of the fifth month) of such College's 
academic year, payments shall be made in the form of advance 
installments to each Community College in an amount equal to seventy-
five percent (75%) of the grant amount available for allotment to such 
Community College for such academic year under paragraph (d) of this 
section, calculated on the basis of registrations at the conclusion of 
sixth week of the academic year, less the amount previously advanced for 
such academic year. On or before July 1st (or such other date that is 
the first day of the eleventh month) of each such academic year the 
balance

[[Page 215]]

of the grant amount to which each College is entitled under paragraph 
(d) of this section shall be paid to such College. In the event that 
additional sums are appropriated to which such Community Colleges are 
entitled under section 110(a) of the Act and paragraph (d) of this 
section, these amounts shall be included in such final payments.
    (f) If with respect to any academic year the amounts of financial 
assistance hereunder have been ratably reduced as provided in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section and additional funds have not been appropriated 
to pay the full amount of such reductions on or before June 1st of such 
year, the Director of Education shall notify each Community College of 
such fact in writing, and each Community College shall report in writing 
to the Director of Education on or before July 1st of such year the 
amount of unused portion of received funds. The total of such reported 
unused portions of received funds shall be reallocated by the Director 
of Education in proportion to the amount of financial assistance to 
which each Community College is entitled under paragraph (d) but which 
has not been provided due to the ratable reductions provided for 
therein, (except that no Community College shall receive more than the 
total annual cost of the education programs provided by such College) 
and payments shall be made reflecting such reallocations on or before 
August 1st of such academic year.
    (g) If the Director of Education determines that a Community College 
has received, through mistake or fraud, payments of financial assistance 
under this subpart to which it was not entitled, the Director shall 
promptly notify the college, which may appeal the Director's 
determination under the procedures set forth in Sec. 41.7, and adjust 
the amount of payments to the college under this subpart for the same or 
subsequent academic years to compensate for such overpayments or 
otherwise attempt to recover such overpayments.
    (h) Eligibility for grants under this subpart shall not, by itself, 
bar a Community College from qualifying for or receiving financial 
assistance under any other Federal program for which it may qualify.


<R05>
Sec. 41.9  Reports.

    Each Community College receiving financial assistance under this 
subpart shall provide to the Director of Education on or before December 
1st of each year a report which shall include an accounting of the 
amounts and purposes for which such financial assistance was expended 
during the preceding academic year; the annual cost of education 
programs of the Community College from all sources for such academic 
year; and a final report of the performance based upon the criteria set 
forth in the Community College's stated goals, philosophy or plan of 
operation. Upon reasonable cause, the Director of Education may extend 
the period for submitting the annual report. Each Community College 
shall in addition report to the Director of Education its FTE Indian 
student enrollment for each academic term of the academic year within 
three weeks of the date such FTE calculation is made.


<R05>
Sec. 41.10  Technical assistance.

    The Director of Education shall furnish technical assistance either 
directly or through contract to any Community College requesting it. 
Such assistance shall be initiated within thirty (30) days of a 
Community College's request in writing. In any case, where the type and 
source of technical assistance is specified in the request, the 
Director, to the extent possible or feasible, shall provide the type of 
technical assistance through the source so specified. Technical 
assistance may include, but is not limited to, consulting services for 
the development of programs, plans, and feasibility studies and 
accounting, and other technical advice. In awarding of contracts for 
technical assistance, preference shall be given to an organization 
designated by the Community College to be assisted. Denials of requests 
for technical assistance under this section shall be made in writing and 
sent to the applicant within thirty (30) days of the request, together 
with a statement of the reason for denial. An appeal under this section 
may be undertaken in the same manner as in the case of negative 
determinations of feasibility under Sec. 41.7 of his subpart.

calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion 
of the sixth week of an academic term, plus (2) the full-time equivalent 
of the number of other Indian students who are enrolled part-time for an 
entire academic term at the College (determined on the basis of the 
quotient of the sum of credit hours for which all such part-time 
students are registered during such academic term divided by (12)), 
calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion 
of the sixth week of an academic term. The formula for calculating the 
Indian FTE for an academic term is expressed mathematically as 
FTE=FT+PTCR/12 where FT is the number of full time Indian students 
(those carrying 12 or more credit hours at the end of the sixth week of 
the academic term) and PTCR is the number of credit hours for which 
part-time Indian students are registered at the end of the sixth week of

the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.
    (j) Operating and Maintenance Expenses of Education Programs means 
the obligation and expenditures by the College for post-secondary 
education activities including administration, instruction, attendance, 
health and other student services, operation, maintenance and repair of 
plant, and fixed charges, and other related expenses, but not including 
obligations or expenditures for the acquisition or construction of 
academic facilities (as defined in Sec. 41.3(l) of subpart A).

under paragraph (b) of this section, the Director of Education shall 
make a grant award to the College in an amount determined under 
paragraph (e) of this section. The grant award shall be evidenced by a 
grant agreement signed by the Director of Education, incorporating the 
grant application and including the provisions required by Sec. 41.27 
of this subpart.
    (e) The College shall be eligible to receive a grant for the fiscal 
year beginning October 1, 1979, and for each succeeding year, in an 
amount equal to $4,000 multiplied by the number of FTE Indian students 
in attendance at the College during each academic term divided by the 
number of academic terms in the academic year, except that no such grant

beginning on such date are available for obligation by BIA, whichever 
occurs later, based on the number of FTE Indian students calculated on 
the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion of the sixth 
week of the final academic term of the preceding year. On or before 
January 1st (or such other date that is the first day of the fifth 
month) of such academic year, payment shall be made in the form of such 
advance installments to the College in an amount equal to seventy-five 
percent (75%) of the grant amount available for allotment to the College 
for such academic year under paragraph (e) of this section, calculated 
on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion of the 
sixth week of the academic year, less the amount previously advanced for 
such academic year. On or before July 1st (or such other date that is 
the first day of the eleventh month) of such academic year, the balance 
of the grant amount to which the College is entitled under paragraph (e) 
of this section shall be paid to the College. In the event that 
additional sums are appropriated for the benefit of the College, these 
sums shall be included in the final payment.

    (c) Information which may be used in determining a student's rights, 
benefits, and privileges under Federal programs shall be collected 
directly from the student or his parents, to the greatest extent 
practicable. In deciding whether collection of information from a parent

or student is unreasonable, when compared with the cost of collecting it 
from a third party.
    (3) Whether there is a risk that information collected from third 
parties, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse

[[Page 227]]

determination to the student concerned.
    (4) Whether the information, if supplied by the parent or student, 
would have to be verified by a third party.

student of information collected from third parties.

supply information about himself which will be added to a system of 
student records shall be notified of the basis for requesting the 
information, how it may be used, and what the consequences, if any, are 
of not supplying the information. At a minimum, the notice to the parent 
or eligible student must state:
    (1) The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of 
the President) which authorizes requesting the information and whether 
disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary.
    (2) The principle purpose or purposes for which the information is 
intended to be used.
    (3) The routine uses which may be made of the information.
    (4) The effects, if any, of not providing all or any part of the 
requested information.

the parent or eligible student shall be on the form or on a tear-off 
sheet attached to the form or on a separate sheet, whichever, is most 
practical.
    (f) When information is collected by an interviewer, the interviewer 
shall provide the parent or eligible student with a written notice which 
the individual may retain. If the interview is conducted by telephone, 
however, the interviewer may summarize the notice for the individual and

that a copy be mailed to him.
    (g) A parent or eligible student may be asked to acknowledge, in 
writing, that he has been given the notice required by this section.
    (h) No student records may be maintained describing how any

maintained, at a minimum, subject to the following safeguards, or 
safeguards giving comparable protection:
    (1) Areas in which the student records are maintained or regularly 
used shall be posted with an appropriate warning, stating that access to 
the records is limited to authorized persons. The warning shall also 
summarize the requirements of Sec. 43.23 and state that employees may 
be subject to a criminal penalty for the unauthorized disclosure of 
student records.
    (2) During working hours, the area in which the student records are 
maintained or regularly used shall be occupied by authorized personnel, 
or access to the student records shall be restricted by their storage in 
locked metal file cabinets or a locked room.

    (d) The education institution responsible for a system of student 
records shall be responsible for assuring that specific procedures are 
developed to assure that the student records in the system for which it 
is responsible are maintained with security meeting the regulations in 
this section. These procedures shall be in writing and shall be posted 
or otherwise periodically brought to the attention of employees working 
with the student records contained in the system.


<R05>
Sec. 43.23  Conduct of employees.

    (a) Employees whose duties require handling of student records 
shall, at all times, take care to protect the integrity, security, and 
confidentiality of these records.

Sec. 63.2  Policy.

    In enacting the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence

to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their 
children and that the United States has a direct interest, as trustee, 
in protecting Indian children who are members of, or are eligible for 
membership in, an Indian tribe. The minimum standards of character and 
suitability of employment for individuals ensure that Indian children 
are protected, and the Indian child protection and family violence

 Subpart B_Minimum Standards of Character and Suitability for Employment


<R05>
Sec. 63.10  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish:
    (a) Procedures for determining suitability for employment and 
efficiency of service as mandated by the Indian Child Protection and 
Family Violence Prevention Act; and

[[Page 253]]

    (b) Minimum standards of character to ensure that individuals having 
regular contact with or control over Indian children have not been 
convicted of certain types of crimes or acted in a manner that placed 
others at risk or raised questions about their trustworthiness.


<R05>
Sec. 63.11  What is a determination of suitability for employment and efficiency of service?

    (a) Determinations of suitability measure the fitness or eligibility 
of an applicant, volunteer, or employee for a particular position. 
Suitability for employment does not evaluate an applicant's education, 
skills, knowledge, experience, etc. Rather, it requires that the 
employer investigate the background of each applicant, volunteer, and 
employee to:
    (1) Determine the degree of risk the applicant, volunteer, or 
employee brings to the position; and
    (2) Certify that the applicant's, volunteer's, or employee's past 
conduct would not interfere with his/her performance of duties, nor 
would it create an immediate or long-term risk for any Indian child.
    (b) Efficiency of service is the employer's verification that the 
applicant or employee is able to perform the duties and responsibilities 
of the position, and his/her presence on the job will not inhibit other 
employees or the agency from performing their functions.


<R05>
Sec. 63.12  What are minimum standards of character?

    Minimum standards of character are established by an employer and 
refer to identifiable character traits and past conduct. An employer may 
use character traits and past conduct to determine whether an applicant, 
volunteer, or employee can effectively perform the duties of a 
particular position without risk of harm to others. Minimum standards of 
character ensure that no applicant, volunteer, or employee will be 
placed in a position with regular contact with or control over Indian 
children if he/she has been found guilty of or entered a plea of nolo 
contendere or guilty to any offense under Federal, state, or tribal law 
involving crimes of violence, sexual assault, sexual molestation, sexual 
exploitation, sexual contact or prostitution, or crimes against persons.


<R05>
Sec. 63.13  What does the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence 

Prevention Act require of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian tribes or tribal 
          organizations receiving funds under the Indian Self-
          Determination and Education Assistance Act or the Tribally 
          Controlled Schools Act?

    (a) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must compile a list of all 
authorized positions which involve regular contact with or control over 
Indian children; investigate the character of each individual who is 
employed, or is being considered for employment; and, prescribe minimum 
standards of character which each individual must meet to be appointed 
to such positions.
    (b) All Indian tribes or tribal organizations receiving funds under 
the authority of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act or the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 must conduct a 
background investigation for individuals whose duties and 
responsibilities would allow them regular contact with or control over 
Indian children, and employ only individuals who meet standards of 
character that are no less stringent than those prescribed for the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 63.14  What positions require a background investigation and

determination of suitability for employment or retention?

    All positions that allow an applicant, employee, or volunteer 
regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a 
background investigation and determination of suitability for 
employment.


<R05>
Sec. 63.15  What questions should an employer ask?

    Employment applications must:
    (a) Ask whether the applicant, volunteer, or employee has been 
arrested or convicted of a crime involving a child, violence, sexual 
assault, sexual molestation, sexual exploitation, sexual contact or 
prostitution, or crimes against persons;

[[Page 254]]

    (b) Ask the disposition of the arrest or charge;
    (c) Require that an applicant, volunteer or employee sign, under 
penalty of perjury, a statement verifying the truth of all information 
provided in the employment application; and
    (d) Inform the applicant, volunteer or employee that a criminal 
history record check is a condition of employment and require the 
applicant, volunteer or employee to consent, in writing, to a record 
check.

Sec. 63.16  Who conducts the background investigation and prepares the

determination of suitability for employment?

    (a) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must use the United States Office 
of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct background investigations for 
Federal employees. The BIA must designate qualified security personnel 
to adjudicate the results of background investigations.
    (b) Indian tribes and tribal organizations may conduct their own 
background investigations, contract with private firms, or request the 
OPM to conduct an investigation. The investigation should cover the past 
five years of the individual's employment, education, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 63.17  How does an employer determine suitability for employment 

and efficiency of service?

    (a) Adjudication is the process employers use to determine 
suitability for employment and efficiency of service. The adjudication 
process protects the interests of the employer and the rights of 
applicants and employees. Adjudication requires uniform evaluation to 
ensure fair and consistent judgment.
    (b) Each case is judged on its own merits. All available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, must be considered and 
assessed in terms of accuracy, completeness, relevance, seriousness, 
overall significance, and how similar cases have been handled in the 
past.
    (c) An adjudicating official conducts the adjudication. Each Federal 
agency, Indian tribe, or tribal organization must appoint an 
adjudicating official, who must first have been the subject of a 
favorable background investigation.
    (1) Indian tribes and tribal organizations must ensure that persons 
charged with the responsibility for adjudicating employee background 
investigations are well-qualified and trained.
    (2) Indian tribes and tribal organizations should also ensure that 
individuals who are not trained to adjudicate these types of 
investigations are supervised by someone who is experienced and receive 
the training necessary to perform the task.
    (d) Each adjudicating official must be thoroughly familiar with all 
laws, regulations, and criteria involved in making a determination for 
suitability.
    (e) The adjudicating official must review the background 
investigation to determine the character, reputation, and 
trustworthiness of the individual. At a minimum, the adjudicating 
official must:
    (1) Review each security investigation form and employment 
application and compare the information provided;
    (2) Review the results of written record searches requested from 
local law enforcement agencies, former employers, former supervisors, 
employment references, and schools; and
    (3) Review the results of the fingerprint charts maintained by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation or other law enforcement information 
maintained by other agencies.
    (f) Relevancy is a key objective in evaluating investigative data. 
The adjudicating official must consider prior conduct in light of:
    (1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct in question;
    (2) The recency and circumstances surrounding the conduct in 
question;
    (3) The age of the individual at the time of the incident;
    (4) Societal conditions that may have contributed to the nature of 
the conduct;
    (5) The probability that the individual will continue the type of 
behavior in question; and,
    (6) The individual's commitment to rehabilitation and a change in 
the behavior in question.

<R05>
Sec. 63.18  Are the requirements for Bureau of Indian Affairs 

adjudication different from the requirements for Indian tribes and 
tribal organizations?

    Yes.
    (a) In addition to the minimum requirements for background 
investigations found in Sec. 63.12, Bureau of Indian Affairs' 
adjudicating officials must review the OPM National Agency Check and 
Inquiries which includes a search of the OPM Security/Suitability 
Investigations Index (SII) and the Defense Clearance and Investigations 
Index (DCII), and any additional standards which may be established by 
the BIA.
    (b) All Bureau of Indian Affairs employees who have regular contact 
with or control over Indian children must be reinvestigated every five 
years during their employment in that or any other position which allows 
regular contact with or control over Indian children.
    (c) Indian tribes and tribal organizations may adopt these 
additional requirements but are not mandated to do so by law.


<R05>
Sec. 63.19  When should an employer deny employment or dismiss an employee?

    (a) An employer must deny employment or dismiss an employee when an 
individual has been found guilty of or entered a plea of guilty or nolo 
contendere to any Federal, state or tribal offense involving a crime of 
violence, sexual assault, sexual molestation, child exploitation, sexual 
contact, prostitution, or crimes against persons.
    (b) An employer may deny employment or dismiss an employee when an 
individual has been convicted of an offense involving a child victim, a 
sex crime, or a drug felony.

<R05>
Sec. 63.20  What should an employer do if an individual has been charged

until the court has disposed of the charge.


<R05>
Sec. 63.21  Are there other factors that may disqualify an applicant, 

volunteer or employee from placement in a position which involves regular contact with or 
          control over Indian children?

    Yes.
    (a) An applicant, volunteer, or employee may be disqualified from 
consideration or continuing employment if it is found that:
    (1) The individual's misconduct or negligence interfered with or 
affected a current or prior employer's performance of duties and 
responsibilities.
    (2) The individual's criminal or dishonest conduct affected the 
individual's performance or the performance of others.
    (3) The individual made an intentional false statement, deception or 
fraud on an examination or in obtaining employment.
    (4) The individual has refused to furnish testimony or cooperate 
with an investigation.

duration that suggests the individual could not perform the duties of 
the position or would directly threaten the property or safety of 
others.
    (6) The individual has illegally used narcotics, drugs, or other 
controlled substances without evidence of substantial rehabilitation.
    (7) The individual knowingly and willfully engaged in an act or 
activities designed to disrupt government programs.
    (b) An individual must be disqualified for Federal employment if any 
statutory or regulatory provision would prevent his/her lawful 
employment.

[[Page 256]]


<R05>
Sec. 63.22  Can an employer certify an individual with a prior conviction

or substantiated misconduct as suitable for employment?

    (a) The Bureau of Indian Affairs must use Federal adjudicative 
standards which allow the BIA to certify that an individual is suitable 
for employment in a position that does not involve regular contact with 
or control over Indian children. The adjudicating officer must determine 
that the individual's prior conduct will not interfere with the 
performance of duties and will not create a potential for risk to the 
safety and well-being of Indian children.
    (b) Indian tribes and tribal organizations must identify those 
positions which permit contact with or control over Indian children and 
establish standards to determine suitability for employment. Those 
standards should then be used to determine whether an individual is 
suitable for employment in a position that permits contact with or 
control over Indian children. If not, the individual may only be placed 
in a position that does not permit contact with or control over Indian 
children.


<R05>
Sec. 63.23  What rights does an applicant, volunteer or employee have during this process?

    (a) The applicant, volunteer, or employee must be provided an 
opportunity to explain, deny, or refute unfavorable and incorrect 
information gathered in an investigation, before the adjudication is 
final. The applicant, volunteer, or employee should receive a written 
summary of all derogatory information and be informed of the process for 
explaining, denying, or refuting unfavorable information.
    (b) Employers and adjudicating officials must not release the actual 
background investigative report to an applicant, volunteer, or employee. 
However, they may issue a written summary of the derogatory information.
    (c) The applicant, volunteer, or employee who is the subject of a 
background investigation may obtain a copy of the reports from the 
originating (Federal, state, or other tribal) agency and challenge the 
accuracy and completeness of any information maintained by that agency.
    (d) The results of an investigation cannot be used for any purpose 
other than to determine suitability for employment in a position that 
involves regular contact with or control over Indian children.
    (e) Investigative reports contain information of a highly personal 
nature and should be maintained confidentially and secured in locked 
files. Investigative reports should be seen only by those officials who 
in performing their official duties need to know the information 
contained in the report.


<R05>
Sec. 63.24  What protections must employers provide to applicants, volunteers and employees?

    (a) Indian tribes and tribal organizations must comply with the

meets a tribe's written criteria for membership or who is recognized as 
belonging to a tribe by the local Indians comprising the tribe.
    (l) Mutilated ballot means an official ballot that has been damaged 
to the extent that it is not possible to determine the choice the voter 
intended to make. There are two kinds of mutilated official ballots:
    (1) A ballot that is mutilated and not cast. In this case, the 
mutilated ballot may be exchanged for a new one. If the need arises to 
exchange a mutilated absentee ballot, no additional time will

[[Page 269]]

be provided for the new ballot to be received by the election board.
    (2) A ballot that is mutilated and cast. A mutilated cast ballot is 
to be counted in the same manner as a spoiled cast ballot.

Officer, or other official of the local unit of the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (or a Bureau employee that such person might designate) having 
administrative jurisdiction over a tribe.
    (n) Official ballot means a ballot prepared by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs for use in an election pursuant to this part. It is possible 
that an official ballot may be found to be either spoiled or mutilated 
at the time the votes are counted.
    (o) Registration means the act whereby persons, who are eligible to 
vote, become entitled or qualified to cast ballots by having their names

Act, Executive Order, or otherwise for the use or occupancy of Indians.
    (r) Revocation means that act whereby the adult members of a tribe 
vote to abandon their constitutional form of government as opposed to 
their voting to amend or totally revise it.
    (s) Secretarial election means an election held within a tribe 
pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary as authorized by 
Federal Statute (as distinguished from tribal elections which are 
conducted under tribal authority. (See Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe v. 
Andrus, 566 F. 2d 1085 (8th Cir., 1977), cert. denied 439 U.S. 820 
(1978)).
    (t) Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or his/her 
authorized representative.
    (u) Spoiled ballot means an official ballot that has been marked in 
such a way that it is not possible to determine the intent of the voter, 
a ballot that has not been marked at all, or one that has been marked so 
as to violate the secrecy of the ballot. There are two kinds of spoiled 
official ballots:
    (1) A ballot that is spoiled and not cast. In this case, the spoiled 
ballot may be exchanged for a new one. If the need arises to exchange a 
spoiled absentee ballot, no additional time will be provided for the new 
ballot to be received by the election board.
    (2) A ballot that is spoiled and cast. A spoiled cast ballot is to 
be counted in tabulating the total votes cast in conjunction with 
determining whether the required percentage of the qualified voters has 
participated in the election.
    (v) Tribal government means that entity established pursuant to a 
tribal constitution as empowered to speak for the tribe or in the

services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and (2) any group of Indians 
whose members each have at least one-half degree of Indian blood for 
whom a reservation is established and who each reside on that 
reservation. Such tribes may consist of any consolidation of one or more 
tribes or parts of tribes.
    (x) Voting district means a geographical area established to 
facilitate a tribal election process.


<R05>
Sec. 81.2  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to provide uniformity and order in:
    (1) Holding Secretarial elections for voting on proposed 
constitutions when tribes wish to reorganize,
    (2) Adopting constitutional amendments,
    (3) Ratifying and amending charters,
    (4) Revoking constitutions, and
    (5) Facilitating the calling of such elections by the Secretary 
under provisions of a Federal Statute.
    (b) This part may also be used as a guideline by tribes wishing to 
hold constitutional elections that are not held pursuant to a Federal 
Statute.

[[Page 270]]

    (c) Where a discrepancy might appear to exist between these 
regulations and a specific requirement of the statute governing the 
reorganization of a tribe or ratification and amendment of charters, the 
regulations shall be interpreted to conform with the statute.
    (d) As much as possible, Secretarial elections shall be scheduled so 
as to avoid their being held at the same time as tribal elections in 
order to avoid the confusion that results from different requirements 
for each kind of election.


<R05>
Sec. 81.3  Group eligibility.

    (a) No tribe which has voted to exclude itself from the provisions 
of the Indian Reorganization Act, or is otherwise precluded by law, may 
be reorganized under a Federal Statute. Tribes wishing to reorganize or 
a reorganized tribe seeking to amend its constitution and bylaws or 
wishing to vote to revoke such document shall do so under the 
regulations in this part.
    (b) Charters issued to reorganized tribes shall be ratified or 
amended under the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 81.4  Assistance from the Department of the Interior.

    Representatives of the Department of the Interior will cooperate 
with and offer advice and assistance (including the proposing of 
amendments), to any tribe in drafting a constitution and bylaws, an 
amendment, a charter or charter amendment, or in revocation of 
constitutions. Any payments that might be necessary to non-Bureau staff 
assisting in the conduct of the election shall be made from tribal 
funds.


<R05>
Sec. 81.5  Request to call election.

    (a) The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election to 
adopt a constitution and bylaws or to revoke a constitution and bylaws, 
upon a request from the tribal government.
    (b) The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election to 
adopt a constitution and bylaws pursuant to a Federal Statute upon 
receipt of a petition bearing the signatures of at least 60 percent of 
the tribe's adult members.
    (c) The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election to 
ratify a charter at the time the charter is issued, but he/she may issue 
a charter to a reservation-based tribe only upon petition by at least 
one-third of the adult members of the tribe. No ratification, however, 
shall be valid unless the tribe has a constitution adopted and approved 
pursuant to the relevant Federal Statute.
    (d) The Secretary shall authorize the calling of an election on the 
adoption of amendments to a constitution and bylaws or a charter when 
requested pursuant to the amendment article of those documents. The 
election shall be conducted as prescribed in this part unless the 
amendment article of the constitution and bylaws or the charter provides 
otherwise, in which case the provisions of those documents shall rule 
where applicable.
    (e) If the amendment provisions of a tribal constitution or charter 
have become outdated and amendment can not be effected pursuant to them, 
the Secretary may authorize an election under this part to amend the 
documents when the recognized tribal government so requests.
    (f) Any authorization not acted upon within 90 days (tribes in 
Alaska shall be granted 120 days) from the date of issuance will be 
considered void. Notification of the election date as provided for in 
Sec. 81.14 shall constitute the action envisioned in this section. 
Extension of an authorization may be granted upon a valid and reasonable 
request from the election board. Copies of authorizations shall be 
furnished the requesting tribe or petitioners.
    (g) In those instances where conflicting proposals to amend a single 
constitutional or charter provision are submitted, that proposal first 
received by the officer in charge, if found valid, shall be placed 
before the voters before any consideration is given other proposals. 
Other proposals shall be considered in order of their receipt; provided, 
they are resubmitted following final action on the initial submission. 
This procedure shall also apply in those instances where new or revised 
constitutions are at issue.


<R05>
Sec. 81.6  Entitlement to vote.

    (a) If the group is a tribe, or tribes, of a reservation and is 
acting to effect reorganization under a Federal Statute for the first 
time:

[[Page 271]]

    (1) Any duly registered adult member regardless of residence shall 
be entitled to vote on the adoption of a constitution and bylaws.
    (2) Duly registered adult nonresident members and ill or physically 
disabled registered adult resident members may vote by absentee ballot 
(see Sec. 81.19).
    (b) If the group is composed of the adult Indian residents of a 
reservation:
    (1) Any adult duly registered member physically residing on the 
reservation shall be entitled to vote.
    (2) Absentee voting shall be permitted only for duly registered 
residents temporarily absent from the reservation, ill, or physically 
disabled.
    (c) If the group is a tribe, or tribes, without a reservation as 
defined in this part, any duly registered member shall be entitled to 
vote on the adoption of a constitution and bylaws by either arriving at 
a polling place or by requesting, properly completing, and timely 
casting an absentee ballot as determined by the election board pursuant 
to the relevant Federal Statute; provided, that outside of Alaska and 
Oklahoma, a reservation shall be established for the tribe before it 
becomes entitled to vote on the adoption of a constitution.
    (d) For a reorganized tribe to amend its constitution and bylaws, 
only members who have duly registered shall be entitled to vote; 
provided, that registration is open to the same class of voters that was 
entitled to vote in the Secretarial election that effected its 
reorganization, unless the amendment article of the existing 
constitution provides otherwise.
    (e) For a reorganized tribe to revoke its constitution and bylaws, 
only members who have duly registered shall be entitled to vote; 
provided, that registration is open to the same class of voters as was 
entitled to vote in the Secretarial election that effected its 
reorganization, unless the amendment article of the existing 
constitution provides otherwise.
    (f) For a reorganized tribe to ratify a charter or to adopt a 
charter amendment, any adult member who has duly registered shall be 
entitled to vote, provided that if the tribe is of a reservation, only 
duly registered members physically residing on the reservation shall be 
entitled to vote.


<R05>
Sec. 81.7  Adoption, ratification, or revocation by majority vote.

    Except as it may be further limited by this part, a constitution and 
bylaws, amendments thereto, or charter and charter amendments shall be 
considered adopted, ratified, or revoked if a majority of those actually 
voting are in favor of adoption, ratification, or revocation. The total 
vote cast, however, must be at least 30 percent of those entitled to 
vote, unless, with regard to amendments, the constitution provides 
otherwise. The names of persons appearing on the registration list who 
have not reached eighteen years of age by the date of the election, 
shall be removed from the list of registered voters when determining 
whether the required percentage of participation has been achieved. 
Unless the existing constitution or charter provides otherwise, none of 
the actions cited in this section shall become effective until they are 
approved by the Secretary. The validity of any charter ratification 
shall be dependent upon the tribe first having reorganized. Duly 
ratified charters shall be revoked or surrendered only by Act of 
Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 81.8  Election board.

    (a) There shall be an election board consisting of the officer in 
charge acting as chairman and at least two representatives of the tribal 
governing body or an authorized representative committee. Where such 
persons may be unwilling or unable to serve, the chairman shall select 
at least two adult members of the tribe to serve. In addition, the 
officer in charge may appoint an interpreter and as many clerks and poll 
watchers as he/she deems necessary, but they shall not be members of the 
board.
    (b) It shall be the duty of the board to conduct elections in 
compliance with the procedures described in this part and in particular:
    (1) To see that the name of each person offering to vote is on the 
official list of registered voters;
    (2) To keep the ballot boxes locked at all times except when ballots 
are being counted;

[[Page 272]]

    (3) To see that ballots are cast only by registered voters and that 
the voting list is checked to indicate this;
    (4) To begin to count the regularly cast ballots immediately after 
the close of the polls and then the absentee ballots, pursuant to Sec. 
81.21;
    (5) To post and certify the election returns;
    (6) To return the following to the officer in charge:
    (i) The ballots (in marked and locked boxes);
    (ii) All unused ballots; and
    (iii) The completed Certificate of Results of Election. The officer 
in charge shall retain the ballots and other material among official 
records for at least one year. At the end of one year, the officer in 
charge shall forward the contents of the boxes and other related 
material to the appropriate Federal Records Center.


<R05>
Sec. 81.9  Voting districts.

    If: (a) Voting districts have not already been designated for tribal 
elections in the tribal constitution or by tribal election ordinance or 
resolution; and (b) in the election board's judgment voting districts 
are needed, the board shall establish them and designate a polling place 
for each district. Where a reservation exists, no voting district may be 
established beyond its boundaries.


<R05>
Sec. 81.10  District Election Boards.

    (a) Where voting districts have been established by the tribal 
constitution, ordinance, resolution, or by the election board, the 
election board shall appoint district election boards for each district, 
which shall have the duties prescribed above for the election board 
except that they shall return to the election board:
    (1) The ballots (in marked and locked boxes),
    (2) All unused ballots, and
    (3) Their certifications of the district election results on the 
certification forms prescribed by the election board.
    (b) The board will compile the election results for the entire 
reservation and transmit them together with the aforementioned ballots 
and ballot boxes to the officer in charge.


<R05>
Sec. 81.11  Registration.

    (a) Only registered voters will be entitled to vote, and all 
determinations of the sufficiency of the number of ballots cast will be 
based upon the number of registered voters. The election board, upon 
receipt of authorization to conduct an election, shall notify by regular 
mail all adult members of the tribe, who to its knowledge are eligible 
to vote pursuant to Sec. 81.6 of the need to register if they intend to 
vote. Any tribal member who, to the election board's knowledge, will 
become 18 years of age within 150 days (180 days for Alaska tribes) from 
the date of authorization and who is otherwise eligible to vote shall 
also be notified and shall be eligible to register, provided that such a 
person shall not be entitled to vote if election day falls before the 
individual's 18th birthday. This notice shall be sent to an individual's 
last known address as it appears on the records of the local unit of the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction. Each notice addressed to a 
tribal member not residing on the reservation shall be accompanied by a 
preaddressed registration form (BIA Form 8302) which shall set forth the 
following information in the upper right corner:
    (1) OMB Clearance Number 1076-003, Expires June 30, 1983;
    (2) The name and address of the person desiring to register;
    (3) A statement with a signature line attesting that the individual 
is a tribal member and is at least 18 years of age, or will be within 
150 days, (180 days for Alaska tribes) from the date of authorization; 
and
    (4) The three following statements: ``Completion of and return of 
this registration form is necessary if you desire to become qualified to 
vote in the forthcoming constitutional or charter election.'' ``This 
form, upon completion and return to the election board, shall be the 
basis for determining whether you qualify to have your name placed upon 
the list of registered voters and receive a ballot'' and ``completion 
and return of this form is voluntary.'' Members who qualify as absentee 
voters and wish to cast an absentee ballot must complete and return the 
above

[[Page 273]]

registration form before, or in conjunction with, requesting an absentee 
ballot in sufficient time to permit compliance with Sec. 81.12.
    (b) The following records shall be kept for all notices:
    (1) Names and addresses of persons to whom notices are mailed;
    (2) Date of mailing; and
    (3) A copy of each return registration request (including from whom 
received and date and time of receipt).

Tribal members living on the reservation who desire to vote must 
register with the election board in the manner it determines in time to 
permit compliance with Sec. 81.12. Registration procedures for such 
Indians shall be included in the notice of the need to register to 
resident members.

[46 FR 1670, Jan. 7, 1981, as amended at 46 FR 38352, July 27, 1981. 
Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 81.12  Voting list.

    The election board shall compile in alphabetical order an official 
list of registered voters arranged by voting districts, if any. This 
list shall designate, where applicable, those who have requested an 
absentee ballot and the members of the tribe who are or will have 
attained the age of 18 years within 150 days (180 days for Alaska 
tribes) from the date an election is authorized and who have duly 
registered to vote. A copy of this list shall be supplied to any 
district election board and shall be posted at the headquarters of the 
local administrative unit of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the tribal 
headquarters, and at various other public places designated by the 
election board at least 20 days prior to the election.


<R05>
Sec. 81.13  Eligibility disputes.

    The election board shall determine the eligibility of any written 
claim to vote presented to it by one whose name does not appear on the 
official list of registered voters as well as any written challenge of 
the right to vote of anyone whose name is on the list. Its decision 
shall be final. It shall rule on all claims no later than ten days 
before the election. Any claim not presented at least ten days before 
the election shall be disallowed. Nonresident claimants successfully 
appealing omission from the list shall immediately be furnished an 
absentee ballot. Omission of names from the voters list due to late 
registration, if notification (pursuant to Sec. 81.14) has been timely 
mailed, shall not be considered grounds for challenge.


<R05>
Sec. 81.14  Election notices.

    Not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice shall be given of the 
date of the election. Such notice shall include the location of where 
the results will be posted. The notice shall also advise that persons 
must register if they intend to vote. The election board shall determine 
whether the notice will be given by television, radio, newspaper, 
poster, or mail, or by more than one of these methods and whether in an 
Indian language in addition to English. A copy of any written election 
notice may be mailed to each registered voter and shall be posted at the 
local administrative unit of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and elsewhere 
as directed by the election board. At any time after receiving 
Secretarial authorization to hold the election, the board shall make 
available to the adult members of the tribe the text of any amendment or 
proposed constitution and bylaws, amendment thereto, charter, or charter 
amendment. The election board may determine the manner and timing of the 
distribution. However, the text shall be posted at least within the 
local administrative unit of the Bureau and the tribal headquarters 
within two days following the giving of notice of the election date by 
the election board.


<R05>
Sec. 81.15  Opening and closing of polls.

    If polling places are established, the polls shall remain open from 
8 a.m. to 7 p.m., local time, unless different hours are set by the 
election board and the voters are informed of this in the election 
notice.


<R05>
Sec. 81.16  Interpreters.

    Interpreters, where needed, may be provided to explain the manner of 
voting to any voter who asks for instructions; provided, that all 
reasonable precautions are taken to ensure that the interpreter does not 
influence the voter in casting the ballot. The interpreter

[[Page 274]]

may accompany the voter into the booth upon the latter's request.


<R05>
Sec. 81.17  Electioneering.

    There shall be no electioneering during voting hours within 50 feet 
of any voting place. Sample ballots will be permitted in the voting 
booth.


<R05>
Sec. 81.18  Manner of voting.

    (a) Registered voters may vote by arriving at the appropriate 
polling place within the prescribed voting hours telling officials their 
names and addresses, signing their signature or mark on the voting list, 
and by marking and placing in the ballot box the ballots which will be 
handed to them. Voting shall be by secret ballot.
    (b) Voting may take place at the same time regarding the adoption of 
a constitution, the ratification of a charter, or the amendment of such 
documents; provided, that entitlement to vote for the proposal is 
consistent with Sec. 81.6 of this part and, provided further, that no 
charter shall be considered ratified if the proposed constitution is not 
adopted and approved.
    (c) The election board may choose not to use polling places and 
provide for the issuance and receipt of ballots entirely through the 
United States Postal Service. In that event, the election board shall 
use the appropriate procedures set forth in this part relating to 
absentee balloting.


<R05>
Sec. 81.19  Absentee voting.

    (a) Nonresident members who have registered may vote by absentee 
ballot except as prohibited by Sec. 81.6. Also, whenever, due to 
temporary absence from the reservation, illness, or physical disability, 
a registered and otherwise eligible voter is not able to vote at the 
polls and notifies the election board, the voter shall be entitled to 
vote by absentee ballot. Upon his or her request, the election board 
shall give or mail absentee ballots to registered voters who may be 
entitled to receive them pursuant to Sec. 81.6. At the same time, such 
voters will also be provided a copy of the proposal to be voted upon 
when the full text does not appear on the ballot. Appropriate records 
shall be kept of those from whom requests are received and the date they 
were received. The election board shall allow an absentee voter no less 
than ten days from the mailing out of an absentee ballot to receive and 
return the ballot. This period shall not be afforded absentee voters 
desiring to exchange a mutilated or spoiled ballot less than ten days 
before the election date. While requests for absentee ballots received 
less than ten days before an election will be promptly honored, no 
absentee ballot will be counted if received later than either the close 
of the polls or after some other deadline established by the election 
board. The election board shall furnish election officials the names of 
individuals who have been given or had mailed to them an absentee 
ballot.
    (b) Accompanying the absentee ballot shall be:
    (1) An inner envelope bearing on the outside, the words ``Absentee 
Ballot,''
    (2) Instructions for completion of the absentee ballot,
    (3) A copy of the proposed amendment, and
    (4) A preaddressed outer envelope, imprinted on the back with a 
certificate as follows:

    I, (name of voter), hereby certify that I am a qualified voter of 
the (name) Tribe of Indians; that I will be 18 years of age or over at 
the election date and am entitled to vote in the election to be held on 
(date of election); and that I cannot appear at the polling place on the 
reservation on the date of the election because (indicate one of the 
following reasons): I am a non resident voter [squ]; or I expect to be 
temporarily absent from the reservation [squ]; or because of illness 
[squ]; or physical disability [squ]; or because no polling place has 
been established [squ]. I further certify that I marked the enclosed 
ballot in secret.

     Signed:--------------(voter's signature).

    (c) The absentee voter shall mark the ballot and the ballot shall 
then be folded so as to conceal the marking and be placed in the 
envelope marked ``Absentee Ballot'' and the envelope sealed. The voter 
shall then place the sealed envelope marked ``Absentee Ballot'' in the 
outer envelope, seal it and complete the certificate and mail it. The 
preaddressed outer envelope shall be directed to the election board at 
the reservation. Absentee ballots must be received by the election board 
not later

[[Page 275]]

than the close of the polls or as otherwise directed by the election 
board.
    (d) The election board shall make and keep a record of ballots 
mailed, to whom mailed, the date of mailing, the address on the 
envelope, the date of the return of the ballot, and from whom received. 
After duly recording the receipt date of absentee ballots received on 
time, representatives of the election board shall open the outer 
envelopes, secure them and place the unmarked inner envelopes containing 
the ballots in a separate box reserved for that purpose. After all other 
ballots have been counted, the absentee ballots shall be counted 
immediately and included in the results of the election.


<R05>
Sec. 81.20  Ballots.

    (a) Ballots are to be prepared clearly and simply so that it is easy 
for the voters to indicate a choice between no more than two 
alternatives. For example, if a tribal council or the petitioners 
propose to reduce the one-half degree blood quantum required to qualify 
for membership but want the voters to decide whether it should be one-
fourth or one-eight, it would not be appropriate to put those two 
alternatives on the ballot. Doing so, would deny the voters an 
opportunity to vote for keeping the one-half degree blood quantum. 
Neither would it be appropriate to include all three blood quantum 
alternatives. Rather, those proposing the change should decide which 
blood quantum is to be submitted to the voters. The ballot in the 
Secretarial election would then give the electors the choice of marking 
either ``yes'' or ``no.'' A vote against the proposed change would be in 
favor of keeping the one-half degree blood quantum in the example.
    (b) In preparing ballots for proposed amendments, care should be 
taken to ensure that:
    (1) Each proposed amendment addresses only a single question.
    (2) If a proposed amendment conflicts with other provisions of the 
document being amended, the ballot shall be prepared so that the 
question includes all changes in those other directly related provisions 
in order to avoid contradictions within the document.
    (3) When more than one amendment is being submitted to the voters at 
a given election, the proposals shall be identified with alphabetical 
designations rather than numerical. The first of the several proposals 
would be labeled ``Proposed Amendment A,'' the next would be ``Proposed 
Amendment B,'' etc. Those amendments that are adopted and approved would 
then be assigned consecutive numbers to follow those assigned any 
earlier amendments that may have been make to that governing document. A 
statement similar to the following shall appear on each of the proposed 
amendments and shall be completed following the election:

    Having been duly adopted and approved, Proposed Amendment (A,B,C, 
etc.) is hereby designated as Amendment No. -- to the (Constitution, 
Charter, etc.) of the (name of tribe) Tribe.

    (c) The election board will supply all ballots. Each ballot shall be 
stamped in red ink on its face in the same place:

OFFICIAL BALLOT
(Facsimile Signature)
CHAIRMAN, ELECTION BOARD

    (d) Should any voter spoil or mutilate a ballot in the course of 
voting at a poll, the voter shall destroy it in the presence of the 
election officials and the election officials shall then make note of 
the destroyed ballot and furnish the voter with another ballot.
    (e) Any spoiled or mutilated absentee ballot may be exchanged for a 
new one by returning it to the election board with a request for 
another. The board shall honor the request promptly and note the dates 
of related actions. No extension of time will be granted for receipt of 
exchanged ballots that might not be cast on time.


<R05>
Sec. 81.21  Counting of ballots.

    All duly cast ballots are to be counted. Even though it will not be 
possible to determine the intent of the voter regarding spoiled and 
mutilated ballots, they are to be counted for purposes of determining 
whether the required percentage of voters have cast their ballots in the 
election. Invalid ballots shall not be counted for purposes of 
determining the required percentage of votes cast.

[[Page 276]]


<R05>
Sec. 81.22  Contesting of election results.

    Any qualified voter, within three days following the posting of the 
results of an election, may challenge the election results by filing 
with the Secretary through the officer in charge the grounds for the 
challenge, together with substantiating evidence. If in the opinion of 
the Secretary, the objections are valid and warrant a recount or new 
election, the Secretary shall order a recount or a new election. The 
results of the recount or new election shall be final.


<R05>
Sec. 81.23  Posting and certifying election results.

    (a) The results of the election shall be posted in the local Bureau 
of Indian Affairs office, tribal headquarters, and at other appropriate 
public places determined by the election board.
    (b) The election board shall certify the results of the election on 
the following form and transmit them to the local unit of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs:

                   Certificate of Results of Election

    Pursuant to a Secretarial election authorized by the (title of

following ways:
    (1) Through having each signer subscribe or acknowledge his/her

may be filed with the local Bureau official.
    (b) Challenges will be considered on the following grounds:
    (1) Forgery of signatures; and

[[Page 279]]

    (2) Lack of proper qualifications of a signer.

No challenge will be considered which is not accompanied by supporting 
evidence in writing. In the event that an individual's name appears on a 
petition more than once, all but one of the names shall be stricken.

    (b) The Area Director or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall 
within 45 days after the official filing date decide upon each challenge 
and the sufficiency of the petition and announce whether the petition 
shall be acted upon. If a decision is reached that the petitioning 
action is for any reason insufficient, the spokesman for the petitioners 
and the governing body of the tribe will be so informed and given the 
reasons for the decision. If a petitioning action warrants action by the 
Secretary or Commissioner, the spokesman for the petitioners and the 
governing body of the tribe concerned will be so informed. The decision

<R05>
Sec. 83.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish a departmental procedure 
and policy for acknowledging that certain American Indian groups exist 
as tribes. Acknowledgment of tribal existence by the Department is a 
prerequisite to the protection, services, and benefits of the Federal 
government available to Indian tribes by virtue of their status as 
tribes. Acknowledgment shall also mean that the tribe is entitled to the 
immunities and privileges available to other federally acknowledged 
Indian tribes by virtue of their government-to-government relationship 
with the United States as well as the responsibilities, powers, 
limitations and obligations of such tribes. Acknowledgment shall subject 
the Indian tribe to the same authority of Congress and the United States 
to which other federally acknowledged tribes are subjected.


<R05>
Sec. 83.3  Scope.

    (a) This part applies only to those American Indian groups 
indigenous to the continental United States which are not currently 
acknowledged as Indian tribes by the Department. It is intended to apply 
to groups that can establish a substantially continuous tribal existence 
and which have functioned as autonomous entities throughout history 
until the present.
    (b) Indian tribes, organized bands, pueblos, Alaska Native villages, 
or communities which are already acknowledged as such and are receiving 
services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs may not be reviewed under the 
procedures established by these regulations.
    (c) Associations, organizations, corporations or groups of any 
character that have been formed in recent times may not be acknowledged 
under these regulations. The fact that a group that meets the criteria 
in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (g) has recently incorporated or otherwise 
formalized its existing autonomous political process will be viewed as a 
change in form and have no bearing on the Assistant Secretary's final 
decision.
    (d) Splinter groups, political factions, communities or groups of 
any character that separate from the main body of a currently 
acknowledged tribe may not be acknowledged under these regulations. 
However, groups that can establish clearly that they have functioned 
throughout history until the present as an autonomous tribal entity may 
be acknowledged under this part, even though they have been regarded by 
some as part of or have been associated in some manner with an 
acknowledged North American Indian tribe.
    (e) Further, groups which are, or the members of which are, subject 
to congressional legislation terminating or forbidding the Federal 
relationship may not be acknowledged under this part.
    (f) Finally, groups that previously petitioned and were denied 
Federal acknowledgment under these regulations or under previous 
regulations in part 83 of this title, may not be acknowledged under 
these regulations. This includes reorganized or reconstituted 
petitioners previously denied, or splinter groups, spin-offs, or 
component groups of any type that were once part of petitioners 
previously denied.
    (g) Indian groups whose documented petitions are under active 
consideration at the effective date of these revised regulations may 
choose to complete their petitioning process either under these 
regulations or under the previous acknowledgment regulations in part 83 
of this title. This choice must be made by April 26, 1994. This option 
shall apply to any petition for which a determination is not final and 
effective. Such petitioners may request a suspension of consideration 
under Sec. 83.10(g) of not more than 180 days in

[[Page 282]]

order to provide additional information or argument.


<R05>
Sec. 83.4  Filing a letter of intent.

    (a) Any Indian group in the continental United States that believes 
it should be acknowledged as an Indian tribe and that it can satisfy the 
criteria in Sec. 83.7 may submit a letter of intent.
    (b) Letters of intent requesting acknowledgment that an Indian group 
exists as an Indian tribe shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary--
Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20240. Attention: Branch of Acknowledgment and Research, 
Mail Stop 2611-MIB. A letter of intent may be filed in advance of, or at 
the same time as, a group's documented petition.
    (c) A letter of intent must be produced, dated and signed by the 
governing body of an Indian group and submitted to the Assistant 
Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 83.5  Duties of the Department.

    (a) The Department shall publish in the Federal Register, no less 
frequently than every three years, a list of all Indian tribes entitled 
to receive services from the Bureau by virtue of their status as Indian 
tribes. The list may be published more frequently, if the Assistant 
Secretary deems it necessary.
    (b) The Assistant Secretary shall make available revised and 
expanded guidelines for the preparation of documented petitions by 
September 23, 1994. These guidelines will include an explanation of the 
criteria and other provisions of the regulations, a discussion of the 
types of evidence which may be used to demonstrate particular criteria 
or other provisions of the regulations, and general suggestions and 
guidelines on how and where to conduct research. The guidelines may be 
supplemented or updated as necessary. The Department's example of a 
documented petition format, while preferable, shall not preclude the use 
of any other format.
    (c) The Department shall, upon request, provide petitioners with 
suggestions and advice regarding preparation of the documented petition. 
The Department shall not be responsible for the actual research on 
behalf of the petitioner.
    (d) Any notice which by the terms of these regulations must be 
published in the Federal Register, shall also be mailed to the 
petitioner, the governor of the state where the group is located, and to 
other interested parties.
    (e) After an Indian group has filed a letter of intent requesting 
Federal acknowledgment as an Indian tribe and until that group has 
actually submitted a documented petition, the Assistant Secretary may 
contact the group periodically and request clarification, in writing, of 
its intent to continue with the petitioning process.
    (f) All petitioners under active consideration shall be notified, by 
April 16, 1994, of the opportunity under Sec. 83.3(g) to choose whether 
to complete their petitioning process under the provisions of these 
revised regulations or the previous regulations as published, on 
September 5, 1978, at 43 FR 39361.
    (g) All other groups that have submitted documented petitions or 
letters of intent shall be notified of and provided with a copy of these 
regulations by July 25, 1994.


<R05>
Sec. 83.6  General provisions for the documented petition.

    (a) The documented petition may be in any readable form that 
contains detailed, specific evidence in support of a request to the 
Secretary to acknowledge tribal existence.
    (b) The documented petition must include a certification, signed and 
dated by members of the group's governing body, stating that it is the 
group's official documented petition.
    (c) A petitioner must satisfy all of the criteria in paragraphs (a) 
through (g) of Sec. 83.7 in order for tribal existence to be 
acknowledged. Therefore, the documented petition must include thorough 
explanations and supporting documentation in response to all of the 
criteria. The definitions in Sec. 83.1 are an integral part of the 
regulations, and the criteria should be read carefully together with 
these definitions.
    (d) A petitioner may be denied acknowledgment if the evidence 
available demonstrates that it does not meet one or more criteria. A 
petitioner may also

[[Page 283]]

be denied if there is insufficient evidence that it meets one or more of 
the criteria. A criterion shall be considered met if the available 
evidence establishes a reasonable likelihood of the validity of the 
facts relating to that criterion. Conclusive proof of the facts relating 
to a criterion shall not be required in order for the criterion to be 
considered met.
    (e) Evaluation of petitions shall take into account historical 
situations and time periods for which evidence is demonstrably limited 
or not available. The limitations inherent in demonstrating the 
historical existence of community and political influence or authority 
shall also be taken into account. Existence of community and political 
influence or authority shall be demonstrated on a substantially 
continuous basis, but this demonstration does not require meeting these 
criteria at every point in time. Fluctuations in tribal activity during 
various years shall not in themselves be a cause for denial of 
acknowledgment under these criteria.
    (f) The criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (g) shall be interpreted 
as applying to tribes or groups that have historically combined and 
functioned as a single autonomous political entity.
    (g) The specific forms of evidence stated in the criteria in Sec. 
83.7 (a) through (c) and Sec. 83.7(e) are not mandatory requirements. 
The criteria may be met alternatively by any suitable evidence that 
demonstrates that the petitioner meets the requirements of the criterion 
statement and related definitions.


<R05>
Sec. 83.7  Mandatory criteria for Federal acknowledgment.

    The mandatory criteria are:
    (a) The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian entity 
on a substantially continuous basis since 1900. Evidence that the 
group's character as an Indian entity has from time to time been denied 
shall not be considered to be conclusive evidence that this criterion 
has not been met. Evidence to be relied upon in determining a group's 
Indian identity may include one or a combination of the following, as 
well as other evidence of identification by other than the petitioner 
itself or its members.
    (1) Identification as an Indian entity by Federal authorities.
    (2) Relationships with State governments based on identification of 
the group as Indian.
    (3) Dealings with a county, parish, or other local government in a 
relationship based on the group's Indian identity.
    (4) Identification as an Indian entity by anthropologists, 
historians, and/or other scholars.
    (5) Identification as an Indian entity in newspapers and books.
    (6) Identification as an Indian entity in relationships with Indian 
tribes or with national, regional, or state Indian organizations.
    (b) A predominant portion of the petitioning group comprises a 
distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times 
until the present.
    (1) This criterion may be demonstrated by some combination of the 
following evidence and/or other evidence that the petitioner meets the 
definition of community set forth in Sec. 83.1:
    (i) Significant rates of marriage within the group, and/or, as may 
be culturally required, patterned out-marriages with other Indian 
populations.
    (ii) Significant social relationships connecting individual members.
    (iii) Significant rates of informal social interaction which exist 
broadly among the members of a group.
    (iv) A significant degree of shared or cooperative labor or other 
economic activity among the membership.
    (v) Evidence of strong patterns of discrimination or other social 
distinctions by non-members.
    (vi) Shared sacred or secular ritual activity encompassing most of 
the group.
    (vii) Cultural patterns shared among a significant portion of the 
group that are different from those of the non-Indian populations with 
whom it interacts. These patterns must function as more than a symbolic 
identification of the group as Indian. They may include, but are not 
limited to, language, kinship organization, or religious beliefs and 
practices.

[[Page 284]]

    (viii) The persistence of a named, collective Indian identity 
continuously over a period of more than 50 years, notwithstanding 
changes in name.
    (ix) A demonstration of historical political influence under the 
criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) shall be evidence for demonstrating 
historical community.
    (2) A petitioner shall be considered to have provided sufficient 
evidence of community at a given point in time if evidence is provided 
to demonstrate any one of the following:
    (i) More than 50 percent of the members reside in a geographical 
area exclusively or almost exclusively composed of members of the group, 
and the balance of the group maintains consistent interaction with some 
members of the community;
    (ii) At least 50 percent of the marriages in the group are between 
members of the group;
    (iii) At least 50 percent of the group members maintain distinct 
cultural patterns such as, but not limited to, language, kinship 
organization, or religious beliefs and practices;
    (iv) There are distinct community social institutions encompassing 
most of the members, such as kinship organizations, formal or informal 
economic cooperation, or religious organizations; or
    (v) The group has met the criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) using evidence 
described in Sec. 83.7(c)(2).
    (c) The petitioner has maintained political influence or authority 
over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the 
present.
    (1) This criterion may be demonstrated by some combination of the 
evidence listed below and/or by other evidence that the petitioner meets 
the definition of political influence or authority in Sec. 83.1.
    (i) The group is able to mobilize significant numbers of members and 
significant resources from its members for group purposes.
    (ii) Most of the membership considers issues acted upon or actions 
taken by group leaders or governing bodies to be of importance.
    (iii) There is widespread knowledge, communication and involvement 
in political processes by most of the group's members.
    (iv) The group meets the criterion in Sec. 83.7(b) at more than a 
minimal level.
    (v) There are internal conflicts which show controversy over valued 
group goals, properties, policies, processes and/or decisions.
    (2) A petitioning group shall be considered to have provided 
sufficient evidence to demonstrate the exercise of political influence 
or authority at a given point in time by demonstrating that group 
leaders and/or other mechanisms exist or existed which:
    (i) Allocate group resources such as land, residence rights and the 
like on a consistent basis.
    (ii) Settle disputes between members or subgroups by mediation or 
other means on a regular basis;
    (iii) Exert strong influence on the behavior of individual members, 
such as the establishment or maintenance of norms and the enforcement of 
sanctions to direct or control behavior;
    (iv) Organize or influence economic subsistence activities among the 
members, including shared or cooperative labor.
    (3) A group that has met the requirements in paragraph 83.7(b)(2) at 
a given point in time shall be considered to have provided sufficient 
evidence to meet this criterion at that point in time.
    (d) A copy of the group's present governing document including its 
membership criteria. In the absence of a written document, the 
petitioner must provide a statement describing in full its membership 
criteria and current governing procedures.
    (e) The petitioner's membership consists of individuals who descend 
from a historical Indian tribe or from historical Indian tribes which 
combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.
    (1) Evidence acceptable to the Secretary which can be used for this 
purpose includes but is not limited to:
    (i) Rolls prepared by the Secretary on a descendancy basis for 
purposes of distributing claims money, providing allotments, or other 
purposes;
    (ii) State, Federal, or other official records or evidence 
identifying present members or ancestors of present members as being 
descendants of a historical tribe or tribes that combined and

[[Page 285]]

functioned as a single autonomous political entity.
    (iii) Church, school, and other similar enrollment records 
identifying present members or ancestors of present members as being 
descendants of a historical tribe or tribes that combined and functioned 
as a single autonomous political entity.
    (iv) Affidavits of recognition by tribal elders, leaders, or the 
tribal governing body identifying present members or ancestors of 
present members as being descendants of a historical tribe or tribes 
that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political entity.
    (v) Other records or evidence identifying present members or 
ancestors of present members as being descendants of a historical tribe 
or tribes that combined and functioned as a single autonomous political 
entity.
    (2) The petitioner must provide an official membership list, 
separately certified by the group's governing body, of all known current 
members of the group. This list must include each member's full name 
(including maiden name), date of birth, and current residential address. 
The petitioner must also provide a copy of each available former list of 
members based on the group's own defined criteria, as well as a 
statement describing the circumstances surrounding the preparation of 
the current list and, insofar as possible, the circumstances surrounding 
the preparation of former lists.
    (f) The membership of the petitioning group is composed principally 
of persons who are not members of any acknowledged North American Indian 
tribe. However, under certain conditions a petitioning group may be 
acknowledged even if its membership is composed principally of persons 
whose names have appeared on rolls of, or who have been otherwise 
associated with, an acknowledged Indian tribe. The conditions are that 
the group must establish that it has functioned throughout history until 
the present as a separate and autonomous Indian tribal entity, that its 
members do not maintain a bilateral political relationship with the 
acknowledged tribe, and that its members have provided written 
confirmation of their membership in the petitioning group.
    (g) Neither the petitioner nor its members are the subject of 
congressional legislation that has expressly terminated or forbidden the 
Federal relationship.


<R05>
Sec. 83.8  Previous Federal acknowledgment.

    (a) Unambiguous previous Federal acknowledgment is acceptable 
evidence of the tribal character of a petitioner to the date of the last 
such previous acknowledgment. If a petitioner provides substantial 
evidence of unambiguous Federal acknowledgment, the petitioner will then 
only be required to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of Sec. 
83.7 to the extent required by this section.
    (b) A determination of the adequacy of the evidence of previous 
Federal action acknowledging tribal status shall be made during the 
technical assistance review of the documented petition conducted 
pursuant to Sec. 83.10(b). If a petition is awaiting active 
consideration at the time of adoption of these regulations, this review 
will be conducted while the petition is under active consideration 
unless the petitioner requests in writing that this review be made in 
advance.
    (c) Evidence to demonstrate previous Federal acknowledgment 
includes, but is not limited to:
    (1) Evidence that the group has had treaty relations with the United 
States.
    (2) Evidence that the group has been denominated a tribe by act of 
Congress or Executive Order.
    (3) Evidence that the group has been treated by the Federal 
Government as having collective rights in tribal lands or funds.
    (d) To be acknowledged, a petitioner that can demonstrate previous 
Federal acknowledgment must show that:
    (1) The group meets the requirements of the criterion in Sec. 
83.7(a), except that such identification shall be demonstrated since the 
point of last Federal acknowledgment. The group must further have been 
identified by such sources as the same tribal entity that was previously 
acknowledged or as a

[[Page 286]]

portion that has evolved from that entity.
    (2) The group meets the requirements of the criterion in Sec. 
83.7(b) to demonstrate that it comprises a distinct community at 
present. However, it need not provide evidence to demonstrate existence 
as a community historically.
    (3) The group meets the requirements of the criterion in Sec. 
83.7(c) to demonstrate that political influence or authority is 
exercised within the group at present. Sufficient evidence to meet the 
criterion in Sec. 83.7(c) from the point of last Federal acknowledgment 
to the present may be provided by demonstration of substantially 
continuous historical identification, by authoritative, knowledgeable 
external sources, of leaders and/or a governing body who exercise 
political influence or authority, together with demonstration of one 
form of evidence listed in Sec. 83.7(c).
    (4) The group meets the requirements of the criteria in paragraphs 
83.7 (d) through (g).
    (5) If a petitioner which has demonstrated previous Federal 
acknowledgment cannot meet the requirements in paragraphs (d) (1) and 
(3), the petitioner may demonstrate alternatively that it meets the 
requirements of the criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) through (c) from last 
Federal acknowledgment until the present.


<R05>
Sec. 83.9  Notice of receipt of a petition.

    (a) Within 30 days after receiving a letter of intent, or a 
documented petition if a letter of intent has not previously been 
received and noticed, the Assistant Secretary shall acknowledge such 
receipt in writing and shall have published within 60 days in the 
Federal Register a notice of such receipt. This notice must include the 
name, location, and mailing address of the petitioner and such other 
information as will identify the entity submitting the letter of intent 
or documented petition and the date it was received. This notice shall 
also serve to announce the opportunity for interested parties and 
informed parties to submit factual or legal arguments in support of or 
in opposition to the petitioner's request for acknowledgment and/or to 
request to be kept informed of all general actions affecting the 
petition. The notice shall also indicate where a copy of the letter of 
intent and the documented petition may be examined.
    (b) The Assistant Secretary shall notify, in writing, the governor 
and attorney general of the state in which a petitioner is located. The 
Assistant Secretary shall also notify any recognized tribe and any other 
petitioner which appears to have a historical or present relationship 
with the petitioner or which may otherwise be considered to have a 
potential interest in the acknowledgment determination.
    (c) The Assistant Secretary shall also publish the notice of receipt 
of the letter of intent, or documented petition if a letter of intent 
has not been previously received, in a major newspaper or newspapers of 
general circulation in the town or city nearest to the petitioner. The 
notice will include all of the information in paragraph (a) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 83.10  Processing of the documented petition.

    (a) Upon receipt of a documented petition, the Assistant Secretary 
shall cause a review to be conducted to determine whether the petitioner 
is entitled to be acknowledged as an Indian tribe. The review shall 
include consideration of the documented petition and the factual 
statements contained therein. The Assistant Secretary may also initiate 
other research for any purpose relative to analyzing the documented 
petition and obtaining additional information about the petitioner's 
status. The Assistant Secretary may likewise consider any evidence which 
may be submitted by interested parties or informed parties.
    (b) Prior to active consideration of the documented petition, the 
Assistant Secretary shall conduct a preliminary review of the petition 
for purposes of technical assistance.
    (1) This technical assistance review does not constitute the 
Assistant Secretary's review to determine if the petitioner is entitled 
to be acknowledged as an Indian tribe. It is a preliminary review for 
the purpose of providing the petitioner an opportunity to supplement or 
revise the documented petition prior to active consideration. Insofar

[[Page 287]]

as possible, technical assistance reviews under this paragraph will be 
conducted in the order of receipt of documented petitions. However, 
technical assistance reviews will not have priority over active 
consideration of documented petitions.
    (2) After the technical assistance review, the Assistant Secretary 
shall notify the petitioner by letter of any obvious deficiencies or 
significant omissions apparent in the documented petition and provide 
the petitioner with an opportunity to withdraw the documented petition 
for further work or to submit additional information and/or 
clarification.
    (3) If a petitioner's documented petition claims previous Federal 
acknowledgment and/or includes evidence of previous Federal 
acknowledgment, the technical assistance review will also include a 
review to determine whether that evidence is sufficient to meet the 
requirements of previous Federal acknowledgment as defined in Sec. 
83.1.
    (c) Petitioners have the option of responding in part or in full to 
the technical assistance review letter or of requesting, in writing, 
that the Assistant Secretary proceed with the active consideration of 
the documented petition using the materials already submitted.
    (1) If the petitioner requests that the materials submitted in 
response to the technical assistance review letter be again reviewed for 
adequacy, the Assistant Secretary will provide the additional review. 
However, this additional review will not be automatic and will be 
conducted only at the request of the petitioner.
    (2) If the assertion of previous Federal acknowledgment under Sec. 
83.8 cannot be substantiated during the technical assistance review, the 
petitioner must respond by providing additional evidence. A petitioner 
claiming previous Federal acknowledgment who fails to respond to a 
technical assistance review letter under this paragraph, or whose 
response fails to establish the claim, shall have its documented 
petition considered on the same basis as documented petitions submitted 
by groups not claiming previous Federal acknowledgment. Petitioners that 
fail to demonstrate previous Federal acknowledgment after a review of 
materials submitted in response to the technical assistance review shall 
be so notified. Such petitioners may submit additional materials 
concerning previous acknowledgment during the course of active 
consideration.
    (d) The order of consideration of documented petitions shall be 
determined by the date of the Bureau's notification to the petitioner 
that it considers that the documented petition is ready to be placed on 
active consideration. The Assistant Secretary shall establish and 
maintain a numbered register of documented petitions which have been 
determined ready for active consideration. The Assistant Secretary shall 
also maintain a numbered register of letters of intent or incomplete 
petitions based on the original date of filing with the Bureau. In the 
event that two or more documented petitions are determined ready for 
active consideration on the same date, the register of letters of intent 
or incomplete petitions shall determine the order of consideration by 
the Assistant Secretary.
    (e) Prior to active consideration, the Assistant Secretary shall 
investigate any petitioner whose documented petition and response to the 
technical assistance review letter indicates that there is little or no 
evidence that establishes that the group can meet the mandatory criteria 
in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of Sec. 83.7.
    (1) If this review finds that the evidence clearly establishes that 
the group does not meet the mandatory criteria in paragraph (e), (f) or 
(g) of Sec. 83.7, a full consideration of the documented petition under 
all seven of the mandatory criteria will not be undertaken pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section. Rather, the Assistant Secretary shall 
instead decline to acknowledge that the petitioner is an Indian tribe 
and publish a proposed finding to that effect in the Federal Register. 
The periods for receipt of comments on the proposed finding from 
petitioners, interested parties and informed parties, for consideration 
of comments received, and for publication of a final determination 
regarding the petitioner's status shall follow the timetables 
established in paragraphs (h) through (l) of this section.

[[Page 288]]

    (2) If the review cannot clearly demonstrate that the group does not 
meet one or more of the mandatory criteria in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) 
of Sec. 83.7, a full evaluation of the documented petition under all 
seven of the mandatory criteria shall be undertaken during active 
consideration of the documented petition pursuant to paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (f) The petitioner and interested parties shall be notified when the 
documented petition comes under active consideration.
    (1) They shall also be provided with the name, office address, and 
telephone number of the staff member with primary administrative 
responsibility for the petition; the names of the researchers conducting 
the evaluation of the petition; and the name of their supervisor.
    (2) The petitioner shall be notified of any substantive comment on 
its petition received prior to the beginning of active consideration or 
during the preparation of the proposed finding, and shall be provided an 
opportunity to respond to such comments.
    (g) Once active consideration of the documented petition has begun, 
the Assistant Secretary shall continue the review and publish proposed 
findings and a final determination in the Federal Register pursuant to 
these regulations, notwithstanding any requests by the petitioner or 
interested parties to cease consideration. The Assistant Secretary has 
the discretion, however, to suspend active consideration of a documented 
petition, either conditionally or for a stated period of time, upon a 
showing to the petitioner that there are technical problems with the 
documented petition or administrative problems that temporarily preclude 
continuing active consideration. The Assistant Secretary shall also 
consider requests by petitioners for suspension of consideration and has 
the discretion to grant such requests for good cause. Upon resolution of 
the technical or administrative problems that are the basis for the 
suspension, the documented petition will have priority on the numbered 
register of documented petitions insofar as possible. The Assistant 
Secretary shall notify the petitioner and interested parties when active 
consideration of the documented petition is resumed. The timetables in 
succeeding paragraphs shall begin anew upon the resumption of active 
consideration.
    (h) Within one year after notifying the petitioner that active 
consideration of the documented petition has begun, the Assistant 
Secretary shall publish proposed findings in the Federal Register. The 
Assistant Secretary has the discretion to extend that period up to an 
additional 180 days. The petitioner and interested parties shall be 
notified of the time extension. In addition to the proposed findings, 
the Assistant Secretary shall prepare a report summarizing the evidence, 
reasoning, and analyses that are the basis for the proposed decision. 
Copies of the report shall be provided to the petitioner, interested 
parties, and informed parties and made available to others upon written 
request.
    (i) Upon publication of the proposed findings, the petitioner or any 
individual or organization wishing to challenge or support the proposed 
findings shall have 180 days to submit arguments and evidence to the 
Assistant Secretary to rebut or support the proposed finding. The period 
for comment on a proposed finding may be extended for up to an 
additional 180 days at the Assistant Secretary's discretion upon a 
finding of good cause. The petitioner and interested parties shall be 
notified of the time extension. Interested and informed parties who 
submit arguments and evidence to the Assistant Secretary must provide 
copies of their submissions to the petitioner.
    (j)(1) During the response period, the Assistant Secretary shall 
provide technical advice concerning the factual basis for the proposed 
finding, the reasoning used in preparing it, and suggestions regarding 
the preparation of materials in response to the proposed finding. The 
Assistant Secretary shall make available to the petitioner in a timely 
fashion any records used for the proposed finding not already held by 
the petitioner, to the extent allowable by Federal law.
    (2) In addition, the Assistant Secretary shall, if requested by the 
petitioner or any interested party, hold a

[[Page 289]]

formal meeting for the purpose of inquiring into the reasoning, 
analyses, and factual bases for the proposed finding. The proceedings of 
this meeting shall be on the record. The meeting record shall be 
available to any participating party and become part of the record 
considered by the Assistant Secretary in reaching a final determination.
    (k) The petitioner shall have a minimum of 60 days to respond to any 
submissions by interested and informed parties during the response 
period. This may be extended at the Assistant Secretary's discretion if 
warranted by the extent and nature of the comments. The petitioner and 
interested parties shall be notified by letter of any extension. No 
further comments from interested or informed parties will be accepted 
after the end of the regular response period.
    (l) At the end of the period for comment on a proposed finding, the 
Assistant Secretary shall consult with the petitioner and interested 
parties to determine an equitable timeframe for consideration of written 
arguments and evidence submitted during the response period. The 
petitioner and interested parties shall be notified of the date such 
consideration begins.
    (1) Unsolicited comments submitted after the close of the response 
period established in Sec. 83.10(i) and Sec. 83.10(k), will not be 
considered in preparation of a final determination. The Assistant 
Secretary has the discretion during the preparation of the proposed 
finding, however, to request additional explanations and information 
from the petitioner or from commenting parties to support or supplement 
their comments on a proposed finding. The Assistant Secretary may also 
conduct such additional research as is necessary to evaluate and 
supplement the record. In either case, the additional materials will 
become part of the petition record.
    (2) After consideration of the written arguments and evidence 
rebutting or supporting the proposed finding and the petitioner's 
response to the comments of interested parties and informed parties, the 
Assistant Secretary shall make a final determination regarding the 
petitioner's status. A summary of this determination shall be published 
in the Federal Register within 60 days from the date on which the 
consideration of the written arguments and evidence rebutting or 
supporting the proposed finding begins.
    (3) The Assistant Secretary has the discretion to extend the period 
for the preparation of a final determination if warranted by the extent 
and nature of evidence and arguments received during the response 
period. The petitioner and interested parties shall be notified of the 
time extension.
    (4) The determination will become effective 90 days from publication 
unless a request for reconsideration is filed pursuant to Sec. 83.11.
    (m) The Assistant Secretary shall acknowledge the existence of the 
petitioner as an Indian tribe when it is determined that the group 
satisfies all of the criteria in Sec. 83.7. The Assistant Secretary 
shall decline to acknowledge that a petitioner is an Indian tribe if it 
fails to satisfy any one of the criteria in Sec. 83.7.
    (n) If the Assistant Secretary declines to acknowledge that a 
petitioner is an Indian tribe, the petitioner shall be informed of 
alternatives, if any, to acknowledgment under these procedures. These 
alternatives may include other means through which the petitioning group 
may achieve the status of an acknowledged Indian tribe or through which 
any of its members may become eligible for services and benefits from 
the Department as Indians, or become members of an acknowledged Indian 
tribe.
    (o) The determination to decline to acknowledge that the petitioner 
is an Indian tribe shall be final for the Department.
    (p) A petitioner that has petitioned under this part or under the 
acknowledgment regulations previously effective and that has been denied 
Federal acknowledgment may not re-petition under this part. The term 
``petitioner'' here includes previously denied petitioners that have 
reorganized or been renamed or that are wholly or primarily portions of 
groups that have previously been denied under these or previous 
acknowledgment regulations.

Sec. 83.11  Independent review, reconsideration and final action.

    (a)(1) Upon publication of the Assistant Secretary's determination 
in the Federal Register, the petitioner or any interested party may file 
a request for reconsideration with the Interior Board of Indian Appeals. 
Petitioners which choose under Sec. 83.3(g) to be considered under 
previously effective acknowledgment regulations may nonetheless request 
reconsideration under this section.
    (2) A petitioner's or interested party's request for reconsideration 
must be received by the Board no later than 90 days after the date of 
publication of the Assistant Secretary's determination in the Federal 
Register. If no request for reconsideration has been received, the 
Assistant Secretary's decision shall be final for the Department 90 days 
after publication of the final determination in the Federal Register.
    (b) The petitioner's or interested party's request for 
reconsideration shall contain a detailed statement of the grounds for 
the request, and shall include any new evidence to be considered.
    (1) The detailed statement of grounds for reconsideration filed by a 
petitioner or interested parties shall be considered the appellant's 
opening brief provided for in 43 CFR 4.311(a).
    (2) The party or parties requesting the reconsideration shall mail 
copies of the request to the petitioner and all other interested 
parties.
    (c)(1) The Board shall dismiss a request for reconsideration that is 
not filed by the deadline specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) If a petitioner's or interested party's request for 
reconsideration is filed on time, the Board shall determine, within 120 
days after publication of the Assistant Secretary's final determination 
in the Federal Register, whether the request alleges any of the grounds 
in paragraph (d) of this section and shall notify the petitioner and 
interested parties of this determination.
    (d) The Board shall have the authority to review all requests for 
reconsideration that are timely and that allege any of the following:
    (1) That there is new evidence that could affect the determination; 
or
    (2) That a substantial portion of the evidence relied upon in the 
Assistant Secretary's determination was unreliable or was of little 
probative value; or
    (3) That petitioner's or the Bureau's research appears inadequate or 
incomplete in some material respect; or
    (4) That there are reasonable alternative interpretations, not 
previously considered, of the evidence used for the final determination, 
that would substantially affect the determination that the petitioner 
meets or does not meet one or more of the criteria in Sec. 83.7 (a) 
through (g).
    (e) The Board shall have administrative authority to review 
determinations of the Assistant Secretary made pursuant to Sec. 
83.10(m) to the extent authorized by this section.
    (1) The regulations at 43 CFR 4.310-4.318 and 4.331-4.340 shall 
apply to proceedings before the Board except when they are inconsistent 
with these regulations.
    (2) The Board may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate 
to provide a full and fair evaluation of a request for reconsideration 
under this section to the extent they are not inconsistent with these 
regulations.
    (3) The Board, at its discretion, may request experts not associated 
with the Bureau, the petitioner, or interested parties to provide 
comments, recommendations, or technical advice concerning the 
determination, the administrative record, or materials filed by the 
petitioner or interested parties. The Board may also request, at its 
discretion, comments or technical assistance from the Assistant 
Secretary concerning the final determination or, pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(8) of this section, the record used for the determination.
    (4) Pursuant to 43 CFR 4.337(a), the Board may require, at its 
discretion, a hearing conducted by an administrative law judge of the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals if the Board determines that further 
inquiry is necessary to resolve a genuine issue of material fact or to 
otherwise augment the record before it concerning the grounds for 
reconsideration.

[[Page 291]]

    (5) The detailed statement of grounds for reconsideration filed by a 
petitioner or interested parties pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section shall be considered the appellant's opening brief provided for 
in 43 CFR 4.311(a).
    (6) An appellant's reply to an opposing party's answer brief, 
provided for in 43 CFR 4.311(b), shall not apply to proceedings under 
this section, except that a petitioner shall have the opportunity to 
reply to an answer brief filed by any party that opposes a petitioner's 
request for reconsideration.
    (7) The opportunity for reconsideration of a Board decision provided 
for in 43 CFR 4.315 shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
    (8) For purposes of review by the Board, the administrative record 
shall consist of all appropriate documents in the Branch of 
Acknowledgment and Research relevant to the determination involved in 
the request for reconsideration. The Assistant Secretary shall designate 
and transmit to the Board copies of critical documents central to the 
portions of the determination under a request for reconsideration. The 
Branch of Acknowledgment and Research shall retain custody of the 
remainder of the administrative record, to which the Board shall have 
unrestricted access.
    (9) The Board shall affirm the Assistant Secretary's determination 
if the Board finds that the petitioner or interested party has failed to 
establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, at least one of the 
grounds under paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(4) of this section.
    (10) The Board shall vacate the Assistant Secretary's determination 
and remand it to the Assistant Secretary for further work and 
reconsideration if the Board finds that the petitioner or an interested 
party has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, one or more 
of the grounds under paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(4) of this section.
    (f)(1) The Board, in addition to making its determination to affirm 
or remand, shall describe in its decision any grounds for 
reconsideration other than those in paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(4) of this 
section alleged by a petitioner's or interested party's request for 
reconsideration.
    (2) If the Board affirms the Assistant Secretary's decision under 
Sec. 83.11(e)(9) but finds that the petitioner or interested parties 
have alleged other grounds for reconsideration, the Board shall send the 
requests for reconsideration to the Secretary. The Secretary shall have 
the discretion to request that the Assistant Secretary reconsider the 
final determination on those grounds.
    (3) The Secretary, in reviewing the Assistant Secretary's decision, 
may review any information available, whether formally part of the 
record or not. Where the Secretary's review relies upon information that 
is not formally part of the record, the Secretary shall insert the 
information relied upon into the record, together with an identification 
of its source and nature.
    (4) Where the Board has sent the Secretary a request for 
reconsideration under paragraph (f)(2), the petitioner and interested 
parties shall have 30 days from receiving notice of the Board's decision 
to submit comments to the Secretary. Where materials are submitted to 
the Secretary opposing a petitioner's request for reconsideration, the 
interested party shall provide copies to the petitioner and the 
petitioner shall have 15 days from their receipt of the information to 
file a response with the Secretary.
    (5) The Secretary shall make a determination whether to request a 
reconsideration of the Assistant Secretary's determination within 60 
days of receipt of all comments and shall notify all parties of the 
decision.
    (g)(1) The Assistant Secretary shall issue a reconsidered 
determination within 120 days of receipt of the Board's decision to 
remand a determination or the Secretary's request for reconsideration.
    (2) The Assistant Secretary's reconsideration shall address all 
grounds determined to be valid grounds for reconsideration in a remand 
by the Board, other grounds described by the Board pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(1), and all grounds specified in any Secretarial request. The 
Assistant Secretary's reconsideration may address any issues and 
evidence consistent with the Board's decision or the Secretary's 
request.

[[Page 292]]

    (h)(1) If the Board finds that no petitioner's or interested party's 
request for reconsideration is timely, the Assistant Secretary's 
determination shall become effective and final for the Department 120 
days from the publication of the final determination in the Federal 
Register.
    (2) If the Secretary declines to request reconsideration under 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the Assistant Secretary's decision 
shall become effective and final for the Department as of the date of 
notification to all parties of the Secretary's decision.
    (3) If a determination is reconsidered by the Assistant Secretary 
because of action by the Board remanding a decision or because the 
Secretary has requested reconsideration, the reconsidered determination 
shall be final and effective upon publication of the notice of this 
reconsidered determination in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 83.12  Implementation of decisions.

    (a) Upon final determination that the petitioner exists as an Indian 
tribe, it shall be considered eligible for the services and benefits 
from the Federal government that are available to other federally 
recognized tribes. The newly acknowledged tribe shall be considered a 
historic tribe and shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities 
available to other federally recognized historic tribes by virtue of 
their government-to-government relationship with the United States. It 
shall also have the responsibilities and obligations of such tribes. 
Newly acknowledged Indian tribes shall likewise be subject to the same 
authority of Congress and the United States as are other federally 
acknowledged tribes.
    (b) Upon acknowledgment as an Indian tribe, the list of members 
submitted as part of the petitioners documented petition shall be the 
tribe's complete base roll for purposes of Federal funding and other 
administrative purposes. For Bureau purposes, any additions made to the 
roll, other than individuals who are descendants of those on the roll 
and who meet the tribe's membership criteria, shall be limited to those 
meeting the requirements of Sec. 83.7(e) and maintaining significant 
social and political ties with the tribe (i.e., maintaining the same 
relationship with the tribe as those on the list submitted with the 
group's documented petition).
    (c) While the newly acknowledged tribe shall be considered eligible 
for benefits and services available to federally recognized tribes 
because of their status as Indian tribes, acknowledgment of tribal 
existence shall not create immediate access to existing programs. The 
tribe may participate in existing programs after it meets the specific 
program requirements, if any, and upon appropriation of funds by 
Congress. Requests for appropriations shall follow a determination of 
the needs of the newly acknowledged tribe.
    (d) Within six months after acknowledgment, the appropriate Area 
Office shall consult with the newly acknowledged tribe and develop, in 
cooperation with the tribe, a determination of needs and a recommended 
budget. These shall be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary. The 
recommended budget will then be considered along with other 
recommendations by the Assistant Secretary in the usual budget request 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 83.13  Information collection.

    (a) The collections of information contained in Sec. 83.7 have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq. and assigned clearance number 1076-0104. The information will be 
used to establish historical existence as a tribe, verify family 
relationships and the group's claim that its members are Indian and 
descend from a historical tribe or tribes which combined, that members 
are not substantially enrolled in other Indian tribes, and that they 
have not individually or as a group been terminated or otherwise 
forbidden the Federal relationship. Response is required to obtain a 
benefit in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 2.
    (b) Public reporting burden for this information is estimated to 
average 1,968 hours per petition, including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of 
information. Send comments

authorizing the disposition of its judgment funds; and of all funds 
deriving from judgments entered prior to the date of the Act for which 
there has been no enabling legislation.


<R05>
Sec. 87.3  Time limits.

    (a) The Secretary shall cause to begin as early as possible the 
necessary research to determine the identity of the ultimate or present 
day beneficiaries of judgments. Such research shall be done under the 
direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The affected tribes or 
groups shall be encouraged to submit pertinent data. All pertinent data, 
including cultural, political and historical material, and records, 
including membership, census and other rolls shall be considered. If

and the Commissioner has reviewed the tribal proposal(s), the Area 
Director, or such other official of the Department of the Interior as he 
shall designate to act for him, shall hold a hearing of record to 
receive testimony on the tribal proposal(s).
    (b) The hearing shall be held after appropriate public notice 
beginning at least twenty (20) days prior to the date

[[Page 297]]

of such hearing, and after consultation with the governing body of the 
tribe or group regarding the date and location of the hearing, to obtain 
the testimony of members of the governing body and other 
representatives, spokesmen or members of the tribe or group on the 
proposal(s).
    (c) All testimony at the hearing shall be transcribed and a 
transcript thereof shall be furnished to the Commissioner and the tribal 
governing body immediately subsequent to the hearing. Particular care

    (d) Whenever two or more tribes or groups are involved in the use or 
distribution of the judgment funds, including situations in which two or

or place, or on the number of entities to be represented at the hearing, 
the Commissioner, after considering the views of the affected tribes and 
groups, shall within twenty (20) days of receipt of such advice by the 
Area Director, designate a location and date for such hearing and invite

affected tribe or group, including minorities views;
    (d) Copies of all pertinent resolutions and other communications or 
documents received from the affected tribe or group, including 
minorities;
    (e) A copy of the tribal constitution and bylaws, or other

of the judgment funds as of thirty (30) days of the submittal of the 
proposed plan, including a statement concerning attorney fees and 
litigation expenses;
    (g) A statement justifying any compromise proposal developed by the 
Commissioner in the event of the absence of agreement among any and all 
entities on the division or apportionment of the funds, should two or 
more entities be involved;
    (h) And a statement regarding the feasibility of the proposed plan, 
including a timetable prepared in cooperation with the tribal governing 
body, for the implementation of programming and roll preparation.

Within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the appropriation of the 
judgment funds the Secretary shall submit a proposed plan, together with 
the pertinent materials described above, simultaneously to each of the 
Chairmen of the Congressional Committees, at the same time sending 
copies of the proposed plan and materials to the governing body of the 
affected tribe or group. The one hundred and eighty (180) day period

request shall be subject to the approval of both Congressional 
Committees.

    (a) Within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of a resolution 
by either House disapproving a plan, the Secretary shall simultaneously 
submit proposed legislation authorizing the use or distribution of the 
funds, together with a report thereon, to the Chairmen of both 
Congressional Committees, at the same time sending copies of the 
proposed legislation to the governing body of the affected tribe or 
group. Such proposed legislation shall be developed on the basis of 
further consultation with the affected tribe or group.
    (b) In any instance in which the Secretary determines that 
circumstances are not conducive to the preparation and submission of a 
plan, he shall, after appropriate consultation with the affected tribe 
or group, submit proposed legislation within the 180-day period to both 
Congressional Committee simultaneously.

of tribal members residing on or near the subject reservation, including 
former reservation areas in Oklahoma, or Alaska Native villages; the 
formal educational level and the general level of social and economic 
adjustment of such reservation residents; the nature of recent 
programming affecting the subject tribe or group and particularly the 
reservation residents; the needs and aspirations of any local Indian 
communities or districts within the reservation and the nature of 
organization of such local entities; the feasibility of the 
participation of tribal members not in residence on the reservation; the 
availability of funds for programming purposes derived from sources 
other than the subject judgment; and all other pertinent social and 
economic data developed to support any proposed program.


<R05>
Sec. 87.10  Per capita payment aspects of plans and protection

of funds accruing to minors, legal incompetents and deceased beneficiaries.

    (a) The per capita shares of living competent adults shall be paid 
directly to them. The shares of minors, legal incompetents and deceased 
individual beneficiaries, enhanced by investment earnings, shall be held 
in individual Indian money (IIM) accounts unless otherwise provided as 
set out in this section. While held in IIM accounts, said shares shall 
be invested pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 162a and shall be the property of the 
minors or legal incompetents or the estates of the deceased individual 
beneficiaries to whom the per capita payments were made.
    (b)(1) Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, minors' per capita shares, until the minors attain the age of 
18 years, shall be retained in individually segregated IIM accounts and 
handled as provided in Sec. 115.4 of this chapter. Should it be 
determined that the funds are to be invested pursuant to a trust, minors 
who will have reached the age of 18 years within six months after the 
establishment of the trust shall have their funds retained at interest 
in IIM accounts and paid to them upon attaining their majority.
    (2) A private trust for the minors' per capita shares may be 
established subject to the approval of the tribal governing body and the 
Secretary on the following conditions:
    (i) The tribal governing body specifically requests the 
establishment of such trust, and the trust provides for segregated 
amounts to each individual minor, based on his per capita share, and
    (ii) The trust agreement specifically provides that the investment 
policy to

[[Page 299]]

be followed is that of preserving the trust corpus and of obtaining the 
highest interest rates current money markets can safely provide. The 
trust agreement must further provide that maturity dates of investments 
cannot exceed the period of the trust and that only the following types 
of investment shall be made: United States Treasury obligations; Federal 
agency obligations; repurchase/resell agreements; United States Treasury 
bills; Bankers' acceptance, provided the assets of the issuing bank 
exceed $1 billion or the issuing bank pledges full collateral; 
Certificates of deposit, provided the assets of the issuing bank exceed 
$1 billion or the issuing bank pledges full collateral; Commercial 
paper, provided it is rated prime-2 by Moody or A-2 by Standard and Poor 
or is obligation of a company with outstanding unsecured debt rated Aa 
by Standard and Poor.
    (c) The per capita shares of legal incompetents shall be held in IIM 
accounts and administered pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 115.5 of 
this chapter.
    (d) The shares of deceased individual beneficiaries, plus all 
interest and investment income accruing thereto, shall be paid to their 
heirs and legatees upon their determination as provided in 43 CFR part 
4, subpart D.
    (e) All per capita shares, including all interest and investment 
income accruing thereto, while they are held in trust under the 
provisions of this section, shall be exempt from Federal and State 
income taxes and shall not be considered as income or resources when 
determining the extent of eligibility for assistance under the Social 
Security Act, as amended.
    (f) All per capita shares or portions thereof, including all 
interest and investment income accruing thereto, which are not paid out 
but which remain unclaimed with the Federal Government shall be 
maintained separately and be enhanced by investment, and shall, unless 
otherwise provided in an effective plan or in enabling legislation, be 
subject to the provisions of the Act of September 22, 1961, 75 Stat. 
584. No per capita share or portion thereof shall be transferred to the

Area Director shall report to the Commissioner on the status of the 
implementation of the plan, including all enrollment and programming 
aspects, and thenceforth shall report to the Commissioner on an annual 
basis regarding any remaining or unfulfilled aspects of a plan. The Area 
Director shall include in his first and all subsequent annual reports a 
statement regarding the maintenance of the timetable, a full accounting 
of any per capita distribution, and the expenditure of all programming

         Payment of Tribal Attorney Fees With Appropriated Funds

    Source: 48 FR 3969, Jan. 28, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 89.40  General policy.

    In ordinary circumstances, legal services with respect to trust 
resources are provided for Indian tribe(s):
    (a) By private counsel employed by tribes when such tribe is 
financially able and elects to do so, or
    (b) By the United States as trustee through the Office of the 
Solicitor and/or the Department of Justice.

It is the policy of the Department of the Interior not to use federally 
appropriated funds to pay for private counsel to represent Indian 
tribes. Exceptions to that policy are listed in Sec. 89.41 of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 89.41  Exceptions to policy.

    The Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs upon concurrence of the 
Solicitor and receipt of a recommendation as provided by Sec. 89.43 
may, in his/her discretion, authorize the direct or indirect expenditure 
of appropriated funds to

[[Page 302]]

pay reasonable attorney's fees in order to permit an Indian tribe to 
secure private legal representation in the following circumstances:
    (a) When a tribe determines it necessary to bring a court action or 
to defend itself to protect its trust resources, rights claimed under a 
treaty, agreement, executive order, or statute, or its governmental 
powers and the Attorney General refuses assistance or advises that 
assistance is not otherwise available (Comptroller General's Opinion B-
114868, December 6, 1976).
    (b) When a tribe determines it necessary to institute or to defend 
itself in an administrative proceeding to protect its trust resources, 
rights claimed under a treaty, agreement, executive order, or statute, 
or to protect its governmental powers and the Solicitor is unable to 
provide representation due to a conflict of interest or other reasons.
    (c) When a tribe determines legal assistance necessary, other than 
for litigation, pursuant to a contract executed under Pub. L. 93-638 and 
the Solicitor has determined that the services of his office are not 
available.
    (d) When a tribe determines it critical, and the Assistant 
Secretary--Indian Affairs finds the concerns of the tribe to have merit 
after consultation with and the advice of the Solicitor, to intervene, 
in a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department or in an 
administrative proceeding being handled by the Solicitor because the 
responsible Government Attorney refuses either to exclude or to include 
some facet of the suit or proceedings which the tribe claims renders 
such legal representation completely inadequate to protect or in 
contravention of the rights and interests of the tribe. Prior to 
consulting with and advising the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs, in 
a lawsuit being handled by the Justice Department, the Solicitor shall 
seek the comments and advice of the Attorney General.
    (e) When a tribe determines, and the Assistant Secretary--Indian 
Affairs, after consultation with the Solicitor concurs, that a 
substantial possibility of a negotiated settlement or agreement exists.
    (f) Payment of fees will not be allowed if such payment was not 
authorized before services were performed.
    (g) This rule applies to expenditure of appropriated Federal funds 
and not a tribe's own funds on deposit in the U.S. Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 89.42  Factors to be considered.

    The following factors are to be considered in determining whether 
funds should be paid to provide private legal representation for a 
tribe.
    (a) The merits of the legal position which the tribe asserts. 
Greater weight will be given to those cases where the tribe's legal 
argument is deemed particularly meritorious than to those cases where 
the tribe's position, although not entirely without merit, may be 
relatively weak;
    (b) The ability of the tribe to pay all or a part of its legal 
expenses out of its own funds. A review of the tribe's financial 
resources under this subsection will include an examination of the 
tribe's total expenditures to determine whether its expenditures for 
other purposes comport with the asserted importance of the case for 
which it seeks funds;
    (c) Whether the question the tribe seeks to litigate is being 
litigated in another case by another tribe;
    (d) Whether, as a matter of strategy, the issues the tribe seeks to 
litigate could be more satisfactorily resolved in another forum, in a 
different factual context, or a different time; and
    (e) Whether the issue should be litigated at all in preference to a 
legislative or other solution.


<R05>
Sec. 89.43  Procedures.

    The information collection requirements contained in this section do 
not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 
U.S.C. 3051 et seq., because it is anticipated there will be fewer than 
10 respondents annually.
    (a) A tribe or other organization seeking funds under Sec. 89.41 
shall submit a written request through the Agency Superintendent and the 
Area Director, including
    (1) A detailed statement describing the nature and scope of the 
problems for which legal services are sought;

[[Page 303]]

    (2) A statement of the terms, including total anticipated costs, of 
the requested legal services contract;
    (3) A current financial statement and a statement that the tribe 
does not possess sufficient tribal funds or assets to pay for all or a 
part of the legal services sought; and
    (4) A statement of why the matter must be handled by a private 
attorney as opposed to Department of Justice or Department of Interior 
attorneys.

All requests shall be considered by a committee consisting of the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs (Policy), or his delegate, the 
Director of the Office of Trust Responsibilities in BIA or his delegate, 
and the Associate Solicitor--Indian Affairs or his delegate.
    (b) If two of the three committee members recommend approval of a 
tribe's request, the request, along with the committee's recommendation, 
shall be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for final determination 
after consultation with and the advice of the Solicitor. The committee's 
recommendation shall indicate the amount of funds recommended to assist 
the tribe, the hourly rate allowed, the maximum amount permitted to be 
expended in the recommended action and the tribal contributions, if any. 
The Assistant Secretary shall approve the request only with the 
concurrence of the Solicitor.
    (c) The requirements imposed by this policy are supplementary to 
those contained in all existing regulations dealing with attorney 
contracts with Indian tribes and, in particular, those contained in 
parts 88 and 89 of this title.

Sec. 101.2  Kinds of loans.

    Loans from the Indian Revolving Loan Fund shall be made for purposes 
which will improve and promote the economic development on Indian 
reservations.
    (a) Loans may be made by the United States to eligible relending 
organizations for relending to members for economic enterprises and to 
eligible tribes for relending to members, eligible corporations, 
cooperative associations, partnerships and subordinate bands and for 
financing tribal economic enterprises, which will promote the economic 
development of a reservation and/or the group or members thereon. Loans 
made by tribes or relending organizations may be for the following 
purposes:
    (1) To individual Indians or Natives, cooperative associations, 
corporations and partnerships, to finance economic enterprises operated 
for profit, the operation of which will contribute to the improvement of 
the economy of a reservation and/or the members thereon.
    (2) To individual Indians or Natives for purposes of purchasing, 
constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by 
the borrower.
    (3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a 
college or graduate education and degree in a field which will provide 
employment opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available 
from sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.
    (4) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of attending 
vocational schools which provide training in desired skills in a field 
in which there are employment opportunities, provided that adequate 
funds and/or training are not available from grant or scholarship 
sources, or federal or state training programs.

Loans may also be made by the United States to tribes for loaning to or 
investing in other organizations subject to the provisions in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (b) Direct loans may be made by the United States to eligible 
tribes, tribal organizations or corporations and tribal cooperative 
associations without fund restrictions. Direct loans to individual 
Indians, partnerships, and other non-tribal organizations shall not 
exceed $350,000. Direct loans from the United States shall be made for 
the following purposes:
    (1) To eligible tribes, individual Indians, Natives, or associations 
thereof, corporations and partnerships, to finance economic enterprises 
operated for profit, the operation of which will contribute to the

constructing or improving housing on a reservation and to be occupied by 
the borrower.
    (3) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of obtaining a 
college or

[[Page 316]]

graduate education and degree in a field which will provide employment 
opportunities, provided that adequate funds are not available from 
sources such as grants, scholarships or other loan sources.
    (4) To individual Indians and Natives for purposes of attending 
vocational schools which provide training in desired skills in a field 
in which there are employment opportunities, provided that adequate

sources or federal or state training programs.
    (c) Before a United States direct loan is approved, the Commissioner 
may require the applicants to prepare a market and capacity report on 
existing or proposed economic enterprises for which financing is 
requested if the operation involves manufacturing, selling or providing 
services.
    (d) Loans may be made to eligible tribes and Indian organizations 
for use in attracting industries and economic enterprises, the operation 
of which will contribute to the economy of a reservation. Tribes and 
Indian organizations may receive loans from the revolving loan fund for 
investment in or lending to other organizations regardless of whether 
they are organizations of Indians. However, not more than 50 percent of 
the loan made to an Indian organization may be used for the purpose of 
making a loan to or investing in other organizations. Applications for 
loans to provide funds for lending to or investing in other 
organizations already in operation will be accompanied by:
    (1) Audited balance sheets and operating statements of the other 
organization for the immediate three preceding years;
    (2) Pro forma operating statement and balance sheets for the 
succeeding three years reflecting the results of operations after 
injection of the additional funds;
    (3) Names of owners or if a corporation and stock has been issued, 
names of major stockholders and shares of stock owned by each;
    (4) A copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, if

and capacity report will be prepared. If a proposed operation is to be 
established, the information in paragraphs (d)(2) through (7) of this 
section will be furnished. The Commissioner may require additional 
information on the other organization, if needed, to adequately evaluate 
the benefits which the Indian organization will receive and the economic 
benefits which will accrue to a reservation. If the loan is for 
relending to another organization, the application must show what 
security is being offered. If the loan is for investment in another 
organization, the equity to be obtained must be shown. Copies of all 
agreements, contracts or other documents to be executed by the Indian 
organization and the other organization in connection with a loan or 
investment shall be submitted with the application for a loan and will 
require Commissioner approval prior to disbursement of loan funds to the 
Indian organization.

    (a) Loans may be made from the revolving loan fund to Indians, 
eligible tribes and relending organizations, and corporations, 
cooperative associations and partnerships having a form of organization 
satisfactory to the Commissioner. Loans may be made to applicants only 
when, in the judgment of the Commissioner, there is a reasonable 
prospect of repayment. Loans may be made only to an applicant who, in 
the opinion of the Commissioner, is unable to obtain financing on 
reasonable terms and conditions from other sources such as tribal 
relending programs, banks, Farmers Home Administration, Small Business 
Administration, Production Credit Associations,

[[Page 317]]

equity equal to 20 percent of the total cost of a new enterprise, or 20 
percent of the total cost of expansion of an existing enterprise.
    (b) The establishment of a United States direct revolving loan 
program on a reservation(s) for making direct loans will require the 
approval of the Commissioner. All requests for establishing a United 
States direct revolving loan program on a reservation will be 
accompanied by reasons for need, estimate of financing needs, and other 
sources of financing available to meet the needs. The Commissioner, in 
approving a United States direct loan program, may require the 
preparation and approval of a plan of operation for conducting the 
program.
    (c) If local lending conditions and/or the information in an 
application for a loan indicate a probability that an applicant may be 
able to obtain the loan from other sources, the Commissioner, before 
approving a United States direct loan, will require the applicant to 
furnish letters from two customary lenders in the area who are making 
loans for similar purposes, stating whether or not they are willing to 
make a loan to the applicant for the same purposes and amount. If a 
customary lender will make the loan on reasonable terms and conditions, 
the Commissioner will not approve a United States direct loan.

<R05>
Sec. 101.5  Approval of loans.

    (a) Loan agreements, including those used by relending organizations 
in operating a relending program, must be executed on a form approved by 
the Commissioner. On direct United States loans, the Commissioner will 
approve the loan by issuing a commitment order covering the terms and 
conditions for making the loan.
    (b) Applications for loans from relending organizations must be 
approved, if a tribe, by the governing body or designated committee, or 
other approving committee or body authorized to act on credit matters

committee must be authorized to act on behalf of the relending

from the revolving loan fund if the Commissioner determines that the 
rejection is unwarranted.

<R05>
Sec. 101.11  Interest.

    (a) The interest to be charged on loans by the United States shall 
be at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance 
with section 104, title I, of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 
93-262, 88 Stat. 77). The interest rate shall be determined monthly and 
shall be effective on advances made on loans during the current calendar 
month. The interest rate shall be stated in the promissory note(s) 
executed by the borrower(s) evidencing the advance(s).
    (b) Additional charges to cover loan administration costs, including 
credit reports, may be charged to borrowers.
    (c) Education loans may provide for deferral of interest while the 
borrower is in school full time or in the military service.
    (d) The interest rate on loans made by relending organizations which

Act of 1974. The interest rate on loans for expert assistance will be at

Sec. 101.12  Records and reports.

    Loan agreements between the United States and tribes, corporations, 
partnerships, cooperative associations and individual Indians for 
financing economic enterprises, and to relending organizations, will 
require that borrowers establish and maintain accounting and operating 
records that are satisfactory to the Commissioner and submit written 
reports as required by the Commissioner. The records, accounts, and loan 
files shall be available for examination and audit by the Commissioner 
at any reasonable time. Unless an exception is approved by the 
Commissioner, borrowers will be required to have an annual audit made of 
the records of relending programs and economic enterprises financed with

<R05>
Sec. 101.13  Security.

    (a) United States direct loans shall be secured by such security as 
the Commissioner may require. A lack of security will not preclude the 
making of a loan if the proposed use of the funds is sound and the 
information in the application and supporting papers correctly show that 
expected income will be adequate to pay all expenses and the loan 
principal and interest payments, indicating reasonable assurance that 
the loan will be repaid. Loans made by relending organizations 
conducting a relending program using revolving loan funds will require 
borrowers to give security for loans, if available, but the absence of 
security will not preclude the making of a loan if the proposed use of 
the funds is sound and the information in the application and supporting 
papers correctly show that expected income will be adequate to pay all 
expenses and the loan principal and interest payments, indicating 
reasonable assurance that the loan will be repaid. The declaration of 
policy and plan of operation of relending organizations conducting 
relending programs will include provisions covering the type and amount 
of security to be taken to secure loans made.
    (b) Land purchased by an individual Indian with the proceeds of a 
loan and land already held in trust or restricted status by the 
individual Indian may be mortgaged as security for a loan in accordance 
with 25 CFR 152.34 and the Act of March 29, 1956 (70 Stat. 62; (25 
U.S.C. 483a)). Mortgages of individually held trust or restricted land 
will include only an acreage of the borrower's land which the 
Commissioner determines is necessary to protect the loan in case of 
default. On proposed foreclosures which involve the sale of individually 
held trust or restricted land given as security for a loan, the tribe of 
the reservation on which the land is located will be notified in writing 
at least thirty calendar days in advance of the anticipated date of 
sale. Land purchased by a tribe with the proceeds of a loan from the 
revolving loan fund with title taken in a trust or restricted status, 
and land already held in a trust or restricted status by a tribe may not 
be mortgaged as security for a loan.
    (1) Title to any land purchased by a tribe or by an individual 
Indian with revolving loan funds may be taken in trust or restricted 
status unless the land is located outside the boundaries of a 
reservation or a tribal consolidation area approved by the Secretary. 
Title to any land purchased by a tribe or an individual Indian which is 
outside the boundaries of a reservation or approved consolidation area 
may be taken in trust if the purchaser was the owner of trust or 
restricted interests in the land before the purchase. Otherwise, title 
shall be taken in the name of the purchaser without any restrictions on 
alienation, control, or use.
    (c) Mortgages of leasehold interests in land held in trust or 
restricted status by an individual Indian, may be

[[Page 321]]

taken for the purpose of borrowing capital for the development and 
improvement of the leased premises when permitted in the lease or lease 
modification agreement. Such mortgages must be approved by the lessor 
and Commissioner. (70 Stat. 62, (25 U.S.C. 483a)).
    (d) Individuals may give assignments of income from trust property 
as security for loans. Tribes may give assignments of trust income as 
security for loans provided that the assignment shall be specific as to 
the source(s) of income being assigned. All assignments of trust income 
require approval by the Commissioner before becoming effective.
    (e) Chattels may be given as security for a loan. A mortgage on 
chattels, the title to which is known to be in trust, requires 
Commissioner approval. Non-trust chattels may be mortgaged without 
approval of any federal official.
    (f) Crops grown on lands held in trust or restricted status for the 
benefit of an individual Indian may be given as security for a loan when 
approved by the Commissioner. Crops grown on leased, trust or restricted 
land may be given as security for a loan when permitted by the 
provisions of a lease or when the owner gives written consent. Approval 
of the lien document by the Commissioner is required. Crops grown on 
trust or restricted land held by a tribe which has been assigned to an 
individual for use may be given as security for a loan, provided the 
terms of the assignment permit the assignee to give the crops as 
security for a loan or the tribe's governing body specifically gives 
consent. The lien document requires Commissioner approval. Crops grown 
on non-trust or non-restricted land may be mortgaged without the 
approval of any federal official.
    (g) Title to any personal property purchased with a loan shall be 
taken in the name of the purchaser and mortgaged to secure the loan 
unless the loan is otherwise adequately secured. Tribes must adhere to 
the provisions of their constitutions and bylaws, corporate charters, or 
other organizational documents when mortgaging tribal property and 
assigning trust income as security for loans.
    (h) Relending organizations receiving a loan from the United States 
for relending shall be required to assign to the United States as 
security for the loan all securities acquired in connection with loans 
made to its members, sub-organizations, or associations from such funds, 
unless the Commissioner determines that repayment of the loan to the 
United States is otherwise reasonably assured. Funds advanced to finance 
a tribal economic enterprise shall be secured by an assignment of net 
income and net assets of the economic enterprise, unless the 
Commissioner determines that it is not feasible to require an assignment 
or that repayment of the loan to the United States is otherwise 
reasonably assured.
    (i) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or 
recorded in accordance with applicable state or federal laws except for 
those customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages 
on documented vessels will be filed at the customs house designated as 
the home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.


<R05>
Sec. 101.14  Maturity.

    The maturity of any United States direct loan shall not exceed 
thirty years. Loans made will be scheduled for repayment at the earliest 
possible date consistent with the purpose of the loan and the repayment 
capacity of the borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 101.15  Penalties on default.

    Unless otherwise provided in the loan agreement between the United 
States and a borrower, failure on the part of a borrower to conform to 
the terms of the loan agreement will be deemed grounds for the taking of 
any one or all of the following steps by the Commissioner:
    (a) Discontinue any further advance of funds contemplated by the 
loan agreement.
    (b) Take possession of any or all collateral given as security and 
in the case of individuals, corporation, partnerships or cooperative 
associations, the property purchased with the borrowed funds.
    (c) Prosecute legal action against the borrower or against officers 
of corporations, tribes, bands, credit associations, cooperative 
associations, and other organizations.

[[Page 322]]

    (d) Declare the entire amount advanced immediately due and payable.
    (e) Prevent further disbursement of credit funds under the control 
of the borrower.
    (f) Withdraw any unobligated funds from the borrower.
    (g) Require relending organizations conducting a relending program 
to apply all collections on loans to liquidate the debt to the United 
States.
    (h) Take possession of the assets of a relending organization 
conducting a relending program and exercise or arrange to exercise its 
powers until the Commissioner has received acceptable assurance of its 
repayment of the revolving loan and compliance with the provisions of 
the terms of the loan agreement.
    (i) Liquidate, operate or arrange for the operation of economic 
enterprises financed with revolving loans made to individuals, tribes, 
corporations, partnerships and cooperative associations until the 
indebtedness is paid or until the Commissioner has received acceptable 
assurance of its repayment and compliance with the terms of the loan 
agreement.
    (j) Report the name and account information of a delinquent borrower 
to a credit bureau.
    (k) Assess additional interest and penalty charges for the period of 
time that payment is not made.
    (l) Assess charges to cover additional administrative costs incurred 
by the Government to service the account.
    (m) Offset amounts owed the borrower under other Federal programs 
including other programs administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    (n) Refer the account to a private collection agency to collect the 
amount due.
    (o) Refer the account to the U.S. Department of Justice for 
collection by litigation.
    (p) If the borrower is a current or retired Federal employee, take 
action to offset the borrower's salary or civil service retirement 
benefits.
    (q) Refer the debt to the Internal Revenue Service for offset 
against any amount owed the borrower as an income tax refund.
    (r) Report any written-off debt to the Internal Revenue Service as 
taxable income to the borrower.
    (s) Recommend suspension or debarment from conducting further 
business with the Federal Government.

<R05>
Sec. 101.16  Default on loans made by relending organizations.

    Relending organizations conducting relending programs using 
revolving loan funds will follow prudent lending practices in making and 
servicing loans and take appropriate actions to protect their interests 
in the security given to secure repayment of loans. Declarations of 
policy and plans of operation shall include procedures which will be 
followed in acting to correct a default, such as modification of loan 
agreement or foreclosure and liquidation of security. Relending 
organizations employing a general counsel will refer legal questions on 
foreclosure procedures and sale of security to their counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 101.17  Uncollectable loans made by the United States.

    If the Secretary determines that a United States direct loan is 
uncollectable in whole or in part or is collectable only at an 
unreasonable cost, or when such action would be in the best interest of 
the United States, the Secretary may cancel, adjust, compromise, or 
reduce the amount of any loan made from the revolving loan fund. The 
Commissioner may adjust, compromise, subordinate, or modify the terms of 
any mortgage, lease, assignment, contract, agreement, or other document 
taken as security for loans. The cancellation of all or part of a loan 
shall become effective when signed by the Secretary.

[54 FR 34975, Aug. 23, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 101.18  Uncollectible loans made by relending organizations.

    (a) Relending organizations conducting relending programs using 
revolving loan funds may, when approved by the Commissioner, chargeoff 
as uncollectible all or part of the balance of principal and interest 
owing on

[[Page 323]]

loans which are considered to be uncollectible. Usually a chargeoff 
includes both principal and interest and provides for cessation of 
interest accruals on the principal balance owing as of the date of the 
chargeoff.
    (b) Action to chargeoff a loan will be in the form of a resolution 
enacted by the committee or body authorized and responsible for actions 
on loan matters for the relending organization. Before action is taken 
to chargeoff a loan as uncollectible, the lender will make an effort, to 
the extent feasible, to liquidate the security given for a loan and 
apply the net proceeds as a repayment on the balance of principal and 
interest owed. The chargeoff of a loan by a relending organization as 
uncollectible will not reduce the principal balance owed to the United 
States. A chargeoff will not release the borrower of the obligation or 
the responsibility to make payments when his or her financial situation 
will permit. Chargeoff action will not release the lender of 
responsibility to continue its efforts to collect the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 101.19  Assignment of loans.

    A borrower of a direct loan from the United States may not assign 
the loan agreement or any interest in it to a third party without the 
consent of the Commissioner. Relending organizations which are 
conducting relending programs may not assign the loan agreements of 
borrowers, or any interest therein, to third parties without the 
approval of the Commissioner and the borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 101.20  Relending by borrower.

    (a) A relending organization may reloan funds loaned to it by the 
United States with the approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner 
may authorize such lenders to approve applications for particular types 
of loans up to a specified amount.
    (b) Loans shall be secured by such securities as the lender and the 
Commissioner may require. With the Commissioner's approval, mortgages of 
individually held trust or restricted land, leasehold interests, 
chattels, crops grown on trust or restricted land, and assignments of 
trust income may all be taken as security for loans.
    (c) Title to personal property purchased with loans received from 
relending organizations using revolving loan funds in its relending 
program shall be taken in the name of the borrower.
    (d) The term of a loan made by a relending organization conducting a 
relending program shall not extend beyond the maturity date of its loan 
from the United States, unless an exception is approved by the 
Commissioner and the organization has funds available from which to make 
scheduled repayment on its loan from the United States. Loans made will 
be scheduled for repayment at the earliest possible date consistent with 
the purpose for which a loan is made and the indicated repayment 
capacity of the borrower.
    (e) Securing documents or financing statements shall be filed or 
recorded in accordance with federal or state law except those 
customarily filed in Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. Mortgages on 
documented vessels will be filed at the custom house designated as the 
home port of the vessel as shown on the marine document.

Sec. 101.21  Repayments on United States direct loans.

    Repayments on United States direct loans shall be made to the 
authorized collection officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who shall 
issue an official receipt for the repayment and deposit the collection 
into the revolving loan fund. Collections will first be applied to pay 
interest to date of payment and the balance applied on the principal 
installment due. Collections on loans made by relending organizations 
which have been declared in default in which the Commissioner has taken 
control of the assets of the program (including loans made with balances 
owing) will be made to an authorized collection officer of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs who shall issue a receipt to the payor and deposit the 
collection in the United States revolving loan fund. The relending 
organization's loan from the United States will be credited with the 
amounts collected from its borrowers,

[[Page 324]]

with the collections applied first on interest accrued and the balance 
applied to the principal. Payments on United States direct loans may be 
made in advance of due dates without penalty.

    Repayments on loans made by a relending organization conducting a 
relending program will be made to the officers of the lending 
organization or individuals designated and authorized in a declaration 
of policy and plan of operation. Collections on loans and other income 
to a relending program will be deposited in the lender's revolving loan 
account as designated in a declaration of policy and plan of operation. 
Collections on loans will be first applied to pay interest to date of 
payment with the balance applied to the principal.

<R05>
Sec. 101.24  Loans for expert assistance for preparation and trial of Indian claims.

    (a) Loans may be made to Indian tribes, bands and other identifiable 
groups of Indians from funds authorized and appropriated under the 
provisions of section 1 of the Act of November 4, 1963 (Pub. L. 88-168, 
77 Stat. 301; 25 U.S.C. 70n-1), as amended by the Act of September 19, 
1966 (Pub. L. 89-592, 80 Stat. 814) and section 2 of the Act of May 24, 
1973 (Pub. L. 93-37, 87 Stat. 73). Loan proceeds may only be used for 
the employment of expert assistance, other than the assistance of 
counsel, for the preparation and trial of claims pending before the 
Indian Claims Commission. Applications for loans will be submitted on 
forms approved by the Commissioner and shall include a justification of 
the need for a loan. The justification shall include a statement from 
the applicant's claims attorney regarding the need for a loan. The 
application will be accompanied by a statement signed by an authorized 
officer of the applicant certifying that the applicant does not have 
adequate funds available to obtain and pay for the expert assistance 
needed. The Superintendent and the Area Director will attest to the 
accuracy of the statement or point out any inaccuracies. Loans will be 
approved by issuance of a commitment order by the Commissioner.
    (b) No loan shall be approved if the applicant has funds available 
on deposit in the United States Treasury or elsewhere in an amount 
adequate to obtain the expert assistance needed or if, in the opinion of 
the Commissioner, the fees to be paid the experts are unreasonable on 
the basis of the services to be performed by them.
    (c) Contracts for the employment of experts are subject to the 
provisions of 25 U.S.C. 81 and require approval by the Commissioner.
    (d) Vouchers or claims submitted by experts for payment for services 
rendered and reimbursement for expenses will be in accordance with the 
provisions of the expert assistance contract and shall be sufficiently 
detailed and itemized to permit an audit to determine that the amounts 
are in accordance with the contract. Vouchers or claims shall be 
reviewed by the borrower's claims attorney who will certify on the last 
page of the voucher or by attachment thereto, that the services have 
been rendered and payment is due the expert and that expenses and 
charges for work performed are in accordance with the provisions of the 
contract.
    (e) Requests for advances under the loan agreement shall be 
accompanied by a certificate signed by an authorized officer of the 
borrower certifying that the borrower does not have adequate funds 
available from its own financial resources with which to pay the expert. 
The Superintendent and Area Director will attest to the accuracy of the 
statement or point out inaccuracies. A copy of the voucher or claim from 
the expert

[[Page 325]]

will accompany the request for advance.
    (f) Loan funds will be advanced only as needed to pay obligations 
incurred under approved contracts for expert assistance. The funds will 
be deposited in a separate account, shall not be commingled with other 
funds of the borrower, and shall not be disbursed for any other purpose.
    (g) Loans shall bear interest at the rate of 5\1/2\ percent per 
annum from the date funds are advanced until the loan is repaid.
    (h) The principal amount of the loan advanced plus interest shall be 
repayable from the proceeds of any judgment received by the borrower at 
the time funds from the award become available to make the payment.

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 103.1  What does this part do?

    This part explains how to obtain and use a BIA loan guaranty or loan 
insurance agreement under the Program, and who may do so. It also 
describes how to obtain and use interest subsidy payments under the 
Program, and who may do so.


<R05>
Sec. 103.2  Who does the Program help?

    The purpose of the Program is to encourage eligible borrowers to 
develop viable Indian businesses through conventional lender financing. 
The direct function of the Program is to help lenders reduce excessive 
risks on loans they make. That function in turn helps borrowers secure 
conventional financing that might otherwise be unavailable.


<R05>
Sec. 103.3  Who administers the Program?

    Authority for administering the Program ultimately rests with the 
Secretary, who may exercise that authority directly at any time. Absent 
a direct exercise of authority, however, the Secretary delegates Program 
authority to BIA officials through the U.S. Department of Interior 
Departmental Manual. A lender should submit all applications and 
correspondence to the BIA office serving the borrower's location.


<R05>
Sec. 103.4  What kinds of loans will BIA guarantee or insure?

    In general, BIA may guarantee or insure any loan made by an eligible 
lender to an eligible borrower to conduct a lawful business organized 
for profit. There are several important exceptions:
    (a) The business must contribute to the economy of an Indian 
reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA;
    (b) The borrower may not use the loan for relending purposes;
    (c) If any portion of the loan is used to refinance an existing 
loan, the borrower must be current on the existing loan; and
    (d) BIA may not guarantee or insure a loan if it believes the lender 
would be

[[Page 327]]

willing to extend the requested financing without a BIA guaranty or 
insurance coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 103.5  What size loan will BIA guarantee or insure?

    BIA can guarantee or insure a loan or combination of loans of up to 
$500,000 for an individual Indian, or more for an acceptable Indian 
business entity, Tribe, or tribal enterprise involving two or more 
persons. No individual Indian may have an outstanding principal balance 
of more than $500,000 in guaranteed or insured loans at any time. BIA 
can limit the size of loans it will guarantee or insure, depending on 
the resources BIA has available.


<R05>
Sec. 103.6  To what extent will BIA guarantee or insure a loan?

    (a) BIA can guarantee up to 90 percent of the unpaid principal and 
accrued interest due on a loan.
    (b) BIA can insure up to the lesser of:
    (1) 90 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest due on a 
loan; or
    (2) 15 percent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all 
loans the lender has insured under the Program as of the date the lender 
makes a claim under its insurance coverage.
    (c) BIA's guaranty certificate or loan insurance agreement should 
reflect the lowest guaranty or insurance percentage rate that satisfies 
the lender's risk management requirements.
    (d) Absent exceptional circumstances, BIA will allow no more than:
    (1) Two simultaneous guarantees under the Program covering 
outstanding loans from the same lender to the same borrower; or
    (2) One loan guaranty under the Program when the lender 
simultaneously has one or more outstanding loans insured under the 
Program to the same borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 103.7  Must the borrower have equity in the business being financed?

    The borrower must be projected to have at least 20 percent equity in 
the business being financed, immediately after the loan is funded. If a 
substantial portion of the loan is for construction or renovation, the 
borrower's equity may be calculated based upon the reasonable estimated 
value of the borrower's assets after completion of the construction or 
renovation.


<R05>
Sec. 103.8  Is there any cost for a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage?

    BIA charges the lender a premium for a guaranty or insurance 
coverage.
    (a) The premium is:
    (1) Two percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount 
that BIA guarantees; or
    (2) One percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount 
that BIA insures, without considering the 15 percent aggregate 
outstanding principal limitation on the lender's insured loans.
    (b) Lenders may pass the cost of the premium on to the borrower, 
either by charging a one-time fee or by adding the cost to the principal 
amount of the borrower's loan. Adding the premium to the principal 
amount of the loan will not make any further premium due. BIA will 
guarantee or insure the additional principal to the same extent as the 
original approved principal amount.


<R04>
  Subpart B_How a Lender Obtains a Loan Guaranty or Insurance Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 103.9  Who applies to BIA under the Program?

    The lender is responsible for determining whether it will require a 
BIA guaranty or insurance coverage, based upon the loan application it 
receives from an eligible borrower. If the lender requires a BIA 
guaranty or insurance coverage, the lender is responsible for completing 
and submitting a guaranty application or complying with a loan insurance 
agreement under the Program.


<R05>
Sec. 103.10  What lenders are eligible under the Program?

    (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a lender 
is eligible under the Program, and may be considered for BIA approval, 
if the lender is:
    (1) Regularly engaged in the business of making loans;

[[Page 328]]

    (2) Capable of evaluating and servicing loans in accordance with 
reasonable and prudent industry standards; and
    (3) Otherwise reasonably acceptable to BIA.
    (b) The following lenders are not qualified to issue loans under the 
Program:
    (1) An agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;
    (2) A lender that borrows money from any Federal Government source, 
other than the Federal Reserve Bank System, for purposes of relending;
    (3) A lender that does not include the interest on loans it makes in 
gross income, for purposes of chapter 1, title 26 of the United States 
Code; and
    (4) A lender that does not keep any ownership interest in loans it 
originates.


<R05>
Sec. 103.11  How does BIA approve lenders for the Program?

    (a) BIA approves each lender by entering into a loan guaranty 
agreement and/or a loan insurance agreement with it. BIA may provide up 
to three different levels of approval for a lender making guaranteed 
loans, depending on factors such as:
    (1) The number of loans the lender makes under the Program;
    (2) The total principal balance of the lender's Program loans;
    (3) The number of years the lender has been involved with the 
Program;
    (4) The relative benefits and opportunities the lender has given to 
Indian business efforts through the Program; and
    (5) The lender's historical compliance with Program requirements.
    (b) BIA will consider a lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan 
insurance agreement suspended as of:
    (1) The effective date of a change in the lender's corporate 
structure;
    (2) The effective date of a merger between the lender and any other 
entity, when the lender is not the surviving entity; or
    (3) The start of any legal proceeding in which substantially all of 
the lender's assets may be subject to disposition through laws governing 
bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership.
    (c) A change in a lender's name, without any other change specified 
under paragraph (b) of this section, will not cause a suspension of the 
lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance agreement. The 
lender should notify BIA of its name change as soon as possible.
    (d) If a lender's loan guaranty agreement and/or loan insurance 
agreement is suspended under paragraph (b) of this section, the lender, 
or its successor in interest, must enter into a new loan guaranty 
agreement and/or loan insurance agreement with BIA in order to secure 
any new BIA loan guarantees or insurance coverage.
    (e) The suspension of a loan guaranty agreement and/or loan 
insurance agreement does not affect the validity of any guaranty 
certificate or insurance coverage in effect before the date of the 
suspension. Any such certificate or insurance coverage will remain 
governed by applicable terms of the suspended loan guaranty agreement 
and/or loan insurance agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 103.12  How does a lender apply for a loan guaranty?

    To apply for a loan guaranty, a BIA-approved lender must submit to 
BIA a loan guaranty application request form, together with each of the 
following:
    (a) A written explanation from the lender indicating why it needs a 
BIA guaranty for the loan, and the minimum loan guarantee percentage it 
will accept;
    (b) A copy of the borrower's complete loan application;
    (c) A description of the borrower's equity in the business being 
financed;
    (d) A copy of the lender's independent credit analysis of the 
borrower's business, repayment ability, and loan collateral (including 
insurance);
    (e) An original report from a nationally-recognized credit bureau, 
dated within 90 days of the date of the lender's loan guaranty 
application package, outlining the credit history of the borrower, and 
to the extent permitted by law, each co-maker or guarantor of the loan 
(if any);
    (f) A copy of the lender's loan commitment letter to the borrower, 
showing at a minimum the proposed loan

[[Page 329]]

amount, purpose, interest rate, schedule of payments, and security 
(including insurance requirements), and the lender's terms and 
conditions for funding;
    (g) The lender's good faith estimate of any loan-related fees and 
costs it will charge the borrower, as authorized under this part;
    (h) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to finance 
construction, renovation, or demolition work, the lender's:
    (1) Insurance and bonding requirements for the work;
    (2) Proposed draw requirements; and
    (3) Proposed work inspection procedures;
    (i) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to refinance 
or otherwise retire existing indebtedness:
    (1) A clear description of all loans being paid off, including the 
names of all makers, cosigners and guarantors, maturity dates, payment 
schedules, uncured delinquencies, collateral, and payoff amounts as of a 
specific date; and
    (2) A comparison of the terms of the loan or loans being paid off 
and the terms of the new loan, identifying the advantages of the new 
loan over the loan being paid off.


<R05>
Sec. 103.13  How does a lender apply for loan insurance coverage?

    BIA-approved lenders can make loans insured under the Program in two 
ways, depending on the size of the loan:
    (a) For loans in an original principal amount of up to $100,000 per 
borrower, the lender can make each loan in accordance with the lender's 
loan insurance agreement, without specific prior approval from BIA.
    (b) For loans in an original principal amount of over $100,000, the 
lender must seek BIA's specific prior approval in each case. The lender 
must submit a loan insurance coverage application request form, together 
with the same information required for a loan guaranty under Sec. 
103.12, except for the information required by Sec. 103.12(a).
    (c) The lender must submit a loan insurance application package even 
for a loan of less than $100,000 if:
    (1) The total outstanding balance of all insured loans the lender is 
extending to the borrower under the Program exceeds $100,000; or
    (2) the lender makes a request for interest subsidy, pursuant to 
Sec. 103.21.


<R05>
Sec. 103.14  Can BIA request additional information?

    BIA may require the lender to provide additional information, 
whenever BIA believes it needs the information to properly evaluate a 
new lender, guaranty application, or insurance application. After BIA 
issues a loan guaranty or insurance coverage, the lender must let BIA 
inspect the lender's records at any reasonable time for information 
concerning the Program.


<R05>
Sec. 103.15  Are there any prohibited loan terms?

    A loan agreement guaranteed or insured under the Program may not 
contain:
    (a) Charges by the lender styled as ``points,'' loan origination 
fees, or any similar fees (however named), except that if authorized in 
the loan agreement, the lender may charge the borrower a reasonable 
annual loan servicing fee that:
    (1) Is not included as part of the loan principal; and
    (2) Does not bear interest;
    (b) Charges of any kind by the lender or by any third party except 
for the reasonable and customary cost of legal and architectural 
services, broker commissions, surveys, compliance inspections, title 
inspection and/or insurance, lien searches, appraisals, recording costs, 
premiums for required hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds 
of insurance, and such other charges as BIA may approve in writing;
    (c) A loan repayment term of over 30 years;
    (d) Payments scheduled less frequently than annually;
    (e) A prepayment penalty, unless the terms of the penalty are 
clearly specified in BIA's loan guaranty or loan insurance conditions;
    (f) An interest rate greater than what BIA considers reasonable, 
taking into account the range of rates prevailing in the private market 
for similar loans;
    (g) A variable interest rate, unless the rate is tied to a specific 
prime rate

[[Page 330]]

published from time to time by a nationally recognized financial 
institution or news source;
    (h) An increased rate of interest based on default;
    (i) A fee imposed for the late repayment of any installment due, 
except for a late fee that:
    (1) Is imposed only after the borrower is at least 30 days late with 
payment;
    (2) Does not bear interest; and
    (3) Equals no more than 5 percent of the late installment;
    (j) An ``insecurity'' clause, or any similar provision permitting 
the lender to declare a loan default solely on the basis of its 
subjective view of the borrower's changed repayment prospects;
    (k) A requirement that the borrower take title to any real or 
personal property purchased with loan proceeds by a title instrument 
containing restrictions on alienation, control or use of the property, 
unless otherwise required by applicable law; or
    (l) A requirement that a borrower which is a tribe provide as 
security a general assignment of the tribe's trust income. If otherwise 
lawful, a tribe may provide as loan security an assignment of trust 
income from a specific source.


<R05>
Sec. 103.16  How does BIA approve or reject a loan guaranty or insurance application?

    (a) BIA reviews each guaranty or insurance application, and may 
evaluate each loan application independently from the lender. BIA bases 
its loan guaranty or insurance decisions on many factors, including 
compliance with this part, and whether there is a reasonable prospect of 
loan repayment from business cash flow, or if necessary, from 
liquidating loan collateral. Lenders are expected to obtain a first lien 
security interest in enough collateral to reasonably secure repayment of 
each loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, to the extent that 
collateral is available.
    (b) BIA approves applications by issuing an approval letter, 
followed by the procedures in Sec. 103.18. If the guaranty or insurance 
application is incomplete, BIA may return the application to the lender, 
or hold the application while the lender submits the missing 
information. If BIA denies the application, it will provide the lender 
with a written explanation, with a copy to the borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 103.17  Must the lender follow any special procedures to close the loan?

    (a) BIA officials or their representatives may attend the closing of 
any loan or loan modification that BIA agrees to guarantee or insure. 
For guaranteed loans, and insured loans that BIA must individually 
review under this part, the lender must give BIA notice of the date of 
closing at least 5 business days before closing occurs.
    (b) At or prior to closing, the lender must obtain appropriate, 
satisfactory title and/or lien searches for each asset to be used as 
loan collateral.
    (c) At or prior to closing, the lender must obtain recent appraisals 
for all real property and improvements to be used as collateral for the 
loan, to the extent required by law.
    (d) At or prior to closing, the lender must document that the lender 
and borrower have complied with all applicable Federal, State, local, 
and tribal laws implicated by financing the borrower's business, for 
example by securing:
    (1) Copies of all permits and licenses required to operate the 
borrower's business;
    (2) Environmental studies required for construction and/or business 
operations under NEPA and other environmental laws;
    (3) Archeological or historical studies required by law; and
    (4) Certification by a registered surveyor or appropriate BIA 
official indicating that the proposed business will not be located in a 
special flood hazard area, as defined by applicable law.
    (e) The lender must supply BIA with copies of all final, signed loan 
closing documents within 30 days following closing. To the extent 
applicable, loan closing documents must include the following:
    (1) Promissory notes;
    (2) Security agreements, including pledge and similar agreements, 
and related financing statements (together

[[Page 331]]

with BIA's written approval of any assignment of specific tribal trust 
assets under Sec. 103.15(l), or of any security interest in an 
individual Indian money account);
    (3) Mortgage instruments or deeds of trust (together with BIA's 
written approval, if required by 25 U.S.C. 483a, or if the mortgage is 
of a leasehold interest in tribal trust property);
    (4) Guarantees (other than from BIA);
    (5) Construction contracts, and plans and specifications;
    (6) Leases related to the business (together with BIA's written 
approval, if required under 25 CFR part 162);
    (7) Attorney opinion letters;
    (8) Resolutions made by a Tribe or business entity;
    (9) Waivers or partial waivers of sovereign immunity; and
    (10) Similar instruments designed to document the loan, establish 
the basis for a security interest in loan collateral, and comply with 
applicable law.
    (f) Unless BIA indicates otherwise in writing, the lender must close 
a guaranteed or insured loan within 90 days of any approval provided 
under Sec. 103.16.


<R05>
Sec. 103.18  How does BIA issue a loan guaranty or confirm loan insurance?

    (a) A loan is guaranteed under the Program when all of the following 
occur:
    (1) BIA issues a signed loan guaranty certificate bearing a series 
number, an authorized signature, a guaranty percentage rate, the 
lender's name, the borrower's name, the original principal amount of the 
loan, and such other terms and conditions as BIA may require;
    (2) The loan closes and funds;
    (3) The lender pays BIA the applicable loan guaranty premium; and
    (4) The lender meets all of the conditions listed in the loan 
guaranty certificate.
    (b) A loan is insured under the Program when all of the following 
occur:
    (1) The loan's purpose and terms meet the requirements of the 
Program and the lender's loan insurance agreement with BIA;
    (2) The loan closes and funds;
    (3) The lender notifies BIA of the borrower's identity and 
organizational structure, the amount of the loan, the interest rate, the 
payment schedule, and the date on which the loan closing and funding 
occurred;
    (4) The lender pays BIA the applicable loan insurance premium;
    (5) If over $100,000 or if the loan requires interest subsidy, BIA 
approves the loan in writing; and
    (6) If over $100,000 or if the loan requires interest subsidy, the 
lender meets all of the conditions listed in BIA's written loan 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 103.19  When must the lender pay BIA the loan guaranty or insurance premium?

    The premium is due within 30 calendar days of the loan closing. If 
not paid on time, BIA will send the lender written notice by certified 
mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight 
delivery service (signature of recipient required), stating that the 
premium is due immediately. If the lender fails to make the premium 
payment within 30 calendar days of the date of BIA's notice, BIA's 
guaranty certificate or insurance coverage with respect to that 
particular loan is void, without further action.


<R04>
                       Subpart C_Interest Subsidy


<R05>
Sec. 103.20  What is interest subsidy?

    Interest subsidy is a payment BIA makes for the benefit of the 
borrower, to reimburse part of the interest payments the borrower has 
made on a loan guaranteed or insured under the Program. It is available 
to borrowers whose projected or historical earnings before interest and 
taxes, after adjustment for extraordinary items, is less than the 
industry norm.


<R05>
Sec. 103.21  Who applies for interest subsidy payments, and what is 

the application procedure?

    (a) An eligible lender must request interest subsidy payments on 
behalf of an eligible borrower, after determining that the borrower 
qualifies. Typically, the lender should include a request for interest 
subsidy at the time it applies for a guaranty or insurance coverage 
under the Program. A request for interest subsidy must be supported by 
the information required in Sec. Sec. 103.12 and

[[Page 332]]

103.13 (relating to loan guaranty and insurance coverage applications). 
BIA approves, returns, or rejects interest subsidy requests in the same 
manner indicated in Sec. 103.16, based on the factors in Sec. 103.20 
and BIA's available resources.
    (b) BIA's approval of interest subsidy for an insured loan may 
provide for specific limitations on the manner in which the lender and 
borrower can modify the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 103.22  How does BIA determine the amount of interest subsidy?

    Interest subsidy payments should equal the difference between the 
lender's rate of interest and the rate determined in accordance with 25 
U.S.C. 1464. BIA will fix the amount of interest subsidy as of the date 
it approves the interest subsidy request.

[66 FR 3867, Jan. 17, 2001, as amended at 67 FR 63543, Oct. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 103.23  How does BIA make interest subsidy payments?

    The lender must send BIA reports at least quarterly on the 
borrower's loan payment history, together with a calculation of the 
interest subsidy then due. The lender's reports and calculation do not 
have to be in any specific format, but in addition to the calculation 
the reports must contain at least the information required by Sec. 
103.33(a). Based on the lender's reports and calculation, BIA will send 
interest subsidy payments to the borrower in care of the lender. The 
payments belong to the borrower, but the borrower and lender may agree 
in advance on how the borrower will use interest subsidy payments. BIA 
may verify and correct interest subsidy calculations and payments at any 
time.


<R05>
Sec. 103.24  How long will BIA make interest subsidy payments?

    (a) BIA will issue interest subsidy payments for the term of the 
loan, up to 3 years. If interest subsidy payments still are justified, 
the lender may apply for up to two 1-year extensions of this initial 
term. BIA will make interest subsidy payments on a single loan for no 
more than 5 years.
    (b) BIA will choose the date from which it calculates interest 
subsidy years, usually the date the lender first extends the loan funds. 
Interest subsidy payments will apply to all loan payments made in the 
calendar years following that date.
    (c) Interest subsidy payments will not be due for any loan payment 
made after the corresponding loan guaranty or insurance coverage stops 
under the Program, regardless of the circumstances.


<R04>
               Subpart D_Provisions Relating to Borrowers


<R05>
Sec. 103.25  What kind of borrower is eligible under the Program?

    (a) A borrower is eligible for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan if 
the borrower is:
    (1) An Indian individual;
    (2) An Indian-owned business entity organized under Federal, State, 
or tribal law, with an organizational structure reasonably acceptable to 
BIA;
    (3) A tribe; or
    (4) A business enterprise established and recognized by a tribe.
    (b) To be eligible for a BIA-guaranteed or insured loan, a business 
entity or tribal enterprise must be at least 51 percent owned by 
Indians. If at any time a business entity or tribal enterprise becomes 
less than 51 percent Indian owned, the lender either may declare a 
default as of the date the borrower stopped being at least 51 percent 
Indian owned and exercise its remedies under this part, or else continue 
to extend the loan to the borrower and allow BIA's guaranty or insurance 
coverage to become invalid.

[66 FR 3867, Jan. 17, 2001; 66 FR 46307, Sept. 4, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 103.26  What must the borrower supply the lender in its loan application?

    The lender may use any form of loan application it chooses. However, 
the borrower must supply the lender the information listed in this 
section in order for BIA to process a guaranty or insurance coverage 
application:
    (a) The borrower's precise legal name, address, and tax 
identification number or social security number;
    (b) Proof of the borrower's eligibility under the Program;

[[Page 333]]

    (c) A statement signed by the borrower, indicating that it is not 
delinquent on any Federal tax or other debt obligation;
    (d) The borrower's business plan, including resumes of all 
principals and a detailed discussion of the product or service to be 
offered, market factors, the borrower's marketing strategy, and any 
technical assistance the borrower may require;
    (e) A detailed description of the borrower's equity in the business 
being financed, including the method(s) of valuation;
    (f) The borrower's balance sheets and operating statements for the 
preceding 3 years, or so much of that period that the borrower has been 
in business;
    (g) The borrower's current financial statement, and the financial 
statements of all co-makers and guarantors of the loan (other than BIA);
    (h) At least 3 years of financial projections for the borrower's 
business, consisting of pro-forma balance sheets, operating statements, 
and cash flow statements;
    (i) A detailed list of all proposed collateral for the loan, 
including asset values and the method(s) of valuation;
    (j) A detailed list of all proposed hazard, liability, key man life, 
and other kinds of insurance the borrower will maintain on its business 
assets and operations;
    (k) If any significant portion of the loan will be used to finance 
construction, renovation, or demolition work:
    (1) Written quotes for the work from established and reputable 
contractors; and
    (2) To the extent available, copies of all construction and 
architectural contracts for the work, plans and specifications, and 
applicable building permits;
    (l) If the borrower is a tribe or a tribal enterprise, resolutions 
by the tribe and proof of authority under tribal law permitting the 
borrower to borrow the loan amount and offer the proposed loan 
collateral; and
    (m) If the borrower is a business entity, resolutions by the 
appropriate governing officials and proof of authority under its 
organizing documents permitting the borrower to borrow the loan amount 
and offer the proposed loan collateral.


<R05>
Sec. 103.27  Can the borrower get help preparing its loan application 

or putting its loan funds to use?

    A borrower may seek BIA's assistance when preparing a loan 
application or when planning business operations, including assistance 
identifying and complying with applicable laws as indicated by Sec. 
103.17(d). The borrower should contact the BIA field or agency office 
serving the area in which the borrower's business is to be located, or 
if there is no separate field or agency office serving the area, then 
the borrower should contact the BIA regional office serving the area.


<R04>
                        Subpart E_Loan Transfers


<R05>
Sec. 103.28  What if the lender transfers part of the loan to another person?

    (a) A lender may transfer one or more interests in a guaranteed loan 
to another person or persons, as long as the parties have in place an 
agreement that designates one person to perform all of the duties 
required of the lender under the Program and the loan guaranty 
certificate. Starting on the date of the transfer, only the person 
designated to perform the duties of the lender will be entitled to 
exercise the rights conferred by BIA's loan guaranty certificate, and 
will from that point forward be considered the lender for purposes of 
the Program. A lender under the Program must both service the guaranteed 
loan and own at least a 10 percent interest in the guaranteed loan. BIA 
will not consider more than one person at any given time to be the 
lender with respect to any loan guaranty certificate. If the person 
designated to perform the duties of the lender in an agreement among 
loan participants is not the original lender, then the provisions of 
Sec. 103.29(a) will apply (relating to sale or assignment of guaranteed 
loans), and the person designated to perform the duties of the lender 
must give BIA notice of its interest in the loan. Failure to provide 
notice in accordance with Sec. 103.29(a) will void BIA's loan guaranty 
certificate, without further action.

[[Page 334]]

    (b) Transferring any interest in an insured loan to another person 
will void the insurance coverage for that loan, except where the 
transfer is effected by a merger.


<R05>
Sec. 103.29  What if the lender transfers the entire loan?

    (a) A lender may transfer all of its rights in a guaranteed loan to 
any other person. The acquiring person must send BIA written notice of 
the transfer, describing the borrower, the loan, BIA's loan guaranty 
certificate number, and the acquiring person's name and address. 
Starting on the date of the transfer, only the acquiring person will be 
entitled to exercise the rights conferred by BIA's loan guaranty 
certificate, and will from that point forward be considered the lender 
for purposes of the Program. The acquiring person must service the 
guaranteed loan and otherwise perform all of the duties required of the 
lender under the Program and the loan guaranty certificate. Except when 
a transfer is effected by a merger, any failure by the acquiring person 
to send BIA proper notice of the transfer within 30 calendar days of the 
transfer date will void BIA's loan guaranty certificate, without further 
action.
    (b) Transferring an insured loan to another person will void the 
insurance coverage for that loan, except where the transfer is effected 
by a merger.
    (c) If a lender is not the surviving entity after a merger, the 
lender's successor must notify BIA in writing of the change within 30 
calendar days of the merger. The lender also must re-apply to become an 
approved lender under the Program, as indicated in Sec. 103.11.


<R04>
                  Subpart F_Loan Servicing Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 103.30  What standard of care must a lender meet?

    Lenders must service all loans guaranteed or insured under the 
Program in a commercially reasonable manner, in accordance with 
standards and procedures adopted by prudent lenders in the BIA region in 
which the borrower's business is located, and in accordance with this 
part. If the lender fails to follow any of these standards, BIA may 
reduce or eliminate entirely the amount payable under its guaranty or 
insurance coverage to the extent BIA can reasonably attribute the loss 
to the lender's failure. BIA also may deny payment completely if the 
lender gets a loan guaranty or insurance coverage through fraud, or 
negligently allows a borrower's fraudulent loan application or use of 
loan funds to go undetected. In particular, and without limitation, 
lenders must:
    (a) Check and verify information contained in the borrower's loan 
application, such as the borrower's eligibility, the authority of 
persons acting on behalf of the borrower, and the title status of any 
proposed collateral;
    (b) Take reasonable precautions to assure that loan proceeds are 
used as specified in BIA's guaranty certificate or written insurance 
approval, or if not so specified, then in descending order of 
importance:
    (1) BIA's written loan guaranty approval;
    (2) The loan documents;
    (3) The terms of the lender's final loan commitment to the borrower; 
or
    (4) The borrower's loan application;
    (c) When feasible, require the borrower to use automatic bank 
account debiting to make loan payments;
    (d) Require the borrower to take title to real and personal property 
purchased with loan proceeds in the borrower's own name, except for real 
property to be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of a 
borrower that is a tribe;
    (e) Promptly record all security interests and subsequently keep 
them in effect. Lenders must record all mortgages and other security 
interests in accordance with State and local law, including the laws of 
any tribe that may have jurisdiction. Lenders also must record any 
leasehold mortgages or assignments of income involving individual Indian 
or tribal trust land with the BIA office having responsibility for 
maintaining records on that trust land;
    (f) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower 
and any guarantor of the loan (other than BIA) keep current on all taxes 
levied on real

[[Page 335]]

and personal property used in the borrower's business or as collateral 
for the loan, and on all applicable payroll taxes;
    (g) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that all required 
insurance policies remain in effect, including hazard, liability, key 
man life, and other kinds of insurance, in amounts reasonably necessary 
to protect the interests of the borrower, the borrower's business, and 
the lender;
    (h) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower 
remains in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, local and 
tribal laws, including environmental laws and laws concerning the 
preservation of historical and archeological sites and data;
    (i) Assure, to the extent reasonably practicable, that the borrower 
causes any construction, renovation, or demolition work funded by the 
loan to proceed in accordance with approved construction contracts and 
plans and specifications, which must be sufficient in scope and detail 
to adequately govern the work;
    (j) Reserve for itself and BIA the right to inspect the borrower's 
business records and all loan collateral at any reasonable time;
    (k) Promptly notify the borrower in writing of any material breach 
by the borrower of the terms of its loan, with specific instructions on 
how to cure the breach and a deadline for doing so;
    (l) Participate in any probate, receivership, bankruptcy, or similar 
proceeding involving the borrower and any guarantor or co-maker of the 
borrower's debt, to the extent necessary to maintain the greatest 
possible rights to repayment; and
    (m) Otherwise seek to avoid and mitigate any potential loss arising 
from the loan, using at least that level of care the lender would use if 
it did not have a BIA loan guaranty or insurance coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 103.31  What loan servicing requirements apply to BIA?

    Once a lender extends a loan that is guaranteed or insured under the 
Program, BIA has no responsibility for decisions concerning it, except 
for:
    (a) Any approvals required under this part;
    (b) Any decisions reserved to BIA under conditions of BIA's guaranty 
certificate or insurance coverage; and
    (c) Decisions concerning a loan that the lender has assigned to BIA 
or to which BIA is subrogated by virtue of paying a claim based on a 
guaranty certificate or insurance coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 103.32  What sort of loan documentation does BIA expect the

lender to maintain?

    For every loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, the lender 
must maintain:
    (a) BIA's original loan guaranty certificate or insurance coverage 
approval letter, if applicable;
    (b) Original signed and/or certified counterparts of all final loan 
documents, including those listed in Sec. 103.17 (concerning documents 
required for loan closing), all renewals, modifications, and additions 
to those documents, and signed settlement statements;
    (c) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all documents gathered 
by the lender under Sec. Sec. 103.12, 103.13 and 103.26 (concerning 
information submitted by the borrower in its loan application, and 
information supplied to BIA in the lender's loan guaranty or insurance 
coverage application);
    (d) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all applicable insurance 
binders or certificates, including without limitation hazard, liability, 
key man life, and title insurance;
    (e) A complete and current history of all loan transactions, 
including dated disbursements, payments, adjustments, and notes 
describing all contacts with the borrower;
    (f) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all correspondence with 
the borrower, including default notices and evidence of receipt;
    (g) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all correspondence, 
notices, news items or other information concerning the borrower, 
whether gathered by the lender or furnished to it, containing material 
information about the borrower and its business operations;
    (h) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all advertisements, 
notices, title instruments, accountings, and

[[Page 336]]

other documentation of efforts to liquidate loan collateral; and
    (i) Originals or copies, as appropriate, of all notices, pleadings, 
motions, orders, and other documents associated with any legal 
proceeding involving the lender and the borrower or its assets, 
including without limitation judicial or non-judicial foreclosure 
proceedings, suits to collect payment, bankruptcy proceedings, probate 
proceedings, and any settlement associated with threatened or actual 
litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 103.33  Are there reporting requirements?

    (a) The lender must periodically report the borrower's loan payment 
history so that BIA can recalculate the government's contingent 
liability. Loan payment history reports must be quarterly unless BIA 
provides otherwise for a particular loan. These reports can be in any 
format the lender desires, as long as they contain:
    (1) The lender's name;
    (2) The borrower's name;
    (3) A reference to BIA's Loan Guaranty Certificate or Loan Insurance 
Agreement number;
    (4) The lender's internal loan number; and
    (5) The date and amount of all loan balance activity for the 
reporting period.
    (b) If applicable, the lender must supply a calculation of any 
interest subsidy payments that are due, as indicated in Sec. 103.23.
    (c) If there is a transfer of any or all of the lender's ownership 
interest in the loan, the party receiving the ownership interest may be 
required to notify BIA, as indicated in Sec. Sec. 103.28 and 103.29.
    (d) If there is a default on the loan, the lender must notify BIA, 
as indicated in Sec. Sec. 103.35 and 103.36.
    (e) If the borrower ceases to qualify for a BIA-guaranteed or 
insured loan under Sec. 103.25(b), the lender must promptly notify BIA 
even if the lender does not pursue default remedies under Sec. Sec. 
103.35 and 103.36. This notice allows BIA to eliminate the guaranty or 
insurance coverage from its active recordkeeping system.
    (f) If the loan is prepaid in full, the lender must promptly notify 
BIA in writing so that BIA can eliminate the guaranty or insurance 
coverage from its active recordkeeping system.
    (g) If a lender changes its name, it should notify BIA in accordance 
with Sec. 103.11(c).


<R05>
Sec. 103.34  What if the lender and borrower decide to change the 

terms of the loan?

    (a) The lender must obtain written BIA approval before modifying a 
loan guaranteed or insured under the Program, if the change will:
    (1) Increase the borrower's outstanding principal amount (if a term 
loan), or maximum available credit (if a revolving loan).
    (i) BIA will approve or disapprove a loan increase based upon the 
lender's explanation of the borrower's need for additional funding, and 
updated information of the sort required under Sec. Sec. 103.12, 
103.13, and 103.26, as applicable.
    (ii) Upon approval by BIA and payment of an additional guaranty or 
insurance premium in accordance with Sec. Sec. 103.8 and 103.19 and 
this section, the entire outstanding loan amount, as modified, will be 
guaranteed or insured (as the case may be) to the extent BIA specifies. 
The lender must pay the additional premium only on the increase in the 
outstanding principal amount of the loan (if a term loan) or the 
increase in the credit limit available to the borrower (if a revolving 
loan).
    (iii) Lenders may not increase the outstanding principal amount of a 
loan guaranteed or insured under the Program if a significant purpose of 
doing so would be to allow the borrower to pay accrued loan interest it 
otherwise would have difficulty paying.
    (2) Permanently adjust the loan repayment schedule.
    (3) Increase a fixed interest rate, convert a fixed interest rate to 
an adjustable interest rate, or convert an adjustable interest rate to a 
fixed interest rate.
    (4) Allow any changes in the identity or organizational structure of 
the borrower.
    (5) Allow any material change in the use of loan proceeds or the 
nature of the borrower's business.
    (6) Release any collateral taken as security for the loan, except 
items sold

[[Page 337]]

in the ordinary course of business and promptly replaced by similar 
items of collateral, such as inventory.
    (7) Allow the borrower to move any significant portion of its 
business operations to a location that is not on or near an Indian 
reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA.
    (8) Be likely to materially increase the risk of a claim on BIA's 
guaranty or insurance coverage, or materially reduce the aggregate value 
of the collateral securing the loan.
    (9) Cure a default for which BIA is to receive notice under Sec. 
103.35(b).
    (b) In the case of an insured loan, the amount of which will not 
exceed $100,000 when combined with all other insured loans from the 
lender to the borrower, the lender need not obtain BIA's prior approval 
to make any of the loan modifications indicated in Sec. 103.34(a), 
except as provided in Sec. 103.21(b). However, all loan modifications 
must remain consistent with the lender's loan insurance agreement with 
BIA, and in the event of an increase in the borrower's outstanding 
principal amount (if a term loan), or maximum available credit (if a 
revolving loan), the lender must send BIA an additional premium payment 
in accordance with Sec. Sec. 103.8, 103.19 and this section. The lender 
must pay the additional premium only on the increase in the outstanding 
principal amount of the loan (if a term loan) or the increase in the 
credit limit available to the borrower (if a revolving loan). To the 
extent a loan modification changes any of the information supplied to 
BIA under Sec. 103.18(b)(3), the lender also must promptly notify BIA 
of the new information.
    (c) Subject to any applicable BIA loan guaranty or insurance 
coverage conditions, a lender may extend additional loans to a borrower 
without BIA approval, if the additional loans are not to be guaranteed 
or insured under the Program.


<R04>
                  Subpart G_Default and Payment by BIA


<R05>
Sec. 103.35  What must the lender do if the borrower defaults on the loan?

    (a) The lender must send written notice of the default to the 
borrower, and otherwise meet the standard of care established for the 
lender in this part. The lender's notice to the borrower should be sent 
as soon as possible after the default, but in any event before the 
lender's notice to BIA under paragraph (b) of this section. For purposes 
of the Program, ``default'' will mean a default as defined in this part.
    (b) The lender also must send written notice of the default to BIA 
by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a nationally-
recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient required) 
within 60 calendar days of the default, unless the default is fully 
cured before that deadline. This notice is required even if the lender 
grants the borrower a forbearance under Sec. 103.36(a). One purpose of 
the notice is to give BIA the opportunity to intervene and seek 
assistance for the borrower, even though BIA has no duty, either to the 
lender or the borrower, to do so. Another purpose of the notice is to 
permit BIA to plan for a possible loss claim from the lender, under 
Sec. 103.36(d). The lender's notice must clearly indicate:
    (1) The identity of the borrower;
    (2) The applicable Program guaranty certificate or insurance 
agreement number;
    (3) The date and nature of all bases for default;
    (4) If a monetary default, the amount of past due principal and 
interest, the date through which interest has been calculated, and the 
amount of any late fees, precautionary advances, or other amounts the 
lender claims;
    (5) The nature and outcome of any correspondence or other contacts 
with the borrower concerning the default; and
    (6) The precise nature of any action the borrower could take to cure 
the default.


<R05>
Sec. 103.36  What options and remedies does the lender have if the

borrower defaults on the loan?

    (a) The lender may grant the borrower a temporary forbearance, even 
beyond any default cure periods specified in the loan documents, if 
doing so

[[Page 338]]

is likely to result in the borrower curing the default. However, BIA 
must approve in writing any forbearance or other agreement that:
    (1) Permanently modifies the terms of the loan in any manner 
indicated by Sec. 103.34(a);
    (2) Would allow the borrower's default to extend beyond the deadline 
established in Sec. 103.36(d) for the lender to elect a remedy; or
    (3) Is not likely to result in the borrower curing the default.
    (b) The lender may make precautionary advances on the borrower's 
behalf during the default, if doing so is reasonably necessary to ensure 
that loan recovery prospects do not significantly deteriorate. Items for 
which the lender may make precautionary advances include, for example:
    (1) Hazard, liability, or key man life insurance premiums;
    (2) Security measures to safeguard abandoned business assets;
    (3) Real or personal property taxes;
    (4) Corrective actions required by court or administrative orders; 
or
    (5) Essential maintenance.
    (c) BIA will guaranty or insure the amount of precautionary advances 
from the date of each advance to the same extent as other amounts due 
under the loan, if:
    (1) The borrower has demonstrated its inability or unwillingness to 
make the payment or perform the duty that jeopardizes loan recovery, 
including by undue delay in making the payment or performing the duty;
    (2) The total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender 
does not at the time of the advance exceed 10 percent of the outstanding 
principal balance of the loan;
    (3) Where loan document provisions do not require the borrower to 
repay precautionary advances (however termed) when made by the lender, 
or where the total expense of all precautionary advances by the lender 
will exceed 10 percent of the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
when made, the lender secures BIA's prior written approval; and
    (4) The lender properly claims and documents all precautionary 
advances, if and when it submits a claim for loss under Sec. 103.37.
    (d) If the default remains uncured, the lender must send BIA a 
written notice by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a 
nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient 
required) within 90 calendar days of the default to select one of the 
following remedies:
    (1) In the case of a guaranteed loan, the lender may submit a claim 
to BIA for its loss;
    (2) In the case of either a guaranteed or insured loan, the lender 
may liquidate all collateral securing the loan, and upon completion, if 
it has a residual loss on the loan, it may submit a claim to BIA for 
that loss; or
    (3) The lender may negotiate a loan modification agreement with the 
borrower to permanently change the terms of the loan in a manner that 
will cure the default. If the lender chooses this remedy, it may take no 
longer than 45 calendar days from the date BIA receives the notice of 
remedy selection to finalize a loan modification agreement and secure 
BIA's written approval of it, unless BIA specifically extends this 
deadline in writing. However, the lender may at any time before the 
expiration of the 45-day period (or any extension thereof) change its 
choice of remedy by sending BIA a notice otherwise complying with Sec. 
103.36(d)(1) or (2). If the lender fails to send BIA a notice changing 
its choice of remedy and does not finalize an approved loan modification 
agreement within the 45-day period (or any extension thereof), the 
lender's only permissible remedy under the Program will be to pursue the 
procedure specified in Sec. 103.36(d)(2).
    (e) Failure by the lender to provide BIA with notice of the lender's 
election of remedy within 90 calendar days of the default, as indicated 
in Sec. 103.36(d), will invalidate BIA's loan guaranty certificate or 
insurance coverage for that particular loan, absent an express waiver of 
this provision by BIA. BIA may preserve the validity of a loan guaranty 
certificate or insurance coverage through waiver of this provision only 
when BIA determines, in its discretion, that:
    (1) The lender consistently has acted in good faith, and

[[Page 339]]

    (2) The lender's failure to provide timely notice either:
    (i) Has not caused any actual or potential prejudice to BIA; or
    (ii) Was the result of the lender relying upon specific written 
advice from a BIA official.


<R05>
Sec. 103.37  What must the lender do to collect payment under 

its loan guaranty certificate or loan insurance coverage?

    (a) For guaranteed loans, the lender must submit a claim for its 
loss on a form approved by BIA.
    (1) If the lender makes an immediate claim under Sec. 103.36(d)(1), 
it must send BIA the claim for loss within 90 calendar days of the 
default by certified mail (return receipt requested), or by a 
nationally-recognized overnight delivery service (signature of recipient 
required). The lender's claim for loss may include interest that has 
accrued on the outstanding principal amount of the loan only through the 
date it submits the claim.
    (2) If the lender elects first to liquidate the collateral securing 
the loan under Sec. 103.36(d)(2), and has a residual loss after doing 
so, it must send BIA the claim for loss within 30 calendar days of 
completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform collateral 
liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably possible, 
within the standards established by this part. The lender's claim for 
loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal 
amount of the loan only through the earlier of:
    (i) The date it submits the claim;
    (ii) The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or 
the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the 
loan; or
    (iii) One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the 
default.
    (b) For insured loans, after liquidating all loan collateral, the 
lender must submit a claim for its loss (if any) on a form approved by 
BIA. The lender must send BIA the claim for loss by certified mail 
(return receipt requested), or by a nationally-recognized overnight 
delivery service (signature of recipient required) within 30 calendar 
days of completing all liquidation efforts. The lender must perform 
collateral liquidation as expeditiously and thoroughly as is reasonably 
possible, within the standards established by this part. The lender's 
claim for loss may include interest that has accrued on the outstanding 
principal amount of the loan through the earlier of:
    (1) The date it submits the claim;
    (2) The date the lender gets a judgment of foreclosure or sale (or 
the non-judicial equivalent) on the principal collateral securing the 
loan; or
    (3) One hundred eighty calendar days after the date of the default.
    (c) Whenever the lender liquidates loan collateral under Sec. 
103.36(d)(2), it must vigorously pursue all reasonable methods of 
collection concerning the loan collateral before submitting a claim for 
its residual loss (if any) to BIA. Without limiting the generality of 
the preceding sentence, the lender must:
    (1) Foreclose, either judicially or non-judicially, all rights of 
redemption the borrower or any co-maker or guarantor of the loan (other 
than BIA) may have in collateral under any mortgage securing the loan;
    (2) Gather and dispose of all personal property pledged as 
collateral under the loan, in accordance with applicable law;
    (3) Exercise all set-off rights the lender may have under contract 
or applicable law;
    (4) Make demand for payment on the borrower, all co-makers, and all 
guarantors of the loan (other than BIA); and
    (5) Participate fully in all bankruptcy proceedings that may arise 
involving the borrower and any co-maker or guarantor of the loan. Full 
participation might include, for example, filing a proof of claim in the 
case, attending creditors' meetings, and seeking a court order releasing 
the automatic stay of collection efforts so that the lender can 
liquidate affected loan collateral.
    (d) BIA may require further information, including without 
limitation copies of any documents the lender is to maintain under Sec. 
103.32 and all documentation of liquidation efforts, to help BIA 
evaluate the lender's claim for loss.

[[Page 340]]

    (e) BIA will pay the lender the guaranteed or insured portion of the 
lender's claim for loss, to the extent the claim is based upon 
reasonably sufficient evidence of the loss and compliance with the 
requirements of this part. BIA will render a decision on a claim for 
loss within 90 days of receiving all information it requires to properly 
evaluate the loss.


<R05>
Sec. 103.38  Is there anything else for BIA or the lender to do after BIA makes payment?

    When BIA pays the lender on its claim for loss, the lender must sign 
and deliver to BIA an assignment of rights to its loan agreement with 
the borrower, in a document acceptable to BIA. Immediately upon payment, 
BIA is subrogated to all rights of the lender under the loan agreement 
with the borrower, and must pursue collection efforts against the 
borrower and any co-maker and guarantor, as required by law.


<R05>
Sec. 103.39  When will BIA refuse to pay all or part of a lender's claim?

    BIA may deny all or part of a lender's claim for loss when:
    (a) The loan is not guaranteed or insured as indicated in Sec. 
103.18;
    (b) The guarantee or insurance coverage has become invalid under 
Sec. Sec. 103.28, 103.29, or 103.36(e);
    (c) The lender has not met the standard of care indicated in Sec. 
103.30;
    (d) The lender presents a claim for a residual loss after attempting 
to liquidate loan collateral, and:
    (1) The lender has not made a reasonable effort to liquidate all 
security for the loan;
    (2) The lender has taken an unreasonable amount of time to complete 
its liquidation efforts, the probable consequence of which has been to 
reduce overall prospects of loss recovery; or
    (3) The lender's loss claim is inflated by unreasonable liquidation 
expenses or unjustifiable deductions from collateral liquidation 
proceeds applied to the loan balance; or
    (e) The lender has otherwise failed in any material respect to 
follow the requirements of this part, and BIA can reasonably attribute 
some or all of the lender's loss to that failure.


<R05>
Sec. 103.40  Will BIA make exceptions to its criteria for denying payment?

    (a) BIA will not reduce or deny payment solely on the basis of 
Sec. Sec. 103.39(c) or (e) when the lender making the claim for loss:
    (1) Is a person to whom a previous lender transferred the loan under 
Sec. Sec. 103.28 or 103.29 before maturity for value;
    (2) Notified BIA of its acquisition of the loan interest as required 
by Sec. Sec. 103.28 or 103.29;
    (3) Had no involvement in or knowledge of the actions or 
circumstances that would have allowed BIA to reduce or deny payment to a 
previous lender; and
    (4) Has not itself violated the standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 
103.39(c) or (e).
    (b) If BIA makes payment to a lender under this section, it may seek 
reimbursement from the previous lender or lenders who contributed to the 
loss by violating Sec. Sec. 103.39(c) or (e).


<R05>
Sec. 103.41  What happens if a lender violates provisions of this part?

    In addition to reducing or eliminating payment on a specific claim 
for loss, BIA may either temporarily suspend, or permanently bar, a 
lender from making or acquiring loans under the Program if the lender 
repeatedly fails to abide by the requirements of this part, or if the 
lender significantly violates the requirements of this part on any 
single occasion.


<R05>
Sec. 103.42  How long must a lender comply with Program requirements?

    (a) A lender must comply in general with Program requirements 
during:
    (1) The effective period of its loan guaranty agreement or loan 
insurance agreement; and
    (2) Whatever additional period is necessary to resolve any 
outstanding loan guaranty or insurance claims or coverage the lender may 
have.
    (b) Except as otherwise required by law, a lender must maintain 
records with respect to a particular loan for 6 years after either:
    (1) The loan is repaid in full; or
    (2) The lender accepts payment from BIA for a loss on the loan, 
pursuant to a guaranty certificate or an insurance agreement.

[[Page 341]]

    (c) At any time 2 years or more following one of the events 
specified in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section, a lender may 
convert its records for corresponding loans to any electronic format 
that is readily retrievable and that provides an accurate, detailed 
image of the original records. Upon converting its records in this 
manner, the lender may dispose of its original loan records.
    (d) This section does not restrict any claims BIA may have against 
the lender or any other party arising from the lender's participation in 
the Program.


<R05>
Sec. 103.43  What must the lender do after repayment in full?

    The lender must completely and promptly release of record all 
remaining collateral for a guaranteed or insured loan after the loan has 
been paid in full. The release must be at the lender's sole cost. In 
addition, if the loan is prepaid the lender must notify BIA in 
accordance with Sec. 103.33(f).

Sec. 111.1  Persons to share payments.

    In making all annuity and other per capita payments, the funds shall 
be equally divided among the Indians entitled thereto share and share 
alike. The roll for such payments should be prepared on Form 5-322, \1\ 
in strict alphabetical order by families of husband, wife, and unmarried 
dependent minor children. Unless otherwise instructed,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Forms may be obtained from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
Washington, D.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Indians of both sexes may be considered adults at the age of 18 
years;
    (b) Deceased enrollees may be carried on the rolls for one payment 
after death;
    (c) Where final rolls have been prepared constituting the legal 
membership of the tribe, only Indians whose names appear thereon are 
entitled to share in future payments, after-born children being excluded 
and the shares of deceased enrollees paid to the heirs if determined or 
if not determined credited to the estate pending determination; and
    (d) The shares of competent Indians will be paid to them directly 
and the shares of incompetents and minors deposited for expenditure 
under the individual Indian money regulations.

    Cross References: For regulations pertaining to the determination of 
heirs and approval of wills, see part 15 and subpart G of part 11 of

Sec. 111.2  Enrolling non-full-blood children.

    Where an Indian woman was married to a white man prior to June 7, 
1897, and was at the time of her marriage a recognized member of the 
tribe even though she left it after marriage and lived away from the 
reservation, the children of such a marriage should be enrolled--and, 
also in the case of an Indian woman married to a white man subsequent to 
the above date but who still maintains her affiliation with the tribe 
and she and her children are recognized members thereof; however, where 
an Indian woman by marriage with a white man after June 7, 1897, has, in 
effect, withdrawn from the tribe and is no longer identified with it, 
her children should not be enrolled. In case of doubt all the facts 
should be submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, D.C., 
for a decision.


<R05>
Sec. 111.3  Payments by check.

    All payments should be made by check. In making payments to 
competent Indians, each check should be drawn to the order of the 
enrollee and given or sent directly to him. Powers of attorney and 
orders given by an Indian to another person for his share in

[[Page 343]]

a payment will not be recognized. Superintendents will note in the 
``Remarks'' column on the roll the date of birth of each new enrollee 
and the date of death of deceased annuitants.


<R05>
Sec. 111.4  Election of shareholders.

    An Indian holding equal rights in two or more tribes can share in 
payments to only one of them and will be required to elect with which 
tribe he wishes to be enrolled and to relinquish in writing his claims 
to payments to the other. In the case of a minor the election will be 
made by the parent or guardian.


<R05>
Sec. 111.5  Future payments.

    Indians who have received or applied for their pro rata shares of an 
interest-bearing tribal fund under the act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. 
1221; 25 U.S.C. 119, 121), as amended by the act of May 18, 1916 (39 
Stat. 128), will not be permitted to participate in future payments made 
from the accumulated interest.

Act and 25 CFR part 1200, subpart B, unless otherwise specified by

the trust funds.

funds that are not made in compliance with statutory language or other federal law?

    If a tribe's use of trust funds is limited by statutory language or

tribe's trust funds are invested in securities that have not matured, 
OTFM will only sell the asset to make cash available to the tribe if:
    (a) There are no restrictions against the sale, and
    (b) A tribe provides OTFM with a tribal resolution stating that:

project if:
    (a) The funds were withdrawn in accordance with:
    (1) The terms of Trust Reform Act;
    (2) The terms of the legislative settlement; or
    (3) The terms of a judgment use and distribution plan; and

<R05>
Sec. 115.815  How does a tribe request trust funds from a tribal trust account?

    To request trust funds from a tribal trust account, a tribe may:

    (1) The tribe did not submit all the necessary documentation;
    (2) The tribe's request is not signed by the proper authorizing 
official(s);
    (3) OTFM does not have documentation from the tribe certifying its

    (4) The tribe's request is in conflict with statutory language or 
the controlling document governing the use of the trust funds; or
    (5) The BIA or OTFM requires clarification regarding the tribe's 
request.
    (b) If action on a tribe's request to withdraw trust funds will be 
delayed or denied, the BIA or the OTFM will:
    (1) Notify the tribe within ten (10) working days of the date of a

    (3) Provide technical assistance to the tribe to address any 
problems.


<R05>
Sec. 115.817  How does OTFM disburse money to a tribe?

    Upon receipt of all necessary documentation, OTFM will process the 
request for disbursement and send the tribe the requested amount of 
trust funds within one business day. Whenever possible, trust funds will 
be disbursed electronically to an account in a financial institution 
designated by the tribe. If there are circumstances that preclude

<R05>
Sec. 115.818  What happens if an Indian adult does not cash his or

her per capita check?

    (a) If an Indian adult does not cash his or her per capita check 
within twelve (12) months of the date the check was issued, the check 
will be canceled and the trust funds will be deposited into a ``returned 
per capita account'' where the funds will be maintained until we receive 
a request for disbursement by the Indian adult or for disposition by a 
tribe pursuant to Sec. 115.820.
    (b) If an Indian adult's per capita check is returned to us as 
undeliverable, the trust funds will be immediately deposited into a 
``returned per capita account'' where the funds will be maintained until 
we receive a request for disbursement by the individual or for 
disposition by a tribe pursuant to Sec. 115.820.

[[Page 367]]


<R05>
Sec. 115.819  What steps will be taken to locate an individual 

whose per capita check is returned as undeliverable or not

          issuance?

    The OTFM will notify a tribe of the names of the individuals whose 
per capita checks were returned as undeliverable or not cashed within 
twelve (12) months of issuance and will take reasonable action, 
including utilizing electronic search tools, to locate the individual 
entitled to receive the per capita funds.


<R05>
Sec. 115.820  May OTFM transfer money in a returned per capita account to a tribal account?

    Funds in a returned per capita account will not automatically be 
returned to a tribe. However, a tribe may apply under 25 U.S.C. 164 and 
Public Law 87-283, 75 Stat. 584 (1961), to have the unclaimed per capita 
funds transferred to its account for the tribe's use after six years

such certification.


<R05>
Sec. 115.902  May administrative or land conveyance fees paid 

as federal reimbursements be deposited in a special deposit account?

special deposit accounts at OTFM. Cash bonds held by the Secretary are 
to be deposited in non-interest bearing accounts until the term of the 
bonds expire.


<R05>
Sec. 115.904  Where earnest money is paid prior to Secretarial 

approval of a conveyance or contract instrument involving trust assets,
may the BIA deposit that 
          earnest money into a special deposit account?

taxes of every kind and character for which such Indian is or may be 
liable before paying to or for such person any funds as required by law. 
All checks in payment of taxes shall be made payable to the proper

from these sources are insufficient, one-fourth of the estimated amount 
of such ad valorem taxes may be obligated from each quarterly payment. 
If an Indian who is liable for ad valorem taxes has no allowance funds,

amount of income taxes from each semi-annual payment of interest on 
deposits, but if such interest payments are insufficient to meet this 
obligation, additional funds shall be retained from interest on 
investments, rentals, or other allowance funds.
    (2) Whenever funds are withheld for the purpose of establishing a

the Indian and may disburse the allowance funds of the Indian in 
conformity therewith so long as the power of attorney remains in force 
and effect.


<R05>
Sec. 117.5  Procedure for hearings to assume supervision of expenditure of allowance funds.

    (a) Whenever the superintendent has reason to believe that an adult

person or by registered mail, and a copy thereof shall likewise be 
served upon his guardian if the Indian is under guardianship:

    Section 1 of the act of February 27, 1925 (43 Stat. 1008) provides 
in part as follows:
    ``All payments to adults not having certificates of competency, 
including amounts paid for each minor, shall, in case the Secretary of 
the Interior finds that such adults are wasting or squandering said 
income, be subject to the supervision of the Superintendent of the Osage 
Agency: . . .''
    Enclosed is a copy of a report which has been made to me concerning 
your handling and management of the income paid to you through the Osage 
Agency. This report indicates that you have been wasting and squandering 
your payments.
    You are hereby notified that a hearing will be held in the Osage 
Indian Agency, Pawhuska, Oklahoma, at ---- m., on the ---------- day of 
--------------, 19----, before the Superintendent, for the purpose of 
taking testimony and evidence to be submitted to the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs for his consideration in determining whether your 
payments shall be subject to the supervision of the Superintendent.
    You are requested to be present at the hearing at the time and place 
designated above. You may introduce at the hearing such testimony and 
evidence as you deem appropriate to show that you are not wasting or 
squandering your payments and that your payments should continue to be 
made to you without supervision for your unrestricted use.
    You are entitled to employ an attorney to assist you in this matter. 
Upon your request the employees of the Osage Agency will furnish you 
with any information you desire concerning your accounts at the Osage

    Date.
    Superintendent.

    (b) A hearing shall be held pursuant to the notice, the date of

preliminary report, the notice and proof of service, all testimony and 
evidence introduced at the hearing, and all briefs and letters filed by 
the Indian or his attorney shall be submitted to the Commissioner, 
together with a recommendation from the superintendent.
    (d) Upon a finding by the Commissioner that the Indian is wasting or

to the supervision of the superintendent. Notice of the decision of the 
Commissioner shall be furnished all interested parties.


<R05>
Sec. 117.6  Allowance for minors.

    The superintendent may disburse from the surplus funds of an Indian

unless otherwise directed by the Commissioner. When an Indian refuses to 
make application for funds to defray the cost of repairs necessary to 
preserve restricted property, the superintendent may, when authorized by 
the Commissioner, expend the surplus funds of the Indian for such 
repairs.


<R05>
Sec. 117.10  Purchase of automotive equipment.

account from allowance funds within 24 months. No disbursement of 
surplus funds for the purchase of automotive equipment shall be made if

loss or damage to unrestricted real or personal property shall be paid 
to the Indian for his unrestricted use.


<R05>
Sec. 117.16  Reimbursement to surplus funds.

    When expenditures have been made from surplus funds upon the

<R05>
Sec. 134.1  Partial reimbursement of irrigation charges; 5 percent per

annum of cost of system, June 30, 1920.

    In pursuance of the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 
U.S.C. 386), regulations governing partial payment of construction 
charges on Indian irrigation projects, with the exception of certain 
ones mentioned therein, where approved by the Department June 21, 1920, 
and require that each owner of irrigable land under any irrigation 
system constructed for the benefit of Indians under provisions of law 
requiring reimbursement of the cost of such system and to which land, 
water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from such system, shall 
pay, on or before November 15, 1920, a sum equal to 5 percent of the per 
acre cost, as of June 30, 1920, of the construction of the system under 
which such land is situated. The per acre cost of a given system as of 
June 30, 1920, shall be determined by dividing the total amount expended 
for construction purposes on such system up to that day by the total 
area of land to which water for irrigation purposes can be delivered on 
that date; and on November 15 of each year following the year 1920, 
until further notice, the land owners, as therein prescribed, shall pay 
5 percent of the per acre construction cost as of June 30, of the 
current year, such per acre cost to be determined by dividing the cost 
of the system to June 30 of that year by the total area of land to which 
water for irrigation purposes can be delivered from the system on that 
date. Provision is contained that no payments shall be required under 
the regulations in behalf of lands still in process of allotment or 
prior to the issuance of the first or trust patent therefor, nor for 
lands reserved for school, agency, or other administrative purposes 
where the legal title still remains in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 134.2  Landowners financially unable to pay.

    Considerable difficulty has been encountered in collecting charges 
under the regulations in this part owing to the fact that Indians have 
been financially unable to pay the charges, the result being that the 
construction charges have accrued against the lands and in cases where 
the land is sold for the benefit of the allottee or his heirs under the 
regulations, the purchaser is to pay the accrued and future irrigation 
charges which make it difficult in some instances, to sell the land at 
as favorable terms as might otherwise be secured.

[[Page 380]]


<R05>
Sec. 134.3  Period for payments extended.

    Furthermore, in recent legislation dealing with specific projects in 
the Bureau and also all reclamation projects the policy has been to 
extend the payment of such charges over a longer period of years.


<R05>
Sec. 134.4  Annual payment reduced.

    In view of these conditions the regulations governing this matter 
are hereby modified so as to distribute the unaccrued installments over 
a period of time so that 2\1/2\ percent of the total amount yet due 
shall be due and payable on November 15 of each year until further 
notice. You shall accordingly ascertain the per acre cost after 
deducting the amount of the accrued charges and take 2\1/2\ percent of 
that amount and a like sum each year so that the amount of the annual 
installments will be the same each year. Superintendents are obligated 
to submit all proposed lists of sales involving allotments containing 
irrigable allotments to the project or supervising engineer for

Sec. 134.4a  Assessment and collection of additional construction costs.

    (a) Upon the completion of the construction of an Indian irrigation 
project, or unit thereof, subsequent to the determination of the partial 
per acre construction assessment rate which was fixed prior to July 1, 
1957, pursuant to Sec. 134.4 the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative shall determine such additional construction 
cost and distribute that cost on a per acre basis against all of the 
irrigable lands of the project, or unit thereof, and \1/40\th of such 
per acre additional construction cost thus determined shall be assessed 
and collected annually from the non-Indian landowner of the project, or 
unit, thereof. The first installment shall be due and payable on 
November 15 of the year following the completion of such additional 
construction work or, if such additional construction work on the 
project, or unit thereof, has been completed prior to July 1, 1957, and 
the per acre annual rate determined, the first installment of the 
additional construction cost to be repaid by such non-Indian landowners 
shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958. This annual per acre rate 
shall be in addition to, and run concurrently with, the per acre 
construction rate assessed annually under Sec. 134.4.
    (b) Project lands in Indian ownership are not subject to assessment 
for their proportionate share of the per acre construction cost of the 
project, or unit thereof, until after the Indian title to the land has 
been extinguished. At that time the total annual per acre assessment 
rate against non-Indian lands of the project, or unit thereof, shall be 
assessed against the former Indian lands for each and every acre of 
irrigable land to which water can be delivered through the project 
works, beginning on November 15 of the year following the extinguishment 
of the Indian title to the land and on November 15 of each year 
thereafter over a forty year period. In cases where the Indian title to 
project land was extinguished prior to July 1, 1957, the assessment

[[Page 381]]

rate shall be due and payable on November 15, 1958.


<R05>
Sec. 134.5  Payments to disbursing officer.

    Payments under this part shall be made to the disbursing officer for 
the supervising engineer of the Indian Irrigation Service having 
jurisdiction over the irrigation system under which the land for which 
payment is made may lie. The sum so collected will then, after proper 
credit has been made to the land for which collected, be deposited in 
the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the respective funds 
used in constructing irrigation systems toward which reimbursement shall 
have been made.


<R05>
Sec. 134.6  ``Owner'' defined.

    The word ``owner'' as used in this part shall be construed to 
include any person, Indian or white, or any firm, partnership, 
corporation, association, or other organization to whom title to the 
land capable of irrigation, as provided in the act of February 14, 1920 
(41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386), has passed, either by fee or trust 
patent, or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 134.7  Modifications.

    The act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 386a), cancelled 
all irrigation assessments for construction costs against lands in 
Indian ownership which were unpaid at that date and deferred all future 
assessments for construction costs until the Indian title to the land 
shall have been extinguished.

Stat. 333-338), contracts were executed June 28, 1951, by the United 
States with the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District 
and the Upper Little Horn Irrigation District providing for the payment, 
over a period of 40 years, by each of the Districts of its respective 
share of the sum of $210,726 expended for the construction of the Willow 
Creek storage works on account of non-Indian lands within the Districts 
entitled to share in the storage water, directly or by substitution.


<R05>
Sec. 135.2  Annual rate of assessments.

    Within the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District 
there are 3,196.8 acres for which the District is obligated by contract 
to pay its proper share of the total construction costs. Within the 
Upper Little Horn Irrigation District there are 1,554.7 acres for which 
the District is obligated by contract to pay its proper share of the 
total construction costs. There are 3,237.6 acres, more or less, covered 
by contracts with private landowners, obligating such owners to pay 
their proper share of such construction costs. The total per acre charge 
against all such lands is $26.38. This amounts to an annual per acre 
rate of $0.6595. For the purpose of this notice the annual per acre rate 
is hereby fixed at $0.66. This annual per acre rate of assessment will 
continue for a 40-year period within which the total amount of 
construction costs of $210,726 is to be repaid without

[[Page 382]]

interest. The amount of each annual installment chargeable against each 
of the Districts for the acreage covered by their respective contracts 
shall be determined by multiplying the total acreage, under each 
contract entitled to Willow Creek storage rights, either directly or by 
subsituation, by the per acre annual rate.


<R05>
Sec. 135.3  Annual assessments.

    Notice is hereby given of an annual assessment of $2,108.05 to be 
repaid by the Lower Little Horn and Lodge Grass Irrigation District for 
the 3,196.8 acres of irrigable land of the District, and an annual 
assessment of $1,025.06 to be repaid by the Upper Little Horn Irrigation 
District for the 1,554.7 acres of irrigable land of the District. 
Against the amounts due annually by the Districts under this notice, 
there shall be allowed any credits due under section 6 of the act of 
June 28, 1946. Credits due on behalf of any land shall be reflected by 
the respective Districts when placing against such land the annual 
assessment on the tax rolls.


<R05>

Sec. 135.20  Private contract lands; assessments.

    In addition to 4,751.5 acres of non-Indian land included within the 
two irrigation Districts dealt with in subpart A, there are 3,237.6 
acres of land, more or less, in non-Indian ownership under private 
ditches, covered by repayment contracts executed pursuant to the act of 
June 28, 1946 (60 Stat. 333-338), obligating such owners to pay their 
proper share of such construction costs. The total per acre charge 
against all such lands is $26.38. This amounts to an annual per acre 
rate of $0.6595. For the purposes of this notice the annual per acre 
rate is hereby fixed at $0.66. This annual rate of assessment will 
continue for a 40-year period within which the total amount of 
construction cost of $210,726 is to be repaid without interest. The

<R05>
Sec. 136.1  Repayment contracts.

    A rehabilitation program was established on the Fort Hall Unit of 
the Fort Hall Project in 1936. Based upon the estimated construction 
costs, contracts were signed by all non-Indian landowners within the 
project, including such landowners within the Little Indian Unit, now a 
part of the Fort Hall Unit. Under the terms of their contracts, the 
landowners agreed to repay to the Government their pro rata share, on an 
acreage basis, of all expenditures for construction and other necessary 
improvements for carrying out the approved program, payments not to 
exceed $7.50 per acre, based upon an estimated expenditure of 
$450,000.00 for a project then considered as covering approximately 
60,000 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 136.2  Construction costs.

    The program of rehabilitation has now been completed at a cost of 
$419,186.52. This amount, chargeable on an equal per acre basis against 
60,000 acres, amounts to a rate of $6.986 per acre, which rate is hereby 
determined to be the per acre cost to be repaid to the United States 
under the 1936 contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 136.3  Repayment of construction costs.

    Under the terms of the contracts, the landowners agreed to repay the 
construction cost in forty (40) equal annual installments. Therefore, 
the annual per acre installment is hereby fixed at seventeen and one-
half cents (17\1/2\ cents) per acre, due and payable on December 1st of 
each year, the first payment being due on December 1, 1955. Under 
section 4 of the repayment contracts of the landowners and the act of 
March 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 210), the charges remain a lien against the 
lands until paid.

Sec. 137.1  Water supply.

    The engineering report dealt with in section 1 of the act of June 7, 
1924 (43 Stat. 475) and other available records show that the storage 
capacity of the San Carlos reservoir created by the Coolidge Dam and the 
water supply therefor over a period of years will provide for the 
irrigation of only 80,000 acres of lands in Indian and public or private 
ownership within the San Carlos irrigation project, the balance of the 
water supply needed for the additional 20,000 acres of the project to be 
provided for by recaptured and return flow water and by means of pumping 
the underground supply. The cost of providing the proposed supply and of 
operating the works for this latter acreage to be equally distributed 
over the entire 100,000 acres of the project regardless of where the 
works are placed and operated.

[[Page 384]]


<R05>
Sec. 137.2  Availability of water.

    Pursuant to section 3 of the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 475), 
requiring the Secretary of the Interior by public notice to announce 
when water is actually available for lands in private ownership under 
the project and the amount of the construction charges per irrigable 
acre against the same which charges shall be payable in annual 
installments as provided for therein, this public notice, of which Sec. 
137.1 is made a part hereof, is hereby given:
    The date when a reasonable water supply is actually available for 
lands in private ownership under the San Carlos irrigation project is 
hereby declared to be the 1st day of December 1932.


<R05>
Sec. 137.3  Construction charges.

    Each acre of land in private ownership of said project is hereby 
charged with $95.25 of construction cost assessable thereto at the date 
hereof (Dec. 1, 1932), which sum is based upon 50,000 acres of such 
privately owned lands, making a total charge or assessment due from the 
owners thereof of $4,762,250 on this date (Dec. 1, 1932), excluding the 
cost of operation and maintenance for the calendar year of 1933 which 
may be carried into construction cost as provided for by section 3 of 
the act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), and also excluding interest at 
the rate of 4 percent which is charged against such lands by said act. 
Of the 50,000 acres constituting the lands in private ownership within 
the said project only 46,107.49 acres have at this date (Dec. 1, 1932) 
actually been designated as coming within the project. Should this 
present designated area be not increased within a reasonable time 
herefrom and prior to the due date of the first installment of the 
charge fixed in this section, namely, on December 1, 1935, so as to 
bring the total designated area up to the 50,000 acres, the per acre 
charge fixed in this section shall be proportionately increased against 
the then designated area so as to assure reimbursement of the total 
indebtedness due the Government by the owners of the lands in private 
ownership from the lesser designated acreage.


<R05>
Sec. 137.4  Future charges.

    The payment of said construction cost and costs of future operation

act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), as supplemented or amended and such 
contingent project liabilities which may be incurred in accordance with 
the provisions of said repayment contract shall be made in accordance 
with the provisions of said act of June 7, 1924, as supplemented or 
amended and the repayment contract by and between the San Carlos 
irrigation and drainage district and the Secretary of the Interior 
bearing date of June 8, 1931; the said construction cost incurred 
subsequent to this public notice assessable against the lands in private 
ownership and costs of operation and maintenance assessed against such 
privately owned lands within the project for the first year after this 
public notice to be included in the construction cost and such 
contingent project liabilities which may be incurred in accordance with 
provisions of the repayment contract shall also be repaid to the 
Government pursuant to the terms of said act of June 7, 1924, as 
supplemented or amended, and the repayment contract and this public 
notice.


<R05>
Sec. 137.5  Construction costs limited.

drainage district, page 13 thereof, contains the following:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Contract available at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington, 
D.C.

    In accordance with the foregoing the costs of the San Carlos project 
as fixed by the public notice to be issued as aforesaid, unless further 
sums shall be agreed to by the Secretary of the Interior and the 
district after the execution of this instrument, may amount to but shall 
not exceed the sum of $9,556,313.77, except that said total may be 
exceeded by the inclusion of any sums expended to safeguard the project 
as hereinabove provided for, and any sums expended on account of 
contingent liabilities as in the next paragraph hereof provided.
    The foregoing and subsequent statements of project costs, the 
district's shares of which are to be repaid hereunder, unless otherwise 
provided by Congress more favorably to the lands of the project, may be 
increased

[[Page 385]]

by the addition of sums not now fixed as project charges but which 
possibly constitute contingent project liabilities incurred after the 
date of the San Carlos Act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 476), or incurred 
on account of the Florence-casa Grande project, and so may become 
project charges by the judgment of courts of competent jurisdiction or 
of other proper authority.
    The limitations therein fixed has approximately been reached, there 
remaining but $32,815.02 yet to be expended on project works before 
reaching that limitation. Upon the expenditure of this additional sum 
there shall be no further expenditures of funds for construction, 
operation and maintenance of the San Carlos project so far as the 
private lands are concerned until the San Carlos irrigation and drainage 
district shall, through appropriate action, authorize pursuant to the 
terms of the said repayment contract such additional expenditures. This 
limitation does not apply to project expenditures for the extension of 
the distributing and pumping system regardless of where they may arise. 
This class of expenditures being excepted from the limitation on 
expenditures contained in the said repayment contract by section 14, 
page 10, thereof, which section is known as the ``Equalization of 
Expenditures.''

power development shall be disposed of as required by the terms and 
conditions of the act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210) as supplemented or 
amended.


<R05>
Sec. 137.7  Private ownership defined.

all lands of the San Carlos irrigation project that have or may be 
designated by the Secretary of the Interior that are situated outside of 
the boundaries of the Gila River Indian Reservation.


<R05>
Sec. 137.8  Indian lands excluded.

    This public notice, with the exception of that part dealing with 
payment in advance each year of operation and maintenance charges 
against lands in Indian ownership operated under lease, does not apply 
in so far as payments are concerned to Indian lands within the project. 
The act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 386a) defers the 
collection of construction costs from Indian owned lands so long as the 
title to such lands remains in the Indian ownership.

Sec. 139.1  Construction costs and assessable acreage.

    The construction program has been completed on the Wapato-Satus Unit 
of the Wapato Indian Irrigation Project, and the construction costs have 
been established by Designation Report dated August 1962 as 
$7,903,823.12 for the project and $1,499,073.62 for the ``B'' lands 
share of the construction costs in the Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs 
on the Yakima River. The area benefited by this development has been 
established at 136,559.59 acres divided into 79,025.68 acres of ``A'' 
land and 57,533.91 acres of ``B'' land. Under the requirements of the 
acts of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409), and March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 
210), these costs are to be repaid to the U.S. Treasury by the owners of 
the lands benefited.


<R05>
Sec. 139.2  Repayment of construction costs.

    The cost per acre of the construction under Sec. 139.1 is, 
therefore, calculated at $57.8782 for ``A'' lands and $83.9337 for ``B'' 
lands in non-Indian ownership as established by Designation Report dated 
August 1962. Under the provisions of the acts cited in Sec. 139.1 the 
annual per acre assessment for forty equal annual payments, is hereby 
fixed at $1.45 per acre for ``A'' lands and $2.10 per acre for ``B''

establish rates and conditions for users of the Alaska Resupply 
Operation is delegated to the Area Director.
    (a) The Manager must develop a tariff that establishes rates and 
conditions for charging users.
    (1) The tariff must be approved by the Area Director.
    (2) The tariff must be published on or before March 1 of each year.
    (3) The tariff must not be altered, amended, or published more 
frequently than once each year, except in an extreme emergency.
    (4) The tariff must be published, circulated and posted throughout 
Alaska, particularly in the communities commonly and historically served 
by the resupply operation.
    (b) The tariff must include standard freight categories and rate 
structures

[[Page 408]]

that are recognized within the industry, as well as any appropriate 
specialized warehouse, handling and storage charges.
    (c) The tariff must specify rates for return cargo and cargo hauled 
between ports.
    (1) The rates and conditions for the Bureau, other Federal agencies, 
the State of Alaska and its subsidiaries must be the same as that for 
Native entities.
    (2) Different rates and conditions may be established for non-Indian 
and non-Native commercial establishments, if those establishments do not 
meet the standard in Sec. 142.4(c) and no other service is available to 
that location.


<R05>
Sec. 142.6  How are the rates and conditions for the Alaska Resupply

Operation established?

    The Manager must develop tariff rates using the best modeling 
techniques available to ensure the most economical service to the Alaska 
Natives, Indian or Native owned businesses, profit or nonprofit Alaska 
Native corporations, Native cooperatives or organizations, or such other 
groups or individuals as may be sponsored by any Native or Indian 
organization, without enhancing the Federal treasury.
    (a) The Area Director's approval of the tariff constitutes a final 
action for the Department for the purpose of establishing billing rates.
    (b) The Bureau must issue a supplemental bill to cover excess cost 
in the event that the actual cost of a specific freight substantially 
exceeds the tariff price.
    (c) If the income from the tariff substantially exceeds actual 
costs, a prorated payment will be issued to the shipper.


<R05>
Sec. 142.7  How are transportation and scheduling determined?

    (a) The Manager must arrange the most economical and efficient 
transportation available, taking into consideration lifestyle, timing 
and other needs of the user. Where practical, shipping must be by 
consolidated shipment that takes advantage of economies of scale and 
consider geographic disparity and distribution of sites.
    (b) Itineraries and scheduling for all deliveries must be in keeping 
with the needs of the users to the maximum extent possible. Planned 
itineraries with dates set as to the earliest and latest anticipated 
delivery dates must be provided to users prior to final commitment by 
them to utilize the transportation services. Each shipping season the 
final departure and arrival schedules must be distributed prior to the 
commencement of deliveries.


<R05>
Sec. 142.8  Is economy of operation a requirement for the Alaska Resupply Operation?

    Yes. The Manager must ensure that purchasing, warehousing and 
transportation services utilize the most economical delivery. This may 
be accomplished by memoranda of agreement, formal contracts, or 
cooperative arrangements. Whenever possible joint arrangements for 
economy will be entered into with other Federal agencies, the State of 
Alaska, Alaska Native cooperatives or other entities providing services 
to rural Alaska communities.


<R05>
Sec. 142.9  How are orders accepted?

similar instrument.
    (b) The Seattle Support Center must prepare proper manifests of the 
freight accepted at the facility or other designated location. The

contract of carriage is executed, upon which payment can be exacted upon 
the successful delivery of the goods and services.


<R05>
Sec. 142.10  How is freight to be prepared?

    All freight must be prepared in accordance with industry standards, 
unless otherwise specified, for overseas shipment, including any pickup, 
delivery, staging, sorting, consolidating, packaging, crating, boxing, 
containerizing, and marking that may be deemed necessary by the Manager.

[[Page 409]]

Collection Standards, and other like acts apply to the Alaska Resupply 
Operation.
    (b) Payment for all goods purchased and freight or other services 
rendered by the Seattle Support Center are due and payable upon final 
receipt of the goods or services. If payment is not received within the 
time specified on the billing document, interest and penalty fees at the 
current treasury rate will be charged, and handling and administrative 
fees may be applied.
    (c) Where fuel and other goods are purchased on behalf of commercial 
enterprises, payment for those goods must be made within 30 days of 
delivery to the Seattle Support Center Warehouse. Payment for freight 
must be made within 30 days from receipt of the goods by the shipper.


<R05>
Sec. 142.12  What is the liability of the United States for loss or damage?

    (a) The liability of the United States for any loss or damage to, or 
non-delivery of freight is limited by 46 U.S.C. 746 and the Carriage of 
Goods by Sea Act (46 U.S.C. 1300 et seq.). The terms of such limitation 
of liability must be contained in any document of title relating to the 
carriage of goods by sea. This liability may be further restricted in 
specialized instances as specified in the tariff.
    (b) In addition to the standards of conduct and ethics applicable to 
all government employees, the employees of the Seattle Support Center 
shall not conduct any business with, engage in trade with, or accept any 
gifts or items of value from any shipper or permittee.
    (c) The Seattle Support Center will continue to function only as 
long as the need for assistance to Native village economies exits. To 
that end, a review of the need for the serve must be conducted every 
five years.

Affairs to allow access to land records and title documents unless such 
access would violate the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a or other law 
restricting access to such records, or there are strong policy grounds 
for denying access where such access is not required by the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. It shall be the policy of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs that, unless specifically authorized, monetary 
considerations will not be disclosed insofar as leases of tribal land 
are concerned.
    (b) Before disclosing information concerning any living individual, 
the Manager, Land Titles and Records Office, shall consult 5 U.S.C. 
552a(b) and the notice of routine users then in effect to determine 
whether the information may be released without the written consent of 
the person to whom it pertains.

approved and such order issued by the Secretary, in his discretion, if 
he determines that the applicant is competent or that removal of 
restrictions is in the best interests of the Indian owner. The effect of 
the order will be to remove the restrictions from the land described 
therein.
    (b) If the application is denied, the applicant will be notified in 
writing, given the reasons therefor and advised of his right to appeal 
pursuant to the provisions of part 2 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 152.12  Removal of restrictions, Five Civilized Tribes, after

application under authority other than section 2(a) of the Act of August 11, 1955.

    When an Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes makes application for 
removal of restrictions from his restricted lands under authority other 
than section 2(a) of the Act of August 11, 1955 (69 Stat. 666), such 
application may be for either unconditional removal of restrictions or 
conditional removal of restrictions, but shall not include lands or 
interest in lands acquired by inheritance or devise.
    (a) If the application is for unconditional removal of restrictions 
and the Secretary, in his discretion, determines the applicant should 
have the unrestricted control of that land described in his application, 
the Secretary may issue an order removing restrictions therefrom.
    (b) When the Secretary, in his discretion, finds that in the best 
interest of the applicant all or part of the land described in the 
application should be sold with conditions concerning terms of sale and 
disposal of the proceeds, the Secretary may issue a conditional order 
removing restrictions which shall be effective only and simultaneously 
with the execution of a deed by said applicant upon completion of an 
advertised sale or negotiated sale acceptable to the Secretary.

Sec. 152.13  Removal of restrictions, Five Civilized Tribes, after 

application under section 2(a) of the Act of August 11, 1955.

    When an Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes makes application for 
removal of restrictions under authority of section 2(a) of the Act of 
August 11, 1955 (69 Stat. 666), the Secretary will determine the 
competency of the applicant.
    (a) If the Secretary determines the applicant to be competent, he 
shall issue an order removing restrictions having the effect stated in 
Sec. 152.16.
    (b) If the Secretary rejects the application, his action is not 
subject to administrative appeal, notwithstanding the provisions 
concerning appeals in part 2 of this chapter.
    (c) If the Secretary rejects the application, or neither rejects nor 
approves the application within 90 days of the application date, the 
applicant may apply to the State district court in the county in which 
he resides for an order removing restrictions. If that State district 
court issues such order, it will have the effect stated in Sec. 152.16.


<R05>
Sec. 152.14  Removal of restrictions, Five Civilized Tribes, without application.

    Section 2(b) of the Act of August 11, 1955 (69 Stat. 666), 
authorizes the Secretary to issue an order removing restrictions to an 
Indian of the Five Civilized Tribes without application therefor. When 
the Secretary determines an Indian to be competent, he shall notify the 
Indian in writing of his intent to issue an order removing restrictions 
30 days after the date of the notice. This decision may be appealed 
under the provisions of part 2 of this chapter within such 30 days. All 
administrative appeals under that part will postpone the issuance of the 
order. When the decision is not appealed within 30 days after the date 
of notice, or when any dismissal of an appeal is not appealed within the 
prescribed time limit, or when the final appeal is dismissed, an order 
removing restrictions will be issued.


<R05>
Sec. 152.15  Judicial review of removal of restrictions, Five Civilized Tribes, without application.

    When an order removing restrictions is issued, pursuant to Sec. 
152.14, a copy of such order will be delivered to the Indian, to any 
person acting in his behalf, and to the Board of County Commissioners 
for the county in which the Indian resides. At the time the order is 
delivered written notice will be given the parties that under the terms 
of the Act of August 11, 1955 (69 Stat. 666), the Indian or the Board of 
County Commissioners has, within 6 months of the date of notification, 
the right to appeal to the State district court for the district in 
which the Indian resides for an order setting aside the order removing 
restrictions. The timely initiation of proceedings in the State district 
court will stay the effective date of the order removing restrictions 
until such proceedings are concluded. If the State district court 
dismisses the appeal, the order removing restrictions will become 
effective 6 months after notification to the parties of such dismissal. 
The effect of the issuance of such order will be as prescribed in Sec. 
152.16.


<R05>
Sec. 152.16  Effect of order removing restrictions, Five Civilized Tribes.

    An order removing restrictions issued pursuant to the Act of August 
11, 1955 (69 Stat. 666), on its effective date shall serve to remove all 
jurisdiction and supervision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs over money 
and property held by the United States in trust for the individual 
Indian or held subject to restrictions against alienation imposed by the 
United States. The Secretary shall cause to be turned over to the Indian 
full ownership and control of such money and property and issue in the 
case of land such title document as may be appropriate: Provided, That 
the Secretary may make such provisions as he deems necessary to insure 
payment of money loaned to any such Indian by the Federal Government or 
by an Indian tribe; And provided further, That the interest of any 
lessee or permittee in any lease, contract, or permit that is 
outstanding when an order removing restrictions becomes effective shall 
be preserved as provided in section 2(d) of the Act of August 11, 1955 
(69 Stat. 666).

[[Page 424]]

tribe, lands owned by a tribe with Federal restrictions against

<R05>
Sec. 152.23  Applications for sale, exchange or gift.

    Applications for the sale, exchange or gift of trust or restricted

case, the transaction appears to be clearly justified in the light of 
the long-range best interest of the owner or owners or as under 
conditions set out in Sec. 152.25(d).


<R05>
Sec. 152.24  Appraisal.

    Except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, an appraisal shall be 
made indicating the fair market value prior to making or approving a 
sale, exchange, or other transfer of title of trust or restricted land.


<R05>
Sec. 152.25  Negotiated sales, gifts and exchanges of trust or restricted lands.

    Those sales, exchanges, and gifts of trust or restricted lands

advertised sale, except as may be otherwise provided by the Secretary.
    (a) Consideration not less than the appraised fair market value. 
Indian owners may, with the approval of the Secretary, negotiate a sale 
of and sell trust or restricted land for not less than the appraised 
fair market value:
    (1) When the sale is to the United States, States, or political 
subdivisions thereof, or such other sale as may be for a public purpose;
    (2) When the sale is to the tribe or another Indian; or
    (3) When the Secretary determines it is impractical to advertise.
    (b) Exchange at appraised fair market value. With the approval of 
the Secretary, Indian owners may exchange trust or restricted land, or a 
combination of such land and other things of value, for other lands or 
combinations of land and other things of value. The value of the 
consideration received by the Indian in the exchange must be at least 
substantially equal to the appraised fair market value of the 
consideration given by him.
    (c) Sale to coowners. With the approval of the Secretary, Indian 
owners may negotiate a sale of and sell trust or restricted land to a 
coowner of that land. The consideration may be less than the appraised 
fair market value, if in the opinion of the Secretary there is a special 
relationship between the coowners or special circumstances exist.
    (d) Gifts and conveyances for less than the appraised fair market 
value. With the approval of the Secretary, Indian owners may convey 
trust or restricted land, for less than the appraised fair market value 
or for no consideration when the prospective grantee is the owner's 
spouse, brother, sister, lineal ancestor of Indian blood or lineal 
descendant, or when some other special relationship exists between the 
grantor and grantee or special circumstances exist that in the opinion 
of the Secretary warrant the approval of the conveyance.


<R05>
Sec. 152.26  Advertisement.

    (a) Upon approval of an application for an advertised sale, notice 
of the sale will be published not less than 30 days prior to the date

subject and any restrictions and encumbrances of record with the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs and any other information that may improve sale 
prospects.

[[Page 425]]


<R05>
Sec. 152.27  Procedure of sale.

    Advertised sales shall be by sealed bids except as otherwise 
provided herein.
    (a)(1) Bids, conforming to the requirements set out in the 
advertisement of sale, along with a certified check, cashier's check, 
money order, or U.S. Treasury check, payable to the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, for not less than 10 percent of the amount of the bid, must be 
enclosed in a sealed envelope marked as prescribed in the notice of 
sale. A cash deposit may be submitted in lieu of the above-specified 
negotiable instruments at the bidder's risk. Tribes submitting bids 
pursuant to this paragraph may guarantee the required 10 percent deposit 
by an appropriate resolution;
    (2) The sealed envelopes containing the bids will be publicly opened 
at the time fixed for sale. The bids will be announced and will be 
appropriately recorded.
    (b) The policy of the Secretary recognizes that in many instances a 
tribe or a member thereof has a valid interest in acquiring trust or 
restricted lands offered for sale.
    (1) With the consent of the owner and when the notice of sale so 
states, the tribe or members of such tribe shall have the right to meet 
the high bid.
    (2) Provided the tribe is not the high bidder and when one or more 
acceptable sealed bids are received and when so stated in the notice of 
sale, an oral auction may be held following the bid opening. Bidding in 
the auction will be limited to the tribe, and to those who submitted 
sealed bids at 75 percent or more of the appraised value of the land 
being auctioned. At the conclusion of the auction the highest bidder 
must increase his deposit to not less than 10 percent of his auction 
bid.


<R05>
Sec. 152.28  Action at close of bidding.

    (a) The officer in charge of the sale shall publicly announce the 
apparent highest acceptable bid. The deposits submitted by the 
unsuccessful bidders shall be returned immediately. The deposit 
submitted by the apparent successful bidder shall be held in a special 
account.
    (b) If the highest bid received at an advertised sale is less than 
the appraised fair market value of the land, the Secretary with the 
consent of the owner may accept that bid if the amount bid approximates 
said appraised fair market value and in the Secretary's judgment is the 
highest price that may be realized in the circumstances.
    (c) The Secretary shall award the bid and notify the apparent 
successful bidder that the remainder of the purchase price must be 
submitted within 30 days.
    (1) Upon a showing of cause the Secretary may, in his discretion, 
extend the time of payment of the balance due.
    (2) If the remainder of the purchase price is not paid within the 
time allowed, the bid will be rejected and the apparent successful 
bidder's 10 percent deposit will be forfeited to the landowner's use.
    (d) The issuance of the patent or delivery of a deed to the 
purchaser will not be authorized until the balance of the purchase price 
has been paid, except that the fee patent may be ordered in cases where 
the purchaser is obtaining a loan from an agency of the Federal 
Government and such agency has given the Secretary a commitment that the 
balance of the purchase price will be paid when the fee patent is 
issued.


<R05>
Sec. 152.29  Rejection of bids; disapproval of sale.

    The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all bids before 
the award, after the award, or at any time prior to the issuance of a 
patent or delivery of a deed, when he shall have determined such 
rejection to be in the best interests of the Indian owner.


<R05>
Sec. 152.30  Bidding by employees.

    Except as authorized by the provisions of part 140 of this chapter, 
no person employed in Indian Affairs shall directly or indirectly bid, 
make, or prepare any bid, or assist any bidder in preparing his bid. 
Sales between Indians, either of whom is an employee of the U.S. 
Government, are governed by the provisions of part 140 of this chapter 
(see 25 U.S.C. 68 and 441).

[[Page 426]]


<R05>
Sec. 152.31  Cost of conveyance; payment.

    Pursuant to the Act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 415), as amended 
by the Act of March 1, 1933 (47 Stat. 1417; 25 U.S.C. 413), the 
Secretary may in his discretion collect from a purchaser reasonable fees 
for work performed or expense incurred in the transaction. The amount so 
collected shall be deposited to the credit of the United States as 
general fund receipts, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (a)(1) The amount of the fee shall be $22.50 for each transaction.
    (2) The fee may be reduced to a lesser amount or may be waived, if 
the Secretary determines circumstances justify such action.
    (b)(1) If any or all of the costs of the work performed or expenses 
incurred are paid with tribal funds, an alternate schedule of fees may 
be established, subject to approval of the Secretary, and that part of 
such fees deemed appropriate may be credited to the tribe.
    (2) When the purchaser is the tribe which bears all or any part of 
such costs, the collection of the proportionate share from the tribe may 
be waived.


<R05>
Sec. 152.32  Irrigation fee; payment.

    Collection of all construction costs against any Indian-owned lands 
within Indian irrigation projects is deferred as long as Indian title 
has not been extinguished. (Act of July 1, 1932 (47 Stat. 564; 25 U.S.C. 
386a)). This statute is interpreted to apply only where such land is 
owned by Indians either in trust or restricted status.
    (a) When any person whether Indian or non-Indian acquires Indian 
lands in a fee simple status that are part of an Indian irrigation 
project he must enter into an agreement,
    (1) To pay the pro rata share of the construction of the project 
chargeable to the land,
    (2) To pay all construction costs that accrue in the future, and
    (3) To pay all future charges assessable to the land which are based 
on the annual cost of operation and maintenance of the irrigation 
system.
    (b) Any operation and maintenance charges that are delinquent when 
Indian land is sold will be deducted from the proceeds of sale unless 
other acceptable arrangements are made to provide for their payment 
prior to the approval of the sale.
    (c) A lien clause covering all unpaid irrigation construction costs, 
past and future, will be inserted in the patent or other instrument of 
conveyance issued to all purchasers of restricted or trust lands that 
are under an Indian irrigation project.

    Cross Reference: See part 159 and part 160 and cross-references 
thereunder in this chapter for further regulations regarding sale of 
irrigable lands.

               Partitions in Kind of Inherited Allotments


<R05>
Sec. 152.33  Partition.

    (a) Partition without application. If the Secretary of the Interior 
shall find that any inherited trust allotment or allotments (as 
distinguished from lands held in a restricted fee status or authorized 
to be sold under the Act of May 14, 1948 (62 Stat. 236; 25 U.S.C. 483)), 
are capable of partition in kind to the advantage of the heirs, he may 
cause such lands to be partitioned among them, regardless of their 
competency, patents in fee to be issued to the competent heirs for their 
shares and trust patents to be issued to the incompetent heirs for the 
lands respectively or jointly set apart to them, the trust period to 
terminate in accordance with the terms of the original patent or order 
of extension of the trust period set out in said patent. (Act of May 18, 
1916 (39 Stat. 127; 25 U.S.C. 378)). The authority contained in the Act 
of May 18, 1916, is not applicable to lands authorized to be sold by the 
Act of May 14, 1948, nor to land held in restricted fee status.
    (b) Application for partition. Heirs of a deceased allottee may make 
written application, in the form approved by the Secretary, for 
partition of their trust or restricted land. If the Secretary finds the 
trust lands susceptible of partition, he may issue new patents or deeds 
to the heirs for the portions set aside to them. If the allotment is 
held under a restricted fee title (as distinguished from a trust title), 
partition

[[Page 427]]

may be accomplished by the heirs executing deeds approved by the 
Secretary, to the other heirs for their respective portions.

         Mortgages and Deeds of Trust To Secure Loans to Indians


<R05>
Sec. 152.34  Approval of mortgages and deeds of trust.

    Any individual Indian owner of trust or restricted lands, may with 
the approval of the Secretary execute a mortgage or deed of trust to his 
land. Prior to approval of such mortgage or deed of trust, the Secretary 
shall secure appraisal information as he deems advisable. Such lands 
shall be subject to foreclosure or sale pursuant to the terms of the 
mortgage or deed of trust in accordance with the laws of the State in 
which the lands are located. For the purpose of foreclosure or sale 
proceedings under this section, the Indian owners shall be regarded as 
vested with unrestricted fee simple title to the lands (Act of March 29, 
1956).

(70 Stat. 62; 25 U.S.C. 483a)


<R05>
Sec. 152.35  Deferred payment sales.

    When the Indian owner and purchaser desire, a sale may be made or 
approved on the deferred payment plan. The terms of the sale will be 
incorporated in a memorandum of sale which shall constitute a contract 
for delivery of title upon payment in full of the amount of the agreed 
consideration. The deed executed by the grantor or grantors will be held 
by the Superintendent and will be delivered only upon full compliance 
with the terms of sale. If conveyance of title is to be made by fee 
patent, request therefor will be made only upon full compliance with the 
terms of the sale. The terms of the sale shall require that the 
purchaser pay not less than 10 percent of the purchase price in advance 
as required by the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 855), as amended (25 
U.S.C. 372); terms for the payment of the remaining installments plus 
interest shall be those acceptable to the Secretary and the Indian 
owner. If the purchaser on any deferred payment plan makes default in 
the first or subsequent payments, all payments, including interest, 
previously made will be forfeited to the Indian owner.

<R05>
Sec. 158.54  Exchanges of restrictive lands.

    Upon written application of the Indians involved, the exchange of 
restricted lands between adult Indians, and between adult Indians and 
non-Indians, may be approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or his 
authorized representative. Title to all lands acquired under this part 
by an Indian who does not have a certificate of competency shall be 
taken by deed containing a clause restricting alienation or encumbrance 
without the consent of the Secretary, or his authorized representative. 
In case of differences in the appraised value of lands under 
consideration for exchange, the application of an Indian for funds to 
equalize such differences may be approved to the extent authorized by 
Sec. 117.8 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 158.55  Institution of partition proceedings.

    (a) Prior authorization should be obtained from the Secretary, or

description of the lands involved, the names of the several owners and 
their respective interests and the reasons for such court action. 
Authorization may be given for the institution of partition proceedings

exchange deeds is impracticable.
    (b) When it appears to the best interest of the Indians to do so, 
the Secretary's, or his authorized representative's, authorization to 
institute partition proceedings may require that title to the lands be 
quieted in the partition action in order that the deeds issued pursuant 
to the proceedings shall convey good and merchantable title to the 
grantee therein. (See section 6, 37 Stat. 87.)


<R05>

description on all instruments vesting title. When a grantee is a member 
of the Osage Tribe who has not received a certificate of competency, 
deeds or other instruments vesting title shall contain the following 
clause against alienation:

    Subject to the condition that while title to the above-described 
lands shall remain in the grantee or his Osage Indian heirs or devisees 
who do not have certificates of competency, the same shall not be 
alienated or encumbered without approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior or his authorized representative.


<R05>
Sec. 158.57  Approval of deeds or other instruments vesting title on

partition and payment of costs.

    Upon completion of the partition proceedings in accordance with the

or his authorized representative, may approve the deeds, or other 
instruments vesting title on partition, and may disburse from the 
restricted (accounts) funds of the Indians concerned, such amounts as 
may be necessary for payment of their share of court costs, attorney 
fees, and owelty moneys.


<R05>
Sec. 158.58  Disposition of proceeds of partition sales.

    Owelty moneys due members of the Osage Tribe who do not have

of this chapter. For general regulations pertaining to the issuance of 
patents in fee, see part 152 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 159.1  Conditions of contract.

    (a) The form of contract (Form 5-462b) \1\ for sale of irrigable 
lands specifically provides that the purchaser will obligate and pay on 
a per acre basis all irrigation charges assessed or to be assessed 
against the land purchased including accrued assessment, which accrued 
assessment shall be paid prior to the approval of the sale, and for the 
payment of the construction and operation and maintenance assessments on 
the due dates of each year. The agreement is to be acknowledged and 
recorded in the county records in which county the land is situated. The 
charges incidental to the recording of the instrument shall be paid by 
the purchaser at the time of executing the agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Forms may be obtained from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
Washington, D.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) A strict compliance with the terms of paragraph (a) of this 
section is absolutely necessary and required.

(Secs. 1, 3, 36 Stat. 270, 272, as amended; 25 U.S.C. 385. Interprets or 
applies sec. 1, 41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386)

[22 FR 10566, Dec. 24, 1957. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]
    Note: On May 12, 1921, Circular No. 1677, re sale of irrigable 
lands, was addressed to all superintendents. It was pointed out therein 
that the collection of irrigation construction charges was required by 
the terms of an act approved February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 
386), and that in addition to the construction charge there was an 
operation and maintenance charge assessable annually that must be paid 
by the landowners benefited; furthermore, that the purpose of this 
circular was to point out to the superintendents the necessity of 
advising prospective purchasers that irrigation charges must be paid and 
that a so-called paid-up water right was not conveyed with the land. A 
form of agreement to be executed by the prospective purchaser 
accompanied this circular.
    It has been brought to the attention of the Bureau that irrigation 
construction charges and operation and maintenance charges have accrued 
against irrigable allotments prior to the time of their being advertised 
for sale and that the superintendents have failed to provide for payment 
of the accrued irrigation charges, with the result that no means are 
apparent for their collection.
    With a view of preventing any future misunderstanding the form of 
contract accompanying Circular No. 1677 has been redrafted and Form 5-
462b assigned to it. The circular has been designated ``No. 1677a.''

<R05>
Sec. 160.1  Liens.

    The act of March 7, 1928 (45 Stat. 210; 25 U.S.C. 387) creates a 
first lien against irrigable lands under all Indian irrigation projects 
where the construction, operation and maintenance costs of such projects 
remain unpaid and are reimbursable, and directs that such lien shall be 
recited in any patent or instrument issued for such lands to cover such 
unpaid charges. Prior to the enactment of this legislation similar liens 
had been created by legislative authority against irrigable lands of the 
projects on the Fort Yuma, Colorado River, and Gila River Reservations, 
in Arizona; Blackfeet, Fort Peck, Flathead, Fort Belknap, and Crow 
Reservations, Mont.; Wapato project, Yakima Reservation, Wash.; the 
irrigable lands on the Colville Reservation within the West Okanogan 
irrigation district, Washington, and the Fort Hall Reservation, Idaho. 
This legislation, therefore, extends protection similar to that existing 
in the legislation applicable to the projects on the reservations above 
mentioned.

    Cross References: For operation and maintenance charges and 
construction costs, see parts 134 and 137 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 160.2  Instructions.

    All superintendents and other officers are directed to familiarize 
themselves with this provision of law, and in

[[Page 431]]

all cases involving the issuance of patents or deeds direct to the 
Indian or purchaser of Indian allotments embracing irrigable lands, they 
will recite in the papers forwarded to the Department for action the 
fact that the lands involved are within an irrigation project (giving 
the name) and accordingly are subject to the provisions of this law. 
This requirement will be in addition to the existing regulations 
requiring the superintendents in case of sales of irrigable lands to 
obtain from the project engineer a written statement relative to the 
irrigability of the lands to be sold, and whether or not there are any 
unpaid irrigation charges, together with the estimated per acre 
construction cost assessable against the land involved in the sale. Each 
sale will also be accompanied by contract executed in accordance with 
regulations obligating the purchaser to pay the accrued charges, namely, 
construction, operation, and maintenance, prior to the approval of the 
sale and to assume and pay the unassessed irrigation charges in 
accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the 
Interior.

    Cross References: For additional regulations pertaining to the 
payment of fees and charges in connection with the sale of irrigable 
lands, see part 159 and Sec. Sec. 134.4 and 152.21 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 160.3  Leases to include description of lands.

    It is important, also, for superintendents in leasing irrigable 
lands to present to the project engineer lists containing descriptions 
of the lands involved for his approval of the irrigable acreage and for 
checking as to whether or not such lands are in fact irrigable under 
existing works. Strict compliance with this section is required for the 
purpose of avoiding error.


<R05>
Sec. 160.4  Prompt payment of irrigation charges by lessees.

    Superintendents will also see that irrigation charges are promptly 
paid by lessees, and where such charges are not so paid take appropriate 
and prompt action for their collection. Such unpaid charges are a lien 
against the land, and accordingly any failure on the part of the 
superintendents to collect same increases the obligation against the 
land.

the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary 
corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time from the date 
on which the extension is granted.
    (c) If BIA cancels the permit, BIA will send the permittee and the 
District Grazing Committee a written notice of cancellation within 5 
business days of the decision. BIA will also provide actual or 
constructive notice of the cancellation to the Navajo Nation, as 
appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will:
    (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;
    (2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid fees and other 
financial obligations due under the permit;
    (3) Notify the permittee of his or her right to appeal under 25 CFR 
part 2 of this title, as modified by Sec. 161.607, including the amount 
of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the 
cancellation decision; and
    (4) Order the permittee to cease grazing livestock on the next 
anniversary date of the grazing permit or 180 days following the receipt 
of the written notice of cancellation, whichever is sooner.


<R05>
Sec. 161.607  What appeal bond provisions apply to permit cancellation decisions?

    (a) The appeal bond provisions in Sec. 2.5 of part 2 of this title 
will not apply to appeals from permit cancellation decision. Instead, 
when BIA decides to cancel a permit, BIA may require the permittee to 
post an appeal bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The 
requirement to post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the 
other requirements in part 2 of this title.
    (b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect 
the Navajo Nation against financial losses that will likely result from 
the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be 
separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the 
permit cancellation decision.

<R05>
Sec. 161.608  When will a permit cancellation be effective?

    A cancellation decision involving a permit will not be effective for 
30 days after the permittee receives a written notice of cancellation 
from BIA. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the 
permittee files an appeal under Sec. 161.607 and part 2 of this title, 
unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a 
cancellation decision is ineffective, the permittee must continue to 
comply with the other terms of the permit. If an appeal is not filed in 
accordance with Sec. 161.607 and part 2 of this title, the cancellation 
decision will be effective on the 31st day after the permittee receives 
the written notice of cancellation from BIA.


<R05>
Sec. 161.609  Can BIA take emergency action if the rangeland is threatened?

    Yes, if a permittee or any other party causes or threatens to cause 
immediate, significant and irreparable harm to the Navajo Nation land 
during the term of a permit, BIA will take appropriate emergency action. 
Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under subpart H, or 
judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity resulting in 
or threatening harm. Reasonable efforts will be made to notify the 
Navajo Nation, either before or after the emergency action is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 161.610  What will BIA do if livestock is not removed when a permit expires or is cancelled?

    If the livestock is not removed after the expiration or cancellation 
of a permit, BIA will treat the unauthorized use as a trespass. BIA may 
remove the livestock on behalf of the Navajo Nation, and pursue any 
additional remedies available under applicable law, including the 
assessment of civil penalties and costs under subpart H.

<R05>
Sec. 162.102  What land, or interests in land, are subject to these regulations?

    (a) These regulations apply to Indian land and Government land, 
including any tract in which an interest is owned by an individual 
Indian or tribe in trust or restricted status.
    (b) Where a life estate and remainder interest are both owned in 
trust or restricted status, the life estate and remainder interest must 
both be leased under these regulations, unless the lease is for less 
than one year in duration. Unless otherwise provided by the document 
creating the life estate or by agreement, rent payable under the lease 
must be paid to the life tenant under part 179 of this chapter.
    (c) In approving a lease under these regulations, we will not lease 
any fee interest in Indian land, nor will we collect rent on behalf of 
any fee owners. The leasing of the trust and restricted interests of the 
Indian landowners will not be conditioned on a lease having been 
obtained from the owners of any fee interests. Where all of the trust or 
restricted interests in a tract are subject to a life estate held in fee 
status, we will approve a lease of the remainder interests only if such 
action is necessary to preserve the value of the land or protect the 
interests of the Indian landowners.
    (d) These regulations do not apply to tribal land that is leased 
under a corporate charter issued by us pursuant to 25 U.S.C. Sec. 477, 
or under a special act of Congress authorizing leases without our 
approval under certain conditions, except to the extent that the 
authorizing statutes require us to enforce such leases on behalf of the 
Indian landowners.
    (e) To the extent any regulations in this part conflict with the 
Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, Public Law 106-462, 
the provisions of that Act will govern.


<R05>
Sec. 162.103  What types of land use agreements are covered by these regulations?

    (a) These regulations cover leases that authorize the possession of 
Indian land. These regulations do not apply to:
    (1) Mineral leases, prospecting permits, or mineral development 
agreements, as covered by parts 211, 212 and 225 of this chapter and 
similar parts specific parts specific to particular tribes;
    (2) Grazing permits, as covered by part 166 of this chapter and 
similar

[[Page 452]]

parts specific parts specific to particular tribes;
    (3) Timber contracts, as covered by part 163 of this chapter;
    (4) Management contracts, joint venture agreements, or other 
encumbrances of tribal land, as covered by 25 U.S.C. Sec. 81, as 
amended;
    (5) Leases of water rights associated with Indian land, except to 
the extent the use of such water rights is incorporated in a lease of 
the land itself; and
    (6) Easements or rights-of-way, as covered by part 169 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Where appropriate, the regulations in this part that 
specifically refer to leases will apply to permits that authorize the 
temporary, non-possessory use of Indian land or Government land, not 
including:
    (1) Land assignments and similar instruments authorizing temporary 
uses by tribal members, in accordance with tribal laws or custom; and
    (2) Trader's licenses issued under part 140 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 162.104  When is a lease needed to authorize possession of Indian Land?

    (a) An Indian landowner who owns 100% of the trust or restricted 
interests in a tract may take possession without a lease or any other 
prior authorization from us.
    (b) An Indian landowner of a fractional interest in a tract must 
obtain a lease of the other trust and restricted interests in the tract, 
under these regulations, unless the Indian co-owners have given the 
landowner's permission to take or continue in possession without a 
lease.
    (c) A parent or guardian of a minor child who owns 100% of the trust 
interests in the land may take possession without a lease. We may 
require that the parent or guardian provide evidence of a direct benefit 
to the minor child. When the child reaches the age of majority, a lease 
must be obtained under these regulations to authorize continued 
possession.
    (d) Any other person or legal entity, including an independent legal 
entity owned and operated by a tribe, must obtain a lease under these 
regulations before taking possession.


<R05>
Sec. 162.105  Can tracts with different Indian landowners be unitized 

for leasing purposes?

    (a) A lease negotiated by Indian landowners may cover more than one 
tract of Indian land, but the minimum consent requirements for leases 
granted by Indian landowners under subparts B through D of this part 
will apply to each tract separately. We may combine multiple tracts into 
a unit for leases negotiated or advertised by us, if we determine that 
unitization is in the Indian landowners' best interests and consistent 
with the efficient administration of the land.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided in the lease, the rent or other 
consideration derived from a unitized lease will be distributed based on 
the size of each landowner's interest in proportion to the acreage 
within the entire unit.


<R05>
Sec. 162.106  What will BIA do if possession is taken without an 

approved lease or other proper authorization?

    (a) If a lease is required, and possession is taken without a lease 
by a party other than an Indian landowner of the tract, we will treat 
the unauthorized use as a trespass. Unless we have reason to believe 
that the party in possession is engaged in negotiations with the Indian 
landowners to obtain a lease, we will take action to recover possession 
on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies 
available under applicable law.
    (b) Where a trespass involves Indian agricultural land, we will also 
assess civil penalties and costs under part 166, subpart I, of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 162.107  What are BIA's objectives in granting or approving leases?

    (a) We will assist Indian landowners in leasing their land, either 
through negotiations or advertisement. In reviewing a negotiated lease 
for approval, we will defer to the landowners' determination that the 
lease is in their best interest, to the maximum extent possible. In 
granting a lease on the landowners' behalf, we will obtain a fair annual 
rental and attempt to ensure (through proper notice) that the use of the 
land is consistent with the

[[Page 453]]

landowners' wishes. We will also recognize the rights of Indian 
landowners to use their own land, so long as their Indian co-owners are 
in agreement and the value of the land is preserved.
    (b) We will recognize the governing authority of the tribe having 
jurisdiction over the land to be leased, preparing and advertising 
leases in accordance with applicable tribal laws and policies. We will 
promote tribal control and self-determination over tribal land and other 
land under the tribe's jurisdiction, through contracts and self-
governance compacts entered into under the Indian Self-Determination and 
Education Assistance Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 450f et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 162.108  What are BIA's responsibilities in administering and 

enforcing leases?

    (a) We will ensure that tenants meet their payment obligations to 
Indian landowners, through the collection of rent on behalf of the 
landowners and the prompt initiation of appropriate collection and 
enforcement actions. We will also assist landowners in the enforcement 
of payment obligations that run directly to them, and in the exercise of 
any negotiated remedies that apply in addition to specific remedies made 
available to us under these or other regulations.
    (b) We will ensure that tenants comply with the operating 
requirements in their leases, through appropriate inspections and 
enforcement actions as needed to protect the interests of the Indian 
landowners and respond to concerns expressed by them. We will take 
immediate action to recover possession from trespassers operating 
without a lease, and take other emergency action as needed to preserve 
the value of the land.


<R05>
Sec. 162.109  What laws, other than these regulations, will apply to

leases granted or approved under this part?

    (a) Leases granted or approved under this part will be subject to 
federal laws of general applicability and any specific federal statutory 
requirements that are not incorporated in these regulations.
    (b) Tribal laws generally apply to land under the jurisdiction of 
the tribe enacting such laws, except to the extent that those tribal 
laws are inconsistent with these regulations or other applicable federal 
law. These regulations may be superseded or modified by tribal laws, 
however, so long as:
    (1) The tribal laws are consistent with the enacting tribe's 
governing documents;
    (2) The tribe has notified us of the superseding or modifying effect 
of the tribal laws;
    (3) The superseding or modifying of the regulation would not violate 
a federal statute or judicial decision, or conflict with our general 
trust responsibility under federal law; and
    (4) The superseding or modifying of the regulation applies only to 
tribal land.
    (c) State law may apply to lease disputes or define the remedies 
available to the Indian landowners in the event of a lease violation by 
the tenant, if the lease so provides and the Indian landowners have 
expressly agreed to the application of state law.


<R05>
Sec. 162.110  Can these regulations be administered by tribes, on the 

Secretary's or on BIA's behalf?

    Except insofar as these regulations provide for the granting, 
approval, or enforcement of leases and permits, the provisions in these 
regulations that authorize or require us to take certain actions will 
extend to any tribe or tribal organization that is administering 
specific programs or providing specific services under a contract or 
self-governance compact entered into under the Indian Self-Determination 
and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. Sec. 450f et seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 162.111  Who owns the records associated with this part?

    (a) Records are the property of the United States if they:
    (1) Are made or received by a tribe or tribal organization in the 
conduct of a federal trust function under 25 U.S.C. Sec. 450f et seq., 
including the operation of a trust program; and
    (2) Evidence the organization, functions, policies, decisions, 
procedures, operations, or other activities undertaken in the 
performance of a federal trust function under this part.

[[Page 454]]

    (b) Records not covered by paragraph (a) of this section that are 
made or received by a tribe or tribal organization in the conduct of 
business with the Department of the Interior under this part are the 
property of the tribe.


<R05>
Sec. 162.112  How must records associated with this part be preserved?

    (a) Any organization, including tribes and tribal organizations, 
that have records identified in Sec. 162.111(a) must preserve the 
records in accordance with approved Departmental records retention 
procedures under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapters 29, 31 and 
33. These records and related records management practices and 
safeguards required under the Federal Records Act are subject to 
inspection by the Secretary and the Archivist of the United States.
    (b) A tribe or tribal organization should preserve the records 
identified in Sec. 162.111(b) for the period of time authorized by the 
Archivist of the United States for similar Department of the Interior 
records in accordance with 44 U.S.C. Chapter 33. If a tribe or tribal 
organization does not preserve records associated with its conduct of 
business with the Department of the Interior under this part, it may 
prevent the tribe or tribal organization from being able to adequately 
document essential transactions or furnish information necessary to 
protect its legal and financial rights or those of persons directly 
affected by its activities.


<R05>
Sec. 162.113  May decisions under this part be appealed?

    Yes. Except where otherwise provided in this part, appeals from 
decisions by the BIA under this part may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR 
part 2.


<R04>

<R05>
Sec. 162.200  What types of leases are covered by this subpart?

    The regulations in this subpart apply to agricultural leases, as 
defined in this part. The regulations in this subpart may also apply to 
business leases on agricultural land, where appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 162.201  Must agricultural land be managed in accordance with a 

tribe's agricultural resource management plan?

    (a) Agricultural land under the jurisdiction of a tribe must be 
managed in accordance with the goals and objectives in any agricultural 
resource management plan developed by the tribe, or by us in close 
consultation with the tribe, under AIARMA.
    (b) A ten-year agricultural resource management and monitoring plan 
must be developed through public meetings and completed within three 
years of the initiation of the planning activity. Such a plan must be 
developed through public meetings, and be based on the public meeting 
records and existing survey documents, reports, and other research from 
federal agencies, tribal community colleges, and land grant 
universities. When completed, the plan must:
    (1) Determine available agricultural resources;
    (2) Identify specific tribal agricultural resource goals and 
objectives;
    (3) Establish management objectives for the resources;
    (4) Define critical values of the Indian tribe and its members and 
identify holistic management objectives; and
    (5) Identify actions to be taken to reach established objectives.

tribe's agricultural resource management plan, we may waive the 
regulations under part 1 of this title, so long as the waiver does not 
violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our 
general trust responsibility under federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 162.202  How will tribal laws be enforced on agricultural land?

    (a) Unless prohibited by federal law, we will recognize and comply 
with tribal laws regulating activities on agricultural land, including 
tribal laws relating to land use, environmental protection, and historic 
or cultural preservation.
    (b) While the tribe is primarily responsible for enforcing tribal 
laws pertaining to agricultural land, we will:
    (1) Assist in the enforcement of tribal laws;

[[Page 455]]

    (2) Provide notice of tribal laws to persons or entities undertaking 
activities on agricultural land, under Sec. 162.204(c) of this subpart; 
and
    (3) Require appropriate federal officials to appear in tribal forums 
when requested by the tribe, so long as such an appearance would not:
    (i) Be inconsistent with the restrictions on employee testimony set 
forth at 43 CFR Part 2, Subpart E;
    (ii) Constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United 
States; or
    (iii) Authorize or result in a review of our actions by a tribal 
court.
    (c) Where the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a 
tribal law, but such regulations cannot be superseded or modified by the 
tribal law under Sec. 162.109 of this part, we may waive the 
regulations under part 1 of this chapter, so long as the waiver does not 
violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our 
general trust responsibility under federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 162.203  When can the regulations in this subpart be superseded or

modified by tribal laws and leasing policies?

    (a) The regulations in this subpart may be superseded or modified by 
tribal laws, under the circumstances described in Sec. 162.109(b) of 
this part.
    (b) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution 
establishing a general policy for the leasing of tribal and 
individually-owned agricultural land, we will:
    (1) Waive the general prohibition against tenant preferences in 
leases advertised for bid under Sec. 162.212 of this subpart, by 
allowing prospective Indian tenants to match the highest responsible bid 
(unless the tribal leasing policy specifies some other manner in which 
the preference must be afforded);
    (2) Waive the requirement that a tenant post a bond under Sec. 
162.234 of this subpart;
    (3) Modify the requirement that a tenant post a bond in a form 
described in Sec. 162.235 of this subpart;
    (4) Approve leases of tribal land at rates established by the tribe, 
as provided in Sec. 162.222(b) of this subpart.
    (c) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution 
establishing a general policy for the leasing of ``highly fractionated 
undivided heirship lands'' (as defined in the tribal leasing policy), we 
may waive or modify the three-month notice requirement in Sec. 
162.209(b) of this subpart, so long as:
    (1) The tribal law or leasing policy adopts an alternative plan for 
providing notice to Indian landowners, before an agricultural lease is 
granted by us on their behalf; and
    (2) A waiver or modification of the three-month notice requirement 
is needed to prevent waste, reduce idle land acreage, and ensure lease 
income to the Indian landowners.
    (d) Tribal leasing policies of the type described in paragraphs (b) 
through (c) of this section will not apply to individually-owned land 
that has been made exempt from such laws or policies under Sec. 162.205 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.204  Must notice of applicable tribal laws and leasing policies

be provided?

    (a) A tribe must provide us with an official copy of any tribal law 
or leasing policy that supersedes or modifies these regulations under 
Sec. Sec. 162.109 or 162.203 of this part. If the tribe has not already 
done so, we will provide notice of such a tribal law or leasing policy 
to affected Indian landowners and persons or entities undertaking 
activities on agricultural land. Such notice will be provided in the 
manner described in paragraphs (b) through (c) of this section.
    (b) We will provide notice to Indian landowners, as to the 
superseding or modifying effect of any tribal leasing policy and their 
right to exempt their land from such a policy. Such notice will be 
provided by:
    (1) Written notice included in a notice of our intent to lease the 
land, issued under Sec. 162.209(b) of this subpart; or
    (2) Public notice posted at the tribal community building or the 
United States Post Office, or published in the local newspaper that 
serves the area in which the Indian owners' land is located, at the time 
the tribal leasing policy is adopted.
    (c) We will provide notice to persons or entities undertaking 
activities on

[[Page 456]]

agricultural land, as to the general applicability of tribal laws and 
the superseding or modifying effect of particular tribal laws and 
leasing policies. Such notice will be provided by:
    (1) Written notice included in advertisements for lease, issued 
under Sec. 162.212 of this subpart; or
    (2) Public notice posted at the tribal community building or the 
United States Post Office, or published in a local newspaper of general 
circulation, at the time the tribal law is enacted or the leasing policy 
adopted.


<R05>
Sec. 162.205  Can individual Indian landowners exempt their agricultural

land from certain tribal leasing policies?

    (a) Individual Indian landowners may exempt their agricultural land 
from the application of a tribal leasing policy of a type described in 
Sec. 162.203(b) through (c) of this subpart, if the Indian owners of at 
least 50% of the trust or restricted interests in the land submit a 
written objection to us before a lease is granted or approved.
    (b) Upon our receipt of a written objection from the Indian 
landowners that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section, we will notify the tribe that the owners' land has been 
exempted from a specific tribal leasing policy. If the exempted land is 
part of a unitized lease tract, such land will be removed from the unit 
and leased separately, if appropriate.
    (c) The procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section will also apply to withdrawing an approved exemption.

                          How to Obtain a Lease


<R05>
Sec. 162.206  Can the terms of an agricultural lease be negotiated 

with the Indian landowners?

    An agricultural lease may be obtained through negotiation. We will 
assist prospective tenants in contacting the Indian landowners or their 
representatives for the purpose of negotiating a lease, and we will 
assist the landowners in those negotiations upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 162.207  When can the Indian landowners grant an agricultural lease?

    (a) Tribes grant leases of tribally-owned agricultural land, 
including any tribally-owned undivided interest(s) in a fractionated 
tract, subject to our approval. Where tribal land is subject to a land 
assignment made to a tribal member or some other individual under tribal 
law or custom, the individual and the tribe must both grant the lease, 
subject to our approval.
    (b) Adult Indian owners, or emancipated minors, may grant 
agricultural leases of their land, including undivided interests in 
fractionated tracts, subject to our approval.
    (c) An agricultural lease of a fractionated tract may be granted by 
the owners of a majority interest in the tract, subject to our approval. 
Although prior notice to non-consenting individual Indian landowners is 
generally not needed prior to our approval of such a lease, a right of 
first refusal must be offered to any non-consenting Indian landowner who 
is using the entire lease tract at the time the lease is entered into by 
the owners of a majority interest. Where the owners of a majority 
interest grant such a lease on behalf of all of the Indian owners of a 
fractionated tract, the non-consenting Indian landowners must receive a 
fair annual rental.
    (d) As part of the negotiation of a lease, Indian landowners may 
advertise their land to identify potential tenants with whom to 
negotiate.


<R05>
Sec. 162.208  Who can represent the Indian landowners in negotiating or 

granting an agricultural lease?

    The following individuals or entities may represent an individual 
Indian landowner:
    (a) An adult with custody acting on behalf of his or her minor 
children;
    (b) A guardian, conservator, or other fiduciary appointed by a court 
of competent jurisdiction to act on behalf of an individual Indian 
landowner;
    (c) An adult or legal entity who has been given a written power of 
attorney that:
    (1) Meets all of the formal requirements of any applicable tribal or 
state law;

[[Page 457]]

    (2) Identifies the attorney-in-fact and the land to be leased; and
    (3) Describes the scope of the power granted and any limits thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 162.209  When can BIA grant an agricultural lease on behalf 

of an Indian landowner?

    (a) We may grant an agricultural lease on behalf of:
    (1) Individuals who are found to be non compos mentis by a court of 
competent jurisdiction;
    (2) Orphaned minors;
    (3) The undetermined heirs and devisees of deceased Indian owners;
    (4) Individuals who have given us a written power of attorney to 
lease their land; and
    (5) Individuals whose whereabouts are unknown to us, after 
reasonable attempts are made to locate such individuals; and
    (6) The individual Indian landowners of fractionated Indian land, 
when necessary to protect the interests of the individual Indian 
landowners.
    (b) We may grant an agricultural lease on behalf of all of the 
individual Indian owners of a fractionated tract, where:
    (1) We have provided the Indian landowners with written notice of 
our intent to grant a lease on their behalf, but the Indian landowners 
are unable to agree upon a lease during a three-month negotiation period 
immediately following such notice, or any other notice period 
established by a tribe under Sec. 162.203(c) of this subpart; and
    (2) The land is not being used by an Indian landowner under Sec. 
162.104(b) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 162.210  When can BIA grant a permit covering agricultural land?

    (a) We may grant a permit covering agricultural land in the same 
manner as we would grant an agricultural lease under Sec. 162.209 of 
this part. We may also grant a permit on behalf of individual Indian 
landowners, without prior notice, if it is impractical to provide notice 
to the owners and no substantial injury to the land will occur.
    (b) We may grant a permit covering agricultural land, but not an 
agricultural lease, on government land.
    (c) We will not grant a permit on tribal agricultural land, but a 
tribe may grant a permit, subject to our approval, in the same manner as 
it would grant a lease under Sec. 162.207(a) of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.211  What type of valuation or evaluation methods will be 

applied in estimating the fair annual rental of Indian land?

    (a) To support the Indian landowners in their negotiations, and to 
assist in our consideration of whether an agricultural lease is in the 
Indian landowners' best interest, we must determine the fair annual 
rental of the land prior to our grant or approval of the lease, unless 
the land may be leased at less than a fair annual rental under Sec. 
162.222(b) through (c) of this subpart.
    (b) A fair annual rental may be determined by competitive bidding, 
appraisal, or any other appropriate valuation method. Where an appraisal 
or other valuation is needed to determine the fair annual rental, the 
appraisal or valuation must be prepared in accordance with USPAP.


<R05>
Sec. 162.212  When will the BIA advertise Indian land for agricultural leases?

    (a) We will generally advertise Indian land for agricultural 
leasing:
    (1) At the request of the Indian landowners; or
    (2) Before we grant a lease under Sec. 162.209(b) of this subpart.
    (b) Advertisements will provide prospective tenants with notice of 
any superseding tribal laws and leasing policies that have been made 
applicable to the land under Sec. Sec. 162.109 and 162.203 of this 
part, along with certain standard terms and conditions to be included in 
the lease. Advertisements will prohibit tenant preferences, and bidders 
at lease sales will not be afforded any preference, unless a preference 
in favor of individual Indians is required by a superseding tribal law 
or leasing policy.
    (c) Advertisements will require sealed bids, and they may also 
provide for further competitive bidding among the prospective tenants at 
the conclusion of the bid opening. Competitive bidding should be 
supported, at a minimum, by a market study or rent survey that is 
consistent with USPAP.

[[Page 458]]


<R05>
Sec. 162.213  What supporting documents must be provided prior to BIA's 

grant or approval of an agricultural lease?

    (a) If the tenant is a corporation, partnership or other legal 
entity, it must provide organizational and financial documents, as 
needed to show that the lease will be enforceable against the tenant and 
the tenant will be able to perform all of its lease obligations.
    (b) Where a bond is required under Sec. 162.234 of this subpart, 
the bond must be furnished before we grant or approve the lease.
    (c) The tenant must provide environmental and archaeological 
reports, surveys, and site assessments, as needed to document compliance 
with NEPA and other applicable federal and tribal land use requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 162.214  How and when will BIA decide whether to approve an agricultural lease?

    (a) Before we approve a lease, we must determine in writing that the 
lease is in the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that 
determination, we will:
    (1) Review the lease and supporting documents;
    (2) Identify potential environmental impacts and ensure compliance 
with all applicable environmental laws, land use laws, and ordinances 
(including preparation of the appropriate review documents under NEPA);
    (3) Assure ourselves that adequate consideration has been given, as 
appropriate, to:
    (i) The relationship between the use of the leased premises and the 
use of neighboring lands;
    (ii) The height, quality, and safety of any structures or other 
facilities to be constructed on the leased premises;
    (iii) The availability of police and fire protection, utilities, and 
other essential community services;
    (iv) The availability of judicial forums for all criminal and civil 
matters arising on the leased premises; and
    (v) The effect on the environment of the proposed land use.
    (4) Require any lease modifications or mitigation measures that are 
needed to satisfy any requirements of this subpart, or any other federal 
or tribal land use requirements.
    (b) Where an agricultural lease is in a form that has previously 
been accepted or approved by us, and all of the documents needed to 
support the findings required by paragraph (a) of this section have been 
received, we will decide whether to approve the lease within 30 days of 
the date of our receipt of the lease and supporting documents. If we 
decide to approve or disapprove a lease, we will notify the parties 
immediately and advise them of their right to appeal the decision under 
part 2 of this chapter. Copies of agricultural leases that have been 
approved will be provided to the tenant, and made available to the 
Indian landowners upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 162.215  When will an agricultural lease be effective?

    Unless otherwise provided in the lease, an agricultural lease will 
be effective on the date on which the lease is approved by us. An 
agricultural lease may be made effective on some past or future date, by 
agreement, but such a lease may not be approved more than one year prior 
to the date on which the lease term is to commence.


<R05>
Sec. 162.216  When will a BIA decision to approve an agricultural

lease be effective?

    Our decision to approve an agricultural lease will be effective 
immediately, notwithstanding any appeal that may be filed under part 2 
of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 162.217  Must an agricultural lease or permit be recorded?

    (a) An agricultural lease or permit must be recorded in our Land 
Titles and Records Office with jurisdiction over the land. We will 
record the lease or permit immediately following our approval under this 
subpart.
    (b) Agricultural leases of tribal land that do not require our 
approval, under Sec. 162.102 of this part, must be recorded by the 
tribe in our Land Titles and Records Office with jurisdiction over the 
land.

[[Page 459]]

                           Lease Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 162.218  Is there a standard agricultural lease form?

    Based on the need for flexibility in advertising, negotiating and 
drafting of appropriate lease terms and conditions, there is no standard 
agricultural lease form that must be used. We will assist the Indian 
landowners in drafting lease provisions that conform to the requirements 
of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 162.219  Are there any provisions that must be included in an 

agricultural lease?

    In addition to the other requirements of this part, all agricultural 
leases must provide that:
    (a) The obligations of the tenant and its sureties to the Indian 
landowners will also be enforceable by the United States, so long as the 
land remains in trust or restricted status;
    (b) Nothing contained in this lease shall operate to delay or 
prevent a termination of federal trust responsibilities with respect to 
the land by the issuance of a fee patent or otherwise during the term of 
the lease; however, such termination shall not serve to abrogate the 
lease. The owners of the land and the lessee and his surety or sureties 
shall be notified of any such change in the status of the land;
    (c) There must not be any unlawful conduct, creation of a nuisance, 
illegal activity, or negligent use or waste of the leased premises; and
    (d) The tenant must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, 
rules, regulations, and other legal requirements, including tribal laws 
and leasing policies.


<R05>
Sec. 162.220  Are there any formal requirements that must be satisfied

in the execution of an agricultural lease?

    (a) An agricultural lease must identify the Indian landowners and 
their respective interests in the leased premises, and the lease must be 
granted by or on behalf of each of the Indian landowners. One who 
executes a lease in a representative capacity under Sec. 162.208 of 
this subpart must identify the owner being represented and the authority 
under which such action is being taken.
    (b) An agricultural lease must be executed by individuals having the 
necessary capacity and authority to bind the tenant under applicable 
law.
    (c) An agricultural lease must include a citation of the provisions 
in this subpart that authorize our approval, along with a citation of 
the formal documents by which such authority has been delegated to the 
official taking such action.


<R05>
Sec. 162.221  How should the land be described in an agricultural lease?

    An agricultural lease should describe the leased premises by 
reference to a public or private survey, if possible. If the land cannot 
be so described, the lease must include a legal description or other 
description that is sufficient to identify the leased premises, subject 
to our approval. Where there are undivided interests owned in fee 
status, the aggregate portion of trust and restricted interests should 
be identified in the description of the leased premises.


<R05>
Sec. 162.222  How much rent must be paid under an agricultural lease?

    (a) An agricultural lease must provide for the payment of a fair 
annual rental at the beginning of the lease term, unless a lesser amount 
is permitted under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. The 
tenant's rent payments may be:
    (1) In fixed amounts; or
    (2) Based on a share of the agricultural products generated by the 
lease, or a percentage of the income to be derived from the sale of such 
agricultural products.
    (b) We will approve an agricultural lease of tribal land at a 
nominal rent, or at less than a fair annual rental, if such a rent is 
negotiated or established by the tribe.
    (c) We will approve an agricultural lease of individually-owned land 
at a nominal rent or at less than a fair annual rental, if:
    (1) The tenant is a member of the Indian landowner's immediate 
family, or a co-owner in the lease tract; or
    (2) The tenant is a cooperative or other legal entity in which the 
Indian landowners directly participate in the

[[Page 460]]

revenues or profits generated by the lease.
    (d) We will grant or approve a lease at less than a fair annual 
rental, as previously determined by an appraisal or some other 
appropriate valuation method, if the land is subsequently advertised and 
the tenant is the highest responsible bidder.


<R05>
Sec. 162.223  Must the rent be adjusted under an agricultural lease?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an 
agricultural lease must provide for one or more rental adjustments if 
the lease term runs more than five years, unless the lease provides for 
the payment of:
    (1) Less than a fair annual rental, as permitted under Sec. 
162.222(b) through (c) of this part; or
    (2) A rental based primarily on a share of the agricultural products 
generated by the lease, or a percentage of the income derived from the 
sale of agricultural products.
    (b) If rental adjustments are required, the lease must specify:
    (1) How adjustments are made;
    (2) Who makes the adjustments;
    (3) When the adjustments are effective; and
    (4) How disputes about the adjustments are resolved.
    (c) An agricultural lease of tribal land may run for a term of more 
than five years, without providing for a rental adjustment, if the tribe 
establishes such a policy under Sec. 162.203(b)(4) and negotiates such 
a lease.


<R05>
Sec. 162.224  When are rent payments due under an agricultural lease?

    An agricultural lease must specify the dates on which all rent 
payments are due. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, rent payments 
may not be made or accepted more than one year in advance of the due 
date. Rent payments are due at the time specified in the lease, 
regardless of whether the tenant receives an advance billing or other 
notice that a payment is due.


<R05>
Sec. 162.225  Will untimely rent payments made under an agricultural

lease be subject to interest charges or late payment penalties?

    An agricultural lease must specify the rate at which interest will 
accrue on any rent payment not made by the due date or any other date 
specified in the lease. A lease may also identify additional late 
payment penalties that will apply if a rent payment is not made by a 
specified date. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, such interest 
charges and late payment penalties will apply in the absence of any 
specific notice to the tenant from us or the Indian landowners, and the 
failure to pay such amounts will be treated as a lease violation under 
Sec. 162.251 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.226  To whom can rent payments be made under an agricultural lease?

    (a) An agricultural lease must specify whether rent payments will be 
made directly to the Indian landowners or to us on behalf of the Indian 
landowners. If the lease provides for payment to be made directly to the 
Indian landowners, the lease must also require that the tenant retain 
specific documentation evidencing proof of payment, such as canceled 
checks, cash receipt vouchers, or copies of money orders or cashier's 
checks, consistent with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 162.112 and 162.113 
of this part.
    (b) Rent payments made directly to the Indian landowners must be 
made to the parties specified in the lease, unless the tenant receives 
notice of a change of ownership. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, 
rent payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the 
Indian landowners.
    (c) A lease that provides for rent payments to be made directly to 
the Indian landowners must also provide for such payments to be 
suspended and the rent thereafter paid to us, rather than directly to 
the Indian landowners, if:
    (1) An Indian landowner dies;
    (2) An Indian landowner requests that payment be made to us;
    (3) An Indian landowner is found by us to be in need of assistance 
in managing his/her financial affairs; or
    (4) We determine, in our discretion and after consultation with the 
Indian landowner(s), that direct payment should be discontinued.

[[Page 461]]


<R05>
Sec. 162.227  What form of rent payment can be accepted under an agricultural lease?

    (a) When rent payments are made directly to the Indian landowners, 
the form of payment must be acceptable to the Indian landowners.
    (b) Payments made to us may be delivered in person or by mail. We 
will not accept cash, foreign currency, or third-party checks. We will 
accept:
    (1) Personal or business checks drawn on the account of the tenant;
    (2) Money orders;
    (3) Cashier's checks;
    (4) Certified checks; or
    (5) Electronic funds transfer payments.


<R05>
Sec. 162.228  What other types of payments are required under an agricultural lease?

    (a) The tenant may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, and/or 
assessments associated with the use of the land, as determined by the 
tribe having jurisdiction over the land. The tenant must pay these 
amounts to the appropriate tribal official.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in part 171 of this chapter, if the 
leased premises are within an Indian irrigation project or drainage 
district, the tenant must pay all operation and maintenance charges that 
accrue during the lease term. The tenant must pay these amounts to the 
appropriate official in charge of the irrigation project or drainage 
district. Failure to make such payments will constitute a violation of 
the lease under Sec. 162.251.


<R05>
Sec. 162.229  How long can the term of an agricultural lease run?

    (a) An agricultural lease must provide for a definite lease term, 
specifying the commencement date. The commencement date of the lease may 
not be more than one year after the date on which the lease is approved.
    (b) The lease term must be reasonable, given the purpose of the 
lease and the level of investment required. Unless otherwise provided by 
statute, the maximum term may not exceed ten years, unless a substantial 
investment in the improvement of the land is required. If such a 
substantial investment is required, the maximum term may be up to 25 
years.
    (c) Where all of the trust or restricted interests in a tract are 
owned by a deceased Indian whose heirs and devisees have not yet been 
determined, the maximum term may not exceed two years.
    (d) An agricultural lease may not provide the tenant with an option 
to renew, and such a lease may not be renewed or extended by holdover.


<R05>
Sec. 162.230  Can an agricultural lease be amended, assigned, sublet, or mortgaged?

    (a) An agricultural lease may authorize amendments, assignments, 
subleases, or mortgages of the leasehold interest, but only with the 
written consent of the parties to the lease in the same manner the 
original lease was approved, and our approval. An attempt by the tenant 
to mortgage the leasehold interest or authorize possession by another 
party, without the necessary consent and approval, will be treated as a 
lease violation under Sec. 162.251 of this subpart.
    (b) An agricultural lease may authorize us, one or more of the 
Indian landowners, or a designated representative of the Indian 
landowners, to consent to an amendment, assignment, sublease, mortgage, 
or other type of agreement, on the landowners' behalf. A designated 
landowner or representative may not negotiate or consent to an 
amendment, assignment, or sublease that would:
    (1) Reduce the rentals payable to the other Indian landowners; or
    (2) Terminate or modify the term of the lease.
    (c) Where the Indian landowners have not designated a representative 
for the purpose of consenting to an amendment, assignment, sublease, 
mortgage, or other type of agreement, such consent may be granted by or 
on behalf of the landowners in the same manner as a new lease, under 
Sec. Sec. 162.207 through 162.209 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.231  How can the land be used under an agricultural lease?

    (a) An agricultural lease must describe the authorized uses of the 
leased

[[Page 462]]

premises. Any use of the leased premises for an unauthorized purpose, or 
a failure by the tenant to maintain continuous operations throughout the 
lease term, will be treated as a lease violation under Sec. 162.251 of 
this subpart.
    (b) An agricultural lease must require that farming and grazing 
operations be conducted in accordance with recognized principles of 
sustained yield management, integrated resource management planning, 
sound conservation practices, and other community goals as expressed in 
applicable tribal laws, leasing policies, or agricultural resource 
management plans. Appropriate stipulations or conservation plans must be 
developed and incorporated in all agricultural leases.


<R05>
Sec. 162.232  Can improvements be made under an agricultural lease?

    An agricultural lease must generally describe the type and location 
of any improvements to be constructed by the lessee. Unless otherwise 
provided in the lease, any specific plans for the construction of those 
improvements will not require the consent of the Indian owners or our 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 162.233  Who will own the improvements made under an agricultural lease?

    (a) An agricultural lease may specify who will own any improvements 
constructed by the tenant, during the lease term. The lease must 
indicate whether any improvements constructed by the tenant will remain 
on the leased premises upon the expiration or termination of the lease, 
providing for the improvements to either:
    (1) Remain on the leased premises, in a condition satisfactory to 
the Indian landowners and us; or
    (2) Be removed within a time period specified in the lease, at the 
tenant's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as close as 
possible to their condition prior to construction of such improvements.
    (b) If the lease allows the tenant to remove the improvements, it 
must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to waive the 
removal requirement and take possession of the improvements if they are 
not removed within the specified time period. If the Indian landowners 
choose not to exercise this option, we will take appropriate enforcement 
action to ensure removal at the tenant's expense.


<R05>
Sec. 162.234  Must a tenant provide a bond under an agricultural lease?

    Unless otherwise provided by a tribe under Sec. 162.203 of this 
subpart, or waived by us at the request of the owners of a majority 
interest in an agricultural lease tract, the tenant must provide a bond 
to secure:
    (a) The payment of one year's rental;
    (b) The construction of any required improvements;
    (c) The performance of any additional lease obligations, including 
the payment of operation and maintenance charges under Sec. 162.228(b) 
of this subpart; and
    (d) The restoration and reclamation of the leased premises, to their 
condition at the commencement of the lease term or some other specified 
condition.


<R05>
Sec. 162.235  What form of bond can be accepted under an agricultural lease?

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a bond must 
be deposited with us and made payable only to us, and such a bond may 
not be modified or withdrawn without our approval. We will only accept a 
bond in one of the following forms:
    (1) Cash;
    (2) Negotiable Treasury securities that:
    (i) Have a market value at least equal to the bond amount; and
    (ii) Are accompanied by a statement granting full authority to us to 
sell such securities in case of a violation of the terms of the lease.
    (3) Certificates of deposit that indicate on their face that our 
approval is required prior to redemption by any party;
    (4) Irrevocable letters of credit issued by federally-insured 
financial institutions authorized to do business in the United States. A 
letter of credit must:
    (i) Contain a clause that grants us the authority to demand 
immediate payment if the tenant violates the lease or fails to replace 
the letter of credit at least 30 days prior to its expiration date;
    (ii) Be payable to us;

[[Page 463]]

    (iii) Be irrevocable during its term and have an initial expiration 
date of not less than one year following the date of issuance; and
    (iv) Be automatically renewable for a period of not less than one 
year, unless the issuing financial institution provides us with written 
notice that it will not be renewed, at least 90 calendar days before the 
letter of credit's expiration date.
    (5) A surety bond issued by a company approved by the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury; or
    (6) Any other form of highly liquid, non-volatile security that is 
easily convertible to cash and for which our approval is required prior 
to redemption by any party.
    (b) A tribe may accept and hold any form of bond described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, to secure performance under an 
agricultural lease of tribal land.


<R05>
Sec. 162.236  How will a cash bond be administered?

    (a) If a cash bond is submitted, we will retain the funds in an 
account established in the name of the tenant.
    (b) We will not pay interest on a cash performance bond.
    (c) If the bond is not forfeited under Sec. 162.252(a) of this 
subpart, we will refund the bond to the tenant upon the expiration or 
termination of the lease.

Sec. 162.237  What insurance is required under an agricultural lease?

    When necessary to protect the interests of the Indian landowners, an 
agricultural lease must require that a tenant provide insurance. Such 
insurance may include property, crop, liability and/or casualty 
insurance. If insurance is required, it must identify both the Indian 
landowners and the United States as insured parties, and be sufficient 
to protect all insurable improvements on the leased premises.


<R05>
Sec. 162.238  What indemnities are required under an agricultural lease?

    (a) An agricultural lease must require that the tenant indemnify and 
hold the United States and the Indian landowners harmless from any loss, 
liability, or damages resulting from the tenant's use or occupation of 
the leased premises, unless:
    (1) The tenant would be prohibited by law from making such an 
agreement; or (2) The interests of the Indian landowners are adequately 
protected by insurance.
    (b) Unless the tenant would be prohibited by law from making such an 
agreement, an agricultural lease must specifically require that the 
tenant indemnify the United States and the Indian landowners against all 
liabilities or costs relating to the use, handling, treatment, removal, 
storage, transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials, or the 
release or discharge of any hazardous materials from the leased premises 
that occurs during the lease term, regardless of fault.


<R05>
Sec. 162.239  How will payment rights and obligations relating to

agricultural land be allocated between the Indian landowners and the tenant?

    (a) Unless otherwise provided in an agricultural lease, the Indian 
landowners will be entitled to receive any settlement funds or other 
payments arising from certain actions that diminish the value of the 
land or the improvements thereon. Such payments may include (but are not 
limited to) :
    (1) Insurance proceeds;
    (2) Trespass damages; and
    (3) Condemnation awards.
    (b) An agricultural lease may provide for the tenant to assume 
certain cost-share or other payment obligations that have attached to 
the land through past farming and grazing operations, so long as those 
obligations are specified in the lease and considered in any 
determination of fair annual rental made under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.240  Can an agricultural lease provide for negotiated remedies in the event of a violation?

    (a) A lease of tribal agricultural land may provide the tribe with 
certain negotiated remedies in the event of a lease violation, including 
the power to terminate the lease. An agricultural lease of individually-
owned land may provide the individual Indian landowners with similar 
remedies, so long as the lease also specifies the manner in which those 
remedies may be exercised by or on behalf of the landowners.

[[Page 464]]

    (b) The negotiated remedies described in paragraph (a) of this 
section will apply in addition to the cancellation remedy available to 
us under Sec. 162.252(c) of this subpart. If the lease specifically 
authorizes us to exercise any negotiated remedies on behalf of the 
Indian landowners, the exercise of such remedies may substitute for 
cancellation.
    (c) An agricultural lease may provide for lease disputes to be 
resolved in tribal court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, 
or through arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution 
method. We may not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we 
will defer to ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether 
to exercise any of the remedies available to us under Sec. 162.252 of 
this subpart.

                          Lease Administration


<R05>
Sec. 162.241  Will administrative fees be charged for actions relating to agricultural leases?

    (a) We will charge an administrative fee each time we approve an 
agricultural lease, amendment, assignment, sublease, mortgage, or 
related document. These fees will be paid by the tenant, assignee, or 
subtenant, to cover our costs in preparing or processing the documents 
and administering the lease.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, we will 
charge administrative fees based on the rent payable under the lease. 
The fee will be 3% of the annual rent payable, including any percentage-
based rent that can be reasonably estimated.
    (c) The minimum administrative fee is $10.00 and the maximum 
administrative fee is $500.00, and any administrative fees that have 
been paid will be non-refundable. However, we may waive all or part of 
these administrative fees, in our discretion.
    (d) If all or part of the expenses of the work are paid from tribal 
funds, the tribe may establish an additional or alternate schedule of 
fees.


<R05>
Sec. 162.242  How will BIA decide whether to approve an amendment to an agricultural lease?

    We will approve an agricultural lease amendment if:
    (a) The required consents have been obtained from the parties to the 
lease under Sec. 162.230 and any sureties; and
    (b) We find the amendment to be in the best interest of the Indian 
landowners, under the standards set forth in Sec. 162.213 of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.243  How will BIA decide whether to approve an assignment or

sublease under an agricultural lease?

    (a) We will approve an assignment or sublease under an agricultural 
lease if:
    (1) The required consents have been obtained from the parties to the 
lease under Sec. 162.230 and the tenant's sureties;
    (2) The tenant is not in violation of the lease;
    (3) The assignee agrees to be bound by, or the subtenant agrees to 
be subordinated to, the terms of the lease; and
    (4) We find no compelling reason to withhold our approval in order 
to protect the best interests of the Indian owners.
    (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, we will consider whether:
    (1) The Indian landowners should receive any income derived by the 
tenant from the assignment or sublease, under the terms of the lease;
    (2) The proposed use by the assignee or subtenant will require an 
amendment of the lease;
    (3) The value of any part of the leased premises not covered by the 
assignment or sublease would be adversely affected; and
    (4) The assignee or subtenant has bonded its performance and 
provided supporting documents that demonstrate that the lease or 
sublease will be enforceable against the assignee or subtenant, and that 
the assignee or subtenant will be able to perform its obligations under 
the lease or sublease.

[[Page 465]]


<R05>
Sec. 162.244  How will BIA decide whether to approve a leasehold mortgage 

under an agricultural lease?

    (a) We will approve a leasehold mortgage under an agricultural lease 
if:
    (1) The required consents have been obtained from the parties to the 
lease under Sec. 162.230 and the tenant's sureties;
    (2) The mortgage covers only the tenant's interest in the leased 
premises, and no unrelated collateral;
    (3) The loan being secured by the mortgage will be used only in 
connection with the development or use of the leased premises, and the 
mortgage does not secure any unrelated debts owed by the tenant to the 
mortgagee; and
    (4) We find no compelling reason to withhold our approval in order 
to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.
    (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, we will consider whether:
    (1) The tenant's ability to comply with the lease would be adversely 
affected by any new loan obligations;
    (2) Any lease provisions would be modified by the mortgage;
    (3) The remedies available to us or to the Indian landowners would 
be limited (beyond any additional notice and cure rights to be afforded 
to the mortgagee), in the event of a lease violation; and
    (4) Any rights of the Indian landowners would be subordinated or 
adversely affected in the event of a loan default by the tenant.


<R05>
Sec. 162.245  When will a BIA decision to approve an amendment, 

assignment, sublease, or mortgage under an agricultural lease be effective?

    Our decision to approve an amendment, assignment, sublease, or 
mortgage under an agricultural lease will be effective immediately, 
notwithstanding any appeal that may be filed under part 2 of this 
chapter. Copies of approved documents will be provided to the party 
requesting approval, and made available to the Indian landowners upon 
request.


<R05>
Sec. 162.246  Must an amendment, assignment, sublease, or mortgage approved 

under an agricultural lease be recorded?

    An amendment, assignment, sublease, or mortgage approved under an 
agricultural lease must be recorded in our Land Titles and Records 
Office that has jurisdiction over the leased premises. We will record 
the document immediately following our approval under this subpart.

                            Lease Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 162.247  Will BIA notify a tenant when a rent payment is due under an 

agricultural lease?

    We may issue bills or invoices to a tenant in advance of the dates 
on which rent payments are due under an agricultural lease, but the 
tenant's obligation to make such payments in a timely manner will not be 
excused if such bills or invoices are not delivered or received.


<R05>
Sec. 162.248  What will BIA do if rent payments are not made in the time

and manner required by an agricultural lease?

    (a) A tenant's failure to pay rent in the time and manner required 
by an agricultural lease will be a violation of the lease, and a notice 
of violation will be issued under Sec. 162.251 of this subpart. If the 
lease requires that rent payments be made to us, we will send the tenant 
and its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the 
date on which the rent payment was due. If the lease provides for 
payment directly to the Indian landowners, we will send the tenant and 
its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the date 
on which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the landowners.
    (b) If a tenant fails to provide adequate proof of payment or cure 
the violation within the requisite time period described in Sec. 
162.251(b) of this subpart, and the amount due is not in dispute, we may 
immediately take action to recover the amount of the unpaid rent and any 
associated interest charges or late payment penalties. We may also 
cancel the lease under Sec. 162.252 of this subpart, or invoke any 
other remedies available under the lease or applicable

[[Page 466]]

law, including collection on any available bond or referral of the debt 
to the Department of the Treasury for collection. An action to recover 
any unpaid amounts will not be conditioned on the prior cancellation of 
the lease or any further notice to the tenant, nor will such an action 
be precluded by a prior cancellation.
    (c) Partial payments may be accepted by the Indian landowners or us, 
but acceptance will not operate as a waiver with respect to any amounts 
remaining unpaid or any other existing lease violations. Unless 
otherwise provided in the lease, overpayments may be credited as an 
advance against future rent payments, or refunded.
    (d) If a personal or business check is dishonored, and a rent 
payment is therefore not made by the due date, the failure to make the 
payment in a timely manner will be a violation of the lease, and a 
notice of violation will be issued under Sec. 162.251 of this subpart. 
Any payment made to cure such a violation, and any future payments by 
the same tenant, must be made by one of the alternative payment methods 
listed in Sec. 162.227(b) of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.249  Will any special fees be assessed on delinquent rent payments

due under an agricultural lease?

    The following special fees will be assessed if rent is not paid in 
the time and manner required, in addition to any interest or late 
payment penalties that must be paid to the Indian landowners under an 
agricultural lease. The following special fees will be assessed to cover 
administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of 
the debt:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
       The tenant will pay * * *                    For * * *

(a) $50.00.............................  Administrative fee for
                                          dishonored checks.
(b) $15.00.............................  Administrative fee for BIA
                                          processing of each notice or

(c) 18% of balance due.................  Administrative fee charged by
                                          Treasury following referral
                                          for collection of delinquent
                                          debt.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 162.250  How will BIA determine whether the activities of a tenant

under an agricultural lease are in compliance with the terms of the lease?

    (a) Unless an agricultural lease provides otherwise, we may enter 
the leased premises at any reasonable time, without prior notice, to 
protect the interests of the Indian landowners and ensure that the 
tenant is in compliance with the operating requirements of the lease.
    (b) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific lease 
violation has occurred, we will initiate an appropriate investigation 
within five business days of that notification.


<R05>
Sec. 162.251  What will BIA do in the event of a violation under an agricultural lease?

    (a) If we determine that an agricultural lease has been violated, we 
will send the tenant and its sureties a notice of violation within five 
business days of that determination. The notice of violation must be 
provided by certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (b) Within ten business days of the receipt of a notice of 
violation, the tenant must:
    (1) Cure the violation and notify us in writing that the violation 
has been cured;
    (2) Dispute our determination that a violation has occurred and/or 
explain why we should not cancel the lease; or
    (3) Request additional time to cure the violation.


<R05>
Sec. 162.252  What will BIA do if a violation of an agricultural lease

is not cured within the requisite time period?

    (a) If the tenant does not cure a violation of an agricultural lease 
within the requisite time period, we will consult with the Indian 
landowners, as appropriate, and determine whether:
    (1) The lease should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this 
section and Sec. Sec. 162.253 through 162.254 of this subpart;
    (2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the 
lease, including collecting on any available bond;

[[Page 467]]

    (3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to 
them under the lease; or
    (4) The tenant should be granted additional time in which to cure 
the violation.
    (b) If we decide to grant a tenant additional time in which to cure 
a violation, the tenant must proceed diligently to complete the 
necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time 
period from the date on which the extension is granted.
    (c) If we decide to cancel the lease, we will send the tenant and 
its sureties a cancellation letter within five business days of that 
decision. The cancellation letter must be sent to the tenant by 
certified mail, return receipt requested. We will also provide actual or 
constructive notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, 
as appropriate. The cancellation letter will:
    (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;
    (2) Notify the tenant of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest 
charges, or late payment penalties due under the lease;
    (3) Notify the tenant of its right to appeal under part 2 of this 
chapter, as modified by Sec. 162.253 of this subpart, including the 
amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the 
cancellation decision; and
    (4) Order the tenant to vacate the property within 30 days of the 
date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by 
that time.


<R05>
Sec. 162.253  Will BIA's regulations concerning appeal bonds apply to

cancellation decisions involving agricultural leases?

    (a) The appeal bond provisions in Sec. 2.5 of part 2 of this 
chapter will not apply to appeals from lease cancellation decisions made 
under Sec. 162.252 of this subpart. Instead, when we decide to cancel 
an agricultural lease, we may require that the tenant post an appeal 
bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to 
post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other 
requirements in part 2 of this chapter.
    (b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect 
the Indian landowners against financial losses that will likely result 
from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be 
separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the 
lease cancellation decision.


<R05>
Sec. 162.254  When will a cancellation of an agricultural lease be effective?

    A cancellation decision involving an agricultural lease will not be 
effective until 30 days after the tenant receives a cancellation letter 
from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the tenant 
files an appeal under Sec. 162.253 of this subpart and part 2 of this 
chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. 
While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the tenant must continue 
to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the lease. If an appeal 
is not filed in accordance with Sec. 162.253 of this subpart and part 2 
of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st 
day after the tenant receives the cancellation letter from us.


<R05>
Sec. 162.255  Can BIA take emergency action if the leased premises are 

threatened with immediate and significant harm?

    If a tenant or any other party causes or threatens to cause 
immediate and significant harm to the leased premises during the term of 
an agricultural lease, we will take appropriate emergency action. 
Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under part 166, 
subpart I, of this chapter, or judicial action seeking immediate 
cessation of the activity resulting in or threatening the harm. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to notify the Indian landowners, either 
before or after the emergency action is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 162.256  What will BIA do if a tenant holds over after the expiration

or cancellation of an agricultural lease?

    If a tenant remains in possession after the expiration or 
cancellation of an agricultural lease, we will treat the unauthorized 
use as a trespass. Unless we have reason to believe that the tenant is 
engaged in negotiations with the Indian landowners to obtain a new 
lease, we will take action to recover

[[Page 468]]

possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional 
remedies available under applicable law, including the assessment of 
civil penalties and costs under part 166, subpart I, of this chapter.

Subpart C--Residential Leases [Reserved]

Subpart D--Business Leases [Reserved]


<R04>
         Subpart E_Special Requirements for Certain Reservations


<R05>
Sec. 162.500  Crow Reservation.

    (a) Notwithstanding the regulations in other sections of this part 
162, Crow Indians classified as competent under the Act of June 4, 1920 
(41 Stat. 751), as amended, may lease their trust lands and the trust 
lands of their minor children for farming or grazing purposes without 
the approval of the Secretary pursuant to the Act of May 26, 1926 (44 
Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80). 
However, at their election Crow Indians classified as competent may 
authorize the Secretary to lease, or assist in the leasing of such 
lands, and an appropriate notice of such action shall be made a matter 
of record. When this prerogative is exercised, the general regulations 
contained in this part 162 shall be applicable. Approval of the 
Secretary is required on leases signed by Crow Indians not classified as 
competent or made on inherited or devised trust lands owned by more than 
five competent devisees or heirs.
    (b) The Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of 
March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80), provides that no lease for farming or 
grazing purposes shall be made for a period longer than five years, 
except irrigable lands under the Big Horn Canal; which may be leased for 
periods of ten years. No such lease shall provide the lessee a 
preference right to future leases which, if exercised, would thereby 
extend the total period of encumbrance beyond the five or ten years 
authorized by law.
    (c) All leases entered into by Crow Indians classified as competent, 
under the above-cited special statutes, must be recorded at the Crow 
Agency. Such recording shall constitute notice to all persons. Under 
these special statutes, Crow Indians classified as competent are free to 
lease their property within certain limitations. The five-year (ten-year 
in the case of lands under the Big Horn Canal) limitation is intended to 
afford a protection to the Indians. The essence of this protection is 
the right to deal with the property free, clear, and unencumbered at 
intervals at least as frequent as those provided by law. If lessees are 
able to obtain new leases long before the termination of existing 
leases, they are in a position to set their own terms. In these 
circumstances lessees could perpetuate their leaseholds and the 
protection of the statutory limitations as to terms would be destroyed. 
Therefore, in implementation of the foregoing interpretation, any lease 
which, on its face, is in violation of statutory limitations or 
requirements, and any grazing lease executed more than 12 months, and 
any farming lease executed more than 18 months, prior to the 
commencement of the term thereof or any lease which purports to cancel 
an existing lease with the same lessee as of a future date and take 
effect upon such cancellation will not be recorded. Under a Crow tribal 
program, approved by the Department of the Interior, competent Crow 
Indians may, under certain circumstances, enter into agreements which 
require that, for a specified term, their leases be approved. 
Information concerning whether a competent Crow Indian has executed such 
an instrument is available at the office of the Superintendent of the 
Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Crow Agency, Montana. Any lease 
entered into with a competent Crow Indian during the time such 
instrument is in effect and which is not in accordance with such 
instrument will be returned without recordation.
    (d) Where any of the following conditions are found to exist, leases 
will be recorded but the lessee and lessor will be notified upon 
discovery of the condition:
    (1) The lease in single or counterpart form has not been executed by 
all owners of the land described in the lease;

[[Page 469]]

    (2) There is, of record, a lease on the land for all or a part of 
the same term;
    (3) The lease does not contain stipulations requiring sound land 
utilization plans and conservation practices; or
    (4) There are other deficiencies such as, but not limited to, 
erroneous land descriptions, and alterations which are not clearly 
endorsed by the lessor.
    (e) Any adult Crow Indian classified as competent shall have the 
full responsibility for obtaining compliance with the terms of any lease 
made by him pursuant to this section. This shall not preclude action by 
the Secretary to assure conservation and protection of these trust 
lands.
    (f) Leases made by competent Crow Indians shall be subject to the 
right to issue permits and leases to prospect for, develop, and mine 
oil, gas, and other minerals, and to grant rights-of-way and easements, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. In the issuance or 
granting of such permits, leases, rights-of-way or easements due 
consideration will be given to the interests of lessees and to the 
adjustment of any damages to such interests. In the event of a dispute 
as to the amount of such damage, the matter will be referred to the 
Secretary whose determination will be final as to the amount of said 
damage.


<R05>
Sec. 162.501  Fort Belknap Reservation.

    Not to exceed 20,000 acres of allotted and tribal lands (non-
irrigable as well as irrigable) on the Fort Belknap Reservation in 
Montana may be leased for the culture of sugar beets and other crops in 
rotation for terms not exceeding ten years.


<R05>
Sec. 162.502  Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Reservations, California.

    (a) Upon a determination by the Secretary that the owner or owners 
are not making beneficial use thereof, restricted lands on the Cabazon, 
Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations which are or may be 
irrigated from distribution facilities administered by the Coachella 
Valley County Water District in Riverside County, California, may be 
leased by the Secretary in accordance with the regulations in this part 
for the benefit of the owner or owners.
    (b) All leases granted or approved on restricted lands of the 
Cabazon, Augustine, and Torres-Martinez Indian Reservations shall be 
filed for record in the office of the county recorder of the county in 
which the land is located, the cost thereof to be paid by the lessee. A 
copy of each such lease shall be filed by the lessee with the Coachella 
Valley County Water District or such other irrigation or water district 
within which the leased lands are located. All such leases shall include 
a provision that the lessee, in addition to the rentals provided for in 
the lease, shall pay all irrigation charges properly assessed against 
the land which became payable during the term of the lease. Act of 
August 25, 1950 (64 Stat. 470); Act of August 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 968).


<R05>
Sec. 162.503  San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations.

    (a) Purpose and scope. The Act of November 2, 1966 (80 Stat. 1112), 
provides statutory authority for long-term leasing on the San Xavier and 
Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, Arizona, in addition to that 
contained in the Act of August 9, 1955 (69 Stat. 539), as amended (25 
U.S.C. 415). When leases are made under the 1955 Act on the San Xavier 
or Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, the regulations in part 162 
apply. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations for 
implementation of the 1966 Act. The 1966 Act does not apply to leases 
made for purposes that are subject to the laws governing mining leases 
on Indian lands.
    (b) Duration of leases. Leases made under the 1966 Act for public, 
religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes 
may be made for terms of not to exceed 99 years. The terms of a grazing 
lease shall not exceed ten years; the term of a farming lease that does 
not require the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of 
the land shall not exceed ten years; and the term of a farming lease 
that requires the making of a substantial investment in the improvement 
of the land shall not exceed 40 years. No lease shall contain an option 
to renew which extends the total term

[[Page 470]]

beyond the maximum term permitted by this section.
    (c) Required covenant and enforcement thereof. Every lease under the 
1966 Act shall contain a covenant on the part of the lessee that he will 
not commit or permit on the leased land any act that causes waste or a 
nuisance or which creates a hazard to health of persons or to property 
wherever such persons or property may be.
    (d) Notification regarding leasing proposals. If the Secretary 
determines that a proposed lease to be made under the 1966 Act for 
public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business 
purposes will substantially affect the governmental interests of a 
municipality contiguous to the San Xavier Reservation or the Salt River 
Pima-Maricopa Reservation, as the case may be, he shall notify the 
appropriate authority of such municipality of the pendency of the 
proposed lease. The Secretary may, in his discretion, furnish such 
municipality with an outline of the major provisions of the lease which 
affect its governmental interests and shall consider any comments on the 
terms of the lease affecting the municipality or on the absence of such 
terms from the lease that the authorities may offer. The notice to the 
authorities of the municipality shall set forth a reasonable period, not 
to exceed 30 days, within which any such comments shall be submitted.
    (e) Applicability of other regulations. The regulations in part 162 
of this title shall apply to leases made under the 1966 Act except where 
such regulations are inconsistent with this section.
    (f) Mission San Xavier del Bac. Nothing in the 1966 Act authorizes 
development that would detract from the scenic, historic, and religious 
values of the Mission San Xavier del Bac owned by the Franciscan Order 
of Friars Minor and located on the San Xavier Reservation.

<R05>
Sec. 162.604  Special requirements and provisions.

    (a) All leases made pursuant to the regulations in this part shall 
be in the form approved by the Secretary and subject to his written 
approval.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this part no lease shall be 
approved or granted at less than the present fair annual rental.
    (1) An adult Indian owner of trust or restricted land may lease his 
land for religious, educational, recreational or other public purposes 
to religious organizations or to agencies of the federal, state or local 
government at a nominal rental. Such adult Indian may lease land to 
members of his immediate family with or without rental consideration.
    (2) In the discretion of the Secretary, tribal land may be leased at 
a nominal rental for religious, educational, recreational, or other 
public purposes to religious organizations or to agencies of federal, 
state, or local governments; for purposes of subsidization for the 
benefit of the tribe; and for homesite purposes to tribal members 
provided the land is not commercial or industrial in character.
    (3) Leases may be granted or approved by the Secretary at less than 
the fair annual rental when in his judgment such action would be in the 
best interest of the landowners.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided by the Secretary a satisfactory surety 
bond will be required in an amount that will reasonably assure 
performance of the contractual obligations under the lease. Such bond 
may be for the purpose of guaranteeing:
    (1) Not less than one year's rental unless the lease contract 
provides that the annual rental shall be paid in advance.
    (2) The estimated construction cost of any improvement to be placed 
on the land by the lessee.
    (3) An amount estimated to be adequate to insure compliance with any 
additional contractual obligations.
    (d) The lessee may be required to provide insurance in an amount 
adequate to protect any improvements on the leased premises; the lessee 
may also be required to furnish appropriate liability insurance, and 
such other insurance as may be necessary to protect the lessor's 
interest.
    (e) No lease shall provide the lessee a preference right to future 
leases nor shall any lease contain provisions for renewal, except as 
otherwise provided in this part. No lease shall be entered into more 
than 12 months prior to the commencement of the term of the lease. 
Except with the approval of the Secretary no lease shall provide for 
payment of rent in advance of the beginning of the annual use period for 
which such rent is paid. The lease contract shall contain provisions as 
to the dates rents shall become due and payable.
    (f) Leases granted or approved under this part shall contain 
provisions as to whether payment of rentals is to be made direct to the 
owner of the land or his representative or to the official of the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction over the leased premises.
    (g) All leases issued under this part shall contain the following 
provisions:
    (1) While the leased premises are in trust or restricted status, all 
of the lessee's obligations under this lease, and the obligations of his 
sureties, are to the United States as well as to the owner of the land.
    (2) Nothing contained in this lease shall operate to delay or 
prevent a termination of federal trust responsibilities with respect to 
the land by the issuance of a fee patent or otherwise during the term of 
the lease; however, such termination shall not serve to abrogate the 
lease. The owners of the land and the lessee and his surety or sureties 
shall be notified of any such change in the status of the land.
    (3) The lessee agrees that he will not use or cause to be used any 
part of the leased premises for any unlawful conduct or purpose.

[[Page 472]]

    (h) Leases granted or approved under this part on individually owned 
lands which provide for payment of rental direct to the owner or his 
representative shall contain the following provisions:
    (1) In the event of the death of the owner during the term of this 
lease and while the leased premises are in trust or restricted status, 
all rentals remaining due or payable to the decedent or his 
representative under the provisions of the lease shall be paid to the 
official of the Bureau of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction over the 
leased premises.
    (2) While the leased premises are in trust or restricted status, the 
Secretary may in his discretion suspend the direct rental payment 
provisions of this lease in which event the rentals shall be paid to the 
official of the Bureau of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction over the 
leased premises.


<R05>
Sec. 162.605  Negotiation of leases.

    (a) Leases of individually owned land or tribal land may be 
negotiated by those owners or their representatives who may execute 
leases pursuant to Sec. 162.602 of this subpart.
    (b) Where the owners of a majority interest, or their 
representatives, who may grant leases under Sec. 162.602 of this 
subpart, have negotiated a lease satisfactory to the Secretary he may 
join in the execution of the lease and thereby commit the interests of 
those persons in whose behalf he is authorized to grant leases under 
Sec. 162.601(a)(1), (2), (3), and (5) of this subpart.
    (c) Where the Secretary may grant leases under Sec. 162.601 of this 
subpart he may negotiate leases when in his judgment the fair annual 
rental can thus be obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 162.606  Advertisement.

    Except as otherwise provided in this part, prior to granting a lease 
or permit as authorized under Sec. 162.601 of this subpart the 
Secretary shall advertise the land for lease. Advertisements will call 
for sealed bids and will not offer preference rights.


<R05>
Sec. 162.607  Duration of leases.

    Leases granted or approved under this part shall be limited to the 
minimum duration, commensurate with the purpose of the lease, that will 
allow the highest economic return to the owner consistent with prudent 
management and conservation practices, and except as otherwise provided 
in this part shall not exceed the number of years provided for in this 
section. Except for those leases authorized by Sec. 162.604(b)(1) and 
(2) of this subpart, unless the consideration for the lease is based 
primarily on percentages of income produced by the land, the lease shall 
provide for periodic review, at not less than five-year intervals, of 
the equities involved. Such review shall give consideration to the 
economic conditions at the time, exclusive of improvement or development 
required by the contract or the contribution value of such improvements. 
Any adjustments of rental resulting from such review may be made by the 
Secretary where he has the authority to grant leases, otherwise the 
adjustment must be made with the written concurrence of the owners and 
the approval of the Secretary.
    (a) Leases for public, religious, educational, recreational, 
residential, or business purposes shall not exceed 25 years but may 
include provisions authorizing a renewal or an extension for one 
additional term of not to exceed 25 years, except such leases of land on 
the Hollywood (formerly Dania) Reservation, Fla.; the Navajo 
Reservation, Ariz., N. Mex., and Utah; the Palm Springs Reservation, 
Calif.; the Southern Ute Reservation, Colo.; the Fort Mohave 
Reservation, Calif., Ariz., and Nev.; the Pyramid Lake Reservation, 
Nev.; the Gila River Reservation, Ariz.; the San Carlos Apache 
Reservation, Ariz.; the Spokane Reservation, Wash.; the Hualapai 
Reservation, Ariz.; the Swinomish Reservation, Wash.; the Pueblos of 
Cochiti, Pojoaque, Tesuque, and Zuni, N. Mex.; and land on the Colorado 
River Reservation, Ariz., and Calif.; which leases may be made for terms 
of not to exceed 99 years.
    (b) Leases granted by the Secretary pursuant to Sec. 162.601(a)(3) 
of this subpart shall be for a term of not to exceed two years except as 
otherwise provided in Sec. 162.605(b) of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.608  Ownership of improvements.

    Improvements placed on the leased land shall become the property of 
the

[[Page 473]]

lessor unless specifically excepted therefrom under the terms of the 
lease. The lease shall specify the maximum time allowed for removal of 
any improvements so excepted.


<R05>
Sec. 162.609  Unitization for leasing.

    Where it appears advantageous to the owners and advantageous to the 
operation of the land a single lease contract may include more than one 
parcel of land in separate ownerships, tribal or individual, provided 
the statutory authorities and other applicable requirements of this part 
are observed.


<R05>
Sec. 162.610  Subleases and assignments.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section, a sublease, assignment, amendment or encumbrance of any lease 
or permit issued under this part may be made only with the approval of 
the Secretary and the written consent of all parties to such lease or 
permit, including the surety or sureties.
    (b) With the consent of the Secretary, the lease may contain a 
provision authorizing the lessee to sublease the premises, in whole or 
in part, without further approval. Subleases so made shall not serve to 
relieve the sublessor from any liability nor diminish any supervisory 
authority of the Secretary provided for under the approved lease.
    (c) With the consent of the Secretary, the lease may contain 
provisions authorizing the lessee to encumber his leasehold interest in 
the premises for the purpose of borrowing capital for the development 
and improvement of the leased premises. The encumbrance instrument, must 
be approved by the Secretary. If a sale or foreclosure under the 
approved encumbrance occurs and the encumbrancer is the purchaser, he 
may assign the leasehold without the approval of the Secretary or the 
consent of the other parties to the lease, provided, however, that the 
assignee accepts and agrees in writing to be bound by all the terms and 
conditions of the lease. If the purchaser is a party other than the 
encumbrancer, approval by the Secretary of any assignment will be 
required, and such purchaser will be bound by the terms of the lease and 
will assume in writing all the obligations thereunder.
    (d) With the consent of the Secretary, leases of tribal land to 
individual members of the tribe or to tribal housing authorities may 
contain provisions permitting the assignment of the lease without 
further consent or approval where a lending institution or an agency of 
the United States makes, insures or guarantees a loan to an individual 
member of the tribe or to a tribal housing authority for the purpose of 
providing funds for the construction of housing for Indians on the 
leased premises; provided, the leasehold has been pledged as security 
for the loan and the lender has obtained the leasehold by foreclosure or 
otherwise. Such leases may with the consent of the Secretary also 
contain provisions permitting the lessee to assign the lease without 
further consent or approval.


<R05>
Sec. 162.611  Payment of fees and drainage and irrigation charges.

    (a) Any lease covering lands within an irrigation project or 
drainage district shall require the lessee to pay annually on or before 
the due date, during the term of the lease and in the amounts 
determined, all charges assessed against such lands. Such charges shall 
be in addition to the rental payments prescribed in the lease. All 
payments of such charges and penalties shall be made to the official 
designated in the lease to receive such payments.
    (b) We will charge an administrative fee each time we approve an 
agricultural lease, amendment, assignment, sublease, mortgage, or 
related document. These fees will be paid by the tenant, assignee, or 
subtenant, to cover our costs in preparing or processing the documents 
and administering the lease.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, we will 
charge administrative fees based on the rent payable under the lease. 
The fee will be 3% of the annual rent payable, including any percentage 
or cropshare rent that can be reasonably estimated.
    (d) The minimum administrative fee is $10.00 and the maximum 
administrative fee is $500.00, and any administrative fees that have 
been paid will be non-refundable. However, we may

[[Page 474]]

waive all or part of these administrative fees, in our discretion.
    (e) If all or part of the expenses of the work are paid from tribal 
funds, the tribe may establish an additional or alternate schedule of 
fees.


<R05>
Sec. 162.612  Can a lease provide for negotiated remedies in the event 

of a violation?

    (a) A lease of tribal land may provide the tribe with certain 
negotiated remedies in the event of a lease violation, including the 
power to terminate the lease. A lease of individually-owned land may 
provide the individual Indian landowners with similar remedies, so long 
as the lease also specifies the manner in which those remedies may be 
exercised by or on behalf of the landowners.
    (b) The negotiated remedies described in paragraph (a) of this 
section will apply in addition to the cancellation remedy available to 
us under Sec. 162.619(c) of this subpart. If the lease specifically 
authorizes us to exercise any negotiated remedies on behalf of the 
Indian landowners, the exercise of such remedies may substitute for 
cancellation.
    (c) A lease may provide for lease disputes to be resolved in tribal 
court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or through 
arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution method. We may 
not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to 
ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any 
of the remedies available to us under Sec. 162.619 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.613  Will BIA notify a tenant when a rent payment is due under a lease?

    We may issue bills or invoices to a tenant in advance of the dates 
on which rent payments are due under a lease, but the tenant's 
obligation to make such payments in a timely manner will not be excused 
if such bills or invoices are not delivered or received.


<R05>
Sec. 162.614  Will untimely rent payments made under a lease be subject

to interest charges or late payment penalties?

    A lease must specify the rate at which interest will accrue on any 
rent payment not made by the due date or any other date specified in the 
lease. A lease may also identify additional late payment penalties that 
will apply if a rent payment is not made by a specified date. Unless 
otherwise provided in the lease, such interest charges and late payment 
penalties will apply in the absence of any specific notice to the tenant 
from us or the Indian landowners, and the failure to pay such amounts 
will be treated as a lease violation under Sec. 162.618 of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 162.615  What will BIA do if rent payments are not made in the time 

and manner required by a lease?

    (a) A tenant's failure to pay rent in the time and manner required 
by a lease will be a violation of the lease, and a notice of violation 
will be issued under Sec. 162.618 of this subpart. If the lease 
requires that rent payments be made to us, we will send the tenant and 
its sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the date 
on which the rent payment was due. If the lease provides for payment 
directly to the Indian landowners, we will send the tenant and its 
sureties a notice of violation within five business days of the date on 
which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the landowners.
    (b) If a tenant fails to provide adequate proof of payment or cure 
the violation within the requisite time period described in Sec. 
162.618(b) of this subpart, and the amount due is not in dispute, we may 
immediately take action to recover the amount of the unpaid rent and any 
associated interest charges or late payment penalties. We may also 
cancel the lease under Sec. 162.619 of this subpart, or invoke any 
other remedies available under the lease or applicable law, including 
collection on any available bond or referral of the debt to the 
Department of the Treasury for collection. An action to recover any 
unpaid amounts will not be conditioned on the prior cancellation of the 
lease or any further notice to the tenant, nor will such an action be 
precluded by a prior cancellation.
    (c) Partial payments and underpayments may be accepted by the Indian 
landowners or us, but acceptance will not operate as a waiver with 
respect to any amounts remaining unpaid or any

[[Page 475]]

other existing lease violations. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, 
overpayments may be credited as an advance against future rent payments, 
or refunded.
    (d) If a personal or business check is dishonored, and a rent 
payment is therefore not made by the due date, the failure to make the 
payment in a timely manner will be a violation of the lease, and a 
notice of violation will be issued under Sec. 162.618 of this subpart. 
Any payment made to cure such a violation, and any future payments by 
the same tenant, must be made by an alternative payment method approved 
by us.


<R05>
Sec. 162.616  Will any special fees be assessed on delinquent rent

payments due under a lease?

    The following special fees will be assessed if rent is not paid in 
the time and manner required, in addition to any interest or late 
payment penalties that must be paid to the Indian landowners under a 
lease. The following special fees will be assessed to cover 
administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of 
the debt:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
       The tenant will pay * * *                    For * * *
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) $50.00.............................  Administrative fee for
                                          dishonored checks.
(b) $15.00.............................  Administrative fee for BIA
                                          processing of each notice or
                                          demand letter.
(c) 18% of balance due.................  Administrative fee charged by
                                          Treasury following referral
                                          for collection of delinquent
                                          debt.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 162.617  How will BIA determine whether the activities of a 

tenant under a lease are in compliance with the terms of the lease?

    (a) Unless a lease provides otherwise, we may enter the leased 
premises at any reasonable time, without prior notice, to protect the 
interests of the Indian landowners and ensure that the tenant is in 
compliance with the operating requirements of the lease.
    (b) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific lease 
violation has occurred, we will initiate an appropriate investigation 
within five business days of that notification.


<R05>
Sec. 162.618  What will BIA do in the event of a violation under a lease?

    (a) If we determine that a lease has been violated, we will send the 
tenant and its sureties a notice of violation within five business days 
of that determination. The notice of violation must be provided by 
certified mail, return receipt requested.
    (b) Within ten business days of the receipt of a notice of 
violation, the tenant must:
    (1) Cure the violation and notify us in writing that the violation 
has been cured;
    (2) Dispute our determination that a violation has occurred and/or 
explain why we should not cancel the lease; or
    (3) Request additional time to cure the violation.


<R05>
Sec. 162.619  What will BIA do if a violation of a lease is not cured 

within the requisite time period?

    (a) If the tenant does not cure a violation of a lease within the 
requisite time period, we will consult with the Indian landowners, as 
appropriate, and determine whether:
    (1) The lease should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this 
section and Sec. Sec. 162.620 through 162.621 of this subpart;
    (2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the 
lease, including collecting on any available bond;
    (3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to 
them under the lease; or
    (4) The tenant should be granted additional time in which to cure 
the violation.
    (b) If we decide to grant a tenant additional time in which to cure 
a violation, the tenant must proceed diligently to complete the 
necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time 
period from the date on which the extension is granted.
    (c) If we decide to cancel the lease, we will send the tenant and 
its sureties a cancellation letter within five business days of that 
decision. The cancellation letter must be sent to the tenant by 
certified mail, return receipt requested. We will also provide actual or 
constructive notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, 
as

[[Page 476]]

appropriate. The cancellation letter will:
    (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;
    (2) Notify the tenant of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest 
charges, or late payment penalties due under the lease;
    (3) Notify the tenant of its right to appeal under part 2 of this 
chapter, as modified by Sec. 162.620 of this subpart, including the 
amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the 
cancellation decision; and
    (4) Order the tenant to vacate the property within 30 days of the 
date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by 
that time.


<R05>
Sec. 162.620  Will BIA's regulations concerning appeal bonds apply 

to cancellation decisions involving leases?

    (a) The appeal bond provisions in Sec. 2.5 of part 2 of this 
chapter will not apply to appeals from lease cancellation decisions made 
under Sec. 162.619 of this subpart. Instead, when we decide to cancel 
an agricultural lease, we may require that the tenant post an appeal 
bond with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to 
post an appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other 
requirements in part 2 of this chapter.
    (b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect 
the Indian landowners against financial losses that will likely result 
from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be 
separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the 
lease cancellation decision.


<R05>
Sec. 162.621  When will a cancellation of a lease be effective?

    A cancellation decision involving an agricultural lease will not be 
effective until 30 days after the tenant receives a cancellation letter 
from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the tenant 
files an appeal under Sec. 162.620 of this subpart and part 2 of this 
chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. 
While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the tenant must continue 
to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the lease. If an appeal 
is not filed in accordance with Sec. 162.620 of this subpart and part 2 
of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st 
day after the tenant receives the cancellation letter from us.


<R05>
Sec. 162.622  Can BIA take emergency action if the leased premises are 

threatened with immediate and significant harm?

    If a tenant or any other party causes or threatens to cause 
immediate and significant harm to the leased premises during the term of 
a lease, we will take appropriate emergency action. Emergency action may 
include judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the activity 
resulting in or threatening the harm. Reasonable efforts will be made to 
notify the Indian landowners, either before or after the emergency 
action is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 162.623  What will BIA do if a tenant holds over after the expiration 

or cancellation of a lease?

    If a tenant remains in possession after the expiration or 
cancellation of a lease, we will treat the unauthorized use as a 
trespass. Unless we have reason to believe that the tenant is engaged in 
negotiations with the Indian landowners to obtain a new lease, we will 
take action to recover possession on behalf of the Indian landowners, 
and pursue any additional remedies available under applicable law.

determined by the approving officer, in connection with the use of 
forest products by Indian tribal forest enterprises pursuant to this 
part in Sec. 163.13 or in timber cutting permits issued pursuant to 
Sec. 163.26 of this part.
    (1) In sales in which the estimated stumpage value, calculated at 
the appraised stumpage rates, does not exceed $15,000, the bond shall be 
at least 20 percent of the estimated stumpage value.
    (2) In sales in which the estimated stumpage value exceeds $15,000 
but is not over $150,000, the bond shall be at least 15 percent of the 
estimated stumpage value but not less than $3,000.
    (3) In sales in which the estimated stumpage value exceeds $150,000,

<R05>
Sec. 163.22  Payment for forest products.

    (a) The basis of volume determination for forest products sold shall 
be the Scribner Decimal C log rules, cubic volume, lineal measurement, 
piece count, weight, or such other form of measurement as the Secretary 
may authorize for use. With the exception of Indian tribal forest 
enterprises pursuant to Sec. 163.13 of this part, payment for forest 
products will be required in advance of cutting for timber, or removal 
for other forest products.
    (b) Upon the request of an Indian tribe, the Secretary may provide 
that the purchaser of the forest products of such tribe, which are 
harvested under a timber sale contract, permit, or other harvest sale 
document to make advanced deposits, or direct payments of the gross 
proceeds of such forest products, less any amounts segregated as forest 
management deductions pursuant to Sec. 163.25 of this part, into 
accounts designated by such Indian tribe. Such accounts may be in one or 
more of the following formats:
    (1) Escrow accounts at a tribally designated financial institution 
for receiving deposits with bids and advance deposits from which direct 
disbursements for timber harvested shall be made to tribes and forest 
management deductions accounts; or
    (2) Tribal depository accounts for receiving advance payments, 
installment payments, payments from Indian tribal forest enterprises, 
and/or disbursements from advance deposit accounts or escrow accounts.

[[Page 486]]

    (c) The format must allow the Secretary to maintain trust 
responsibility through written verification that all required deposits, 
payments, and disbursements have been made.
    (d) Terms and conditions for payment of forest products under lump 
sum (predetermined volume) sales shall be specified in forest product 
contract documents.


<R05>
Sec. 163.23  Advance payment for timber products.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, and except in the 
case of lump sum (predetermined volume) sales, contracts for the sale of 
timber from allotted, trust or restricted Indian forest land shall 
provide for an advance payment of up to 25 percent of the stumpage 
value, calculated at the bid price, within 30 days from the date of 
approval and before cutting begins. Additional advance payments may be 
specified in contracts. However, no advance payment will be required 
that would make the sum of such payment and of advance deposits and 
advance payments previously applied against timber cut from each 
ownership in a sale exceed 50 percent of the bid stumpage value. Advance 
payments shall be credited against the timber of each ownership in the 
sale as the timber is cut and scaled at stumpage rates governing at the 
time of scaling. Advance payments are not refundable.
    (b) Advance payments may be required on tribal land. When required, 
advance payments will operate the same as provided for in Sec. 
163.23(a) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 163.24  Duration of timber contracts.

    After the effective date of a forest product contract, unless 
otherwise authorized by the Secretary, the maximum period which shall be 
allowed for harvesting the estimated volume of timber purchased, shall 
be five years.


<R05>
Sec. 163.25  Forest management deductions.

    (a) Pursuant to the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 413 and 25 U.S.C. 3105, 
a forest management deduction shall be withheld from the gross proceeds 
of sales of forest products harvested from Indian forest land as 
described in this section.
    (b) Gross proceeds shall mean the value in money or money's worth of 
consideration furnished by the purchaser of forest products purchased 
under a contract, permit, or other document for the sale of forest 
products.
    (c) Forest management deductions shall not be withheld where the 
total consideration furnished under a contract, permit or other document 
for the sale of forest products is less than $5,001.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 163.25(e) of this part, the amount 
of the forest management deduction shall not exceed the lesser amount of 
ten percent (10%) of the gross proceeds or, the actual percentage in 
effect on November 28, 1990.
    (e) The Secretary may increase the forest management deduction 
percentage for Indian forest land upon receipt of a written request from 
a tribe supported by a resolution executed by the authorized tribal 
representatives. At the request of the authorized tribal representatives 
and at the discretion of the Secretary the forest management deduction 
percentage may be decreased to not less than one percent (1%) or the 
requirement for collection may be waived.
    (f) Forest management deductions are to be utilized to perform 
forest land management activities in accordance with an approved 
expenditure plan. Expenditure plans shall describe the forest land 
management activities anticipated to be undertaken, establish a time 
period for their completion, summarize anticipated obligations and 
expenditures, and specify the method through which funds are to be 
transferred or credited to tribal accounts from special deposit accounts 
established to hold amounts withheld as forest management deductions. 
Any forest management deductions that have not been incorporated into an 
approved expenditure plan by the end of the fiscal year following the 
fiscal year in which the deductions are withheld, shall be collected 
into the general funds of the United States Treasury pursuant to 25 
U.S.C. 413.
    (1) For Indian forest lands located on an Indian reservation, a 
written expenditure plan for the use of forest

[[Page 487]]

management deductions shall be prepared annually and approved by the 
authorized tribal representative(s) and the Secretary. The approval of 
the expenditure plan by the authorized tribal representatives 
constitutes allocation of tribal funds for Indian forest land management 
activities. Approval of the expenditure plan by the Secretary shall 
constitute authority for crediting of forest management deductions to 
tribal account(s). The full amount of any deduction collected by the 
Secretary plus any income or interest earned thereon shall be available 
for expenditure according to the approved expenditure plan for the 
performance of forest land management activities on the reservation from 
which the forest management deduction is collected.
    (2) Forest management deductions shall be handled in the same manner 
as described under Sec. 163.25(f)(1) of this part if the expenditure 
plan approved by an Indian tribe and the Secretary provides for the 
conduct of forest land management activities on Indian forest lands 
located outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation.
    (3) For public domain and Alaska Native allotments held in trust for 
Indians by the United States, forest management deductions may be 
utilized to perform forest land management activities on such lands in 
accordance with an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary.
    (g) Forest management deductions withheld pursuant to this section 
shall not be available to cover the costs that are paid from funds 
appropriated for fire suppression or pest control or otherwise offset 
federal appropriations for meeting the Federal trust responsibility for 
management of Indian forest land.
    (h) Within 120 days after the close of the tribal fiscal year, 
tribes shall submit to the Secretary a written report detailing the 
actual expenditure of forest management deductions during the past 
fiscal year. The Secretary shall have the right to inspect accounts, 
books, or other tribal records supporting the report.
    (i) Forest management deductions incorporated into an expenditure 
plan approved by the Secretary shall remain available until expended.
    (j) As provided in Sec. 163.25(f) of this part, only forest 
management deductions that have not been incorporated into an approved 
expenditure plan may be deposited to a U.S. Treasury miscellaneous 
receipt account. No amount collected as forest management deductions 
shall be credited to any Federal appropriation. No other forest 
management deductions or fees derived from Indian forest land shall be 
collected to be covered into the general funds of the United States 
Treasury.


<R05>
Sec. 163.26  Forest product harvesting permits.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 163.13 and 163.27 of this part, 
removal of forest products that are not under formal contract, pursuant 
to Sec. 163.19, shall be under forest product harvesting permit forms 
approved by the Secretary. Permits will be issued only with the written 
consent of the beneficial Indian owner(s) or the Secretary, for harvest 
of forest products from Indian forest land, as authorized in Sec. 
163.20 of this part. To be valid, permits must be approved by the 
Secretary. Minimum stumpage rates at which forest products may be sold 
will be set at the time consent to issue the permit is obtained. Payment 
and bonding requirements will be stipulated in the permit document as 
appropriate.
    (b) Free use harvesting permits issued shall specify species and 
types of forest products to be removed. It may be stipulated that forest 
products removed under this authority cannot be sold or exchanged for 
other goods or services. The estimated value which may be harvested in a 
fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed 
$5,000. For the purpose of issuance of free use permits, individual 
shall mean an individual Indian or any organized group of Indians.
    (c) Paid permits subject to forest management deductions, as 
provided in Sec. 163.25 of this part, may be issued. Unless otherwise 
authorized by the Secretary, the stumpage value which may be harvested 
under paid permits in a fiscal year by any individual under this 
authority shall not exceed $25,000. For the purpose of issuance of paid 
permits, individual shall mean an individual or

[[Page 488]]

any operating entity comprised of more than one individual.
    (d) A Special Allotment Timber Harvest Permit may be issued to an 
Indian having sole beneficial interest in an allotment to harvest and 
sell designated forest products from his or her allotment. The special 
permit shall include provision for payment by the Indian of forest 
management deductions pursuant to Sec. 163.25 of this part. Unless 
waived by the Secretary, the permit shall also require the Indian to 
make a bond deposit with the Secretary as required by Sec. 163.21. Such 
bonds will be returned to the Indian upon satisfactory completion of the 
permit or will be used by the Secretary in his or her discretion for 
planting or other work to offset damage to the land or the timber caused 
by failure to comply with the provisions of the permit. As a condition 
to granting a special permit under authority of this paragraph, the 
Indian shall be required to provide evidence acceptable to the Secretary 
that he or she has arranged a bona fide sale of the forest products, on 
terms that will protect the Indian's interests.


<R05>
Sec. 163.27  Free-use harvesting without permits.

    With the consent of the beneficial Indian owners and the Secretary, 
Indians may harvest designated types of forest products from Indian 
forest land without a permit or contract, and without charge. Forest 
products harvested under this authority shall be for the Indian's 
personal use, and shall not be sold or exchanged for other goods or 
services.


<R05>
Sec. 163.28  Fire management measures.

    (a) The Secretary is authorized to maintain facilities and staff, 
hire temporary labor, rent fire fighting equipment, purchase tools and 
supplies, and pay for their transportation as needed, to maintain an 
adequate level of readiness to meet normal wildfire protection needs and 
extinguish forest or range fires on Indian land. No expenses for 
fighting a fire outside Indian lands may be incurred unless the fire 
threatens Indian land or unless the expenses are incurred pursuant to an 
approved cooperative agreement with another protection agency. The rates 
of pay for fire fighters and for equipment rental shall be the rates for 
fire fighting services that are currently in use by public and private 
wildfire protection agencies adjacent to Indian reservations on which a 
fire occurs, unless there are in effect at the time different rates that 
have been approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may also enter into 
reciprocal agreements with any fire organization maintaining protection 
facilities in the vicinity of Indian reservations or other Indian land 
for mutual aid in wildfire protection. This section does not apply to 
the rendering of emergency aid, or agreements for mutual aid in fire 
protection pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (69 Stat. 66).
    (b) The Secretary is authorized to conduct a wildfire prevention 
program to reduce the number of person-caused fires and prevent damage 
to natural resources on Indian land.
    (c) The Secretary is authorized to expend funds for emergency 
rehabilitation measures needed to stabilize soil and watershed on Indian 
land damaged by wildfire.
    (d) Upon consultation with the beneficial Indian owners, the 
Secretary may use fire as a management tool on Indian land to achieve 
land and/or resource management objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 163.29  Trespass.

    (a) Trespassers will be liable for civil penalties and damages to 
the enforcement agency and the beneficial Indian owners, and will be 
subject to prosecution for acts of trespass.
    (1) Cases in Tribal Court. For trespass actions brought in tribal 
court pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil 
penalties, remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this Sec. 
163.29 of this part. All other aspects of a tribal trespass prosecution 
brought under these regulations will be that prescribed by the law of 
the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass 
was committed, unless otherwise prescribed under federal law. Absent 
applicable tribal or federal law, the measure of damages shall be that 
prescribed by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed.
    (2) Cases in Federal Court. For trespass actions brought in Federal 
court

[[Page 489]]

pursuant to these regulations, the measure of damages, civil penalties, 
remedies and procedures will be as set forth in this Sec. 163.29. In 
the absence of applicable federal law, the measure shall be that 
prescribed by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose 
jurisdiction the trespass was committed, or in the absence of tribal 
law, the law of the state in which it was committed.
    (3) Civil penalties for trespass include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Treble damages, whenever any person, without lawful authority 
injures, severs, or carries off from a reservation any forest product as 
defined in Sec. 163.1 of this part. Proof of Indian ownership of the 
premises and commission of the acts by the trespasser are prima facie 
evidence sufficient to support liability for treble damages, with no 
requirement to show willfulness or intent. Treble damages shall be based 
upon the highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials 
involved in the trespass.
    (ii) Payment of costs associated with damage to Indian forest land 
includes, but is not limited to, rehabilitation, reforestation, lost 
future revenue and lost profits, loss of productivity, and damage to 
other forest resources.
    (iii) Payment of all reasonable costs associated with the 
enforcement of these trespass regulations beginning with detection and 
including all processes through the prosecution and collection of 
damages, including but not limited to field examination and survey, 
damage appraisal, investigation assistance and reports, witness 
expenses, demand letters, court costs, and attorney fees.
    (iv) Interest calculated at the statutory rate prescribed by the law 
of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the 
trespass was committed, or in the absence of tribal law in the amount 
prescribed by federal law. Where tribal law or federal law does not 
supply a statutory interest rate, the rate of interest shall be 
statutory rate upon judgments as prescribed by the law of the state in 
which the trespass was committed. Interest shall be based on treble the 
highest stumpage value obtainable from the raw materials involved in the 
trespass, and calculated from the date of the trespass until payment is 
rendered.
    (b) Any cash or other proceeds realized from forfeiture of equipment 
or other goods or from forest products damaged or taken in the trespass 
shall be applied to satisfy civil penalties and other damages identified 
under Sec. 163.29(a) of this part. After disposition of real and 
personal property to pay civil penalties and damages resulting from 
trespass, any residual funds shall be returned to the trespasser. In the 
event that collection and forfeiture actions taken against the 
trespasser result in less than full recovery, civil penalties shall be 
distributed as follows:
    (1) Collection of damages up to the highest stumpage value of the 
trespass products shall be distributed pro rata between the Indian 
beneficial owners and any costs and expenses needed to restore the 
trespass land; or
    (2) Collections exceeding the highest stumpage value of the trespass 
product, but less than full recovery, shall be proportionally 
distributed pro rata between the Indian beneficial owners, the law 
enforcement agency, and the cost to restore the trespass land. Forest 
management deductions shall not be withheld where less than the highest 
stumpage value of the unprocessed forest products taken in trespass has 
been recovered.
    (c) Indian beneficial owners who trespass, or who are involved in 
trespass upon their own land, or undivided land in which such owners 
have a partial interest, shall not receive their beneficial share of any 
civil penalties and damages collected in consequence of the trespass. 
Any civil penalties and damages defaulted in consequence of this 
provision instead shall be distributed first toward restoration of the 
land subject of the trespass and second toward costs of the enforcement 
agency in consequence of the trespass, with any remainder to the forest 
management deduction account of the reservation in which the trespass 
took place.
    (d) Civil penalties and other damages collected under these 
regulations, except for penalties and damages provided for in Sec. Sec. 
163.29(a)(3) (ii) and (iii) of this part, shall be treated as proceeds 
from the sale of forest products from

[[Page 490]]

the Indian forest land upon which the trespass occurred.
    (e) When a federal official or authorized tribal representative 
pursuant to Sec. 163.29(j) of this part has reason to believe that 
Indian forest products are involved in trespass, such individual may 
seize and take possession of the forest products involved in the 
trespass if the products are located on reservation. When forest 
products are seized, the person seizing the products must at the time of 
the seizure issue a Notice of Seizure to the possessor or claimant of 
the forest products. The Notice of Seizure shall indicate the date of 
the seizure, a description of the forest products seized, the estimated 
value of forest products seized, an indication of whether the forest 
products are perishable, and the name and authority of the person 
seizing the forest products. Where the official initiates seizure under 
these regulations only, the Notice of Seizure shall further include the 
statement that any challenge or objection to the seizure shall be 
exclusively through administrative appeal pursuant to part 2 of title 
25, and shall provide the name and the address of the official with whom 
the appeal may be filed. Alternately, an official may exercise 
concurrent tribal seizure authority under these regulations using 
applicable tribal law. In such case, the Notice of Seizure shall 
identify the tribal law under which the seizure may be challenged, if 
any. A copy of a Notice of Seizure shall be given to the possessor or 
claimant at the time of the seizure. If the claimant or possessor is 
unknown or unavailable, Notice of Seizure shall be posted on the 
trespass property, and a copy of the Notice shall be kept with any 
incident report generated by the official seizing the forest products. 
If the property seized is perishable and will lose substantial value if 
not sold or otherwise disposed of, the representative of the Secretary, 
or authorized tribal representative where deferral has been requested, 
may cause the forest products to be sold. Such sale action shall not be 
stayed by the filing of an administrative appeal nor by a challenge of 
the seizure action through a tribal forum. All proceeds from the sale of 
the forest products shall be placed into an escrow account and held 
until adjudication or other resolution of the underlying trespass. If it 
is found that the forest products seized were involved in a trespass, 
the proceeds shall be applied to the amount of civil penalties and 
damages awarded. If it is found that a trespass has not occurred or the 
proceeds are in excess of the amount of the judgment awarded, the 
proceeds or excess proceeds shall be returned to the possessor or 
claimant.
    (f) When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are 
involved in trespass and that such products have been removed to land 
not under federal or tribal government supervision, the federal official 
or authorized tribal representative pursuant to Sec. 163.29(k) of this 
part responsible for the trespass shall immediately provide the 
following notice to the owner of the land or the party in possession of 
the trespass products:
    (1) That such products could be Indian trust property involved in a 
trespass; and
    (2) That removal or disposition of the forest products may result in 
criminal and/or civil action by the United States or tribe.
    (g) A representative of the Secretary or authorized tribal 
representative pursuant to Sec. 163.29(j) of this part will promptly 
determine if a trespass has occurred. The appropriate representative 
will issue an official Notice of Trespass to the alleged trespasser and, 
if necessary, the possessor or potential buyer of any trespass products. 
The Notice is intended to inform the trespasser, buyer, or the 
processor:
    (1) That a determination has been made that a trespass has occurred;
    (2) The basis for the determination;
    (3) An assessment of the damages, penalties and costs;
    (4) Of the seizure of forest products, if applicable; and
    (5) That disposition or removal of Indian forest products taken in 
the trespass may result in civil and/or criminal action by the United 
States or the tribe.
    (h) The Secretary may accept payment of damages in the settlement of 
civil trespass cases. In the absence of a court order, the Secretary 
will determine the procedure and approve acceptance of any settlements 
negotiated

[[Page 491]]

by a tribe exercising its concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to Sec. 
163.29(j) of this part.
    (i) The Secretary may delegate by written agreement or contract, 
responsibility for detection and investigation of forest trespass.
    (j) Indian tribes that adopt the regulations set forth in this 
section, conformed as necessary to tribal law, shall have concurrent 
civil jurisdiction to enforce 25 U.S.C. 3106 and this section against 
any person.
    (1) The Secretary shall acknowledge said concurrent civil 
jurisdiction over trespass, upon:
    (i) Receipt of a formal tribal resolution documenting the tribe's 
adoption of this section; and
    (ii) Notification of the ability of the tribal court system to 
properly adjudicate forest trespass cases, including a statement that 
the tribal court will enforce the Indian Civil Rights Act or a tribal 
civil rights law that contains provisions for due process and equal 
protection that are similar to or stronger than those contained in the 
Indian Civil Rights Act.
    (2) Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction 
over trespass cases as set forth in Sec. 163.29(j)(1) of this part, the 
Secretary and tribe's authorized representatives will be jointly 
responsible to coordinate prosecution of trespass actions. The Secretary 
shall, upon timely request of the tribe, defer prosecution of forest 
trespasses to the tribe. Where said deferral is not requested, the 
designated Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry trespass official shall 
coordinate with the authorized forest trespass official of each tribe 
the exercise of concurrent tribal and Federal trespass jurisdiction as 
to each trespass. Such officials shall review each case, determine in 
which forums to recommend bringing an action, and promptly provide their 
recommendation to the Federal officials responsible for initiating and 
prosecuting forest trespass cases. Where an Indian tribe has acquired 
concurrent civil jurisdiction, but does not request deferral of 
prosecution, the federal officials responsible for initiating and 
prosecuting such cases may file and prosecute the action in the tribal 
court or forum.
    (3) The Secretary may rescind an Indian tribe's concurrent civil 
jurisdiction over trespass cases under this regulation if the Secretary 
or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the tribal court 
has not adhered to the due process or equal protection requirements of 
the Indian Civil Rights Act. If it is determined that said rescission is 
justified, the Secretary shall provide written Notice of the rescission, 
including the findings justifying the rescission and the steps needed to 
remedy the violations causing the rescission, to the chief judge of the 
tribal judiciary or other authorized tribal official should there be no 
chief judge. If said steps are not taken within 60 days, the Secretary's 
rescission of concurrent civil jurisdiction shall become final. The 
affected tribe(s) may appeal a Notice of Rescission under part 2 of 
title 25.
    (4) Nothing shall be construed to prohibit or in any way diminish 
the authority of a tribe to prosecute individuals under its criminal or 
civil trespass laws where it has jurisdiction over those individuals.


<R05>
Sec. 163.30  Revocable road use and construction permits for removal of commercial forest products.

    (a) In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 415 as amended, the Secretary may 
request tribes and/or other beneficial owners to sign revocable permits 
designating the Secretary as agent for the landowner and empowering him 
or her to issue revocable road use and construction permits to users for 
the purpose of removing forest products.
    (b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the 
Secretary may issue revocable road use and con- struction permits for 
removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the 
Secretary may act for individual owners when:
    (1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an 
interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis, and the 
Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, 
will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner, which cannot 
be adequately compensated for by monetary damages;

[[Page 492]]

    (2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or those with an 
interest therein are unknown so long as the majority of owner(s) of 
interests whose whereabouts are known, consent to the grant;
    (3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or 
interest have not been determined, and the Secretary finds the grant 
will cause no substantial injury to the land or any land owner; or
    (4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the 
Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the consent of the 
majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will 
cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner(s), that cannot be 
adequately compensated for by monetary damages.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall preclude acquisition of rights-of-
way over Indian lands, under 25 CFR part 169, or conflict with 
provisions of that part.


<R05>
Sec. 163.31  Insect and disease control.

    (a) The Secretary is authorized to protect and preserve Indian 
forest land from disease or insects (Sept. 20, 1922, Ch. 349, 42 Stat. 
857). The Secretary shall consult with the authorized tribal 
representatives and beneficial owners of Indian forest land concerning 
control actions.
    (b) The Secretary is responsible for controlling and mitigating 
harmful effects of insects and diseases on Indian forest land and will 
coordinate control actions with the Secretary of Agriculture in 
accordance with 92 Stat. 365, 16 U.S.C. 2101.


<R05>
Sec. 163.32  Forest development.

    Forest development pertains to forest land management activities 
undertaken to improve the sustainable productivity of commercial Indian 
forest land. The program shall consist of reforestation, timber stand 
improvement projects, and related investments to enhance productivity of 
commercial forest land with emphasis on accomplishing on-the-ground 
projects. Forest development funds will be used to re-establish, 
maintain, and/or improve growth of commercial timber species and control 
stocking levels on commercial forest land. Forest development activities 
will be planned and executed using benefit-cost analyses as one of the 
determinants in establishing priorities for project funding.


<R05>
Sec. 163.33  Administrative appeals.

    Any challenge to action under 25 CFR part 163 taken by an approving 
officer or subordinate official exercising delegated authority from the 
Secretary shall be exclusively through administrative appeal or as 
provided in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 
(Pub. L. 93-638, as amended). Such appeal(s) shall be filed in 
accordance with the provisions of 25 CFR part 2, Appeals from 
administrative actions, except that an appeal of any action under part 
163 of this title shall:
    (a) Not stay any action unless otherwise directed by the Secretary; 
and
    (b) Define ``interested party'' for purposes of bringing such an 
appeal or participating in such an appeal as any person whose own direct 
economic interest is adversely affected by an action or decision.


<R05>
Sec. 163.34  Environmental compliance.

    Actions taken by the Secretary under the regulations in this part 
must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 
applicable Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, and tribal laws 
and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 163.35  Indian forest land assistance account.

    (a) At the request of a tribe's authorized representatives, the 
Secretary may establish tribal-specific forest land assistance accounts 
within the trust fund system.

<R04>
                Subpart A_Purpose, Scope, and Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 166.1  What is the purpose and scope of this part?

    (a) The purpose of this part is to describe the authorities, 
policies, and procedures the BIA uses to approve, grant, and administer 
a permit for grazing on tribal land, individually-owned Indian land, or 
government land.
    (b) If the BIA's approval is not required for a permit, these 
regulations will not apply.
    (c) These regulations do not apply to any tribal land which is 
permitted under a corporate charter issued by us pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 
Sec. 477, or under a special act of Congress authorizing permits 
without our approval under certain conditions, except to the extent that 
the authorizing statutes require us to enforce such permits on behalf of 
the Indian landowners.
    (d) To the extent that any provisions of this part conflict with 
Section 213 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act Amendments of 2000, the 
provisions of that act will govern.
    (e) In approving a permit on behalf of the Indian landowners, the 
BIA will not permit for fee interest owners nor will we collect rent on 
behalf of fee interest owners. Our permitting of the trust and 
restricted interests of the Indian landowners will not be conditioned on 
a permit having been obtained from any fee interest owners. However, 
where all of the trust or restricted interests in a tract are subject to 
a life estate held in fee status, we will approve a permit of the 
remainder interests of the Indian landowners only if such action is 
necessary to preserve the value of the land or protect the interests of 
the Indian landowners. Where a life estate and remainder interest are 
both owned in trust or restricted status, the life estate and remainder 
interest must both be permitted under these regulations, unless the 
permit is for less than one year in duration. Unless otherwise provided 
by the document creating the life estate or by agreement, rent payable 
under the permit must be paid to the holder of the life estate under 
part 179 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 166.2  Can the BIA waive the application of these regulations?

    Yes. In any case in which these regulations conflict with the 
objectives of the agricultural resource management plan provided for in 
Sec. 166.311 of this part, or with a tribal law, the BIA may waive the 
application of such regulations unless the waiver would constitute a 
violation of a federal statute or judicial decision or would conflict 
with the BIA's general trust responsibility under federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 166.3  May decisions under this part be appealed?

    Yes. Except where otherwise provided in this part, appeals from 
decisions by the BIA under this part may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR 
part 2.

Sec. 166.100  What special tribal policies will we apply to permitting

on Indian agricultural lands?

    (a) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution 
establishing a general policy for permitting of Indian agricultural 
lands, the BIA will:
    (1) Waive the general prohibition against Indian operator 
preferences in permits advertised for bid under Sec. 166.221 of this 
part, by allowing prospective Indian operators to match the highest 
responsible bid (unless the tribal law or leasing policy specifies some 
other manner in which the preference must be afforded);
    (2) Waive or modify the requirement that a permittee post a surety 
or performance bond;
    (3) Provide for posting of other collateral or security in lieu of 
surety or other bonds; and
    (4) Approve permits of tribally-owned agricultural lands at rates 
determined by the tribal governing body.
    (b) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution 
establishing a general policy for permitting of Indian agricultural 
lands, and subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the BIA may:
    (1) Waive or modify any general notice requirement of federal law; 
and
    (2) Grant or approve a permit on ``highly fractionated undivided 
heirship lands'' as defined by tribal law.
    (c) The BIA may take the action specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section only if:
    (1) The tribe defines by resolution what constitutes ``highly 
fractionated undivided heirship lands'';
    (2) The tribe adopts an alternative plan for notifying individual 
Indian landowners; and
    (3) The BIA's action is necessary to prevent waste, reduce idle land 
acreage and ensure income.


<R05>
Sec. 166.101  May individual Indian landowners exempt their land 

from certain tribal policies for permitting on Indian agricultural lands?

    (a) The individual Indian landowners of Indian land may exempt their 
land from our application of a tribal policy referred to under Sec. 
166.100 of this part if:
    (1) The Indian landowners have at least a 50% interest in such 
fractionated tract; and
    (2) The Indian landowners submit a written objection to the BIA of 
all or any part of such tribal policies to the permitting of such parcel 
of land.
    (b) Upon verification of the written objection we will notify the 
tribe of the Indian landowners' exemption from the specific tribal 
policy.
    (c) The procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section will also apply to withdrawing an approved exemption.

when requested by the tribe, so long as such an appearance would not:
    (i) Be inconsistent with the restrictions on employee testimony set 
forth at 43 CFR Part 2, Subpart E;
    (ii) Constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United 
States; or
    (iii) Authorize or result in a review of our actions by a tribal 
court.
    (c) Where the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a 
tribal law, but such regulations cannot be superseded or modified by the 
tribal law under Sec. 166.2 of this part, we may waive the regulations 
under part 1 of this title, so long as the waiver does not violate a 
federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our general trust 
responsibility under federal law.

land will not, of itself, make the Indian landowner a partner, joint 
venturer, or associate of the permittees.
    (e) We will assist prospective permittees in contacting the Indian 
landowners or their representatives, for the purpose of negotiating a 
permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.220  What are the basic steps for acquiring a permit through negotiation?

    The basic steps for acquiring a permit by negotiation are as 
follows:
    (a) The BIA or the Indian landowner will:
    (1) Receive a request to permit from an Indian landowner or the 
potential permittee;
    (2) Prepare the permit documents; and
    (3) Grant the permit.
    (b) A potential permittee will complete the requirements for 
securing a permit, (e.g., bond, insurance, payment of administrative 
fee, etc.);
    (c) We will:
    (1) Review the permit for proper documentation and compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations;
    (2) Approve the permit after our review;
    (3) Send the approved permit to the permittee and, upon request, to 
the Indian landowner; and
    (4) Record and maintain the approved permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.221  How do I acquire an advertised permit through competitive bidding?

    (a) As part of the negotiation of a permit, Indian landowners may 
advertise their Indian land to identify potential permittees with whom 
to negotiate.
    (b) When the BIA grants and approves a permit on behalf of an 
individual Indian landowner using an advertisement for bids, we will:
    (1) Prepare and distribute an advertisement of lands available for 
permit that identifies the terms and conditions of the permit sale, 
including, for agricultural permits, any preference rights;
    (2) Solicit sealed bids and conduct the public permit sale;
    (3) Determine and accept the highest or best responsible bidder(s), 
which may require further competitive bidding after the bid opening; and
    (4) Prepare permits for successful bidders.
    (c) After completion of the steps in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the successful bidder must complete and submit the permit and satisfy 
all applicable requirements, (e.g., bond, insurance, payment of 
administrative fee, etc.).
    (d) After review of the permit documentation for proper completion 
and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, within 30 days 
we will:

[[Page 515]]

    (1) Grant and approve the permit on behalf of Indian landowners 
where we are authorized to do so by law;
    (2) Distribute the approved permit to the permittee(s) and, upon 
request, to the Indian landowner(s); and
    (3) Record and maintain the approved permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.222  Are there standard permit forms?

    Yes. Standard permit forms, including bid forms, permit forms, and 
permit modification forms are available at our agency offices.

                       Permit (Leasehold) Mortgage


<R05>
Sec. 166.223  Can I use a permit as collateral for a loan?

    We may approve a permit containing a provision that authorizes the 
permittee to encumber the permit interest, known as a leasehold 
mortgage, for the development and improvement of the permitted Indian 
land. We must approve the leasehold mortgage that encumbers the permit 
interest before it can be effective. We will record the approved 
leasehold mortgage instrument.


<R05>
Sec. 166.224  What factors does the BIA consider when reviewing a leasehold mortgage?

    (a) We will approve the leasehold mortgage if:
    (1) All consents required in the permit have been obtained from the 
Indian landowners and any surety or guarantor;
    (2) The mortgage covers only the permit interest, and no unrelated 
collateral belonging to the permittee;
    (3) The financing being obtained will be used only in connection 
with the development or use of the permitted premises, and the mortgage 
does not secure any unrelated obligations owed by the permittee to the 
mortgagee; and
    (4) We find no compelling reason to withhold our approval, in order 
to protect the best interests of the Indian landowner.
    (b) In making the finding required by paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, we will consider whether:
    (1) The ability to perform the permit obligations would be adversely 
affected by the cumulative mortgage obligations;
    (2) Any negotiated permit provisions as to the allocation or control 
of insurance or condemnation proceeds would be modified;
    (3) The remedies available to us or the Indian landowners would be 
limited (beyond the additional notice and cure rights to be afforded to 
the mortgagee), if the permittee defaults on the permit;
    (4) Any rights of the Indian landowners would be subordinated or 
adversely affected in the event of a foreclosure, assignment in lieu of 
foreclosure, or issuance of a ``new permit'' to the mortgagee.
    (c) We will notify the Indian landowners of our approval of the 
leasehold mortgage.


<R05>
Sec. 166.225  May a permittee voluntarily assign a leasehold interest

under an approved encumbrance?

    With our approval, under an approved encumbrance, a permittee 
voluntarily may assign the leasehold interest to someone other than the 
holder of a leasehold mortgage if the assignee agrees in writing to be 
bound by the terms of the permit. A permit may provide the Indian 
landowners with a right of first refusal on the conveyance of the 
leasehold interest.


<R05>
Sec. 166.226  May the holder of a leasehold mortgage assign the 

leasehold interest after a sale or foreclosure of an approved encumbrance?

    Yes. The holder of a leasehold mortgage may assign a leasehold 
interest obtained by a sale or foreclosure of an approved encumbrance 
without our approval if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by 
the terms of the permit. A permit may provide the Indian landowners with 
a right of first refusal on the conveyance of the permit interest 
(leasehold).

                           Modifying a Permit


<R05>
Sec. 166.227  How can Indian land be removed from an existing permit?

    (a)We will remove Indian land from the permit if:
    (1)The trust status of the Indian land terminates;
    (2) The Indian landowners request removal of their interest, with 
the written approval of the majority interest of the fractionated tract 
to be removed,

[[Page 516]]

and we determine that the removal is beneficial to such interests;
    (3) A tribe allocates grazing privileges for Indian land covered by 
your permit under Sec. 166.218 of this part;
    (4) The permittee requests removal of the Indian land, the owners of 
the majority interest of the Indian land provides written approval of 
the removal of the Indian land, and we determine that the removal is 
warranted; or
    (5) We determine that removal of the Indian land is appropriate, 
with the written approval of the owners of the majority interest of the 
Indian land.
    (b) We will revise the grazing capacity to reflect the removal of 
Indian land and show it on the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.228  How will the BIA provide notice if Indian land is removed 

from an existing permit?

    If the reason for removal is:
    (a) Termination of trust status. We will notify the parties to the 
permit in writing within 30 days. The removal will be effective on the 
next anniversary date of the permit.
    (b) A request from Indian landowners or the permittee, or our 
determination. We will notify the parties to the permit in writing 
within 30 days of such request. The removal will be effective 
immediately if all sureties, Indian landowners, and permittee agree. 
Otherwise, the removal will be effective upon the next anniversary date 
of the permit. If our written notice is within 180 days of the 
anniversary date of the permit, the removal of Indian land will be 
effective 180 days after the written notice.
    (c) Tribal allocation under Sec. 166.218 of this part. We will 
notify the parties to the permit in writing within 180 days of such 
action. The removal of tribal land will be effective on the next 
anniversary date of the permit. If our written notice is within 180 days 
of the anniversary date of the permit, the removal of Indian land will 
be effective 180 days after the written notice.


<R05>
Sec. 166.229  Other than to remove land, how can a permit be amended, 

assigned, subpermitted, or mortgaged?

    (a) We must approve an amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage 
with the written consent of the parties to the permit in the same manner 
that the permit was approved, and the consent of the sureties.
    (b) Indian landowners may designate in writing one or more of their 
co-owners or representatives to negotiate and/or agree to amendments on 
their behalf.
    (1) The designated landowner or representative may:
    (i) Negotiate or agree to amendments; and
    (ii) Consent to or approve other items as necessary.
    (2) The designated landowner or representative may not:
    (i) Negotiate or agree to amendments that reduce the grazing rental 
payments payable to the other Indian landowners; or
    (ii) Terminate the permit or modify the term of the permit.
    (c) We may approve a permit for tribal land to individual members of 
a tribe which contains a provision permitting the assignment of the 
permit by the permittee or the lender without our approval when a 
lending institution or an agency of the United States:
    (1) Accepts the interest in the permit (leasehold) as security for 
the loan; and
    (2) Obtains the interest in the permit (leasehold) through 
foreclosure or otherwise.
    (d) We will revise the grazing capacity and modify the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.230  When will a BIA decision to approve an amendment,

assignment, subpermit, or mortgage under a permit be effective?

    Our decision to approve an amendment, assignment, subpermit, or 
mortgage under a permit will be effective immediately, notwithstanding 
any appeal which may be filed under Part 2 of this title. Copies of 
approved documents will be provided to the party requesting approval, 
and made available to the Indian landowners upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 166.231  Must an amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage

approved under a permit be recorded?

    An amendment, assignment, subpermit, or mortgage approved under a 
permit must be recorded in our Land Titles and Records Office which has 
jurisdiction over the Indian land. We will

[[Page 517]]

record the document immediately following our approval.


<R04>
                Subpart D_Land and Operations Management


<R05>
Sec. 166.300  How is Indian agricultural land managed?

    Tribes, individual Indian landowners, and the BIA will manage Indian 
agricultural land either directly or through contracts, compacts, 
cooperative agreements, or grants under the Indian Self-Determination 
and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93-638, as amended).


<R05>
Sec. 166.301  How is Indian land for grazing purposes described?

    Indian land for grazing purposes should be described by legal 
description (e.g., aliquot parts, metes and bounds) or other acceptable 
description. Where there are undivided interests owned in fee status, 
the aggregate portion of trust and restricted interests should be 
identified in the description of the permitted land.


<R05>
Sec. 166.302  How is a range unit created?

    We create a range unit after we consult with the Indian landowners 
of rangeland, by designating units of compatible size, availability, and 
location.


<R05>
Sec. 166.303  Can more than one parcel of Indian land be combined into one permit?

    Yes. A permit may include more than one parcel of Indian land. 
Permits may include tribal land, individually-owned Indian land, or 
government land, or any combination thereof.


<R05>
Sec. 166.304  Can there be more than one permit for each range unit?

    Yes. There can be more than one permit for each range unit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.305  When is grazing capacity determined?

    Before we grant, modify, or approve a permit, in consultation with 
the Indian landowners, we will establish the total grazing capacity for 
each range unit based on the summation of each parcel's productivity. We 
will also establish the season(s) of use on Indian lands.


<R05>
Sec. 166.306  Can the BIA adjust the grazing capacity?

    Yes. In consultation with the Indian landowners or in the BIA's 
discretion based on good cause, we may adjust the grazing capacity using 
the best evaluation method(s) relevant to the ecological region.


<R05>
Sec. 166.307  Will the grazing capacity be increased if I graze

adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands not covered by the permit?

    No. You will not receive an increase in grazing capacity in the 
permit if you graze trust or non-trust rangeland in common with the 
permitted land. Grazing capacity will be established only for Indian 
land covered by your permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.308  Can the number of animals and/or season of use be 

modified on the permitted land if I graze adjacent trust or non-trust
rangelands under an on-
          and-off grazing permit?

    Yes. The number of animals and/or season of use may be modified on 
permitted Indian land with an on-and-off grazing permit only when a 
conservation plan includes the use of adjacent trust or non-trust 
rangelands not covered by the permit and when that land is used in 
common with permitted land.


<R05>
Sec. 166.309  Who determines livestock class and livestock ownership

requirements on permitted Indian land?

    (a) Tribes determine the class of livestock and livestock ownership 
requirements for livestock that may be grazed on range units composed 
entirely of tribal land or which include government land, subject to the 
grazing capacity prescribed by us under Sec. 166.305 of this part.
    (b) For permits on range units containing, in whole or part, 
individually-owned Indian land, we will adopt the tribal determination 
in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 166.310  What must a permittee do to protect livestock from exposure to disease?

    In accordance with applicable law, permittees must:
    (a) Vaccinate livestock;

[[Page 518]]

    (b) Treat all livestock exposed to or infected with contagious or 
infectious diseases; and
    (c) Restrict the movement of exposed or infected livestock.

              Management Plans and Environmental Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 166.311  Is an Indian agricultural resource management plan required?

    (a) Indian agricultural land under the jurisdiction of a tribe must 
be managed in accordance with the goals and objectives in any 
agricultural resource management plan developed by the tribe, or by us 
in close consultation with the tribe, under the AIARMA.
    (b) The ten-year agricultural resource management and monitoring 
plan must be developed through public meetings and completed within 
three years of the initiation of the planning activity. Such a plan must 
be developed through public meetings, and be based on the public meeting 
records and existing survey documents, reports, and other research from 
federal agencies, tribal community colleges, and land grant 
universities. When completed, the plan must:
    (1) Determine available agricultural resources;
    (2) Identify specific tribal agricultural resource goals and 
objectives;
    (3) Establish management objectives for the resources;
    (4) Define critical values of the tribe and its members and provide 
identified holistic management objectives; and
    (5) Identify actions to be taken to reach established objectives.
    (c) Where the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a 
tribe's agricultural resource management plan, we may waive the 
regulations under part 1 of this title, so long as the waiver does not 
violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our 
general trust responsibility under federal law.


<R05>
Sec. 166.312  Is a conservation plan required?

    A conservation plan must be developed for each permit with the 
permittee and approved by us prior to the issuance of the permit. The 
conservation plan must be consistent with the tribe's agricultural 
resource management plan and must address the permittee's management 
objectives regarding animal husbandry and resource conservation. The 
conservation plan must cover the entire permit period and reviewed by us 
on an annual basis.


<R05>
Sec. 166.313  Is environmental compliance required?

    Actions taken by the BIA under the regulations in this part must 
comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
4321 et seq.), applicable regulations of the Council on Environmental 
Quality (40 CFR part 1500), and applicable tribal laws and regulations.

                 Conservation Practices and Improvements


<R05>
Sec. 166.314  Can a permittee apply a conservation practice on permitted Indian land?

    Yes. A permittee can apply a conservation practice on permitted 
Indian land as long as the permittee has approval from the BIA and 
majority interest and the conservation practice is consistent with the 
conservation plan.


<R05>
Sec. 166.315  Who is responsible for the completion and maintenance of

a conservation practice if the permit expires or is canceled before the completion of 
          the conservation practice?

    Prior to undertaking a conservation practice, the BIA, landowner, 
and permittee will negotiate who will complete and maintain a 
conservation practice if the permit expires or is canceled before the 
conservation practice is completed. That conservation practice agreement 
will be reflected in the conservation plan and permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.316  Can a permittee construct improvements on permitted Indian land?

    Improvements may be constructed on permitted Indian land if the 
permit contains a provision allowing improvements.

[[Page 519]]


<R05>
Sec. 166.317  What happens to improvements constructed on Indian lands

when the permit has been terminated?

    (a) If improvements are to be constructed on Indian land, the permit 
must contain a provision that improvements will either:
    (1) Remain on the land upon termination of the permit, in a 
condition that is in compliance with applicable codes, to become the 
property of the Indian landowner; or
    (2) Be removed and the land restored within a time period specified 
in the permit. The land must be restored as close as possible to the 
original condition prior to construction of such improvements. At the 
request of the permittee we may, at our discretion, grant an extension 
of time for the removal of improvements and restoration of the land for 
circumstances beyond the control of the permittee.
    (b) If the permittee fails to remove improvements within the time 
allowed in the permit, the permittee may forfeit the right to remove the 
improvements and the improvements may become the property of the Indian 
landowner or at the request of the Indian landowner, we will apply the 
bond for the removal of the improvement and restoration of the land.


<R04>
 Subpart E_Grazing Rental Rates, Payments, and Late Payment Collections

                Rental Rate Determination and Adjustment


<R05>
Sec. 166.400  Who establishes grazing rental rates?

    (a) For tribal lands, a tribe may establish a grazing rental rate 
that is less or more than the grazing rental rate established by us. We 
will assist a tribe to establish a grazing rental rate by providing the 
tribe with available information concerning the value of grazing on 
tribal lands.
    (b) We will establish the grazing rental rate by determining the 
fair annual rental for:
    (1) Individually-owned Indian lands; and
    (2) Tribes that have not established a rate under paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) Indian landowners may give us written authority to grant grazing 
privileges on their individually-owned Indian land at a grazing rental 
rate that is:
    (1) Above the grazing rental rate set by us; or
    (2) Below the grazing rental rate set by us, subject to our 
approval, when the permittee is a member of the Indian landowner's 
immediate family as defined in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 166.401  How does the BIA establish grazing rental rates?

    An appraisal can be used to determine the rental value of real 
property. The development and reporting of the valuation will be 
completed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional 
Appraisal Practices (USPAP). If an appraisal is not desired, competitive 
bids, negotiations, advertisements, or any other method can be used in 
conjunction with a market study, rent survey, or feasibility analysis 
developed in accordance with the USPAP.


<R05>
Sec. 166.402  Why must the BIA determine the fair annual rental of Indian land?

    The BIA must determine the fair annual rental of Indian land to:
    (a) Assist the Indian landowner in negotiating a permit with 
potential permittees; and
    (b) Enable us to determine whether a permit is in the best interests 
of the Indian landowner.


<R05>
Sec. 166.403  Will the BIA ever grant or approve a permit at less than fair annual rental?

    (a) We will grant a permit for grazing on individually-owned Indian 
land at less than fair annual rental if, after competitive bidding of 
the permit, we determine that such action would be in the best interests 
of the individual Indian landowners.
    (b) We may approve a permit for grazing on individually-owned Indian 
land at less than fair annual rental if:

[[Page 520]]

    (1) The permit is for the Indian landowner's immediate family or co-
owner; or
    (2) We determine it is in the best interest of the Indian 
landowners.
    (c) We may approve a permit for grazing on tribal land at less than 
fair annual rental if the tribe sets the rate.


<R05>
Sec. 166.404  Whose grazing rental rate will be applicable for a permit on tribal land?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 166.407  If a range unit consists of tribal and individually-owned 

Indian lands, what is the grazing rental rate?

    The grazing rental rate for tribal land will be the rate set by the 
tribe. The grazing rental rate for individually-owned Indian land will 
be the grazing rental rate set by us.


<R05>
Sec. 166.408  Is the grazing rental rate established by the BIA adjusted periodically?

    Yes. To ensure that Indian landowners are receiving the fair annual 
return, we may adjust the grazing rental rate established by the BIA, 
based upon an appropriate valuation method, taking into account the 
value of improvements made under the permit, unless the permit provides 
otherwise, following the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice.
    (a) We will:
    (1) Review the grazing rental rate prior to each anniversary date or 
when specified by the permit.
    (2) Provide you with written notice of any adjustment of the grazing 
rental rate 60 days prior to each anniversary date.
    (3) Allow the adjusted grazing rental rate to be less than the fair 
annual rental if we determine that such a rate is in the best interest 
of the Indian landowner.

[[Page 521]]

    (b) If adjusted, the grazing rental rate will become effective on 
the next anniversary date of the permit.
    (c) These adjustments will be retroactive, if they are not made at 
the time specified in the permit.
    (d) For permits granted by tribes, we will consult with the granting 
tribe to determine whether an adjustment of the grazing rental payment 
should be made. The permit must be modified to document the granting 
tribe's waiver of the adjustment. A tribe may grant a permit without 
providing for a rental adjustment, if the tribe establishes such a 
policy under Sec. 166.100(a)(4) of this part and negotiates such a 
permit.

                             Rental Payments


<R05>
Sec. 166.409  How is my grazing rental payment determined?

    The grazing rental payment is the total of the grazing rental rate 
multiplied by the number of AUMs or acres covered by the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.410  When are grazing rental payments due?

    The initial grazing rental payment is due and payable as specified 
in the permit or 15 days after the BIA approves the permit, whichever is 
later. Subsequent payments are due as specified in the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.411  Will a permittee be notified when a grazing rental payment is due?

    Each permit states the schedule of rental payments agreed to by the 
parties. We will issue an invoice to the permittee 30 to 60 days prior 
to the rental payment due date.


<R05>
Sec. 166.412  What if the permittee does not receive an invoice that a 

grazing rental payment is due?

    If we fail to send an invoice or if we send an invoice and the 
permittee does not receive it, the permittee is still responsible for 
making timely payment of all amounts due under the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.413  To whom are grazing rental payments made?

    (a) A permit must specify whether grazing rental payments will be 
made directly to the Indian landowners or to us on behalf of the Indian 
landowners. If the permit provides for payment to be made directly to 
the Indian landowners, the permit must also require that the permittee 
retain specific documentation evidencing proof of payment, such as 
canceled checks, cash receipt vouchers, or copies of money orders or 
cashier's checks, consistent with the provisions of Sec. Sec. 166.1000 
and 166.1001 of this part.
    (b) Grazing rental payments made directly to the Indian landowners 
must be made to the parties specified in the permit, unless the 
permittee receives a notice of a change of ownership. Unless otherwise 
provided in the permit, grazing rental payments may not be made payable 
directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.
    (c) A permit which provides for grazing rental payments to be made 
directly to the Indian landowners must also provide for such payments to 
be suspended and rent thereafter paid to us, rather than directly than 
to the Indian landowners, if:
    (1) An Indian landowner dies;
    (2) An Indian landowner requests that payment be made to us;
    (3) An Indian landowner is found by us to be in need of assistance 
in managing his/her financial affairs; or
    (4) We determine, in our discretion and after consultation with the 
Indian landowner(s), that direct payment should be discontinued.


<R05>
Sec. 166.414  What forms of grazing rental payments are acceptable?

    (a) When grazing rental payments are made directly to the Indian 
landowners, the form of payment must be acceptable to the Indian 
landowners.
    (b) Payments made to us may be delivered in person or by mail. We 
will not accept cash, foreign currency, or third-party checks. We will 
accept:
    (1) Personal or business checks drawn on the account of the 
permittee;
    (2) Money orders;
    (3) Cashier's checks;
    (4) Certified checks; or
    (5) Electronic funds transfer payments.

[[Page 522]]


<R05>
Sec. 166.415  What will the BIA do if the permittee fails to make a direct 

payment to an Indian landowner?

    Within five business days of the Indian landowner's notification to 
us that a payment has not been received, we will contact the permittee 
either in writing or by telephone requesting that the permittee provide 
documentation (e.g., canceled check, cash receipt voucher, copy of a 
money order or cashier's check) showing that payment has been made to 
the Indian landowner. If the permitee fails to provide such 
documentation, we will follow the procedures identified in Sec. 166.419 
of this part to collect the money on behalf of the Indian landowner or 
to cancel the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.416  May a permittee make a grazing rental payment in advance of 

the due date?

    Rent may be paid no more than 30 days in advance, unless otherwise 
specified in the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.417  May an individual Indian landowner modify the terms of

the permit on a fractionated tract for advance grazing rental payment?

    No. An individual Indian landowner of a fractionated tract may not 
modify a permit to allow a grazing rental payment in advance of the due 
date specified in the initial approved permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.418  When is a grazing rental payment late?

    A grazing rental payment is late if it is not received on or before 
the due date.

                     Late Rental Payment Collections


<R05>
Sec. 166.419  What will the BIA do if grazing rental payments are not made 

in the time and manner required by the permit?

    (a) A permitee's failure to pay grazing rental payments in the time 
and manner required by a permit will be a violation of the permit, and a 
notice of violation will be issued under Sec. 166.703 of this part. If 
the permit requires that grazing rental payments be made to us, we will 
send the permittee and its sureties a notice of violation within five 
business days of the date on which the grazing rental payment was due. 
If the permit provides for payment directly to the Indian landowner(s), 
we will send the permittee and its sureties a notice of violation within 
five business days of the date on which we receive actual notice of non-
payment from the Indian landowner(s).
    (b) If a permittee fails to provide adequate proof of payment or 
cure the violation within the requisite time period described in Sec. 
166.704 of this part, and the amount due is not in dispute, we may 
immediately take action to recover the amount of the unpaid rent and any 
associated interest charges or late payment penalties. We may also 
cancel the permit under Sec. 166.705 of this part, or invoke any other 
remedies available under the permit or applicable law, including 
collection on any available bond or referral of the debt to the 
Department of the Treasury for collection. An action to recover any 
unpaid amounts will not be conditioned on the prior cancellation of the 
permit or any further notice to the permittee, nor will such an action 
be precluded by a prior cancellation.
    (c) Partial payments may be accepted, under special circumstances, 
by the Indian landowners or us, but acceptance will not operate as a 
waiver with respect to any amounts remaining unpaid or any other 
existing permit violations. Unless otherwise provided in the permit, 
overpayments may be credited as an advance against future grazing rental 
payments.
    (d) If a personal or business check is dishonored, and a grazing 
rental payment is therefore not made by the due date, the failure to 
make the payment in a timely manner will be a violation of the permit, 
and a written notice of violation will be issued under Sec. 166.703 of 
this part. Any payment made to cure such a default, and any future 
payments by the same permittee, must be made by one of the alternative 
payment methods listed in Sec. 166.414(b) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 166.420  Will any special fees be assessed on delinquent grazing rental 

payments due under a permit?

    The following special fees will be assessed if a grazing rental 
payment is not paid in the time and manner required, in addition to any 
interest or

[[Page 523]]

late payment penalties which must be paid to the Indian landowners under 
a permit. The following special fees will be assessed to cover 
administrative costs incurred by the United States in the collection of 
the debt:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The permittee will pay * * *                   For * * *

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 166.421  If a permit is canceled for non-payment, does that extinguish the permittee's debt?

    No. The permittee remains liable for any delinquent payment. No 
future permits will be issued until all outstanding debts related to 
Indian agricultural lands are paid.

                    Compensation to Indian Landowners


<R05>
Sec. 166.422  What does the BIA do with grazing rental payments received from permittees?

    Unless arrangements for direct payment to the Indian landowners has 
been provided, the rent will be deposited to the appropriate account 
maintained by the Office of Trust Funds Management in accordance with 
part 115 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 166.423  How do Indian landowners receive grazing rental payments that

the BIA has received from permittees?

    Funds will be paid to the Indian landowners by the Office of Trust 
Funds Management in accordance with 25 CFR part 115.


<R05>
Sec. 166.424  How will the BIA determine the grazing rental payment 

amount to be distributed to each Indian landowner?

    Unless otherwise specified in the permit, the grazing rental payment 
will be distributed to each Indian landowner according to the forage 
production that each parcel of Indian land contributes to the permit, 
annual rental rate of each parcel, and the Indian landowner's interest 
in each parcel.


<R04>
                Subpart F_Administrative and Tribal Fees


<R05>
Sec. 166.500  Are there administrative fees for a permit?

    Yes. We will charge an administrative fee before approving any 
permit, subpermit, assignment, encumbrance, modification, or other 
related document.


<R05>
Sec. 166.501  How are annual administrative fees determined?

    (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), we will charge a three 
percent (%) administrative fee based on the annual grazing rent.
    (b) The minimum administrative fee is $10.00 and the maximum 
administrative fee is $500.00.
    (c) If a tribe performs all or part of the administrative duties for 
this part, the tribe may establish, collect, and use reasonable fees to 
cover its costs associated with the performance of administrative 
duties.


<R05>
Sec. 166.502  Are administrative fees refundable?

    No. We will not refund administrative fees.


<R05>
Sec. 166.503  May the BIA waive administrative fees?

    Yes. We may waive the administrative fee for a justifiable reason.


<R05>
Sec. 166.504  Are there any other administrative or tribal fees, taxes, or assessments that must be paid?

    Yes. The permittee may be required to pay additional fees, taxes, 
and/or assessments associated with the use of the land as determined by 
us or by the tribe. Failure to make such payments will constitute a 
permit violation under subpart H of this part.


<R04>
              Subpart G_Bonding and Insurance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 166.600  Must a permittee provide a bond for a permit?

    Yes. A permittee, assignee or subpermittee must provide a bond for 
each permit interest acquired. Upon request by an Indian landowner, we 
may waive the bond requirement.

[[Page 524]]


<R05>
Sec. 166.601  How is the amount of the bond determined?

    (a) The amount of the bond for each permit is based on the:
    (1) Value of one year's grazing rental payment;
    (2) Value of any improvements to be constructed;
    (3) Cost of performance of any additional obligations; and
    (4) Cost of performance of restoration and reclamation.
    (b) Tribal policy made applicable by Sec. 166.100 of this part may 
establish or waive specific bond requirements for permits.


<R05>
Sec. 166.602  What form of bonds will the BIA accept?

    (a) We will only accept bonds in the following forms:
    (1) Cash;
    (2) Negotiable Treasury securities that:
    (i) Have a market value equal to the bond amount; and
    (ii) Are accompanied by a statement granting full authority to the 
BIA to sell such securities in case of a violation of the terms of the 
permit.
    (3) Certificates of deposit that indicate on their face that 
Secretarial approval is required prior to redemption by any party;
    (4) Irrevocable letters of credit (LOC) issued by federally-insured 
financial institutions authorized to do business in the United States. 
LOC's must:
    (i) Contain a clause that grants the BIA authority to demand 
immediate payment if the permittee defaults or fails to replace the LOC 
within 30 calendar days prior to its expiration date;
    (ii) Be payable to the ``Department of the Interior, BIA'';
    (iii) Be irrevocable during its term and have an initial expiration 
date of not less than one year following the date we receive it; and
    (iv) Be automatically renewable for a period of not less than one 
year, unless the issuing financial institution provides the BIA with 
written notice at least 90 calendar days before the letter of credit's 
expiration date that it will not be renewed;
    (5) Surety bond; or
    (6) Any other form of highly liquid, non-volatile security 
subsequently approved by us that is easily convertible to cash by us and 
for which our approval is required prior to redemption by any party.
    (b) Indian landowners may negotiate a permit term that specifies the 
use of any of the bond forms described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) A tribe may accept and hold any form of bond described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, to secure performance under a permit of 
tribal land.


<R05>
Sec. 166.603  If cash is submitted as a bond, how is it administered?

    If cash is submitted as a bond, we will establish an account in the 
name of the permittee and retain it.


<R05>
Sec. 166.604  Is interest paid on a cash performance bond?

    No. Interest will not be paid on a cash performance bond.


<R05>
Sec. 166.605  Are cash performance bonds refunded?

    If the cash performance bond has not been forfeited for cause, the 
amount deposited will be refunded to the depositor at the end of the 
permit period.


<R05>
Sec. 166.606  What happens to a bond if a violation occurs?

    We may apply the bond to remedy the violation, in which case we will 
require the permittee to submit a replacement bond of an appropriate 
amount.


<R05>
Sec. 166.607  Is insurance required for a permit?

    When we determine it to be in the best interest of the Indian 
landowners, we will require a permittee to provide insurance. If 
insurance is required, it must:
    (a) Be provided in an amount sufficient to:
    (1) Protect any improvements on the permit premises;
    (2) Cover losses such as personal injury or death; and
    (3) Protect the interest of the Indian landowner.
    (b) Identify the tribe, individual Indian landowners, and United 
States as insured parties.

[[Page 525]]


<R05>
Sec. 166.608  What types of insurance may be required?

    We may require liability or casualty insurance (such as for fire, 
hazard, or flood), depending upon the activity conducted under the 
permit.


<R04>
                       Subpart H_Permit Violations


<R05>
Sec. 166.700  What permit violations are addressed by this subpart?

    This subpart addresses violations of permit provisions other than 
trespass. Trespass is addressed under subpart I of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 166.701  How will the BIA determine whether the activities of 

a permittee under a permit are in compliance with the terms of the permit?

    Unless the permit provides otherwise, we may enter the range unit at 
any reasonable time, without prior notice, to protect the interests of 
the Indian landowners and ensure that the permittee is in compliance 
with the operating requirements of the permit.


<R05>
Sec. 166.702  Can a permit provide for negotiated remedies in the event

of a permit violation?

    (a) A permit of tribal land may provide the tribe with certain 
negotiated remedies in the event of a permit violation, including the 
power to terminate the permit. A permit of individually-owned Indian 
land may provide the individual Indian landowners with similar remedies, 
so long as the permit also specifies the manner in which those remedies 
may be exercised by or on behalf of the Indian landowners. Any notice of 
violation must be provided by written notice.
    (b) The negotiated remedies described in paragraph (a) of this 
section will apply in addition to the cancellation remedy available to 
us under Sec. 166.705(c) of this subpart. If the permit specifically 
authorizes us to exercise any negotiated remedies on behalf of the 
Indian landowners, the exercise of such remedies may substitute for 
cancellation.
    (c) A permit may provide for permit disputes to be resolved in 
tribal court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or through 
arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution method. We may 
not be bound by decisions made in such forums, but we will defer to any 
ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any 
of the remedies available to us under Sec. 166.705 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 166.703  What happens if a permit violation occurs?

    (a) If an Indian landowner notifies us that a specific permit 
violation has occurred, we will initiate an appropriate investigation 
within five business days of that notification.
    (b) If we determine that a permit violation has occurred based on 
facts known to us, we will provide written notice to the permittee and 
the sureties of the violation within five business days.


<R05>
Sec. 166.704  What will a written notice of a permit violation contain?

    The written notice of a permit violation will provide the permittee 
with ten days from the receipt of the written notice to:
    (a) Cure the permit violation and notify us that the violation is 
cured.
    (b) Explain why we should not cancel the permit; or
    (c) Request in writing additional time to complete corrective 
actions. If additional time is granted, we may require that certain 
corrective actions be taken immediately.


<R05>
Sec. 166.705  What will the BIA do if a permit violation is not cured 

within the required time period?

    (a) If the permittee does not cure a violation within the required 
time period, we will consult with the Indian landowners, as appropriate, 
and determine whether:
    (1) The permit should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this 
section and Sec. Sec. 166.706 through 166.707 of this subpart;
    (2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the 
permit, including collecting on any available bond;
    (3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to 
them under the permit; or

[[Page 526]]

    (4) The permittee should be granted additional time in which to cure 
the violation.
    (b) If we decide to grant a permittee additional time in which to 
cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the 
necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time 
period from the date on which the extension is granted.
    (c) If we decide to cancel the permit, we will send the permittee 
and its sureties a written notice of cancellation within five business 
days of that decision. We will also provide actual or constructive 
notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, as 
appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will:
    (1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;
    (2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest 
charges, or late payment penalties due under the permit;
    (3) Notify the permittee of its right to appeal under Part 2 of this 
chapter, as modified by Sec. 166.706 of this subpart, including the 
amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the 
cancellation decision; and
    (4) Order the permittee to vacate the property within 30 days of the 
date of receipt of the written notice of cancellation, if an appeal is 
not filed by that time.


<R05>
Sec. 166.706  Will the BIA's regulations concerning appeal bonds 

apply to cancellation decisions involving permits?

    (a) The appeal bond provisions in Sec. 2.5 of part 2 of this 
chapter will not apply to appeals from permit cancellation decisions 
made under Sec. 166.705 of this subpart. Instead, when we decide to 
cancel a permit, we may require the permittee to post an appeal bond 
with an appeal of the cancellation decision. The requirement to post an 
appeal bond will apply in addition to all of the other requirements in 
part 2 of this chapter.
    (b) An appeal bond should be set in an amount necessary to protect 
the Indian landowners against financial losses that will likely result 
from the delay caused by an appeal. Appeal bond requirements will not be 
separately appealable, but may be contested during the appeal of the 
permit cancellation decision.


<R05>
Sec. 166.707  When will a cancellation of a permit be effective?

    A cancellation decision involving a permit will not be effective for 
30 days after the permittee receives a written notice of cancellation 
from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the 
permittee files an appeal under Sec. 166.706 of this subpart and part 2 
of this chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under 
part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the permittee must 
continue to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the permit. If 
an appeal is not filed in accordance with Sec. 166.706 of this subpart 
and part 2 of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective 
on the 31st day after the permittee receives the written notice of 
cancellation from us.


<R05>
Sec. 166.708  Can the BIA take emergency action if the rangeland is

threatened with immediate, significant, and irreparable harm?

    Yes. If a permittee or any other party causes or threatens to cause 
immediate, significant and irreparable harm to the Indian land during 
the term of a permit, we will take appropriate emergency action. 
Emergency action may include trespass proceedings under subpart I of 
this part, or judicial action seeking immediate cessation of the 
activity resulting in or threatening the harm. Reasonable efforts will 
be made to notify the Indian landowners, either before or after the 
emergency action is taken.


<R05>
Sec. 166.709  What will the BIA do if a permittee holds over after 

the expiration or cancellation of a permit?

    If a permittee remains in possession of Indian land after the 
expiration or cancellation of a permit, we will treat the unauthorized 
use as a trespass. Unless we have reason to believe that the permittee 
is engaged in negotiations with the Indian landowners to obtain a new 
permit, we will take action to recover possession of the Indian land on 
behalf of the Indian landowners, and pursue any additional remedies 
available under applicable law, including

[[Page 527]]

the assessment of civil penalties and costs under subpart I of this 
part.


<R04>
                           Subpart I_Trespass


<R05>
Sec. 166.800  What is trespass?

    Under this part, trespass is any unauthorized occupancy, use of, or 
action on Indian agricultural lands. These provisions also apply to 
Indian agricultural land managed under an agricultural lease or permit 
under part 162 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 166.801  What is the BIA's trespass policy?

    We will:
    (a) Investigate accidental, willful, and/or incidental trespass on 
Indian agricultural land;
    (b) Respond to alleged trespass in a prompt, efficient manner;
    (c) Assess trespass penalties for the value of products used or 
removed, cost of damage to the Indian agricultural land, and enforcement 
costs incurred as a consequence of the trespass.
    (d) Ensure that damage to Indian agricultural lands resulting from 
trespass is rehabilitated and stabilized at the expense of the 
trespasser.


<R05>
Sec. 166.802  Who can enforce this subpart?

    (a) The BIA enforces the provisions of this subpart. If the tribe 
adopts the provisions of this subpart, the tribe will have concurrent 
jurisdiction to enforce this subpart. Additionally, if the tribe so 
requests, we will defer to tribal prosecution of trespass on Indian 
agricultural lands.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to diminish the 
sovereign authority of Indian tribes with respect to trespass.

                              Notification


<R05>
Sec. 166.803  How are trespassers notified of a trespass determination?

    (a) Unless otherwise provided under tribal law, when we have reason 
to believe that a trespass on Indian agricultural land has occurred, 
within five business days, we or the authorized tribal representative 
will provide written notice to the alleged trespasser, the possessor of 
trespass property, any known lien holder, and beneficial Indian 
landowner, as appropriate. The written notice will include the 
following:
    (1) The basis for the trespass determination;
    (2) A legal description of where the trespass occurred;
    (3) A verification of ownership of unauthorized property (e.g., 
brands in the State Brand Book for cases of livestock trespass, if 
applicable);
    (4) Corrective actions that must be taken;
    (5) Time frames for taking the corrective actions;
    (6) Potential consequences and penalties for failure to take 
corrective action; and
    (7) A statement that unauthorized livestock or other property may 
not be removed or disposed of unless authorized by us.
    (b) If we determine that the alleged trespasser or possessor of 
trespass property is unknown or refuses delivery of the written notice, 
a public trespass notice will be posted at the tribal community 
building, U.S. Post Office, and published in the local newspaper nearest 
to the Indian agricultural lands where the trespass is occurring.
    (c) Trespass notices under this subpart are not subject to appeal 
under 25 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 166.804  What can I do if I receive a trespass notice?

    If you receive a trespass notice, you will within the time frame 
specified in the notice:
    (a) Comply with the ordered corrective actions; or
    (b) Contact us in writing to explain why the trespass notice is in 
error. You may contact us by telephone but any explanation of trespass 
you wish to provide must be in writing. If we determine that we issued 
the trespass notice in error, we will withdraw the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 166.805  How long will a written trespass notice remain in effect?

    A written trespass notice will remain in effect for the same conduct 
identified in that written notice for a period of one year from the date 
of receipt of the written notice by the trespasser.

[[Page 528]]

                                 Actions


<R05>
Sec. 166.806  What actions does the BIA take against trespassers?

    If the trespasser fails to take the corrective action specified by 
us, we may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate:
    (a) Seize, impound, sell or dispose of unauthorized livestock or 
other property involved in the trespass. We may keep such property we 
seize for use as evidence.
    (b) Assess penalties, damages, and costs, under Sec. 166.812 of 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 166.807  When will we impound unauthorized livestock or other property?

    We will impound unauthorized livestock or other property under the 
following conditions:
    (a) Where there is imminent danger of severe injury to growing or 
harvestable crop or destruction of the range forage.
    (b) When the known owner or the owner's representative of the 
unauthorized livestock or other property refuses to accept delivery of a 
written notice of trespass and the unauthorized livestock or other 
property are not removed within the period prescribed in the written 
notice.
    (c) Any time after five days of providing notice of impoundment if 
you failed to correct the trespass.


<R05>
Sec. 166.808  How are trespassers notified if their unauthorized 

livestock or other property are to be impounded?

    (a) If the trespass is not corrected in the time specified in the 
initial trespass notice, we will send written notice of our intent to 
impound unauthorized livestock or other property to the unauthorized 
livestock or property owner or representative, and any known lien holder 
of the unauthorized livestock or other property.
    (b) If we determine that the owner of the unauthorized livestock or

<R05>
Sec. 167.1  Authority.

    It is within the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to 
protect Indian tribal lands against waste. Subject to regulations of 
this part, the right exists for Indian tribes to authorize the granting 
of permits upon their tribal

[[Page 536]]

lands and to prescribe by appropriate tribal action the conditions under 
which their lands may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 167.2  General regulations.

    Part 166 of this subchapter authorizes the Commissioner of Indian 
Affairs to regulate the grazing of livestock on Indian lands under 
conditions set forth therein. In accordance with this authority and that 
of the Navajo Tribal Council, the Central Grazing Committee and the 
District Grazing Committees, the grazing of livestock on the Navajo 
Reservation shall be governed by the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 167.3  Objectives.

    It is the purpose of the regulations in this part to aid the Navajo 
Indians in achievement of the following objectives:
    (a) The preservation of the forage, the land, and the water 
resources on the Navajo Reservation, and the building up of those 
resources where they have deteriorated.
    (b) The protection of the interests of the Navajo Indians from the 
encroachment of unduly aggressive and anti-social individuals who may or 
may not be members of the Navajo Tribe.
    (c) The adjustment of livestock numbers to the carrying capacity of 
the range in such a manner that the livestock economy of the Navajo 
Tribe will be preserved.
    (d) To secure increasing responsibility and participation of the 
Navajo people, including tribal participation in all basic policy 
decisions, in the sound management of one of the Tribe's greatest 
assets, its grazing lands, and to foster a better relationship and a 
clearer understanding between the Navajo people and the Federal 
Government in carrying out the grazing regulations.
    (e) The improvement of livestock through proper breeding practices 
and the maintenance of a sound culling policy. Buck and bull pastures 
may be established and maintained either on or off the reservation 
through District Grazing Committee and Central Grazing Committee action.


<R05>
Sec. 167.4  Regulations; scope; exceptions.

    The grazing regulations in this part apply to all lands within the 
boundaries of the Navajo Reservation held in trust by the United States 
for the Navajo Tribe and all the trust lands hereafter added to the 
Navajo Reservation. The regulations in this part do not apply to any of 
the area described in the Executive order of December 16, 1882, to 
individually owned allotted lands within the Navajo Reservation nor to 
tribal purchases, allotted or privately owned Navajo Indian lands 
outside the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Reservation.

<R05>
Sec. 167.5  Land management districts.

    The Commissioner of Indian Affairs has established and will retain 
the present land management districts within the Navajo Indian 
Reservation, based on the social and economic requirements of the Navajo 
Indians and the necessity of rehabilitating the grazing lands. District 
boundary changes may be made when deemed necessary and advisable by the 
District Grazing Committees, Central Grazing Committee and Tribal 
Council, with approval by the Superintendent, Area Director, and the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 167.6  Carrying capacities.

    (a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs on June 26, 1943, promulgated 
the authorized carrying capacity for each land management district of 
the Navajo Reservation.
    (b) Recommended adjustments in carrying capacities shall be referred 
by the Superintendent to District Grazing Committee, Central Grazing 
Committee, and the Navajo Tribal Council for review and recommendations 
prior to presentation to the Area Director and the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs for approval.
    (c) Upon the request of the District Grazing Committee, Central 
Grazing Committee and Navajo Tribal Council to the Superintendent; 
recommendations for future adjustments to the established carrying 
capacities shall be made by Range Technicians based on

[[Page 537]]

the best information available through annual utilization studies and 
range condition studies analyzed along with numbers of livestock and 
precipitation data. The recommendations of the Range Technicians shall 
be submitted to the Superintendent, the Area Director and the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
    (d) Carrying capacities shall be stated in terms of sheep units 
yearlong, in the ratio of horses, mules, and burros 1 to 5; cattle 1 to 
4; goats 1 to 1. The latter figure in each case denotes sheep units. 
Sheep, goats, cattle, horses, mules, and burros one year of age or older 
shall be counted against the carrying capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 167.7  Records.

    The District Grazing Committee, the Superintendent, and his 
authorized representatives shall keep accurate records of all grazing 
permits and ownership of all livestock. Master files shall be maintained 
by the Superintendent or his authorized representatives.
    (a) The District Grazing Committee shall be responsibile for and 
assist in organizing the sheep and goat dipping and horse and cattle 
branding program and obtaining the annual live- stock count.
    (b) In order to obtain true records of ownership the permittee shall 
personally appear at the dipping vat or tallying point designated by the 
Grazing Committee with his or her sheep and goats and at branding and 
tallying points for cattle and horses. Should the permittee be unable to 
appear personally he or she shall designate a representative to act for 
and in his or her behalf. The sheep and goats will be dipped and the 
cattle and horses will be branded and recorded in the name of the 
permittee.
    (c) The Superintendent shall prepare and keep current a register 
containing the names of all permittees using the range, the number of 
each class of stock by age classes grazed annually and the periods 
during which grazing shall be permitted in each part thereof. An annual 
stock census will be taken to insure that the carrying capacity is not 
exceeded. All classes of livestock twelve months of age or over will be 
counted against range use and permitted number, except that yearling 
colts will not be counted against permitted numbers on all permits with 
less than six horses. (Cross Reference Sec. 167.9.)


<R05>
Sec. 167.8  Grazing rights.

    (a) The Superintendent shall determine grazing rights of bona fide 
live-stock owners based on recommendations of District Grazing 
Committees. Grazing rights shall be recognized for those permittees 
having ownership records as established in accordance with Sec. 167.7 
or who have acquired grazing rights by marriage, inheritance, purchase 
or division of permits. Whenever the permitted number of sheep units 
within a district is less than the carrying capacity, new permits to the 
carrying capacity limit may be granted as provided in Sec. 167.9.
    (b) All enrolled members of the Navajo Tribe over 18 years of age 
are eligible to acquire and hold grazing permits. Minors under 18 years 
of age can get possession of grazing permits only through inheritance or 
gift, and in each case Trustees must be appointed by the Tribal Courts 
to manage the permits and livestock of such minors until they become 18 
years of age and can hold grazing permits in their own right.
    (c) No person can hold a grazing permit in more than one district on 
the Navajo Reservation.
    (d) Determination of rights to grazing permits involved in cases of 
divorce, separation, threatened family disruption, and permits of 
deceased permittees shall be the responsibility of the Navajo Court of 
Indian Offenses under existing laws, rules, and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 167.9  Grazing permits.

    (a) All livestock grazed on the Navajo Reservation must be covered 
by an authorized grazing permit issued by the Superintendent based upon 
the recommendations of the District Grazing Committee. All such grazing 
permits will be automatically renewed annually until terminated. 
District Grazing Committees shall act on all grazing permit changes 
resulting from negotiability within their respective Districts.

[[Page 538]]

The number of livestock that may be grazed under each permit shall be 
the number originally permitted plus or minus any changes as indicated 
by Transfer Agreements and Court Judgment Orders.
    (b) Any permittee who has five or more horses on his current permit 
will be required to apply any acquired sheep units in classes of stock 
other than horses. If the purchaser wishes more than his present number 
of horses, he must have his needs evaluated by the District Grazing 
Committee. Yearling colts will be counted against permitted number on 
all permits with six or more horses. Yearling colts will not be counted 
against permitted number on all permits with less than six horses. In 
hardship cases the District Grazing Committee may reissue horses removed 
from grazing permits through negotiability to permit holders who are 
without sufficient horses on their present permits to meet minimum 
needs.
    (c) No permittee shall be authorized to graze more than ten head of 
horses or to accumulate a total of over 350 sheep units.
    (d) Upon recommendation of the District Grazing Committee and with 
the approval of the Superintendent, grazing permits may be transferred 
from one permittee to another in accordance with instructions provided 
by the Advisory Committee of the Navajo Tribal Council, or may be 
inherited; provided that the permitted holdings of any individual 
permittee shall not exceed 350 sheep units or the equivalent thereof. 
Should inheritance or other acquisition of permits increase the holdings 
of any permittee to more than 350 sheep units, said permittee shall 
dispose of all livestock in excess of 350 sheep units not later than 
November 15 following date of inheritance or other acquisition, and that 
portion of his or her permit in excess of 350 sheep units within one 
year from date of inheritance.
    (e) By request of a permittee to sublet all or a part of his or her 
regular grazing permit to a member of his family or to any person who 
would receive such permit by inheritance, such subletting of permits may 
be authorized by the District Grazing Committee and the Superintendent 
or his authorized representative.


<R05>
Sec. 167.10  Special grazing permits.

    The problem of special grazing permits shall be settled by the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs working in cooperation with the Tribal Council, 
or any Committee designated by it, with a view to terminating these 
permits at a suitable date and with the least hardship to the Indians 
concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 167.11  Tenure of grazing permits.

    (a) All active regular grazing permits shall be for one year and 
shall be automatically renewed annually until terminated. Any Navajo 
eligible to hold a grazing permit as defined in Sec. 167.8 may become a 
livestock operator by obtaining an active grazing permit through 
negotiability or inheritance or both.
    (b) In many Districts, and portions of all districts, unused grazing 
permits or portions of grazing permits are beneficial in aiding range 
recovery. Each District Grazing Committee will handle each matter of 
unused grazing permit or portions of grazing permits on individual 
merits. Where ample forage is available operators will be encouraged to 
fill their permits with livestock or dispose of their unused permits 
through negotiability. In those areas where forage is in need of 
rehabilitation permittees will not be encouraged to stock to their 
permitted numbers until the range has sufficiently recovered to justify 
the grazing of additional livestock.


<R05>
Sec. 167.12  Grazing fees.

    Grazing fees shall not be charged at this time. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Grazing Committees were organized in May 1953. These committees 
have not had ample time to fully acquaint themselves or the stockmen in 
their respective districts with all of the various items of range 
administration and range management. Also the drought of several years 
has not broken. The Navajo Tribe therefore requests that the matter of 
establishing regulations regarding the adoption of grazing fees be 
deferred until such a time as a full understanding of the advantages of 
fees can be had by the majority of the stockmen in all Districts. The 
assessment of grazing fees will not aid materially in obtaining proper 
range use. At this time it is more important that other sections of 
these grazing regulations be adopted and enforced. Resolution of Navajo 
Tribal Council No. CJ-22-54 of June 9, 1954.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 539]]


<R05>
Sec. 167.13  Trespass.

    The owner of any livestock grazing in trespass in Navajo Tribal 
ranges shall be subject to action by the Navajo Court of Indian Offenses 
as provided in part 11 of this chapter, however, upon recommendations of 
the District Grazing Committee, first offenses may be referred to the 
Central Grazing Committee and the Superintendent or his authorized 
representative for proper settlement out of court. The following acts 
are considered as trespass:
    (a) Any person who sells an entire permit must dispose of all his 
livestock or be in trespass. Any person selling a portion of his permit 
must not run more stock than covered by his remaining permit, or be 
subject to immediate trespass.
    (b) All persons running livestock in excess of their permitted 
number must by April 25, 1959, either obtain permits to cover their 
total livestock numbers or reduce to their permitted number, or be in 
trespass. Additional time may be granted in unusual individual cases as 
determined and approved by the District Grazing Committee, General 
Grazing Committee, and the Superintendent or his authorized 
representative.
    (c) Failure to comply with the provisions in Sec. 167.9, shall be 
considered as trespass.
    (d) Any person who willfully allows his livestock to drift from one 
district to another shall be subject to trespass action. The grazing of 
livestock in customary use areas extending over District Boundary lines, 
when such customary use areas are defined and agreed upon by the 
District Grazing Committees involved, shall not be considered as willful 
trespass.
    (e) The owner of any livestock who violates the customary or 
established use units of other permittees shall be subject to trespass 
action.

<R05>
Sec. 167.14  Movement of livestock.

    Annually, prior to the normal lamb buying season, the Central 
Grazing Committee after consultation with District Grazing Committees 
shall issue regulations covering the buying period and the procedures 
and methods to be used in moving livestock to market. All movements of 
livestock other than trucking from buying areas to loading or shipping 
points must be authorized by Trailing Permits issued by the District 
Grazing Committees on the approved forms. Failure to comply with this 
section and with annual lamb buying regulations will be considered as 
trespass.


<R05>
Sec. 167.15  Control of livestock disease and introduction of livestock.

    (a) The District Grazing Committees with the approval of the 
Superintendent shall require livestock to be dipped, vaccinated, 
inspected and be restricted in movement when necessary to prevent the 
introduction and spread of contagious or infectious disease in the 
economic interest of the Navajo stock owners. Upon the recommendation of 
the District Grazing Committee livestock shall be dipped annually when 
such dipping is necessary to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. 
These annual dippings shall be completed on or before September 1st each 
year. Livestock, however, may be dipped at other times when necessary. 
The Superintendent or his authorized representative and the District 
Grazing Committee may also require the rounding up of cattle, horses, 
mules, etc., in each District for the purpose of inspection for disease, 
vaccinating, branding and other related operations.
    (b) No livestock shall be brought onto the Reservation without a 
permit issued by the Superintendent or his authorized representative 
following inspection, in order to safeguard Indian livestock from 
infections and contagious disease and to insure the introduction of good 
quality sires and breeding stock.
    (c) Any unusual disease conditions beyond the control measures 
provided herein shall be immediately reported by the District Grazing 
Committee to the Chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council and the 
Superintendent who

[[Page 540]]

shall attempt to obtain specialists and provide emergency funds to 
control and suppress the disease.


<R05>
Sec. 167.16  Fences.

    Favorable recommendation from the District Grazing Committee and a 
written authorization from the Superintendent or his authorized 
representative must be secured before any fences may be constructed in 
non-agricultural areas. The District Grazing Committee shall recommend 
to the Superintendent the removal of unauthorized existing fences, or 
fences enclosing demonstration areas no longer used as such, if it is 
determined that such fences interfere with proper range management or an 
equitable distribution of range privileges. All enclosures fenced for 
the purpose of protecting agricultural land shall be kept to a size 
commensurate with the needs for protection of agricultural land and must 
be enclosed by legal four strand barbed wire fence or the equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 167.17  Construction near permanent livestock water developments.

    (a) The District Grazing Committee shall regulate the construction 
of all dwellings, corrals and other structures within one-half mile of 
Government or Navajo Tribal developed permanent livestock waters such as 
springs, wells, and charcos or deep reservoirs.
    (b) A written authorization from the District Grazing Committee must 
be secured before any dwellings, corrals, or other structures may be 
constructed within one-half mile of Government or Navajo Tribal 
developed springs, wells and charcos or deep reservoirs.
    (c) No sewage disposal system shall be authorized to be built which 
will drain into springs or stream channels in such a manner that it 
would cause contamination of waters being used for livestock or human 
consumption.

and conditions:
    (1) The Area Director shall first verify that an applicant meets the 
criteria of the definition in Sec. 168.1(o) and will issue all permits.
    (2) The permitted number shall not exceed either (i) 10 SUYL (See 
Sec. 168.1(1)) for each eligible family member, or (ii) the grazing 
applicant's livestock inventory reduced by voluntary sales as adjusted 
by reproduction, in accordance with procedures developed by the Project 
Officer based upon the study by Stubblefield and Camfield, 1975 page 5. 
The determination of the person to whom permits will be issued and the 
number of livestock to be permitted will be based on information 
provided by the permit applicant and an assessment of the number of 
dependents residing in the immediate household.
    (3) The permit shall authorize grazing for a specific number and

assessed all range users on Hopi Partitioned Lands. The annual Hopi 
grazing fee shall be paid in full in advance of the annual effective 
date of the permit, prior to the issuance of a grazing permit. All 
interim permits will expire at the end of the period provided for 
completion of relocation, Pub. L. 99-190. Failure of the permittee to 
make payment in full in advance will be cause to deny issuance of the 
grazing permit.

restricted in accordance with applicable laws.


<R05>
Sec. 168.16  Impoundment and disposal of unauthorized livestock.

    Unauthorized livestock within any range unit of the Hopi Partitioned 
Lands which are not removed therefrom within the periods prescribed by 
the regulation will be impounded and disposed of by the Superintendent 
as provided herein.
    (a) When the Area Director determines that unauthorized livestock 
use is occurring and has definite knowledge of the kind of unauthorized 
livestock, and knows the name and address of the owners, such livestock 
may be impounded any time five days after written notice of intent to 
impound unauthorized livestock is mailed by certified mail or personally 
delivered to such owners or their agent.
    (b) When the Area Director determines that unauthorized livestock 
use is occurring but does not have complete knowledge of the number and 
class of livestock or if the name and address of the owner thereof are 
unknown, such livestock will be impounded anytime 15 days after the date 
of a General Notice of Intent to Impound unauthorized livestock is first 
published in the local newspaper, posted at the nearest chapter house, 
and in one or more local trading posts.
    (c) Unauthorized livestock on the Hopi Partitioned Lands which are 
owned by persons given notice under paragraph (a) of this section, and 
any unauthorized livestock in areas for which a notice has been posted 
and published under paragraph (b) of this section, will be impounded 
without further notice anytime within the twelve-month period 
immediately following the effective date of the notice.
    (d) Following the impoundment of unauthorized livestock a notice of 
sale of impounded livestock will be published in the local newspaper, 
posted at the nearest chapter house, and in one or more local trading 
posts. The notice will describe the livestock and specify the date, time 
and place of sale. The date set shall be at least 5 days after the 
publication and posting of such notice.
    (e) The owners or their agent may redeem the livestock anytime 
before the time set for the sale by submitting proof of ownership and 
paying for all expenses incurred in gathering, impounding and feeding or 
pasturing the livestock and any trespass fees and/or damages caused by 
the animals.
    (f) Livestock erroneously impounded shall be returned to the 
rightful owner and all expenses accruing thereto shall be waived.

[[Page 545]]

    (g) If the livestock are not redeemed before the time fixed for 
their sale, they shall be sold at public sale to the highest bidder, 
provided his bid is at or above the minimum amount set by the 
Superintendent based upon U.S.D.A.'s current Agricultural Statistic's 
Report for Arizona. If a bid at or above the minimum is not received the 
livestock may be sold at private sale at or above the minimum amount, 
reoffered at public sale, condemned and destroyed, or otherwise disposed 
of. When livestock are sold pursuant to this regulation, the 
superintendent shall furnish the buyer a bill of sale or other written 
instrument evidencing the sale.
    (h) The proceeds of any sale of impounded livestock shall be applied 
as follows:
    (1) To the payment of all expenses incurred by the United States in 
gathering, impounding, and feeding or pasturing the livestock;
    (2) In payment of any penalties or damages assessed pursuant to 
Sec. 168.14 of this part which penalties or damages shall be credited 
to the Hopi tribe as provided in said section;
    (3) Any remaining amount shall be paid over to the owner of said 
livestock upon his submitting proof of ownership.

meaning set forth as follows:
    (1) Concurrence means agreement by the Area Director and the Hopi 
Tribe, speaking through the Chairman of the Tribe (or his designee).
    (2) Non-concurrence means disagreement between the Area Director and 
the Hopi Tribe, speaking through the Chairman of the Hopi Tribe (or his 
designee), or a failure of the Hopi Tribe to respond to a proposal by 
the Area Director in a timely manner.
    (3) Timely manner means a period of thirty days, unless this period 
is shortened by the existence of an emergency. Upon request by the 
Tribal Council, the Area Director may extend the 30 day period. In 
instances where this period applies to the Area Director, he may extend 
the period by so notifying the Tribe.
    (4) An emergency is a condition that the Area Director finds 
threatens the rights and property of life tenants and persons awaiting 
relocation or one that the Area Director finds is causing the condition 
of the range land to deteriorate.
    (5) Conservation practice is a program consisting of a series of 
acts in conformance with the Bureau's range management policies and 
procedures which maintains or seeks to achieve the grazing potential of 
range lands on a continuing basis.
    (6) Range restoration activities is a program consisting of a series 
of range management acts, including but not limited to procedures which 
increase range forage production, reduce erosion, improve range 
usability and reduce stocking by issuing grazing permits to persons 
residing on Hopi partitioned lands at rates which maximize the carrying 
capacity of the range lands on a continuing basis.
    (7) Grazing control is a program consisting of a series of range 
management acts, including but not limited to procedures by which 
grazing permits are issued to persons residing on Hopi partitioned 
lands, which limit the grazing on range lands to its carrying capacity.
    (b) The Area Director will seek the participation of the Hopi Tribe 
in his investigation, formulation and planning of conservation practices 
for Hopi partitioned lands. The Area Director will submit, in writing, 
the proposed plan to the Hopi Tribe.
    (c) Upon receipt of the Area Director's proposed conservation 
practices, the Hopi Tribe will deliver, in writing, to the Area Director 
its concurrence or non-concurrence on all of the proposed conservation 
practices in a timely manner. The Area Director will continue to seek 
Hopi Tribal participation during the review process.
    (d) Concurrence of the Hopi Tribe will be sought on all conservation 
practices, range restoration activities, and grazing control programs on 
the Hopi Partitioned Lands.

[[Page 546]]

    (1) If the Area Director and the Hopi Tribe concur on all or part of 
the proposed conservation practices in writing in a timely manner, those 
practices concurred upon may be immediately implemented.
    (2) If the Hopi Tribe does not concur on all or part of the proposed 
conservation practices in a timely manner, the Area Director will submit 
in writing to the Hopi Tribe a declaration of non-concurrence. The Area 
Director will then notify the Hopi Tribe in writing of a formal hearing 
to be held not sooner than 15 days from the date of the non-concurrence 
declaration.
    (i) The formal hearing on non-concurrence will permit the submission 
of written evidence and argument concerning the proposal. Minutes of the 
hearing will be taken. Following the hearing, the Area Director may 
amend, alter or otherwise change his proposed conservation practices. 
Except as provided in Sec. 168.17(d)(1) of this section, if following 
the hearing, the Area Director altered or amends portions of his 
proposed plan of action, he will submit those individual altered or 
amended portions of the plan to the Tribe in a timely manner for their 
concurrence.
    (ii) In the event the Tribe fails or refuses to give its concurrence 
to the proposal at the hearing, then the implementation of such proposal 
may only be undertaken in those situations where the Area Director 
expressly determines in a written order, based upon findings of fact, 
that the proposed action is necessary to protect the rights and property 
of life tenants and/or persons awaiting relocation.

<R05>
Sec. 169.1  Definitions.

    As used in this part 169:
    (a) Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative acting under delegated authority. Before proceeding under 
these regulations anyone desiring a right-of-way should inquire at the 
Indian Agency, Area Field Office, or other office of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs having immediate supervision over the lands involved to 
determine the identity of the authorized representative of the Secretary 
for the purposes of this part 169.
    (b) Individually owned land means land or any interest therein held 
in

[[Page 547]]

trust by the United States for the benefit of individual Indians and 
land or any interest therein held by individual Indians subject to 
Federal restrictions against alienation or encumbrance.
    (c) Tribe means a tribe, band, nation, community, group or pueblo of 
Indians.
    (d) Tribal land means land or any interest therein, title to which 
is held by the United States in trust for a tribe, or title to which is 
held by any tribe subject to Federal restrictions against alienation or 
encumbrance, and includes such land reserved for Indian Bureau 
administrative purposes. The term also includes lands held by the United 
States in trust for an Indian corporation chartered under section 17 of 
the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 988; 25 U.S.C. 477).
    (e) Government owned land means land owned by the United States and 
under the jurisdiction of the Secretary which was acquired or set aside 
for the use and benefit of Indians and not included in the definitions 
set out in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 169.2  Purpose and scope of regulations.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.2 of this chapter, the 
regulations in this part 169 prescribe the procedures, terms and 
conditions under which rights-of-way over and across tribal land, 
individually owned land and Government owned land may be granted.
    (b) Appeals from administrative action taken under the regulations 
in this part 169 shall be made in accordance with part 2 of this 
chapter.
    (c) The regulations contained in this part 169 do not cover the 
granting of rights-of-way upon tribal lands within a reservation for the 
purpose of constructing, operating, or maintaining dams, water conduits, 
reservoirs, powerhouses, transmission lines or other works which shall 
constitute a part of any project for which a license is required by the 
Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act provides that any license which 
shall be issued to use tribal lands within a reservation shall be 
subject to and contain such conditions as the Secretary of the Interior 
shall deem necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of such 
lands. (16 U.S.C. 797(e)). In the case of tribal lands belonging to a 
tribe organized under the Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984), the 
Federal Power Act requires that annual charges for the use of such 
tribal lands under any license issued by the Federal Power Commission 
shall be subject to the approval of the tribe (16 U.S.C. 803(e)).


<R05>
Sec. 169.3  Consent of landowners to grants of right-of-way.

    (a) No right-of-way shall be granted over and across any tribal 
land, nor shall any permission to survey be issued with respect to any 
such lands, without the prior written consent of the tribe.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no right-
of-way shall be granted over and across any individually owned lands, 
nor shall any permission to survey be issued with respect to any such 
lands, without the prior written consent of the owner or owners of such 
lands and the approval of the Secretary.
    (c) The Secretary may issue permission to survey with respect to, 
and he may grant rights-of-way over and across individually owned lands 
without the consent of the individual Indian owners when
    (1) The individual owner of the land or of an interest therein is a 
minor or a person non compos mentis, and the Secretary finds that such 
grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner, which 
cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages;
    (2) The land is owned by more than one person, and the owners or 
owner of a majority of the interests therein consent to the grant;
    (3) The whereabouts of the owner of the land or an interest therein 
are unknown, and the owners or owner of any interests therein whose 
whereabouts are known, or a majority thereof, consent to the grant;
    (4) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or an 
interest therein have not been determined, and the Secretary finds that 
the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any owner 
thereof;
    (5) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the 
Secretary finds it would be impracticable

[[Page 548]]

to obtain their consent, and also finds that the grant will cause no 
substantial injury to the land or any owner thereof.

<R05>
Sec. 169.4  Permission to survey.

    Anyone desiring to obtain permission to survey for a right-of-way 
across individually owned, tribal or Government owned land must file a 
written application therefor with the Secretary. The application shall 
adequately describe the proposed project, including the purpose and 
general location, and it shall be accompanied by the written consents 
required by Sec. 169.3, by satisfactory evidence of the good faith and 
financial responsibility of the applicant, and by a check or money order 
of sufficient amount to cover twice the estimated damages which may be 
sustained as a result of the survey. With the approval of the Secretary, 
a surety bond may be substituted in lieu of a check or money order 
accompanying an application, provided the company issuing the surety 
bond is licensed to do business in the State where the land to be 
surveyed is located. The application shall contain an agreement to 
indemnify the United States, the owners of the land, and occupants of 
the land, against liability for loss of life, personal injury and 
property damage occurring because of survey activities and caused by the 
applicant, his employees, contractors and their employees, or 
subcontractors and their employees. When the applicant is an agency or 
instrumentality of the Federal or a State Government and is prohibited 
by law from depositing estimated damages in advance or agreeing to 
indemnification, the requirement for such a deposit and indemnification 
may be waived providing the applicant agrees in writing to pay damages 
promptly when they are sustained. An application filed by a corporation 
must be accompanied by a copy of its charter or articles of 
incorporation duly certified by the proper State official of the State 
where the corporation was organized, and a certified copy of the 
resolution or bylaws of the corporation authorizing the filing of the 
application. When the land covered by the application is located in a 
State other than that in which the application was incorporated, it must 
also submit a certificate of the proper State official that the 
applicant is authorized to do business in the State where the land is 
located. An application filed by an unincorporated partnership or 
association must be accompanied by a certified copy of the articles of 
partnership or association, or if there be none, this fact must be 
stated over the signature of each member of the partnership or 
association. If the applicant has previously filed with the Secretary an 
application accompanied by the evidence required in this section, a 
reference to the date and place of such filing, accompanied by proof of 
current financial responsibility and good faith, will be sufficient. 
Upon receipt of an application made in compliance with the regulations 
of this part 169, the Secretary may grant the applicant written 
permission to survey.


<R05>
Sec. 169.5  Application for right-of-way.

    Written application identifying the specific use requested shall be 
filed in duplicate with the Secretary. The application shall cite the 
statute or statutes under which it is filed and the width and length of 
the desired right-of-way, and shall be accompanied by satisfactory 
evidence of the good faith and financial responsibility of the 
applicant. An application filed by a corporation must be accompanied by 
a copy of its charter or articles of incorporation duly certified by the 
proper State official of the State where the corporation was organized, 
and a certified copy of the resolution or bylaws of the corporation 
authorizing the filing of the application. When the land covered by the 
application is located in a State other than that in which the applicant 
was incorporated, it must also submit a certificate of the proper State 
official that the applicant is authorized to do business in the State 
where the land is located. An application filed by an unincorporated 
partnership or association must be accompanied be a certified copy of 
the articles of partnership or association, or if there be none, this 
fact must be stated over the signature of each member of the partnership 
or association. If the

[[Page 549]]

applicant has previously filed with the Secretary an application 
accompanied by the evidence required by this section, a reference to the 
date and place of such filing will be sufficient. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section, the application shall be accompanied by a duly 
executed stipulation, in duplicate, expressly agreeing to the following:
    (a) To construct and maintain the right-of-way in a workmanlike 
manner.
    (b) To pay promptly all damages and compensation, in addition to the 
deposit made pursuant to Sec. 169.4, determined by the Secretary to be 
due the landowners and authorized users and occupants of the land on 
account of the survey, granting, construction and maintenance of the 
right-of-way.
    (c) To indemnify the landowners and authorized users and occupants 
against any liability for loss of life, personal injury and property 
damage arising from the construction, maintenance, occupancy or use of 
the lands by the applicant, his employees, contractors and their 
employees, or subcontractors and their employees.
    (d) To restore the lands as nearly as may be possible to their 
original condition upon the completion of construction to the extent 
compatible with the purpose for which the right-of-way was granted.
    (e) To clear and keep clear the lands within the right-of-way to the 
extent compatible with the purpose of the right-of-way; and to dispose 
of all vegetative and other material cut, uprooted, or otherwise 
accumulated during the construction and maintenance of the project.
    (f) To take soil and resource conservation and protection measures, 
including weed control, on the land covered by the right-of-way.
    (g) To do everything reasonably within its power to prevent and 
suppress fires on or near the lands to be occupied under the right-of-
way.
    (h) To build and repair such roads, fences, and trails as may be 
destroyed or injured by construction work and to build and maintain 
necessary and suitable crossings for all roads and trails that intersect 
the works constructed, maintained, or operated under the right-of-way.
    (i) That upon revocation or termination of the right-of-way, the 
applicant shall, so far as is reasonably possible, restore the land to 
its original condition.
    (j) To at all times keep the Secretary informed of its address, and 
in case of corporations, of the address of its principal place of 
business and of the names and addresses of its principal officers.
    (k) That the applicant will not interfere with the use of the lands 
by or under the authority of the landowners for any purpose not 
inconsistent with the primary purpose for which the right-of-way is 
granted.

When the applicant is the U.S. Government or a State Government or an 
instrumentality thereof and is prohibited by law from executing any of 
the above stipulations, the Secretary may waive the requirement that the 
applicant agree to any stipulations so prohibited.

Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 169.6  Maps.

    (a) Each application for a right-of-way shall be accompanied by maps 
of definite location consisting of an original on tracing linen or other 
permanent and reproducible material and two reproductions thereof. The 
field notes shall accompany the application, as provided in Sec. 169.7. 
The width of the right-of-way shall be clearly shown on the maps.
    (b) A separate map shall be filed for each section of 20 miles of 
right-of-way, but the map of the last section may include any excess of 
10 miles or less.
    (c) The scale of maps showing the line of route normally should be 
2,000 feet to an inch. The maps may, however, be drawn to a larger scale 
when necessary and when an increase in scale cannot be avoided through 
the use of separate field notes, but the scale must not be increased to 
such extent as to make the maps too cumbersome for convenient handling 
and filing.
    (d) The maps shall show the allotment number of each tract of 
allotted land, and shall clearly designate each tract of tribal land 
affected, together with the sections, townships, and

[[Page 550]]

ranges in which the lands crossed by the right-of-way are situated.


<R05>
Sec. 169.7  Field notes.

    Field notes of the survey shall appear along the line indicating the 
right-of-way on the maps, unless the maps would be too crowded thereby 
to be easily legible, in which event the field notes may be filed 
separately on tracing linen in such form that they may be folded readily 
for filing. Where field notes are placed on separate tracing linen, it 
will be necessary to place on the maps only a sufficient number of 
station numbers so as to make it convenient to follow the field notes. 
The field notes shall be typewritten. Whether endorsed on the maps or 
filed separately, the field notes shall be sufficiently complete so as 
to permit the line indicating the right-of-way to be readily retraced on 
the ground from the notes. They shall show whether the line was run on 
true or magnetic bearings, and, in the latter case, the variation of the 
needle and date of determination must be stated. One or more bearings 
(or angular connections with public survey lines) must be given. The 10-
mile sections must be indicated and numbered on all lines of road 
submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 169.8  Public survey.

    (a) The terminal of the line of route shall be fixed by reference of 
course and distance to the nearest existing corner of the public survey. 
The maps, as well as the engineer's affidavit and the certificate, shall 
show these connections.
    (b) When either terminal of the line of route is upon unsurveyed 
land, it must be connected by traverse with an established corner of the 
public survey if not more than 6 miles distant from it, and the single 
bearing and distance from the terminal point to the corner computed and 
noted on the maps, in the engineer's affidavit, and in the certificate. 
The notes and all data for the computation of the traverse must be 
given.


<R05>
Sec. 169.9  Connection with natural objects.

    When the distance to an established corner of the public survey is 
more than 6 miles, this connection will be made with a natural object or 
a permanent monument which can be readily found and recognized, and 
which will fix and perpetuate the position of the terminal point. The 
maps must show the position of such mark, and course and distance to the 
terminus. There must be given an accurate description of the mark and 
full data concerning the traverse, and the engineer's affidavit and the 
certificate on the maps must state the connections.


<R05>
Sec. 169.10  Township and section lines.

    Whenever the line of survey crosses a township or section line of 
the public survey, the distance to the nearest existing corner shall be 
noted. The maps shall show these distances and the station numbers at 
the points of intersections. The field notes shall show these distances 
and the station numbers.


<R05>
Sec. 169.11  Affidavit and certificate.

    (a) There shall be subscribed on the maps of definite location an 
affidavit executed by the engineer who made the survey and a certificate 
executed by the applicant, both certifying to the accuracy of the survey 
and maps and both designating by termini and length in miles and 
decimals, the line of route for which the right-of-way application is 
made.
    (b) Maps covering roads built by the Bureau of Indian Affairs which 
are to be transferred to a county or State government shall contain an 
affidavit as to the accuracy of the survey, executed by the Bureau 
highway engineer in charge of road construction, and a certificate by 
the State or county engineer or other authorized State or county officer 
accepting the right-of-way and stating that he is satisfied as to the 
accuracy of the survey and maps.

<R05>
Sec. 169.13  Other damages.

    In addition to the consideration for a grant of right-of-way 
provided for by the provisions of Sec. 169.12, the applicant for a 
right-of-way will be required to pay all damages incident to the survey 
of the right-of-way or incident to the construction or maintenance of 
the facility for which the right-of-way is granted.


<R05>
Sec. 169.14  Deposit and disbursement of consideration and damages.

    At the time of filing an application for right-of-way, the applicant 
must deposit with the Secretary the total estimated consideration and 
damages, which shall include consideration for the right-of-way, 
severance damages, damages caused during the survey, and estimated 
damages to result from construction less any deposit previously made 
under Sec. 169.4. In no case shall the amount deposited as 
consideration for the right-of-way over any parcel be less than the 
amount specified in the consent covering that parcel. If in reviewing 
the application, the Secretary determines that the amounts deposited are 
inadequate to compensate the owners, the applicant shall increase the 
deposit to an amount determined by the Secretary to be adequate. The 
amounts so deposited shall be held in a ``special deposit'' account for 
distribution to or for the account of the landowners and authorized 
users and occupants of the land. Amounts deposited to cover damages 
resulting from survey and construction may be disbursed after the 
damages have been sustained. Amounts deposited to cover consideration 
for the right-of-way and severance damages shall be disbursed upon the 
granting of the right-of-way. Any part of the deposit which is not 
required for disbursement as aforesaid shall be refunded to the 
applicant promptly following receipt of the affidavit of completion of 
construction filed pursuant to Sec. 169.16.


<R05>
Sec. 169.15  Action on application.

    Upon satisfactory compliance with the regulations in this part 169, 
the Secretary is authorized to grant the right-of-way by issuance of a 
conveyance instrument in the form approved by the Secretary. Such 
instrument shall incorporate all conditions or restrictions set out in 
the consents obtained pursuant to Sec. 169.3. A copy of such instrument 
shall be promptly delivered to the applicant and thereafter the 
applicant may proceed with the construction work. Maps of definite 
location may be attached to and incorporated into the conveyance 
document by reference. In the discretion of the Secretary, one 
conveyance document may be issued covering all of the tracts of land 
traversed by the right-of-way, or separate conveyances may be made 
covering one or several tracts included in the application. A duplicate 
original copy of the conveyance instrument, permanent and reproducible 
maps, a copy of the application and stipulations, together with any 
other pertinent documents shall be transmitted by the Secretary to the 
office of record for land documents affecting the land covered by the 
right-of-way, where they will be recorded and filed.


<R05>
Sec. 169.16  Affidavit of completion.

    Upon the completion of the construction of any right-of-way, the 
applicant shall promptly file with the Secretary an affidavit of 
completion, in duplicate, executed by the engineer and certified by the 
applicant. The Secretary shall transmit one copy of the affidavit to the 
office of record mentioned in Sec. 169.15. Failure to file an affidavit 
in accordance with this section shall subject the right-of-way to 
cancellation in accordance with Sec. 169.20.


<R05>
Sec. 169.17  Change of location.

    If any change from the location described in the conveyance 
instrument is found to be necessary on account of engineering 
difficulties or otherwise, amended maps and field notes of the new 
location shall be filed, and a right-of-way for such new route or 
location shall be subject to consent, approval, the ascertainment of 
damages, and the payment thereof, in all respects as in

[[Page 552]]

the case of the original location. Before a revised conveyance 
instrument is issued, the applicant shall execute such instruments 
deemed necessary by the Secretary extinguishing the right-of-way at the 
original location. Such instruments shall be transmitted by the 
Secretary to the office of record mentioned in Sec. 169.15 for 
recording and filing.


<R05>
Sec. 169.18  Tenure of approved right-of-way grants.

    All rights-of-way granted under the regulations in this part 169 
shall be in the nature of easements for the periods stated in the 
conveyance instrument. Except as otherwise determined by the Secretary 
and stated in the conveyance instrument, rights-of-way granted under the 
Act of February 5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323-328), for railroads, 
telephone lines, telegraph lines, public roads and highways, access 
roads to homesite properties, public sanitary and storm sewer lines 
including sewage disposal and treatment plants, water control and use 
projects (including but not limited to dams, reservoirs, flowage 
easements, ditches, and canals), oil, gas, and public utility water 
pipelines (including pumping stations and appurtenant facilities), 
electric power projects, generating plants, switchyards, electric 
transmission and distribution lines (including poles, towers, and 
appurtenant facilities), and for service roads and trails essential to 
any of the aforestated use purposes, may be without limitation as to 
term of years; whereas, rights-of-way for all other purposes shall be 
for a period of not to exceed 50 years, as determined by the Secretary 
and stated in the conveyance instrument.

<R05>
Sec. 169.19  Renewal of right-of-way grants.

    On or before the expiration date of any right-of-way heretofore or 
hereafter granted for a limited term of years, an application may be 
submitted for a renewal of the grant. If the renewal involves no change 
in the location or status of the original right-of-way grant, the 
applicant may file with his application a certificate under oath setting 
out this fact, and the Secretary, with the consent required by Sec. 
169.3, may thereupon extend the grant for a like term of years, upon the 
payment of consideration as set forth in Sec. 169.12. If any change in 
the size, type, or location of the right-of-way is involved, the 
application for renewal shall be treated and handled as in the case of 
an original application for a right-of-way.


<R05>
Sec. 169.20  Termination of right-of-way grants.

    All rights-of-way granted under the regulations in this part may be 
terminated in whole or in part upon 30 days written notice from the 
Secretary mailed to the grantee at its latest address furnished in 
accordance with Sec. 169.5(j) for any of the following causes:
    (a) Failure to comply with any term or condition of the grant or the 
applicable regulations;
    (b) A nonuse of the right-of-way for a consecutive 2-year period for 
the purpose for which it was granted;
    (c) An abandonment of the right-of-way.

If within the 30-day notice period the grantee fails to correct the 
basis for termination, the Secretary shall issue an appropriate 
instrument terminating the right-of-way. Such instrument shall be 
transmitted by the Secretary to the office of record mentioned in Sec. 
169.15 for recording and filing.

<R05>
Sec. 169.21  Condemnation actions involving individually owned lands.

    The facts relating to any condemnation action to obtain a right-of-
way over individually owned lands shall be reported immediately by 
officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs having knowledge of such facts 
to appropriate officials of the Interior Department so that action may 
be taken to safeguard the interests of the Indians.


<R05>
Sec. 169.22  Service lines.

    (a) An agreement shall be executed by and between the landowner or a 
legally authorized occupant or user of individually owned land and the 
applicant before any work by the applicant

[[Page 553]]

may be undertaken to construct a service line across such land. Such a 
service line shall be limited in the case of power lines to a voltage of 
14.5 kv. or less except lines to serve irrigation pumps and commercial 
and industrial uses which shall be limited to a voltage not to exceed 
34.5 kv. A service line shall be for the sole purpose of supplying the 
individual owner or authorized occupant or user of land, including 
schools and churches, with telephone, water, electric power, gas, and 
other utilities for use by such owner, occupant, or user of the land on 
the premises.
    (b) A similar agreement to that required in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be executed by the tribe or legally authorized occupant or 
user of tribal land and the applicant before any work by the applicant 
may be undertaken for the construction of a service line across tribal 
land. A service line shall be for the sole purpose of supplying an 
occupant or user of tribal land with any of the utilities specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section. No agreement under this paragraph shall 
be valid unless its execution shall have been duly authorized in advance 
of construction by the governing body of the Indian tribe whose land is 
affected, unless the contract under which the occupant or user of the 
land obtained his rights specifically authorizes such occupant or user 
to enter into service agreements for utilities without further tribal 
consent.
    (c) In order to encourage the use of telephone, water, electric 
power, gas and other utilities and to facilitate the extension of these 
modern conveniences to sparsely settled Indian areas without undue costs 
the agreement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall only be 
required to include or have appended thereto, a plat or diagram showing 
with particularity the location, size, and extent of the line. When the 
plat or diagram is placed on a separate sheet it shall bear the 
signature of the parties. In case of tribal land, the agreement shall be 
accompanied by a certified copy of the tribal authorization when 
required.
    (d) An executed copy of the agreement, together with a plat or 
diagram, and in the case of tribal land, an authenticated copy of the 
tribal authorization, when required, shall be filed with the Secretary 
within 30 days after the date of its execution. Failure to meet this 
requirement may result in the removal of improvements placed on the land 
at the expense of the party responsible for the placing of such 
improvements and subject such party to the payment of damages caused by 
his unauthorized act.

individually owned and Government-owned land, except in the State of 
Oklahoma, for railroads, station buildings, depots, machine shops, side 
tracks, turnouts, and water stations; for reservoirs, material or 
ballast pits needed to the construction, repair, and maintenance of 
railroads; and for the planting and growing of trees to protect railroad 
lines. Rights-of-way granted under the above acts shall be subject to 
the provisions of this section as well as other pertinent sections of 
this part 169. Except when otherwise determined by the Secretary, 
rights-of-way for the above purposes granted under the Act of February 
5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323-328), shall also be subject to the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) Rights-of-way for railroads shall not exceed 50 feet in width on 
each side of the centerline of the road, except where there are heavy 
cuts and fills, when they shall not exceed 100 feet in width on each 
side of the road. The right-of-way may include grounds adjacent to the 
line for station buildings, depots, machine shops, side tracks, 
turnouts, and water stations, not to exceed 200 feet in width by a 
length of 3,000 feet, with no more than one station to be located within 
any one continuous length of 10 miles of road.
    (c) Short spurs and branch lines may be shown on the map of the main

plats must be filed for such grounds. The maps shall show any other line 
crossed, or with which connection is made. The station number shall be 
shown on the survey thereof at the point of intersection. All 
intersecting roads must be represented in ink of a different color from 
that used for the line for which application is made.
    (d) Plats of railroad station grounds shall be drawn on a scale of 
400 feet to an inch, and must be filed separately from the line of 
route. Such plats shall show enough of the line of route to indicate the 
position of the tract with reference thereto. Each station ground tract 
must be located with respect to the public survey as provided in Sec. 
169.8 and all buildings or other structures shall be platted on a scale 
sufficiently large to show clearly their dimensions and relative 
positions.
    (e) If any proposed railroad is parallel to, and within 10 miles of, 
a railroad already built or in course of construction, it must be shown 
wherein the public interest will be promoted by the proposed road. Where 
the Interstate Commerce Commission has passed on this point, a certified 
copy of its findings must be filed with the application.
    (f) The applicant must certify that the road is to be operated as a 
common carrier of passengers and freight.
    (g) The applicant shall execute and file, in duplicate, a 
stipulation obligating the company to use all precautions possible to 
prevent forest fires and to suppress such fires when they occur, to 
construct and maintain passenger and freight stations for each 
Government townsite, and to permit the crossing, in a manner 
satisfactory to the Government officials in charge, of the right-of-way 
by canals, ditches, and other projects.
    (h) A railroad company may apply for sufficient land for ballast or 
material pits, reservoirs, or tree planting to aid in the construction 
or maintenance of the road. The authority to use any land for such 
purposes shall terminate upon abandonment or upon failure to use the 
land for such purposes for a continuous period of 2 years.

Sec. 169.24  Railroads in Oklahoma.

    (a) The Act of February 28, 1902 (32 Stat. 43), authorizes right-of-
way grants across tribal and individually owned land in Oklahoma. 
Rights-of-way granted under that act shall be subject to the provisions 
of this section as well as other pertinent sections of this part 169. 
Except when otherwise determined by the Secretary, railroad rights-of-
way in Oklahoma granted under the Act of February 5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 
25 U.S.C. 323-328), shall also be subject to the provisions of this 
section.
    (b) One copy on tracing linen of the map of definite location 
showing the line of route and all lands included within the right-of-way 
must be filed with the Secretary. When tribal lands are involved, a copy 
of the map must also be filed with the tribal council.
    (c) Before any railroad may be constructed or any lands taken or 
condemned for any of the purposes set forth in section 13 of the Act of 
February 28, 1902 (32 Stat. 47), full damages shall be paid to the 
Indian owners.
    (d) After the maps have been filed, the matter of damages shall be 
negotiated by the applicant directly with the Indian owners. If an 
amicable settlement cannot be reached, the amount to be paid as 
compensation and damages shall be fixed and determined as provided in 
the statute. If court proceedings are instituted, the facts shall be 
reported immediately as provided in Sec. 169.21.

Secretary, rights-of-way granted for such purposes under the Act of 
February 5, 1948 (62 Stat. 17; 25 U.S.C. 323-328) shall also be

[[Page 555]]

subject to the provisions of this section.
    (b) Rights-of-way, granted under aforesaid Act of March 11, 1904, as 
amended, for oil and gas pipelines, pumping stations or tank sites shall 
not extend beyond a term of 20 years and may be extended for another 
period of not to exceed 20 years following the procedures set out in 
Sec. 169.19 of this part.
    (c) All oil or gas pipelines, including connecting lines, shall be 
buried a sufficient depth below the surface of the land so as not to 
interfere with cultivation. Whenever the line is laid under a road or 
highway, the right-of-way for which has been granted under an approved 
application pursuant to an act of Congress, its construction shall be in 
compliance with the applicable Federal and State laws; during the period 
of construction, at least one-half the width of the road shall be kept 
open to travel; and, upon completion, the road or highway shall be 
restored to its original condition and all excavations shall be 
refilled. Whenever the line crosses a ravine, canyon, or waterway, it 
shall be laid below the bed thereof or upon such superstructure as will 
not interfere with the use of the surface.
    (d) The size of the proposed pipeline must be shown in the 
application, on the maps, and in the engineer's affidavit and 
applicant's certificate. The application and maps shall specify whether 
the pipe is welded, screw-joint, dresser, or other type of coupling. 
Should the grantee of an approved right-of-way desire at any time to lay 
additional line or lines of pipe in the same trench, or to replace the 
original line with larger or smaller pipe, written permission must first 
be obtained from the Secretary and all damages to be sustained by the 
owners must be paid in advance in the amount fixed and determined by the 
Secretary.
    (e) Applicants for oil or gas pipeline rights-of-way may apply for 
additional land for pumping stations or tank sites. The maps shall show 
clearly the location of all structures and the location of all lines 
connecting with the main line. Applicants for lands for pumping stations 
or tank sites shall execute and file a stipulation agreeing as follows:
    (1) Upon abandonment of the right-of-way to level all dikes, fire-
guards, and excavations and to remove all concrete masonry foundations, 
bases, and structural works and to restore the land as nearly as may be 
possible to its original condition.
    (2) That a grant for pumping station or tank site purposes shall be 
subservient to the owner's right to remove or authorize the removal of 
oil, gas, or other mineral deposits; and that the structures for pumping 
station or tank site will be removed or relocated if necessary to avoid 
interference with the exploration for or recovery of oil, gas, or other 
minerals.
    (f) Purely lateral lines connecting with oil or gas wells on 
restricted lands may be constructed upon filing with the Secretary a 
copy of the written consent of the Indian owners and a blueprint copy of 
a map showing the location of the lateral. Such lateral lines may be of 
any diameter or length, but must be limited to those used solely for the 
transportation of oil or gas from a single tract of tribal or 
individually owned land to another lateral or to a branch of the main 
line.
    (g) The applicant, by accepting a pipeline right-of-way, thereby 
agrees that the books and records of the applicant shall be open to 
inspection by the Secretary at all reasonable times, in order to obtain 
information pertaining in any way to oil or gas produced from tribal or 
individually owned lands or other lands under the jurisdiction of the 
Secretary.

agencies of the Department of the Interior, for authority to survey, 
locate, or commence construction work on any project for the generation 
of electric power, or the transmission or distribution of electrical 
power of 66 kV or higher involving Government-owned lands shall be 
referred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for 
Water and Power Resources or such other agency as may be designated for 
the area involved, for consideration of the relationship of the proposed 
project to the power development program of the United States. Where the 
proposed project will not conflict with the program of the United 
States, the Secretary, upon notification to the effect, may then proceed 
to act upon the application. In the case of necessary changes respecting 
the proposed location, construction, or utilization of the project in 
order to eliminate conflicts with the power development program of the 
United States, the Secretary shall obtain from the applicant written 
consent to or compliance with such requirements before taking further

any radio installation, telephone line, or other communication 
facilities now or hereafter constructed and operated by the United 
States or any agency thereof. This provision shall not relieve the 
applicant from any responsibility or requirement which may be imposed by 
other lawful authority for avoiding or eliminating inductive 
interference.
    (f) An applicant for a right-of-way for a transmission line across 
Government-owned lands having a voltage of 66 kV or more must, in 
addition to the stipulation required by Sec. 169.5, execute and file 
with its application a stipulation agreeing to accept the right-of-way 
grant subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The applicant agrees that, in the event it becomes necessary for 
the United States to acquire the applicant's transmission line or 
facilities constructed on or across such right-of-way, the United States 
reserves the right to acquire such line or facilities at a sum to be 
determined upon by a representative of the applicant, a representative 
of the Secretary of the Interior, and a third representative to be 
selected by the other two for the purpose of determining the value of 
such property thus to be acquired by the United States.
    (2) To allow the Department of the Interior to utilize for the 
transmission of electrical power any surplus capacity of the line in 
excess of the capacity needed by the holder of the grant for the 
transmission of electrical power in connection with the applicant's 
operations, or to increase the capacity of the line at the Department's 
expense and to utilize the increased capacity for the transmission of 
electrical power. Utilization by the Department of surplus or increased 
capacity shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:
    (i) When the Department desires to utilize surplus capacity thought 
to exist in a line, notification will be given to the applicant and the 
applicant shall furnish to the Department within 30 days a certificate 
stating whether the line has any surplus capacity not needed by the 
applicant for the transmission of electrical power in connection with 
the applicant's operations, and, if so, the extent of such surplus 
capacity.
    (ii) In order to utilize any surplus capacity certified by the 
applicant to be available, or any increased capacity provided by the 
Department at its own expense, the Department may interconnect its 
transmission facilities with the applicant's line in a manner 
conformable to approved standards of practice for the interconnection of 
transmission circuits.
    (iii) The expense of interconnection will be borne by the 
Department, and the Department will at all times provide and maintain 
adequate switching, relaying, and protective equipment so as to insure 
that the normal and efficient operation of the applicant's line will not 
be impaired.
    (iv) After any interconnection is completed, the applicant shall 
operate and maintain its line in good condition; and, except in 
emergencies, shall maintain in a closed position all connections under 
the applicant's control between the applicant's line and the 
interconnecting facilities provided by the Department.
    (v) The interconnected power systems of the Department and the 
applicant will be operated in parallel.
    (vi) The transmission of electrical power by the Department over the 
applicant's line will be effected in such manner and quantity as will 
not interfere unreasonably with the applicant's use and operation of the 
line in accordance with the applicant's normal operating standards, 
except that the Department shall have the exclusive right to utilize any 
increased capacity of the line which has been provided at the 
Department's expense.
    (vii) The applicant will not be obligated to allow the transmission 
over its line by the Department of electrical power to any person 
receiving service from the applicant on the date of the filing of the 
application for a grant, other than persons entitled to statutory 
preference in connection with the distribution and sale of electrical 
power by the Department.
    (viii) The Department will pay to the applicant an equitable share 
of the

[[Page 558]]

total monthly cost of maintaining and operating the part of the 
applicant's line utilized by the Department for the transmission of 
electrical power, the payment to be an amount in dollars representing 
the same proportion of the total monthly operation and maintenance cost 
of such part of the line as the maximum amount in kilowatts of the power 
transmitted on a scheduled basis by the Department over the applicant's 
line during the month bears to the total capacity in kilowatts of that 
part of the line. The total monthly cost may include interest and 
amortization, in accordance with the system of accounts prescribed by 
the Federal Power Commission, on the applicant's net total investment 
(exclusive of any investment by the Department) in the part of the line 
utilized by the Department.
    (ix) If, at any time subsequent to a certification by the applicant 
that surplus capacity is available for utilization by the Department, 
the applicant needs for the transmission of electrical power in 
connection with its operations the whole or any part of the capacity of 
the line theretofore certified as being surplus to its needs, the 
applicant may modify or revoke the previous certification by giving the 
Secretary of the Interior 30 months' notice, in advance, of the 
applicant's intention in this respect. After the revocation of a 
certificate, the Department's utilization of the particular line will be 
limited to the increased capacity, if any, provided by the Department at 
its expense.
    (x) If, during the existence of the grant, the applicant desires 
reciprocal accommodations for the transmission of electrical power over 
the interconnecting system of the Department to its line, such 
reciprocal accommodations will be accorded under terms and conditions 
similar to those prescribed in this paragraph with respect to the 
transmission by the Department of electrical power over the applicant's 
line.
    (xi) The terms and conditions prescribed in this paragraph may be 
modified at any time by means of a supplemental agreement negotiated 
between the applicant and the Secretary of the Interior or his designee.
    (g) Applicants may apply for additional lands for generating plants 
and appurtenant facilities. The lands desired for such purposes may be 
indicated on the maps showing the definite location of the right-of-way, 
but separate maps must be filed therefor. Such maps shall show enough of 
the line of route to indicate the position of the tract with respect to 
said line. The tract shall be located with respect to the public survey 
as provided in Sec. 169.8, and all buildings or other structures shall 
be platted on a scale sufficiently large to show clearly their 
dimensions and relative positions.

tribal governments and other IRR Program participants in extending their 
technical capabilities by providing them greater access to 
transportation technology, training, and research opportunities.


<R05>
Sec. 170.162  How is the Indian LTAP funded?

    FHWA uses Highway Trust Funds to fund the Indian LTAP. BIA may use 
IRR Program management and oversight funds for Indian LTAP centers. 
These funds may be used to operate Indian LTAP centers and to develop 
training materials and products for these centers. The Indian LTAP 
centers should apply for supplemental funding from other sources to 
accommodate their needs.


<R05>
Sec. 170.163  How are Indian LTAP recipients selected?

    (a) FHWA announces Indian LTAP grant, cooperative agreement, and 
contracting opportunities in the Federal Register. The announcements 
state that tribal governments, a consortium of tribal governments, State 
transportation departments, or universities are eligible for these 
awards; indicate the funds available; and provide eligibility criteria.
    (b) FHWA sends the information in paragraph (a) of this section to 
BIA for distribution to tribal governments and consortia. BIA must 
provide written notice to tribal governments and consortia.
    (c) A selection committee of Federal and tribal representatives (see 
Sec. 170.164) reviews the proposals of eligible applicants and 
recommends award recipients. FHWA selects and notifies award recipients 
consistent with applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 170.164  How are tribal representatives nominated and chosen for the selection committee?

    In its written notice to tribal governments announcing opportunities 
under the Indian LTAP, FHWA requests nominations within each Indian 
LTAP's service area for representatives to serve on the selection 
committee. Forty-five days after receiving the request for nominations, 
FHWA will notify tribal governments of the nominees for the service 
area. Each tribe then has 30 days to notify FHWA of its selection from 
the nominees.


<R05>
Sec. 170.165  May a tribe enter into a contract or agreement for Indian LTAP funds?

    Yes. If selected for an award as an Indian LTAP Center, a tribe will 
enter into a cooperative agreement with the FHWA and be subject to the 
guidelines of the agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 170.166  What services do Indian LTAP centers provide?

    (a) Indian LTAP centers provide transportation technology transfer 
services, including education, training, technical assistance and 
related support services to tribal governments and IRR Program 
participants. Indian LTAPs will:
    (1) Develop and expand tribal expertise in road and transportation 
areas;
    (2) Improve IRR Program performance;
    (3) Enhance tribal transportation planning, project selection, 
transit and freight programs;
    (4) Develop transportation training and technical resource materials 
and present workshops;
    (5) Improve tribal tourism and recreational travel programs;

committee;
    (8) Coordinate with State LTAPs, other Indian technical centers, 
Rural Technical Assistance Program (RTAP) centers, tribal governments, 
and local planning and transportation agencies to share and exchange 
publications, videotapes, training material, and conduct joint 
workshops;
    (9) Consult with tribes and IRR Program participants concerning 
technical assistance and training desired; and
    (10) Prepare an annual report and distribute this report to service 
area tribes.


<R05>
Sec. 170.167  How does a tribe obtain services from an Indian LTAP center?

    A tribe that wants to obtain services should contact the Indian LTAP 
center serving its service area or its BIA regional road engineer. 
Information about the centers and the services provided can be found on 
the World Wide Web at the following address: http://www.ltap.org.


<R05>
Sec. 170.168  Do Indian LTAP centers offer services similar to those of State LTAPs?

    Yes. However, Indian LTAP centers are primarily responsible for 
increasing the capacity of tribal governments to administer 
transportation programs. State LTAPs also provide services to local and 
rural governments, including tribal governments. Indian LTAP centers 
should coordinate education and training opportunities with State LTAP 
centers to maximize resources.


<R05>
Sec. 170.169  What can a tribe do if Indian LTAP services are unsatisfactory?

    A tribal government can address concerns over quality of services to 
the Indian LTAP Center Director, FHWA, and BIA. If the center does not 
adequately address these concerns in writing within 30 calendar days, 
the tribal government may request any or all of the following:
    (a) A special meeting with the Center's Director and staff to 
address the concern;
    (b) A review of the Center's performance by FHWA and BIA or;
    (c) Services from other Indian LTAP centers.


<R05>
Sec. 170.170  How are Indian LTAP centers managed?

    (a) Each Indian LTAP center is managed by its Center Director and 
staff, with the advice of its technical panel under the Indian LTAP 
agreements. FHWA, BIA, and tribes review the performance of the Indian 
LTAP centers.
    (b) Each Indian LTAP center has a technical panel consisting of one 
BIA Regional Road Engineer, one FHWA representative, one state DOT 
representative, and at least five tribal representatives from the

           Tribal Transportation Allocation Methodology (TTAM)


<R05>
Sec. 170.200  How does BIA allocate IRR Program funds?

    This section sets forth the Tribal Transportation Allocation 
Methodology (TTAM) that BIA uses to allocate IRR Program funds. After 
appropriate statutory and regulatory set-asides, as well as other 
takedowns, the remaining funds are allocated as follows:

[[Page 584]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JY04.001

    (a) A statutorily determined percentage to a tribal transportation 
planning program (under 23 U.S.C. 204(j)); and
    (b) The remainder to a pool of funds designated as ``Remaining 
funding available for distribution.'' This ``Remaining funding available 
for distribution'' pool is further allocated as follows:
    (1) 5 percent to a discretionary pool for IRR High Priority Projects 
(IRRHPP); and
    (2) 95 percent to pool for distribution by the following Relative 
Need Distribution Factor (RNDF) as defined in Sec. 170.223:

(50 percent Cost to Construct + 30 percent Vehicle Miles Traveled + 20 
percent Population)

    (3) If the annual authorization is greater than $275 million, then 
the amount above $275 million, after appropriate statutory and 
regulatory set-asides, as well as other takedowns are applied, will be 
allocated as follows:
    (i) 12.5 percent to the IRRHPP (Sec. 170.205);
    (ii) 12.5 percent to the Population Adjustment Factor (PAF) (Sec. 
170.220); and
    (iii) 75 percent to the RNDF (Sec. 170.223).


<R05>
Sec. 170.201  How does BIA allocate and distribute tribal transportation planning funds?

    Upon request of a tribal government and approval by the BIA Regional 
Office, BIA allocates tribal transportation planning funds described in 
Sec. 170.403 pro rata according to the tribes' relative need percentage 
from the RNDF described in Sec. 170.223. The tribal transportation 
planning funds will be distributed in accordance with the BIA procedures 
for self-governance tribes that negotiate tribal transportation planning 
in their annual funding agreements and to BIA Regional Offices for all 
other tribes.


<R05>
Sec. 170.202  Does the Relative Need Distribution Factor allocate funding among tribes?

    Yes. The RNDF determines the amount of funding available to allocate

[[Page 585]]

to the tribes for their approved IRR projects and activities under 23 
U.S.C. 202(d)(2). The IRR Program construction funds are allocated pro 
rata according to the tribes' relative need percentage from the Funding 
Formula.
    (a) The IRR Program construction funds will be distributed in 
accordance with the BIA procedures for self-governance tribes that 
negotiate IRR construction projects into their AFA, and distributed to 
BIA Regional Offices for all other tribes.
    (b) In order for a tribe's IRR Program allocation to be expended on 
a construction project, the project must be included in an FHWA-approved 
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

                   IRR High Priority Project (IRRHPP)


<R05>
Sec. 170.205  What is an IRR High Priority Project (IRRHPP)?

    (a) The IRRHPP is a special funding pool that can be used:
    (1) By a tribe whose annual allocation is insufficient to complete 
its highest priority project;
    (2) By a governmental subdivision of a tribe that is authorized to 
administer the tribe's IRR Program funding and whose annual allocation 
is insufficient to complete its highest priority project; or
    (3) By any tribe for an emergency/disaster on any IRR transportation 
facility.
    (b) Eligible applicants may have only one IRRHPP application pending 
at any time. This includes emergency/disaster applications.
    (c) IRRHPP funds cannot be used for transportation planning, 
research, routine maintenance activities, and items listed in Sec. 
170.116.


<R05>
Sec. 170.206  How is an emergency/disaster defined?

    (a) An emergency/disaster is damage to an IRR transportation 
facility that:
    (1) Renders the facility impassable or unusable; and
    (2) Is caused by either a natural disaster over a widespread area or 
catastrophic failure from an external cause.
    (b) Some examples of natural disasters are: floods, droughts, 
earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides, avalanches, and severe storms.
    (c) An example of a catastrophic failure is the collapse of a 
highway bridge after being struck by a barge, truck, or landslide.


<R05>
Sec. 170.207  What is the intent of IRRHPP emergency/disaster funding?

    The intent of IRRHPP emergency/disaster funding is to provide 
funding for a project that contains eligible work and would be approved 
for FHWA-ERFO Program funding except that the disaster dollar threshold 
for eligibility in the FHWA-ERFO program has not been met. Applicants 
are encouraged to apply for FHWA-ERFO Program funding if the project 
meets the requirements of the program.


<R05>
Sec. 170.208  What funding is available for IRRHPP?

    The IRRHPP funding level (see chart in Sec. 170.200) for the year 
is:
    (a) Authorization Amount up to $275 million--5 percent of the pool 
of funds designated as ``Remaining funding available for distribution''; 
plus
    (b) Authorization Amount over $275 million--12.5 percent the amount 
above $275 million after appropriate statutory and regulatory set-
asides, as well as other takedowns.


<R05>
Sec. 170.209  How will IRRHPP applications be ranked and funded?

    (a) BIADOT and the Federal Lands Highway (FLH) Program office will

<R05>
Sec. 170.210  How may a tribe apply for IRRHPP?

    A tribe may apply for IRRHPP funds by submitting a complete 
application to BIADOT. The application must include:
    (a) Project scope of work (deliverables, budget breakdown, 
timeline);
    (b) Amount of IRRHPP funds requested;
    (c) Project information addressing ranking criteria identified in 
Sec. 170.209, or the nature of the emergency/disaster;
    (d) Documentation that the project meets the definition of an IRR 
transportation facility and is in the IRR Inventory;
    (e) Documentation of official tribal action requesting the IRRHPP 
project; and
    (f) Documentation from the tribe providing authority for BIA to 
place the project on an IRRHPP TIP if the project is selected and 
approved.


<R05>
Sec. 170.211  What is the IRRHPP Funding Priority List?

    The IRRHPP Funding Priority List (FPL) is the ranked IRRHPPs 
approved for funding under Sec. 170.209.
    (a) The number of projects on the FPL is limited by the amount of 
IRRHPP funds available at the beginning of the fiscal year.
    (b) BIA will place all projects on the FPL on an IRRHPP TIP and 
forward them to FHWA for approval.


<R05>
Sec. 170.212  What is the timeline for IRRHPPs?

    (a) BIA will accept IRRHPP applications until December 31 each year 
for projects during the following year. BIA processes IRRHPP 
applications as shown in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                By . . .                          BIA will . . .

                                          Self-Governance for selected
                                          IRRHPP.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) If total funding for accepted projects does not equal the total 
funds available for IRRHPP, the remaining funds will be redistributed by 
the Relative Need Distribution Factor in accordance with Appendix C to 
subpart C.
    (c) All IRRHPP funds must be obligated on or before August 15. If it 
is anticipated that these funds cannot be obligated by the end of the 
fiscal year, IRRHPP funds assigned to an approved project must be 
returned to FHWA by August 1. BIA will redistribute these funds the 
following fiscal year to those approved projects. (See Sec. 170.213.)


<R05>
Sec. 170.213  How long are IRRHPP funds available for a project?

    Any project not under contract for construction within 3 fiscal 
years of its initial listing on an FPL will forfeit its unexpended 
funding. Applicants may request, in writing, a one-time, 1-year 
extension of this deadline from BIA. Upon completion of an IRRHPP, funds 
that are reserved but not expended are to be recovered and returned to 
the IRRHPP funding pool.


<R05>
Sec. 170.214  How does award of an emergency/disaster project affect projects on the FPL?

    (a) A tribe may submit an emergency/disaster project any time during 
the fiscal year. BIA considers these projects a priority and funds them 
as follows:

[[Page 587]]

    (1) If a tribe submits a project before the issuance of the FPL and 
it is determined as eligible for IRRHPP funds, BIA will provide funding 
before providing funding for the other approved projects on the FPL; or
    (2) If a tribe submits a project after the issuance of the FPL and 
the distribution of the IRRHPP funds, BIA will provide funding when 
funds provided to the FPL projects is returned to BIA due to their 
inability to be obligated. (See Sec. 170.212(c).)
    (b) If BIA uses funding previously designated for a project on the 
FPL to fund an emergency/disaster project, the FPL project that lost its 
funding will move to the top of the FPL for the following year.

                      Population Adjustment Factor


<R05>
Sec. 170.220  What is the Population Adjustment Factor?

    The Population Adjustment Factor (PAF) is a special portion of the 
total IRR Program distribution calculated annually that provides for 
broader participation in the IRR Program by tribes (or a governmental 
subdivision of a tribe authorized to administer the tribe's IRR Program 
funding). The PAF is based upon the population ranges and distribution 
factors in appendix B to subpart C. The population data used is the 
American Indian and Alaska Native Service Population developed by the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, under the Native American 
Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA), (25 U.S.C. 4101 
et seq.). Appendix B to subpart C explains how the PAF is derived. The 
funds generated by the PAF can be used for transportation planning or 
IRR projects.


<R05>
Sec. 170.221  What funding is available for distribution using the PAF?

    When the annual authorization for the IRR Program is greater than 
$275 million, 12.5 percent of the amount above $275 million after the 
appropriate statutory and regulatory set-asides, as well as other 
takedowns, is available for distribution using the PAF.

                    Relative Need Distribution Factor


<R05>
Sec. 170.223  What is the Relative Need Distribution Factor (RNDF)?

    The Relative Need Distribution Factor (RNDF) is a mathematical 
formula used for distributing the IRR Program construction funds. The 
RNDF is derived from a combination of the cost to construct, vehicle 
miles traveled, and population. Appendix C to subpart C explains how the 
RNDF is derived and applied.

       IRR Inventory and Long-Range Transportation Planning (LRTP)


<R05>
Sec. 170.225  How does the LRTP process relate to the IRR Inventory?

    The LRTP process (see subpart D) is a uniform process that 
identifies the transportation needs and priorities of the tribes. The 
IRR Inventory is derived from transportation facilities identified 
through LRTP. It is also a means for identifying projects for the IRRHPP 
Program.


<R05>
Sec. 170.226  How will this part affect the IRR Inventory?

    The IRR Inventory defined in this part will expand the IRR Inventory 
for funding purposes to include:
    (a) All roads, highway bridges, and other eligible transportation 
facilities that were previously approved in the BIA Road System in 1992 
and each following year;
    (b) All Indian reservation roads constructed using Highway Trust 
funds since 1983;
    (c) All designated IRR routes (25 CFR 170.442-170.444);
    (d) Non-road transportation related facilities; and
    (e) Other applicable IRR transportation facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 170.227  How does BIA develop and use the IRR Inventory?

    The IRR Inventory as defined in Sec. 170.442 identifies the 
transportation need by providing the data that BIA uses to generate the 
Cost to Construct (CTC) and Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) components of 
RNDF. The IRR Inventory is developed through the LRTP process, as 
described in Sec. Sec. 170.410 through 170.415. BIA Regional offices

[[Page 588]]

maintain, certify, and enter the data for their region's portion of the 
IRR Inventory database. Only project-specific transportation activities 
are included in the IRR Inventory.


<R05>
Sec. 170.228  Are all facilities included in the IRR Inventory used to calculate CTC?

    No. Projects/facilities proposed to receive construction funds on an 
approved IRRTIP are not eligible for future inclusion in the calculation 
of the CTC portion of the formula for a period of 5 years thereafter.

                          General Data Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 170.231  May a tribe challenge the data BIA uses in the RNDF?

    (a) A tribe may submit a request to the BIA Regional Director to 
revise the data for the tribe that BIA uses in the RNDF. The request 
must include the tribe's data and written support for its contention 
that the tribal data is more accurate than BIA's.
    (b) A tribe may submit a data correction request at any time. In 
order to impact the distribution in a given fiscal year, a data 
correction request must be approved, or any subsequent appeals resolved, 
by June 1 of the prior fiscal year.
    (c) The BIA Regional Director must respond within 30 days of 
receiving a data correction request under this section.
    (1) Unless the BIA Regional Director determines that the existing 
BIA data is more accurate, the BIA Regional Director must approve the 
tribe's data correction request and accept the tribe's corrected data.
    (2) If the BIA Regional Director disapproves the tribe's request, 
the decision must include a detailed written explanation of the reasons 
for the disapproval, copies of any supporting documentation (other than 
the tribe's request) that the BIA Regional Director relied upon in 
reaching the decision, and notice of the tribe's right to appeal the 
decision.
    (3) If the BIA Regional Director does not approve the tribe's 
request within 30 days of receiving the request, the request must be 
deemed disapproved.


<R05>
Sec. 170.232  How does a tribe appeal a disapproval from the BIA Regional Director?

    (a) Within 30 days of receiving a disapproval, or within 30 days of 
a disapproval by non-action of the BIA Regional Director, a tribe may 
file a written notice of appeal to the Director, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, with a copy provided to the BIA Regional Director; and
    (b) Within 30 days of receiving an appeal, the Director, Bureau of 
Indian Affairs must issue a written decision upholding or reversing the 
BIA Regional Director's disapproval. This decision must include a 
detailed written explanation of the reasons for the disapproval, copies 
of any supporting documentation that the Director, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs relied upon in reaching the decision (other than the tribe's 
request or notice of appeal), and notice of the tribe's right to appeal 
the decision to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals under 25 CFR part 
2.

                           Flexible Financing


<R05>
Sec. 170.300  May tribes use flexible financing to finance IRR transportation projects?

    Yes. Tribes may use flexible financing in the same manner as States 
to finance IRR transportation projects, unless otherwise prohibited by 
law.
    (a) Tribes may issue bonds or enter into other debt financing 
instruments under 23 U.S.C. 122 with the expectation of payment of IRR 
Program funds to satisfy the instruments.
    (b) Under 23 U.S.C. 183, the Secretary of Transportation may enter 
into an agreement for secured loans or lines of credit for IRR projects 
meeting the requirements contained in 23 U.S.C. 182. Tribes or BIA may 
service Federal credit instruments. The secured loans or lines of credit 
must be paid from tolls, user fees, or other dedicated revenue sources.
    (c) Tribes may use IRR Program funds as collateral for loans or 
bonds to finance IRR projects. Upon the request of a tribe, a BIA region 
will provide necessary documentation to banks and other financial 
institutions.

[[Page 589]]


<R05>
Sec. 170.301  Can a tribe use IRR Program funds to leverage other funds or pay back loans?

    (a) A tribe can use IRR Program funds to leverage other funds.
    (b) A tribe can use IRR Program funds to pay back loans or other 
finance instruments for a project that:
    (1) The tribe paid for in advance of the current year using non-IRR 
Program funds; and
    (2) Was included in FHWA-approved IRRTIP.


<R05>
Sec. 170.302  Can BIA regional offices borrow IRR Program funds from each other?

    Yes. A BIA Regional office, in consultation with tribes, may enter 
into agreements to borrow IRR Program funds to assist another BIA 
regional office in financing the completion of an IRR project. These 
funds must be repaid within the next fiscal year. These agreements 
cannot be executed during the last year of a transportation 
authorization act unless Congress has authorized IRR Program funds for 
the next year.


<R05>
Sec. 170.303  Can a tribe apply for loans or credit from a State infrastructure bank?

    Yes. Upon the request of a tribe, BIA region will provide necessary 
documentation to a State infrastructure bank to facilitate obtaining 
loans and other forms of credit for an IRR project. A state 
infrastructure bank is a state or multi-state fund that can offer loans 
and other forms of credit to help project sponsors, such as tribes, pay 
for transportation projects.

       Sec. Appendix B to Subpart C--Population Adjustment Factor

    1. The Population Adjustment Factor allows for participation in the 
IRR Program by all tribes. This component of the funding formula creates 
a special calculation of funding which is available in accordance with 
the TTAM each fiscal year for a tribe based on the population range 
within which the tribe is included. The following table shows how BIA 
develops the PAF.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Multiplier used to determine the PAF funding for the population ranges. For example, if $1000 is available for
  the first population range (less than 25), then the second population range (25-100) will receive $3,500 or
  3.5 times the amount available to the first population range.
** The number of tribes changes yearly.
*** The Minimum Base Allocation (MBA) is the dollar value to be multiplied by the distribution factor for each
  population range to determine the distribution of the PAF.

    2. The following example shows how the PAF applies to a total IRR 
Program authorization for the allocation year of $375 million. The five 
steps to calculate the Population Adjustment Factor are applied as 
follows:
    Step 1. For each population range, multiply the Distribution Factor 
by the total number of tribes identified in the population range to 
determine the Step Factor;
    Step 2. Add the Step Factors determined in Step 1 above to derive a 
Total Step Factor;
    Step 3. Calculate the $A = IRR Program authorization available in 
the allocation year by taking the Total IRR Program authorization for 
the allocation year ($375M for this example) minus the appropriate 
statutory and regulatory set-asides, as well as other takedowns ($25M 
for this example)

$375M-$25M = $350M;

    Step 4. Derive a Minimum Base Allocation by taking 12\1/2\ per cent 
of the difference (from Step 3) and dividing it by the Total Step 
Factor. The mathematical equation for the Base Allocation is as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JY04.002

MBA = Minimum Base Allocation
Distribution Factors = 1, 3.5, 5, 6.5, and 8
$A = IRR Program Authorization Available in the Allocation Year
$275M = Base Reference Amount
n = The nth Population Range
1 . . . 5 = Population Ranges 1 through 5
N<INF>n</INF> = Number of tribes in the nth Population Range

For the example above, the formula yields:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JY04.003

    Step 5. Calculate Population Adjustment Factor within each 
Population Range by multiplying the Distribution Factor for the 
Population Range by the Minimum Base Allocation.
    The mathematical equation for the Population Adjustment Factor 
calculation is as follows:

PAF<INF>n</INF> = DF<INF>n</INF> X MBA

Where:

PAF = Population Adjustment Factor
DF = Distribution Factor
n = The n<SUP>th</SUP> Population Range
MBA = Minimum Base Allocation

For example, for DF<INF>1</INF> = 1.00; PAF<INF>1</INF> = 1 x $3,215.57 
= $3,215.57

For example, for DF<INF>3</INF> = 5.00; PAF<INF>3</INF> = 5 x $3,215.57 
= $16,077.86

    The following table illustrates the results of the above 
calculations for all population ranges:

     Sec. Appendix C to Subpart C--Relative Need Distribution Factor

    The Relative Need Distribution Factor (RNDF) is a mathematical 
formula for distributing the IRR Program construction funds using the 
following three factors: Cost to Construct (CTC), Vehicle Miles Traveled 
(VMT), and Population (POP).

                  1. What Is the Formula for the RNDF?

    The Relative Need Distribution Factor is as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR19JY04.004
    
Where:

    2. How Does BIA Estimate Construction Costs?
    The methodology for calculating the Cost to Construct is explained 
in Appendix D of this subpart.
    3. What Is the Cost to Construct for an Individual Tribe?
    The Cost to Construct for an individual tribe is the sum of all 
eligible and approved project costs from the tribe's IRR Inventory.
    4. What Is the Cost to Construct Component in the RNDF?
    The Cost to Construct component is the total estimated cost of a 
tribe's transportation projects as a percentage of the total estimated 
cost nationally of all tribes' transportation facilities. Costs are 
derived from the IRR inventory of eligible IRR transportation facilities 
developed and approved by BIA and tribal governments through Long-Range 
Transportation Planning.
    5. May the Cost to Construct Component of the RNDF Be Modified?
    Yes, BIA and FHWA, with input and recommendations provided by the 
IRR Program Coordinating Committee, may consider revisions to the data 
elements used in calculating the Cost to Construct component.
    6. What Is the Source of the Construction Cost Used To Generate the 
CTC?
    (a) The construction cost will be derived from the average of the 
following three project bid tabulation sources:
    (1) Tribal bid tabulations or local BIA bid tabulations;
    (2) State bid tabulations for the region of the State in which the 
tribe's project will be constructed;

[[Page 592]]

    (3) National IRR Program bid tabulations.
    (b) If one or more of these bid tabulation sources is unavailable, 
use the average of the available sources.
    (c) BIADOT will collect the national IRR Program bid tabulation data 
and enter it into the Cost to Construct database.
    7. What Is the VMT Component and How Is It Calculated?
    VMT is a measure of the current IRR transportation system use. BIA 
calculates VMT using the sum of the length of IRR route segments in 
miles multiplied by the Average Daily Traffic (ADT) of the route 
segment.
    8. What IRR Route Sections Does BIA Use To Calculate VMT?
    All IRR route sections in the IRR Inventory are used to calculate 
VMT, but percentage factors are applied in accordance with Appendix C to 
subpart C, question (10).
    9. What Is the Population Component and How Is It Determined?
    The population component is a factor used to define a portion of 
transportation need based on the number of American Indian or Alaska 
Native people served. The population data used will be the American 
Indian and Alaska Native Service Population developed by the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, under the Native American Housing 
Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA), (25 U.S.C. 4101 et 
seq.).
    10. Do All IRR Transportation Facilities in the IRR Inventory Count 
at 100 Percent of Their CTC and VMT?
    No. The CTC and VMT must be computed at the non-Federal share 
requirement for matching funds for any transportation facility that is 
added to the IRR inventory and is eligible for funding for construction 
or reconstruction with Federal funds, other than Federal Lands Highway 
Program funds.
    However, if a facility falls into one or more of the following 
categories, then the CTC and VMT factors must be computed at 100 
percent:
    (1) The transportation facility was approved, included, and funded 
at 100 percent of CTC and VMT in the IRR Inventory for funding purposes 
prior to the issuance of these regulations.
    (2) The facility is not eligible for funding for construction or 
reconstruction with Federal funds, other than Federal Lands Highway 
Program funds; or
    (3) The facility is eligible for funding for construction or 
reconstruction with Federal funds, however, the public authority 
responsible for maintenance of the facility provides certification of 
maintenance responsibility and its inability to provide funding for the 
project.

             Sec. Appendix D to Subpart C--Cost To Construct

                            Cost To Construct

    (Appendix D includes Tables 1-8 which BIA Division of Transportation 
developed based on internal IRR data and the negotiated rulemaking 
process.) This method utilizes the concepts of the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs' ``Simplified Approach to Compute the Cost to Construct''. The 
concept has been modified to include computing costs for High Capacity 
Roads (multi-lane roads), non-road projects (snowmobile trails, 
boardwalks, footpaths, etc.) and other eligible transportation facility 
projects.
    The theory behind this concept is based on the procedure that 
information gathered during any inventory update can be used to compare 
the existing conditions to defined Adequate Standard Characteristics. 
This comparison can then be used to determine the total cost required to 
bring the transportation facility road up to a necessary Adequate 
Standard. The IRR Inventory database is used to determine the costs of a 
new transportation facility or in the case of an existing facility, the 
costs that will be necessary to improve the facility from it's existing 
condition to an adequate standard. Therefore, the Cost to Construct for 
a particular facility is the cost required to improve the facility's 
existing condition to a condition that would meet the Adequate Standard 
Characteristics (see Table 1). For roadways, the recommended design of 
the geometrics and surface type vary based on the road's functional 
classification and average daily traffic and will use four categories of 
cost. The four categories are Grade and Drain Costs, Aggregate Costs, 
Pavement Costs, and Incidental Costs. For bridges, costs are derived 
from costs in the National Bridge Inventory as well as the National 
Bridge Construction unit cost data developed by FHWA. For other 
transportation IRR transportation facilities, an inventory of needs must 
be developed with associated costs for new and existing IRR 
transportation facilities based on long range transportation planning. 
The BIA Regions and tribes must ensure the IRR Inventory is sufficiently 
updated to provide all the necessary information indicating the need, 
the condition and the construction cost data to compute the cost to 
construct of any proposed or existing facility.

                            Basic Procedures

    The IRR Inventory, based on transportation planning must be 
developed for those tribes without data and updated for those tribes 
that have an existing IRR Inventory. Once the IRR Inventory database is 
current and all IRR transportation facilities needs

[[Page 593]]

are identified and verified, the Cost to Construct for those IRR 
transportation facilities can be developed.
    The procedure for determining the cost to construct of a proposed 
transportation facility is computed through the following step-by-step 
process:
    (a) Determine the Future ADT of the transportation facility as 
applicable, based upon tribal transportation planning or set default 
future ADT (see Table 2);
    (b) Determine the Class of transportation facility e.g., rural 
local, rural major collector, or other transportation facility, 
utilizing future ADT and based upon tribal transportation planning (see 
Table 1);
    (c) Identify, if appropriate, transportation facility terrain as 
flat, rolling, or mountainous;
    (d) Set Adequate Standard based on Class, and/or future ADT, and 
Terrain (see Table 1);
    (e) Identify the transportation facility's construction cost per 
unit (e.g., cost per mile, cost per linear foot) for the applicable 
components of construction: Aggregate, Paving, Grade/Drain, Incidental, 
or other costs associated with the transportation facility;
    (f) Multiply the construction cost per unit for each component of 
construction by the length of the proposed road or other appropriate 
unit of the transportation facility to determine the cost for each 
component of construction; and
    (g) Calculate the cost for the proposed road or transportation 
facility by adding together the costs for each component of 
construction.
    The procedure for determining the cost to reconstruct or 
rehabilitate an existing transportation facility is determined in the 
same manner as a proposed transportation facility, except that the 
existing condition of the project is evaluated to determine the 
remaining percentage of cost of each applicable component of 
construction that will be included in the cost for reconstruction. The 
steps are:
    (1) Evaluate existing condition of road or transportation facility 
in accordance with applicable management systems, guidelines or other 
requirements;
    (2) Identify the percentage of required cost for each component of 
applicable construction costs for the transportation facility by 
determining the Adequate Standards Characteristics (see Table 1) and 
existing condition of the transportation facility and by applying the 
applicable percent cost requirement tables for aggregate, paving, grade/
drain, incidental, and bridge (see Tables 4-8);
    (3) Multiply the construction cost per unit for each component of 
construction by the corresponding percent of cost required (see Tables 
4-8) and by the length of the road or other appropriate unit of the 
transportation facility to determine the reconstruction cost for each 
component; and
    (4) Calculate the reconstruction cost for the road or transportation 
facility by adding together the reconstruction costs for each component 
of construction.
    Average daily traffic (ADT) is acquired through actual traffic 
counts on the roadway sections. Where current ADT is practical to 
acquire, it should be acquired and future ADT calculated by projecting 
the current ADT at 2 percent per year for 20 years. If the road is 
proposed, the ADT impractical to acquire, or a current ADT does not 
exist, then BIA will assign a default current ADT and calculate future 
ADT by projecting the default current ADT at 2 percent per year for 20 
years to form the basis of the Adequate Standard (see Table 1). Table 2 
summarizes the default current and default future ADT by class of road.
    Functional Classification: Functional classification means an 
analysis of a specific transportation facility taking into account 
current and future traffic generators, and their relationship to 
connecting or adjacent BIA, state, county, Federal, and/or local roads 
and other intermodal facilities. Functional classification is used to 
delineate the difference between the various road and/or intermodal 
transportation facility standards eligible for funding under the IRR 
Program. As a part of the IRR Inventory system management, all IRR 
transportation facilities included on or added to the IRR Inventory must 
be classified according to the following functional classifications:
    (a) Class 1: Major arterial roads providing an integrated network 
with characteristics for serving traffic between large population 
centers, generally without stub connections and having average daily 
traffic volumes of 10,000 vehicles per day or more with more than two 
lanes of traffic.
    (b) Class 2: Rural minor arterial roads providing an integrated 
network having the characteristics for serving traffic between large 
population centers, generally without stub connections. May also link 
smaller towns and communities to major resort areas that attract travel 
over long distances and generally provide for relatively high overall 
travel speeds with minimum interference to through traffic movement. 
Generally provide for at least inter-county or inter-State service and 
are spaced at intervals consistent with population density. This class 
of road will have less than 10,000 vehicles per day.
    (c) Class 3: Streets that are located within communities serving 
residential areas.
    (d) Class 4: Rural Major Collector Road is a collector to rural 
local roads.
    (e) Class 5: Rural Local Road that is either a section line and/or 
stub type roads that collect traffic for arterial type roads, make 
connections within the grid of the IRR System. This class of road may 
serve areas around villages, into farming areas, to

[[Page 594]]

schools, tourist attractions, or various small enterprises. Also 
included are roads and motorized trails for administration of forest, 
grazing, mining, oil, recreation, or other use purposes.
    (f) Class 6: City Minor Arterial Streets that are located within 
communities, and serve as access to major arterials.
    (g) Class 7: City Collector Streets that are located within 
communities and serve as collectors to the city local streets.
    (h) Class 8: This classification encompasses all non-road projects 
such as paths, trails, walkways, or other designated types of routes for 
public use by foot traffic, bicycles, trail bikes, snowmobile, all 
terrain vehicles or other uses to provide for the general access of non-
vehicular traffic.
    (i) Class 9: This classification encompasses other transportation 
facilities such as public parking facilities adjacent to IRR routes and 
scenic byways, rest areas, and other scenic pullouts, ferry boat 
terminals, and transit terminals.
    (j) Class 10: This classification encompasses airstrips that are 
within the boundaries of the IRR System grid and are open to the public. 
These airstrips are included for inventory and maintenance purposes 
only.
    (k) Class 11: This classification indicates an overlapping of a 
previously inventoried section or sections of a route and is used to 
indicate that it is not to be used for accumulating needs data. This 
class is used for reporting and identification purposes only.
    Construction Need: All existing and proposed transportation 
facilities in the IRR Inventory must have a Construction Need (CN) which 
is used in the Cost to Construct calculations. These transportation 
facilities are assigned a CN by the tribe during the long-range 
transportation planning and inventory update process using certain 
guidelines which are: Ownership or responsibility of the facility, 
whether it is within or provides access to reservations, groups, 
villages and communities in which the majority of the residents are 
Indian, and whether it is vital to the economic development of Indian 
tribes. As part of the IRR Inventory management, all facilities included 
on or added to the IRR Inventory must be designated a CN which are 
defined as follows:
    (a) Construction Need 0: Transportation facilities which have been 
improved to their acceptable standard or projects/facilities proposed to 
receive construction funds on an approved IRRTIP are not eligible for 
future inclusion in the calculation of the CTC portion of the formula 
for a period of 5 years thereafter.
    (b) Construction Need 1: Existing BIA roads needing improvement.
    (c) Construction Need 2: Construction need other than BIA roads 
needing improvement.
    (d) Construction Need 3: Substandard or other roads for which no 
improvements are planned, maintenance only.
    (e) Construction Need 4: Roads which do not currently exist and need 
to be constructed, proposed roads.

    Table 2--Default Current ADT and Default Future ADT
    Table 2 summarizes the default current and default future ADT by 
class of road. Default future ADT is calculated by projecting default 
current ADT at 2 percent per year for 20 years. 2 percent per year for 
20 years yields a factor of 1.485.

            Table 4--Percent of Grade and Drain Cost Required

    Grade and Drain costs include the cost for constructing a roadbed to 
an adequate standard and providing adequate drainage. Specifically it 
includes the necessary earthwork to build the roadbed to the required 
horizontal and vertical geometric parameters above the surrounding 
terrain and provide for proper drainage away from the foundation with 
adequate cross drains.
    Table 4 summarizes the percentage of grade and drain costs required 
based on the existing roadbed condition observed in an inventory update.

        Table 7--Percent of Incidental Construction Cost Required

    Incidental cost items are generally required if a project includes 
construction or reconstruction of the roadbed. Some incidental items are 
included in all road improvement projects, while others are only 
required for specific projects. Table 7 summarizes the incidental 
construction determination estimating procedure for each of the Roadbed 
Category Codes. As shown in Table 4, roadbed condition codes 0 through 2 
will require 65 percent of the incidental costs for construction because 
they generally will not require maintenance of traffic during 
construction. If maintenance of traffic is required as will generally be 
the case for roadbed condition codes 3 and 4, the minimum percentage of 
incidental costs for these roadbed condition codes will be 75 percent. 
It is assumed that improvement roadbed condition codes 5, 6 and 7 will 
primarily be paving projects with little or no earthwork involved and 
the minimum percentage of the total incidental construction cost for 
these projects will be 30 percent.

                         Transportation Planning


<R05>
Sec. 170.400  What is the purpose of transportation planning?

    The purpose of transportation planning is to fulfill goals by 
developing strategies to meet transportation needs. These strategies 
address current and future land use, economic development, traffic 
demand, public safety, health, and social needs.


<R05>
Sec. 170.401  What is BIA's role in transportation planning?

    Except as provided in Sec. 170.402, the functions and activities 
that BIA must perform for the IRR Program are:
    (a) Preparing the regional IRRTIP;
    (b) Updating the IRR Inventory from data updates;
    (c) Preparing IRR Inventory data updates as needed;
    (d) Coordinating with States and their political subdivisions, and 
appropriate planning authorities on regionally significant IRR projects;
    (e) Providing technical assistance to tribal governments;
    (f) Developing IRR Program budgets including transportation planning 
cost estimates;
    (g) Facilitating public involvement;
    (h) Participating in transportation planning and other 
transportation-related meetings;
    (i) Performing traffic studies;
    (j) Performing preliminary project planning;
    (k) Conducting special transportation studies;
    (l) Developing short and long-range transportation plans;
    (m) Mapping;
    (n) Developing and maintaining management systems;
    (o) Performing transportation planning for operational and 
maintenance facilities; and
    (p) Researching rights-of-way documents for project planning.


<R05>
Sec. 170.402  What is the tribal role in transportation planning?

    (a) All tribes must prepare a tribal TIP (TTIP) or tribal priority 
list.
    (b) Tribes with a self-determination contract or self-governance 
agreement may assume any of the following planning functions:
    (1) Coordinating with States and their political subdivisions, and 
appropriate planning authorities on regionally significant IRR projects;
    (2) Preparing IRR Inventory data updates;
    (3) Facilitating public involvement;
    (4) Performing traffic studies;
    (5) Developing short- and long-range transportation plans;
    (6) Mapping;

[[Page 599]]

    (7) Developing and maintaining tribal management systems;
    (8) Participating in transportation planning and other 
transportation related meetings;
    (9) Performing transportation planning for operational and 
maintenance facilities;
    (10) Developing IRR Program budgets including transportation 
planning cost estimates;
    (11) Conducting special transportation studies, as appropriate;
    (12) Researching rights-of-way documents for project planning; and
    (13) Performing preliminary project planning.


<R05>
Sec. 170.403  What IRR Program funds can be used for transportation planning?

    Funds as defined in 23 U.S.C. 204(j) are specifically reserved for a 
tribal government's transportation planning. Tribes may also identify 
transportation planning as a priority in their tribal priority list or 
TTIP and request the use of up to 100 percent of their IRR Program 
construction funds for transportation planning.


<R05>
Sec. 170.404  What happens when a tribe uses its IRR Program construction 

funds for transportation planning?

    In order for IRR Program construction funds to be concentrated on 
the projects within the inventory, a tribe may use up to $35,000 or 5 
percent of its IRR Program construction funds, whichever is greater, for 
transportation planning. If a tribe exceeds this threshold, BIA will 
subtract the amount over the threshold from the tribe's CTC for the 
following year.


<R05>
Sec. 170.405  Can tribal transportation planning funds be used for

road construction and other projects?

    Yes, any tribe can request to have its planning funds as defined in 
23 U.S.C. 204(j) transferred into construction funds for use on any 
eligible and approved IRR project. (Also see Sec. 170.407.)


<R05>
Sec. 170.406  How must tribes use planning funds?

    (a) IRR Program funds as defined in 23 U.S.C. 204(j) are only 
available upon request of a tribal government and approved by the BIA 
Regional Office. These funds support development and implementation of 
tribal transportation planning and associated strategies for identifying 
transportation needs, including:
    (1) Attending transportation planning meetings;
    (2) Pursuing other sources of funds; and
    (3) Developing the tribal priority list or any of the transportation 
functions/activities as defined in the FHWA IRR Program Transportation 
Planning Procedures and Guidelines (TPPG) or listed in Sec. 170.402.
    (b) A tribe may ask the BIA regional office to enter into a self-
determination contract or self-governance agreement for transportation 
planning activities and functions under ISDEAA or it may request a 
travel authorization to attend transportation planning functions and 
related activities using these funds. (See appendix A of subpart B for 
use of IRR Program Funds.)


<R05>
Sec. 170.407  What happens to unobligated planning funds?

    Once all tribal governments' requests for tribal transportation 
planning funds have been satisfied for a given fiscal year or no later 
than August 15, the BIA regional office may use the remaining funds for 
construction after consultation with the affected tribal governments.

                   Long-Range Transportation Planning


<R05>
Sec. 170.410  What is the purpose of tribal long-range transportation planning?

    (a) The purpose of long-range transportation planning is to clearly 
demonstrate a tribe's transportation needs and to fulfill tribal goals 
by developing strategies to meet these needs. These strategies should 
address future land use, economic development, traffic demand, public 
safety, and health and social needs.
    (b) The time horizon for long-range transportation planning should 
be 20 years to match state transportation planning horizons. A tribe may 
develop a long-range transportation plan under ISDEAA or may ask BIA to 
develop the plan on the tribe's behalf.

[[Page 600]]


<R05>
Sec. 170.411  What may a long-range transportation plan include?

    A comprehensive long-range transportation plan may include:
    (a) An evaluation of a full range of transportation modes and 
connections between modes such as highway, rail, air, and water, to meet 
transportation needs;
    (b) Trip generation studies, including determination of traffic 
generators due to land use;
    (c) Social and economic development planning to identify 
transportation improvements or needs to accommodate existing and 
proposed land use in a safe and economical fashion;
    (d) Measures that address health and safety concerns relating to 
transportation improvements;
    (e) A review of the existing and proposed transportation system to 
identify the relationships between transportation and the environment;
    (f) Cultural preservation planning to identify important issues and 
develop a transportation plan that is sensitive to tribal cultural 
preservation;
    (g) Scenic byway and tourism plans;
    (h) Measures that address energy conservation considerations;
    (i) A prioritized list of short and long-term transportation needs; 
and
    (j) An analysis of funding alternatives to implement plan 
recommendations.


<R05>
Sec. 170.412  How is the tribal IRR long-range transportation plan developed and approved?

    (a) The tribal IRR long-range transportation plan is developed by:
    (1) A tribe working through a self-determination contract or self-
governance agreement or other funding sources; or
    (2) BIA upon request of, and in consultation with, a tribe. The 
tribe and BIA need to agree on the methodology and elements included in 
development of the IRR long-range transportation plan along with time 
frames before work begins.
    (b) During the development of the IRR long-range transportation 
plan, the tribe and BIA should jointly conduct a midpoint review.
    (c) The public reviews a draft IRR long-range transportation plan as 
required by Sec. 170.413. The plan is further refined to address any 
issues identified during the public review process. The tribe then 
approves the IRR long-range transportation plan.


<R05>
Sec. 170.413  What is the public role in developing the long-range transportation plan?

    BIA or the tribe must solicit public involvement. If there are no 
tribal policies regarding public involvement, a tribe must use the 
procedures shown below. Public involvement begins at the same time long-
range transportation planning begins and covers the range of users, from 
stakeholders and private citizens to major public and private entities. 
Public involvement may be handled in either of the following two ways:
    (a) For public meetings, BIA or a tribe must:
    (1) Advertise each public meeting in local public newspapers at 
least 15 days before the meeting date. In the absence of local public 
newspapers, BIA or the tribe may post notices under local acceptable 
practices;
    (2) Provide at the meeting copies of the draft long-range 
transportation plan;
    (3) Provide information on funding and the planning process; and
    (4) Provide the public the opportunity to comment, either orally or 
in writing.
    (b) For public notices, BIA or a tribe must:
    (1) Publish a notice in the local and tribal newspapers when the 
draft long-range transportation plan is complete. In the absence of 
local public newspapers, BIA or the tribe may post notices under local 
acceptable practices; and
    (2) State in the notice that the long-range transportation plan is 
available for review, where a copy can be obtained, whom to contact for 
questions, where comments may be submitted, and the deadline for 
submitting comments (normally 30 days).


<R05>
Sec. 170.414  How is the tribal long-range transportation plan used and updated?

    The tribal government uses its IRR long-range transportation plan in 
its

[[Page 601]]

development of a tribal priority list or TTIP. To be consistent with 
State and MPO planning practices, the tribe or BIA (for direct service 
tribes) should:
    (a) Review the IRR long-range transportation plan annually; and
    (b) Update the plan every 5 years.


<R05>
Sec. 170.415  What is pre-project planning?

    (a) Pre-project planning is part of overall transportation planning 
and includes the activities conducted before final project approval on 
the IRR Transportation Improvement Program (IRRTIP). These activities 
include;
    (1) Preliminary project cost estimates;
    (2) Certification of public involvement;
    (3) Consultation and coordination with States and/or MPO's for a 
regionally significant projects;
    (4) Preliminary needs assessments; and
    (5) Preliminary environmental and archeological reviews.
    (b) The BIA regional office must work cooperatively with tribal, 
state, regional, and metropolitan transportation planning organizations 
concerning the leveraging of funds from non-IRR Program sources and 
identification of other funding sources to expedite the planning, 
design, and construction of projects on the IRRTIP.

                   Transportation Improvement Program


<R05>
Sec. 170.420  What is the tribal priority list?

    The tribal priority list is a list of all transportation projects 
that the tribe wants funded. The list:
    (a) May or may not identify projects in order of priority;
    (b) Is not financially constrained; and
    (c) Is provided to BIA by official tribal action, unless the tribal 
government submits a Tribal Transportation Improvement Program (TTIP).


<R05>
Sec. 170.421  What is the Tribal Transportation Improvement Program (TTIP)?

    The TTIP:
    (a) Must be consistent with the tribal long-range transportation 
plan;
    (b) Must contain all IRR Program funded projects programmed for 
construction in the next 3 to 5 years;
    (c) Must identify the implementation year of each project scheduled 
to begin within the next 3 to 5 years;
    (d) May include other Federal, State, county, and municipal, 
transportation projects initiated by or developed in cooperation with 
the tribal government;
    (e) Will be reviewed and updated as necessary by the tribal 
government;
    (f) Can be changed only by the tribal government; and
    (g) Must be forwarded to BIA by resolution or by tribally authorized 
government action for inclusion into the IRRTIP.


<R05>
Sec. 170.422  What is the IRR Transportation Improvement Program (IRRTIP)?

    The IRRTIP:
    (a) Is financially constrained;
    (b) Must include eligible projects from tribal TTIPs;
    (c) Is selected by tribal governments from TTIPs or other tribal 
actions;
    (d) Is organized by year, State, and tribe; and
    (e) May include non-IRR projects for inclusion into the State 
Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).


<R05>
Sec. 170.423  How are projects placed on the IRRTIP?

    (a) BIA selects projects from the TTIP or tribal priority list for 
inclusion on the IRRTIP as follows:
    (1) The tribal government develops a list of detailed tasks and 
information for each project from the tribal priority list or TTIP;
    (2) BIA includes this project information in its region-wide control 
schedule without change, unless the funding required exceeds the amount 
available to the tribe;
    (3) BIA must include projects that are scheduled in the next 3 to 5 
years; and
    (4) BIA develops the IRRTIP after consulting with the tribes and 
taking their priorities into account.
    (b) A tribe that does not generate enough annual funding under the 
IRR Program funding formula to complete a project may either:

[[Page 602]]

    (1) Submit its tribal priority list to the appropriate BIA Region, 
which will develop the region-wide control schedule after consulting 
with the tribe and taking its priorities into account; or
    (2) Enter a consortium of tribes and delegate authority to the 
consortium to develop the TTIP and tribal control schedule;
    (3) Enter into agreement with other tribes to permit completion of 
the project; or
    (4) Apply for IRRHPP funding under subpart C.
    (c) In order to get a project on the IRRTIP, tribes may seek 
flexible financing alternatives as described in subpart C.


<R05>
Sec. 170.424  How does the public participate in developing the IRRTIP?

    Public involvement is required in the development of the IRRTIP.
    (a) BIA or the tribe must publish a notice in local and tribal 
newspapers when the draft tribal or IRRTIP is complete. In the absence 
of local public newspapers, the tribe or BIA may post notices under 
local acceptable practices. The notice must indicate where a copy can be 
obtained, contact person for questions, where comments may be submitted, 
and the deadline for submitting comments.
    (b) BIA or the tribe may hold public meetings at which the public 
may comment orally or in writing.
    (c) BIA, the tribe, the State transportation agency or MPO may 
conduct public involvement activities.


<R05>
Sec. 170.425  How does BIA update the IRRTIP?

    The IRRTIP annual update allows incorporation of transportation 
projects planned for the next 3 to 5 years. Each BIA regional office 
updates the IRRTIP for each State in its service area to reflect changes 
in the TTIPs or tribal project listings.
    (a) During the first quarter of the fiscal year each BIA Regional 
Office notifies tribes of the update and provides projected IRR Program 
funding amounts and a copy of the previous year's regional IRRTIP.
    (b) The tribe reviews any new transportation planning information, 
priority lists, and TTIP and forwards an updated TTIP or project listing 
to BIA Regional Office on or before July 15.
    (c) The BIA regional office reviews all submitted information with 
the tribes. BIA adds agreed-upon updates, including previously approved 
amendments (see Sec. 170.427), to the IRRTIP so that the Secretaries 
can approve the new updated IRRTIP before the start of the next fiscal 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 170.426  What is the approval process for the IRRTIP?

    The approval process for the IRRTIP is:
    (a) The BIA Regional Office forwards the IRRTIP to the Secretaries 
for review and approval;
    (b) Federal Lands Highway Office will provide copies of the approved 
IRRTIP to the FHWA division office for transmittal to the State 
transportation agency for inclusion in the State Transportation 
Improvement Program (STIP). The approved IRRTIP will be returned to BIA;
    (c) BIA sends copies of the approved IRRTIP to BIA Regional Offices 
and tribal governments; and
    (d) Within 10 working days of receiving the approved IRRTIP and IRR 
Program funds, BIA enters the projects into the Federal finance system.


<R05>
Sec. 170.427  How may an IRRTIP be amended?

    (a) A tribe may amend the IRRTIP by changing its TTIP on or before 
July 15 and submitting the changed TTIP to BIA for inclusion in the 
IRRTIP. BIA's regional office will review all submitted information with 
the tribe and provide a written response (approving, denying, or 
requesting additional information) within 45 days. If the proposed 
IRRTIP amendment contains a project not listed on the current approved 
IRRTIP, BIA must submit the proposed amendment to FHWA for final 
approval.
    (b) BIA may amend the IRRTIP:
    (1) To add or delete projects or reflect significant changes in 
scope at any time if requested by the tribe; and
    (2) To reduce funding or reschedule a project after consulting with 
the affected tribe and obtaining its consent, if practical.

[[Page 603]]

    (c) The Secretary may not reduce funding for or reschedule a project 
that is the subject of a negotiated agreement, except under the terms of

representatives to these meetings at their own expense. These reviews 
may be held in conjunction with either a national BIA transportation 
meeting or an IRR Program Coordinating Committee meeting.
    (b) FHWA, BIA, and affected tribes periodically conduct an IRR 
Program process review of each BIA regional office's processes, 
controls, and stewardship. The review provides recommendations to 
improve the processes and controls of the following activities that a 
BIA Regional Office performs:
    (1) Program Management and Oversight;
    (2) Transportation planning;
    (3) Design;
    (4) Contract administration;
    (5) Construction;
    (6) Financial management; and
    (7) Systems management and existing stewardship agreements.
    (c) After the IRR process review, the review team must:

                            Emergency Relief


<R05>
Sec. 170.920  What is the purpose of the provisions relating to emergency relief?

    Sections 170.920 through 170.927 relating to emergency relief are 
provided for information only and do not change the provisions of 23 CFR 
part 668 or existing guidance on emergency relief.


<R05>
Sec. 170.921  What emergency or disaster assistance programs are available?

    (a) FHWA operates two emergency relief programs:
    (1) The Emergency Relief (ER) Program, which provides disaster 
assistance for Federal-aid highways owned by State, county and local 
governments; and
    (2) The Emergency Relief for Federally Owned Roads (ERFO) Program, 
which provides disaster assistance for Federal roads, including Indian 
Reservation Roads, that have been damaged due to natural disasters 
(floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.).
    (b) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may be considered 
as an alternate funding source to repair damage that is ineligible under 
the ER or ERFO Programs.


<R05>
Sec. 170.922  How can States get Emergency Relief Program funds to repair IRR System damage?

    States can request emergency relief program funds to repair damage 
to Federal-aid highways caused by natural disasters or catastrophic 
failures. It is the responsibility of individual States to request these 
funds.


<R05>
Sec. 170.923  What qualifies for ERFO funding?

    (a) Tribes can use ERFO funding to repair damage to IRR 
transportation facilities (including roads, bridges, and related 
structures) caused by natural disaster over a widespread area or by a 
catastrophic failure from any external cause. The Secretary of 
Transportation determines eligible repairs under 23 CFR 668, subpart B.
    (1) Examples of natural disasters include, but are not limited to, 
floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides, avalanches or severe storms, 
such as saturated surface conditions and high-water table caused by 
precipitation over an extended period of time.
    (2) An example of a catastrophic failure includes, but is not 
limited to, a bridge collapse after being struck by a barge, truck or a 
landslide.
    (b) Structural deficiencies, normal physical deterioration, and 
routine heavy maintenance do not qualify for ERFO funding.


<R05>
Sec. 170.924  What happens if DOT denies an ERFO claim?

    The appealing tribe or the facility owner (if the tribe is not the 
owner) may appeal the finding or determination to the Secretary of 
Transportation at: FHWA, 400 7th St., SW., HFL-1, Washington, DC 20590. 
If the tribe is appealing it must provide a courtesy copy of its appeal 
to BIA.


<R05>
Sec. 170.925  Is ERFO funding supplemental to IRR Program funding?

    Yes. If ERFO funds are approved and available, they can be used to 
supplement IRR construction and maintenance funds for FHWA-approved 
repairs. If IRR construction or maintenance funds are used to address an 
approved claim when ERFO funds are unavailable, the next authorized ERFO 
funds may be used to reimburse the construction or maintenance funds 
expended.


<R05>
Sec. 170.926  Can a tribe administer approved ERFO repairs under 

a self-determination contract or a self-governance agreement?

    Yes.


<R05>
Sec. 170.927  How can FEMA Program funds be used to repair damage?

    (a) A tribe can request FEMA Program funds for emergency repairs to 
damaged roads not on the IRR System if the President has declared a 
major disaster or emergency. The tribe makes the request by submitting 
an SF 424, Application for Federal Assistance, directly to FEMA, as 
described in FEMA Response and Recovery Directorate 9512.4 (Dec. 28, 
1999).
    (b) Tribes can ask States to seek FEMA Program funds to repair 
damage to roads not on the IRR System.

                    Tribal Transportation Departments


<R05>
Sec. 170.930  What is a tribal transportation department?

    A tribal transportation department is a department, commission, 
board, or official of any tribal government charged by its laws with the 
responsibility for highway construction. Tribal governments, as 
sovereign nations, have inherent authority to establish their own 
transportation departments under their own tribal laws. Tribes may staff 
and organize transportation departments in any manner that best suits 
their needs. Tribes can receive technical assistance from Indian LTAP 
centers, BIA regional road engineers, or AASHTO to establish a tribal 
transportation department.


<R05>
Sec. 170.931  Can tribes use IRR Program funds to pay tribal transportation

department operating costs?

    Yes. Tribes can use IRR Program funds to pay the cost of planning, 
administration, and performance of approved IRR Program activities (see 
appendix A, subpart B). Tribes can also use BIA road maintenance funds 
to pay the cost of planning, administration, and performance of 
maintenance activities under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 170.932  Are there other funding sources for tribal transportation departments?

    There are many sources of funds that may help support a tribal 
transportation department. The following are some examples of additional 
funding sources:
    (a) Tribal general funds;
    (b) Tribal Priority Allocation;
    (c) Tribal permits and license fees;
    (d) Tribal fuel tax;
    (e) Federal, State, private, and local transportation grants 
assistance;
    (f) Tribal Employment Rights Ordinance fees (TERO); and
    (g) Capacity building grants from Administration for Native 
Americans and other organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 170.933  Can tribes regulate oversize or overweight vehicles?

    Yes. Tribal governments can regulate travel on roads under their 
jurisdiction and establish a permitting process to regulate the travel 
of oversize or overweight vehicles, in accordance with applicable 
Federal law. BIA may, with the consent of the affected tribe, establish 
a permitting process to regulate the travel of oversize or overweight 
vehicles on BIA-system roads.

                           Resolving Disputes


<R05>
Sec. 170.934  Are alternative dispute resolution procedures available?

    (a) Federal agencies should use mediation, conciliation, 
arbitration, and other techniques to resolve disputes brought by IRR 
Program beneficiaries. The goal of these alternative dispute resolution 
(ADR) procedures is to provide an inexpensive and expeditious forum to 
resolve disputes. Federal agencies should resolve disputes at the lowest 
possible staff level and in a consensual manner whenever possible.
    (b) Except as required in 25 CFR part 900 and part 1000, tribes 
operating under a self-determination contract or self-governance 
agreement are entitled to use dispute resolution techniques prescribed 
in:
    (1) The ADR Act, 5 U.S.C. 571-583;
    (2) The Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 601-613; and
    (3) The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and 
the implementing regulations (including for non-construction the 
mediation and alternative dispute resolution options listed in 25 U.S.C. 
4501 (model contract section (b)(12)).


<R05>
Sec. 170.935  How does a direct service tribe begin the alternative dispute resolution process?

    (a) To begin the ADR process, a direct service tribe must write to 
the BIA Regional Director or the Chief of BIA Division of 
Transportation. The letter must:
    (1) Ask to begin one of the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) 
procedures in the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, 5 
U.S.C. 571-583 (ADR Act); and
    (2) Explain the factual and legal basis for the dispute.
    (b) ADR proceedings will be governed by procedures in the ADR Act 
and the implementing regulations.

    (1) To coordinate transportation-related activities to help provide 
access to jobs and make education, training, childcare, healthcare, and 
other services more accessible to tribal members; and
    (2) As the matching share for other Federal, State, and local 
mobility programs
    (b) To the extent authorized by law additional grants and program 
funds are available for the purposes in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
from other programs administered by the Departments of Transportation, 
Health and Human Services, and Labor.

   Subpart E_Financial Matters: Assessments, Billing, and Collections


<R05>
Sec. 171.500  How does BIA determine the annual operation and

maintenance assessment rate for the irrigation facility servicing my farm unit?

    (a) We calculate the annual operation and maintenance assessment 
rate by estimating the following annual costs and then dividing by the 
total assessable acres for your irrigation facility:
    (1) Personnel salary and benefits for the facility engineer/manager 
and employees under their management or control;
    (2) Materials and supplies;
    (3) Vehicle and equipment repairs;
    (4) Equipment costs, including lease fees;
    (5) Depreciation;
    (6) Acquisition costs;
    (7) Maintenance of a reserve fund available for contingencies or 
emergency costs needed for the reliable operation of the irrigation 
facility infrastructure;
    (8) Maintenance of a vehicle and heavy equipment replacement fund;
    (9) Systematic rehabilitation and replacement of project facilities;
    (10) Contingencies for unknown costs and omitted budget items; and
    (11) Other costs we determine necessary to properly perform the 
activities and functions characteristic of an irrigation facility.
    (b) Annual operation and maintenance assessment rates may be lowered 
through the exercise of our discretion when items listed in (a) of this 
section are adjusted pursuant to our authority under 25 U.S.C. 385, 386a 
and 389.
    (c) If you subdivide your farm unit, you may be subject to a higher 
annual operation and maintenance assessment rate, which we publish 
annually in the Federal Register.
    (d) At projects where supplemental water is available, the 
calculation of your annual operation and maintenance assessment rate may 
take into consideration the total estimated annual amount to be 
collected for supplemental water deliveries.


<R05>
Sec. 171.505  How does BIA calculate my annual operation and maintenance assessment?

    (a) We calculate your annual operation and maintenance assessment by 
multiplying the total assessable acres of your land within the service 
area of our irrigation facility by the annual operation and maintenance 
assessment rate we establish for that facility.
    (b) We will not assess lands that have been re-classified as either 
permanently non-assessable (PNA) or temporarily non-assessable (TNA) or 
lands

[[Page 632]]

that have been granted an Annual Assessment Waiver.
    (c) If your lands are under an approved Incentive Agreement, we may 
waive your assessment as described in the Incentive Agreement (See Sec. 
171.610).
    (d) Some irrigation facilities may charge a minimum operation and 
maintenance assessment. If the irrigation facility serving your farm 
unit charges a minimum operation and maintenance assessment that is more 
than your assessment calculated by the method described in subpart (a) 
of this section, you will be charged the minimum operation and 
maintenance assessment. We provide public notice of any minimum 
operation and maintenance assessments annually in the Federal Register 
(See Sec. 171.565).


<R05>
Sec. 171.510  How does BIA calculate my annual operation and

maintenance assessment if supplemental water is available on 
the irrigation facility servicing my 
          farm unit?

    (a) For projects where supplemental water is available, and you 
request and receive supplemental water, your assessment will include two 
components: a base rate, which is for your per-acre water duty delivered 
to your farm unit; and a supplemental water rate, which is for water 
delivered to your farm unit in addition to your per-acre water duty.
    (b) We publish base and supplemental water rates annually in the 
Federal Register. The base and supplemental water rates are established 
to recover the costs identified in section 171.500(a) of this subpart.
    (c) If your project has established a supplemental water rate, and 
you request and receive supplemental water, we will calculate your total 
annual operation and maintenance assessment by adding the following two 
totals:
    (1) The total assessable acres of your land within the service area 
of our irrigation facility multiplied by the annual operation and 
maintenance assessment rate we establish for that facility; and
    (2) The actual quantity of supplemental water you request and we 
agree to deliver (in acre-feet) times the supplemental water rate 
established for that facility.


<R05>
Sec. 171.515  Who will BIA bill?

    (a) We will bill the landowner, unless:
    (1) The land is leased under a lease approved by us, in which case 
we will bill the lessee, or
    (2) The landowner(s) is represented by a representative organization 
that collects annual operation and maintenance assessments on behalf of 
its members and the representative organization makes a direct payment 
to us on your behalf.
    (b) If you own or lease assessable lands within a BIA irrigation 
facility, you will be billed for annual operation and maintenance 
assessments, whether you request water or not, unless otherwise 
specified in Sec. 171.505(b).

    (1) Distribute all rents and profits, as income, to the life tenant;
    (2) Distribute any contract bonus one-half each to the life tenant 
and the remainderman;
    (3) In the case of mineral contracts:
    (i) Invest the principal, with interest income to be paid to the 
life tenant during the life estate, except in those instances where the 
administrative cost of investment is disproportionately high, in which 
case paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies; and

in an account, with disbursement to take place upon determination of the 
contingent remainderman.


<R05>
Sec. 179.102  How does the Secretary calculate the value of a remainder and a life estate?

    (a) If income is subject to division, the Secretary will use 
Actuarial Table S, Valuation of Annuities, found at 26 CFR 20.2031, to 
determine the value of the interests of the holders of remainder 
interests and the life tenant.
    (b) Actuarial Table S, Valuation of Annuities, specifies the share 
attributable to the life estate and remainder interests, given the age 
of the life tenant and an established rate of return published by the 
Secretary in the Federal Register. We may periodically review and revise 
the percent rate of return to be used to determine the share 
attributable to the interests of the life tenant and the holders of 
remainder interests. The life tenant will receive the balance of the 
distribution after the shares of the holders of remainder interests have 
been calculated.

or allow damage to the trust property through culpable negligence or an 
affirmative act of malicious destruction that causes damage to the 
prejudice of the holders of remainder interests.

                     Subpart B_How To Acquire Leases


<R05>
Sec. 211.20  Leasing procedures.

    (a) Indian mineral owners may, with the approval of the 
superintendent or area director, lease their land for mining purposes. 
No oil and gas lease shall be approved unless it has first been offered 
for bidding at an advertised lease sale in accordance with this section. 
Leases for minerals other than oil and gas shall be advertised for bids 
as prescribed in this section unless the Secretary grants the Indian 
mineral owners written permission to negotiate for lease. Application 
for leases shall be made to the superintendent having jurisdiction over 
the lands.
    (b) Indian mineral owners may request that the Secretary prepare and 
advertise or negotiate (if the requirements of this section have been 
met) mineral leases on their behalf. If requested by an applicant 
interested in acquiring rights to Indian-owned minerals, the Secretary 
shall promptly notify the Indian mineral owner, and advise the owner in 
writing of the alternatives available, including the right to decline to 
lease. If the Indian mineral owner decides to have the leases 
advertised, the Secretary shall consult with the Indian mineral owner 
concerning the appropriate royalty rate and rental. The Secretary may 
then undertake the responsibility to advertise and lease in accordance 
with the following procedures:
    (1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for 
bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of 
both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one 
local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days 
in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the 
reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific 
description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific 
description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the 
superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of 
the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to 
each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. 
Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements of 
lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate 
superintendent or area director for future reference.
    (2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to the responsible 
bidder offering the highest bonus. The Secretary, after consultation 
with the Indian mineral owner, shall establish the rental and royalty 
rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and shall not be 
subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the 
Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that 
acceptance of the lease bid by the Indian mineral owner is required.

[[Page 658]]

    (3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, 
payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not 
less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that 
bid is not accepted.
    (4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) 
working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.
    (5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after 
notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the 
bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of 
the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and 
file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall 
also file the lease in completed form at that time. However, for good 
reasons, the Secretary may grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day 
increments for filing of the lease and all required bonds, provided that 
additional extension requests are submitted and approved prior to the 
expiration of the original thirty (30) days or the previously granted 
extension. Failure on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable 
actions necessary to comply with the foregoing shall result in 
forfeiture of the required payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for 
the use and benefit of the Indian mineral owner.
    (6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder 
fails to complete all requirements necessary for the approval of the 
lease, or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best 
interest of the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the 
Secretary may re-advertise the lease for sale, or, subject to the 
consent of the Indian mineral owner, the lease may be let through 
private negotiations.
    (c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the 
results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the 
consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained.
    (d) The Indian mineral owner may also submit negotiated leases to 
the Secretary for review and approval.

Sec. 211.22  Leases for subsurface storage of oil or gas.

    (a) The Secretary, with the consent of the Indian mineral owners, 
may approve storage leases, or modifications, amendments, or extensions 
of existing leases, on Indian lands to provide for the subsurface 
storage of oil or gas, irrespective of the lands from which production 
is initially obtained. The storage lease, or modification, amendment, or 
extension to an existing lease, shall provide for the payment of such 
storage fee or rental on such oil or gas as may be determined adequate 
in each case, or, in lieu thereof, for a royalty other than that 
prescribed in the oil and gas lease when such stored oil and gas is 
produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously produced.
    (b) The Secretary, with consent of the Indian mineral owners, may 
approve a provision in an oil and gas lease under which storage of oil 
and gas is authorized, for continuance of the lease at least for the 
period of such storage use and so long thereafter as oil or gas not 
previously produced is produced in paying quantities.
    (c) Applications for subsurface storage of oil or gas shall be filed 
in triplicate with the authorized officer and shall disclose the 
ownership of the lands involved, the parties in interest, the storage 
fee, rental, or royalty offered to be paid for such storage, and all 
essential information showing the necessity for such project. Enough 
copies of the final agreement signed by the Indian mineral owners and 
other parties in interest shall be submitted for the approval of the 
Secretary to permit retention of five copies by the Department after 
approval.

the corporation is authorized to hold such interests in the State where 
the land described in the instrument is situated; and
    (2) A notarized statement that the corporation has power to conduct 
all business and operations as described in the lease or permit.
    (c) The Secretary may, either before or after the approval of a 
permit, mineral lease, assignment, or bond, call for any reasonable 
additional information necessary to carry out the regulations in this 
part, or other applicable laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 211.24  Bonds.

    (a) The lessee, permittee or prospective lessee acquiring a lease, 
or any interest therein, by assignment shall furnish with each lease, 
permit or assignment a surety bond or personal bond in an amount 
sufficient to ensure compliance with all of the terms and conditions of 
the lease(s), permit(s), or assignment(s) and the statutes and 
regulations applicable to the lease, permit, or assignment. Surety bonds 
shall be issued by a qualified company approved by the Department of the 
Treasury (see Department of the Treasury Circular No. 570).
    (b) An operator may file a $75,000 bond for all geothermal, mining,

the discretion of the Secretary.
    (c) An operator may file a $150,000 bond for full nationwide 
coverage to cover all geothermal or oil and gas leases, permits, or 
assignments without geographic or acreage limitation to which the 
operator is or may become a party. Nationwide bonds are subject to 
approval in the discretion of the Secretary.
    (d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by:
    (1) Certificate of deposit issued by a financial institution, the 
deposits of which are federally insured, explicitly granting the 
Secretary full authority to demand immediate payment in case of default 
in the performance of the provisions and conditions of the lease or 
permit. The certificate shall explicitly indicate on its face that 
Secretarial approval is required prior to redemption of the certificate 
of deposit by any party;
    (2) Cashier's check;
    (3) Certified check;
    (4) Negotiable Treasury securities of the United States of a value

Sec. 211.25  Acreage limitation.

    A lessee may acquire more than one lease but no single lease shall 
be granted for mineral leasing purposes on Indian tribal or restricted 
lands in excess of the following acreage except where the rule of 
approximation applies:
    (a) Leases for oil and gas and all other minerals except coal are to 
be contained within one United States Governmental survey section of 
land and shall be described by legal subdivisions including lots or 
tract equivalents not to exceed 640 acres; in instances of irregular 
surveys, including lands not surveyed under the United States 
Governmental survey, lands shall be considered in multiples of 40 acres 
or the nearest aliquot equivalent thereof;
    (b) Leases for coal shall ordinarily be limited to 2,560 acres in a 
reasonably compact form and shall be described by legal subdivisions 
including lots or tract equivalents. In instances of irregular surveys, 
including lands not surveyed under the United States Governmental 
survey, lands shall be considered in multiples of 40 acres or the 
nearest aliquot equivalent thereof. The Secretary may, upon application 
and with the consent of the Indian mineral owner, approve the issuance 
of a single lease for more than 2,560 acres, in a reasonably compact 
form, upon a finding that the issuance is in the best interest of the 
lessor.


<R05>
Sec. 211.26  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 211.27  Duration of leases.

    (a) All leases shall be for a term not to exceed a primary term of 
lease duration of ten (10) years and, absent specific lease provisions 
to the contrary, shall continue as long thereafter as the minerals 
specified in the lease are produced in paying quantities. Absent 
specific lease provisions to the contrary, all provisions in leases 
governing their duration shall be measured from the date of approval by 
the Secretary.
    (b) An oil and gas or geothermal resource lease which stipulates 
that it shall continue in full force and effect beyond the expiration of 
the primary term of lease duration (``commencement clause'') if drilling 
operations have commenced during the primary term, shall be valid and 
shall hold the lease beyond the primary term of lease duration if the 
lessee or the lessee's designee has commenced actual drilling by 
midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease with a 
drilling rig designed to reach the total proposed depth, and drilling is 
continued with reasonable diligence until the well is completed to 
production or abandoned. However, in no case shall such drilling hold 
the lease longer than 120 days past the primary term of lease duration 
without actual production of oil, gas, or geothermal resources. 
Provided, that this extension does not allow a lease to continue past 
the 10-year statutory limitation. Drilling which meets the requirements 
of this section and occurs within a unit or communitization agreement to 
which the lease is committed shall be considered as if it occurs on the 
leasehold itself. If there is a conflict between the commencement clause 
and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement clause will 
control.
    (c) A solid minerals lease which stipulates that it shall continue 
in full force and effect beyond the expiration of the primary term of 
lease duration if mining operations have commenced during the primary 
term (commencement clause), shall be valid and hold the lease beyond the 
primary term of lease duration if the lessee or the lessee's designee 
has by midnight of the last day of the primary term of the lease 
commenced actual removal of mineral materials intended for sale and upon 
which royalties will be paid. If there is a conflict between the 
commencement clause and the habendum clause of a lease, the commencement 
clause will control.

Sec. 211.28  Unitization and communitization agreements, and well spacing.

    (a) For the purpose of promoting conservation and efficient 
utilization of minerals, the Secretary may approve a cooperative unit, 
drilling or other development plan on any leased area upon a 
determination that approval is advisable and in the best interest of the 
Indian mineral owner. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative 
unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the 
development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single 
unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the 
agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, 
unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of 
agreements that allocate costs and benefits.
    (b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or 
cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is 
specifically required in the lease. However, the Secretary shall consult 
with the Indian mineral owner prior to making a determination concerning 
a cooperative agreement or well spacing plan.
    (c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply 
with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be 
filed with the superintendent or area director.
    (d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the 
mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be 
notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the 
superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating 
that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the 
superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice 
requirement.
    (e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and 
all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the 
superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the 
first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area proposed 
to be covered by the cooperative agreement.
    (f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval 
of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by 
the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first 
production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved 
before the lease expiration date.
    (g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement 
shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands 
committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be 
effective on the date the agreement is effective.
    (h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program 
approved by the authorized officer.

Sec. 211.29  Exemption of leases and permits made by organized tribes.

    The regulations in this part may be superseded by the provisions of 
any tribal constitution, bylaw or charter issued pursuant to the Indian 
Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 461-479), 
the Alaska Act of May 1, 1936 (49 Stat. 1250; 48 U.S.C. 362,258a), or 
the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1967; 25 
U.S.C., and Sup., 501-509), or by ordinance, resolution, or other action 
authorized under such constitution, bylaw or charter; Provided, that 
such tribal law may not supersede the requirements of Federal statutes 
applicable to Indian mineral leases. The regulations in this part, in so 
far as they are not so superseded, shall apply to leases and permits 
made by organized tribes if the validity of the lease or permit depends 
upon the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

    (a) A lessee shall pay, in advance, beginning with the effective 
date of the lease, an annual rental of $2.00 per acre or fraction of an 
acre or such other greater amount as prescribed in the lease. This 
rental shall not be credited against production royalty nor shall the 
rental be prorated or refunded because of surrender or cancellation.
    (b) The Secretary shall not approve leases with a royalty rate less 
than 16-\2/3\ percent of the amount or value of production produced and 
sold from the lease unless a lower royalty rate is agreed to by the 
Indian mineral owner and is found to be in the best interest of the 
Indian mineral owner. Such approval may only be granted by the area 
director if the approving official is the superintendent and by the 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs if the approving official is the 
area director.
    (c) Value of lease production for royalty purposes shall be 
determined in accordance with applicable lease provisions and 
regulations in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C. If the valuation 
provisions in the lease are inconsistent with the regulations in 30 CFR 
chapter II, subchapters A and C, the lease provisions shall govern.
    (d) If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's 
requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then 
the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for any desired 
school or other buildings belonging to the tribe, by making his own 
connections to a regulator installed, connected to the well and 
maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay 
royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's 
risk at all times.


<R05>
Sec. 211.42  Annual rentals and expenditures for development on leases

other than oil and gas, and geothermal resources.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, a lease for

a yearly development expenditure of not less than $20 per acre. All such 
leases shall provide for a rental payment of not less than $2.00 for 
each acre or fraction of an acre payable on or before the first day of 
each lease year.
    (b) Within twenty (20) days after the lease year, an itemized 
statement, in duplicate, of the expenditure for development under a 
lease for minerals other than oil and gas shall be filed with the 
superintendent or area director. The lessee must certify the statement 
under oath.


<R05>
Sec. 211.43  Royalty rates for minerals other than oil and gas.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the minimum 
rates for leases of minerals other than oil and gas shall be as follows:
    (1) For substances other than coal, the royalty rate shall be 10 
percent of the value of production produced and sold from the lease at 
the nearest shipping point.
    (2) For coal to be strip or open pit mined the royalty rate shall be 
12\1/2\ percent of the value of production produced and sold from the 
lease, and for coal removed from an underground mine, the royalty rate 
shall be 8 percent of the value of production produced and sold from the 
lease.
    (3) For geothermal resources, the royalty rate shall be 10 percent 
of the amount or value of steam, or any other form of heat or energy 
derived from production of geothermal resources under the lease and sold 
or utilized by the lessee. In addition, the royalty rate shall be 5 
percent of the value of any byproduct derived from production of 
geothermal resources under the lease and sold or utilized or reasonably 
susceptible of sale or utilization by the lessee, except that the 
royalty for any mineral byproduct shall be governed by the appropriate 
paragraph of this section.
    (b) A lower royalty rate shall be allowed if it is determined to be 
in the best interest of the Indian mineral owner. Approval of a lower 
rate may only be granted by the area director if the approving official 
is the superintendent or by the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, 
if the approving official is the area director.

Sec. 211.44  Suspension of operations.

    (a) After the expiration of the primary term of the lease the 
Secretary may approve suspension of operations for remedial purposes 
which are necessary for continued production, to protect the resource, 
the environment, or for other good reasons. Provided, that such remedial 
operations are conducted in accordance with 43 CFR part 3160, subpart 
3165 and under such stipulations and conditions as may be prescribed by 
the Secretary and are conducted with reasonable diligence. Any 
suspension shall not relieve the lessee from liability for the payment 
of rental and other payments as required by lease provisions.
    (b) An application for permission to suspend operations or 
production for economic or marketing reasons on a lease capable of 
production after the expiration of the primary term of lease duration 
must be accompanied by the written consent of the Indian mineral owner, 
an economic analysis, and an executed amendment by the parties to the 
lease setting forth the provisions pertaining to the suspension of 
operations and production. Such application shall be treated as a 
negotiated change to lease provisions, and as such, shall be subject to 
review and approval by the Secretary.

Secretary to enter all parts of the leased premises for the purpose of 
inspection and audit. Lessees shall keep a full and correct account of 
all operations and submit all related reports required by the lease and 
applicable regulations. Books and records shall be available for 
inspection during regular business hours.


<R05>
Sec. 211.47  Diligence, drainage and prevention of waste.

    The lessee shall:
    (a) Exercise diligence in mining, drilling and operating wells on 
the leased lands while minerals production can be secured in paying 
quantities;
    (b) Protect the lease from drainage (if oil and gas or geothermal 
resources are being drained from the lease premises by a well or wells 
located on lands not included in the lease, the Secretary reserves the 
right to impose reasonable and equitable terms and conditions to protect 
the interest of the Indian mineral owner of the lands, such as payment 
of compensatory royalty for the drainage);
    (c) Carry on operations in a good and workmanlike manner in 
accordance with approved methods and practices;
    (d) Have due regard for the prevention of waste of oil or gas or 
other minerals, the entrance of water through wells drilled by the 
lessee to other strata, to the destruction or injury of the oil or gas, 
other mineral deposits, or fresh water aquifers, the preservation and 
conservation of the property for future productive operations, and the 
health and safety of workmen and employees;
    (e) Securely plug all wells and effectively shut off all water from 
the oil or gas-bearing strata before abandoning them;
    (f) Not construct any well pad location within 200 feet of any 
structures or improvements without the Indian surface owner's written 
consent;
    (g) Carry out, at the lessee's expense, all reasonable orders and 
requirements of the authorized officer relative to prevention of waste;
    (h) Bury all pipelines crossing tillable lands below plow depth 
unless other arrangements are made with the Indian surface owner; and

any Indian lands before the Secretary has granted written approval of a 
mineral lease or permit pursuant to the regulations in this part.
    (b) After a lease or permit is approved, written permission must be 
secured from the Secretary before any

[[Page 664]]

operations are started on the leased premises, in accordance with 
applicable rules and regulations in 25 CFR part 216; 30 CFR chapter II, 
subchapters A and C; 30 CFR part 750 (Requirements for Surface Coal 
Mining and Reclamation Operations on Indian Lands), 43 CFR parts 3160, 
3260, 3480, 3590, and Orders or Notices to Lessees (NTLs) issued 
thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 211.49  Restrictions on operations.

    Leases issued under the provisions of the regulations in this part 
shall be subject to such restrictions as to time or times for well

Sec. 211.50  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 211.51  Surrender of leases.

    A lessee may, with the approval of the Secretary, surrender a lease 
or any part of it, on the following conditions:
    (a) All royalties and rentals due on the date the request for 
surrender is received must be paid;
    (b) The superintendent, after consultation with the authorized 
officer, must be satisfied that proper provisions have been made for the 
conservation and protection of the property, and that all operations on 
the portion of the lease surrendered have been properly reclaimed, 
abandoned, or conditioned, as required;
    (c) If a lease has been recorded, the lessee must submit a release 
along with the recording information of the original lease so that, 
after acceptance of the release, it may be recorded;
    (d) If a lessee requests to surrender an entire lease or an entire 
undivided portion of a lease document, the lessee must deliver to the 
superintendent or area director the original lease documents; Provided, 
that where the request is made by an assignee to whom no copy of the 
lease was delivered, the assignee must deliver to the superintendent or 
area director only its copy of the assignment;
    (e) If the lease (or a portion thereof being surrendered) is owned 
in undivided interests, all lessees owning undivided interests in the 
lease must join in the request for surrender;
    (f) No part of any advance rental shall be refunded to the lessee, 
nor shall any subsequent surrender or termination of a lease relieve the 
lessee of the obligation to pay advance rental if advance rental became 
due prior to the date the request for surrender was received by the 
superintendent or area director;
    (g) If oil, gas, or geothermal resources are being drained from the 
leased premises by a well or wells located on lands not included in the 
lease, the Secretary reserves the right, prior to acceptance of the 
surrender, to impose reasonable and equitable terms and conditions to 
protect the interests of the Indian mineral owners of the lands 
surrendered. Such terms and conditions may include payment of 
compensatory royalty for any drainage; and
    (h) Upon expiration or surrender of a solid mineral lease the lessee 
shall deliver the leased premises in a condition conforming to the 
approved reclamation plan. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, the 
machinery necessary to operate the mine is the property of the lessee. 
However, the machinery may not be removed from the leased premises 
without the written permission of the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 211.52  Fees.

    Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each permit, lease, 
sublease, or other contract, or assignment, thereof shall be accompanied 
by a filing fee of $75.00 at the time of filing.


<R05>
Sec. 211.53  Assignments, overriding royalties, and operating agreements.

    (a) Approved leases or any interest therein may be assigned or 
transferred only with the approval of the Secretary. The Indian mineral 
owner must also consent if approval of the Indian mineral owner is 
required in the lease. If consent is not required, then the Secretary 
shall notify the Indian mineral owner of the proposed assignment. To 
obtain the approval of the Secretary the assignee must be qualified to 
hold the lease under existing rules and regulations and shall furnish a 
satisfactory bond conditioned for the

[[Page 665]]

faithful performance of the covenants and conditions of the lease.
    (b) No lease or interest therein or the use of such lease shall be 
assigned, sublet, or transferred, directly or indirectly, by working or 
drilling contract, or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary.
    (c) Assignments of leases, and stipulations modifying the provisions 
of existing leases, which stipulations are also subject to the approval 
of the Secretary, shall be filed with the superintendent within five (5) 
working days after the date of execution. Upon execution of satisfactory 
bonds by the assignee the Secretary may permit the release of any bonds 
executed by the assignor. Upon execution of satisfactory bonds the 
assignee accepts all the assignor's responsibilities and prior 
obligations and liabilities of the assignor (including but not limited 
to any underpaid royalties and rentals) under the lease.
    (d) Agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of 
production shall not be considered as interests in the leases as such 
provision is used in this section. Agreements creating overriding 
royalties or payments out of production, or agreements designating 
operators are hereby authorized and the approval of the Secretary shall 
not be required with respect thereto, but such agreements shall be 
subject to the condition that nothing in such agreements shall be 
construed as modifying any of the obligations of the lessee, including, 
but not limited to, obligations imposed by requirements of the MMS for 
reporting, accounting, and auditing; obligations for diligent 
development and operation, protection against drainage and mining in 
trespass, compliance with oil and gas, geothermal, and mining 
regulations (25 CFR part 216; 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, and 3590; 
and those applicable rules found in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters A and 
C) and the requirements for Secretarial approval before abandonment of 
any oil and gas or geothermal well or mining operation. All such 
obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free 
of any such overriding royalties or payments. The existence of 
agreements creating overriding royalties or payments out of production, 
whether or not actually paid, shall not be considered as justification 
for the approval of abandonment of any oil and gas or geothermal well or 
mining operation. Nothing in this paragraph revokes the requirement for 
approval of assignments and other instruments which is required in this 
section, but any overriding royalties or payments out of production 
created by the provisions of such assignments or instruments shall be 
subject to the condition stated in this section. Agreements creating 
overriding royalties or payments out of production, or agreements 
designating operators shall be filed with the superintendent unless 
incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed pursuant 
to this section.

[[Page 666]]

after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (d) The lessee or permittee shall have thirty (30) days (or such 
longer time as specified in the notice) from the date that the notice is 
served to respond, in writing, to the official or the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs office that issued the notice.
    (e) If a permittee or lessee fails to take any action that is 
prescribed in the notice of proposed cancellation, fails to file a 
timely written response to the notice, or files a written response that 
does not, in the discretion of the Secretary, adequately justify the 
permittee's or lessee's actions, then the Secretary may cancel the lease 
or permit, specifying the basis for the cancellation.
    (f) If a permittee or lessee fails to take corrective action or to 
file a timely written response adequately justifying the permittee's or 
lessee's actions pursuant to a notice of noncompliance, the Secretary 
may issue an order of cessation of operations. If the permittee or 
lessee fails to comply with the order of cessation, or fails to timely 
file an appeal of the order of cessation pursuant to paragraph (h), the 
Secretary may issue an order of lease or permit cancellation.
    (g) Cancellation of a lease or permit shall not relieve the lessee 
or permittee of any continuing obligations under the lease or permit.
    (h) Orders of cessation or of lease or permit cancellation issued 
pursuant to this section may be appealed under 25 CFR part 2.
    (i) This section does not limit any other remedies of the Indian 
mineral owner as set forth in the lease or permit.
    (j) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of 
the authorized officer or the MMS official to take any enforcement 
action authorized pursuant to statute or regulation.
    (k) The authorized officer, MMS official, and the superintendent 
and/or area director should consult with one another before taking any 
enforcement actions.


<R05>
Sec. 211.55  Penalties.

    (a) In addition to or in lieu of cancellation under Sec. 211.54, 
violations of the terms and conditions of any lease, or the regulations 
in this part, or failure to comply with a notice of noncompliance or a 
cessation order issued by the Secretary, or, in the case of solid 
minerals the authorized officer, may subject a lessee or permittee to a 
penalty of not more than $1,000 per day for each day that such a 
violation or noncompliance continues beyond the time limits prescribed 
for corrective action.
    (b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the lessee or 
permittee either personally or by certified mail to the lessee or 
permittee at the lessee's or permittee's last known address. The date of 
service by certified mail shall be deemed to be the date when received 
or five (5) working days after the date mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the 
proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the lessee or permittee 
of the lessee's or permittee's right to either request a hearing within 
thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. 
Hearings shall be held before the superintendent and/or area director 
whose findings shall be conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant 
to 25 CFR part 2.
    (d) If the lessee or permittee served with a notice of proposed 
penalty requests a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the 
violations or noncompliance set forth in the notice continue beyond the 
time limits prescribed for corrective action. The Secretary may issue a 
written suspension of the requirement to correct the violations pending 
completion of the hearings provided by this section only upon a 
determination, at the discretion of the Secretary, that such a 
suspension will not be detrimental to the lessor and upon submission and 
acceptance of a bond deemed adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss 
or damage. The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost 
of correcting the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed 
amounts plus accrued penalties and interest.
    (e) Payment in full of penalties more than ten (10) days after a 
final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the

lessee or permittee to late payment charges. Late payment charges shall 
be calculated on the basis of a percentage assessment rate of the amount 
unpaid per month for each month or fraction thereof until payment is 
received by the Secretary. In the absence of a specific lease provision 
prescribing a different rate, the interest rate on late payments and 
underpayments shall be a rate applicable under Sec. 6621(a)(2) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the 
amount of payment not received and only for the number of days the 
payment is late.
    (f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:
    (1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the

impose penalties for violations of applicable regulations pursuant to 43 
CFR part 3160, and 43 CFR Groups 3400 and 3500, 30 CFR part 750, or 30 
CFR chapter II, subchapters A and C;
    (2) Replacing or superseding any penalty provision in the terms and 
conditions of a lease or permit approved by the Secretary pursuant to 
this part; or
    (3) Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of lease 
or permit terms for which the authorized officer, director's 
representative or MMS official, have either statutory or regulatory 
authority to assess a penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 211.56  Geological and geophysical permits.

    Permits to conduct geological and geophysical operations on Indian 
lands which do not conflict with any mineral leases entered into 
pursuant to this part, may be approved by the Secretary with the consent 
of the Indian mineral owner under the following conditions:
    (a) The permit must describe the area to be explored, the duration, 
and the consideration to be paid the Indian owner;
    (b) The permit will not grant the permittee any option or preference 
rights to a lease or other development contract, or authorize the 
production of, or removal of oil and gas, geothermal resources, or other 
minerals, except samples for assay and experimental purposes, unless 
specifically so stated in the permit; and
    (c) Copies of all data collected pursuant to operations conducted 
under the permit shall be forwarded to the Secretary and the Indian 
mineral owner, unless otherwise provided in the permit. Data collected 
under a permit may be held by the Secretary as privileged and 
proprietary information for the time prescribed in the permit. Where no 
time period is prescribed in the permit, the Secretary may release such 
information after six (6) years, with the consent of the Indian mineral 
owner.


<R05>
Sec. 211.57  Forms.

    Leases, bonds, permits, assignments, and other instruments relating 
to mineral leasing shall be on forms, prescribed by the Secretary, that

resources. These regulations are applicable to lands or interests in 
lands the title to which is held, for any individual Indian, in trust by 
the United States or is subject to restriction against alienation 
imposed by the United States. These regulations are intended to ensure 
that Indian mineral owners desiring to have their resources developed 
are assured that they will be developed in a manner that maximizes their 
best economic interests and minimizes any adverse environmental impacts 
or cultural impacts resulting from such development.
    (b) The regulations in this part shall be subject to amendment at 
any time by the Secretary of the Interior. No regulation that becomes 
effective after the date of approval of any lease or permit shall 
operate to affect the duration of the lease or permit, rate of royalty, 
rental, or acreage unless agreed to by all parties to the lease or 
permit.
    (c) Nothing in the regulations in this part is intended to prevent 
Indian tribes from exercising their lawful governmental authority to 
regulate the conduct of persons, businesses, operations or mining within 
their territorial jurisdiction.
    (d) The regulations of the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of 
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Minerals Management 
Service that are referenced in Sec. Sec. 212.4, 212.5, and 212.6 of 
this part are supplemental to these regulations, and apply to parties 
holding leases or permits for development of Indian mineral resources 
unless specifically stated otherwise in this part or in such other 
Federal regulations.

<R04>
                     Subpart B_How To Acquire Leases


<R05>
Sec. 212.20  Leasing procedures.

    (a) Application for leases shall be made to the superintendent 
having jurisdiction over the lands.
    (b) Indian mineral owners may request the Secretary to prepare, 
advertise and negotiate mineral leases on their behalf. Leases for 
minerals shall be advertised for bids as prescribed in this section 
unless one or more of the Indian mineral owners of a tract sought for 
lease request the Secretary to negotiate for a lease on their behalf 
without advertising. Unless the Secretary decides that negotiation of a 
mineral lease is in the best interests of the Indian mineral owners, he 
shall use the following procedure for leasing:
    (1) Leases shall be advertised to receive optimum competition for 
bonus consideration, under sealed bid, oral auction, or a combination of 
both. Notice of such advertisement shall be published in at least one 
local newspaper and in one trade publication at least thirty (30) days 
in advance of sale. If applicable, such notice must identify the 
reservation within which the tracts to be leased are found. No specific 
description of the tracts to be leased need be published. Specific 
description of such tracts shall be available at the office of the 
superintendent and/or area director upon request. The complete text of 
the advertisement, including a specific description, shall be mailed to 
each person listed on the appropriate agency or area mailing list. 
Individuals and companies interested in receiving advertisements on 
lease sales should send their mailing information to the appropriate 
agency or area office for future reference.
    (2) The advertisement shall offer the tracts to a responsible bidder 
offering the highest bonus. The Secretary shall establish the rental and 
royalty rates which shall be stated in the advertisement and will not be 
subject to negotiation. The advertisement shall provide that the 
Secretary reserves the right to reject any or all bids, and that 
acceptance of the lease bid by or on behalf of the Indian mineral owner 
is required. The requirements under Sec. 212.21 are applicable to the 
acceptance of a lease bid.
    (3) Each sealed bid must be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check or postal money order, or any combination thereof, 
payable to the payee designated in the advertisement, in an amount not 
less than 25 percent of the bonus bid, which shall be returned if that 
bid is not accepted.
    (4) A successful oral auction bidder will be allowed five (5) 
working days to remit the required 25 percent deposit of the bonus bid.
    (5) A successful bidder shall, within thirty (30) days after 
notification of the bid award, remit to the Secretary the balance of the 
bonus, the first year's rental, a $75 filing fee, its prorated share of 
the advertising costs as determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and 
file with the Secretary all required bonds. The successful bidder shall 
also file the lease in completed form, signed by the Indian mineral 
owner(s), at that time. However, for good reasons, the Secretary may 
grant extensions of time in thirty (30) day increments for filing of the 
lease and all required bonds, provided that additional extension 
requests are submitted and approved prior to the expiration of the 
original thirty (30) days or the previously granted extension. Failure 
on the part of the bidder to take all reasonable actions necessary to 
comply with the foregoing shall result in forfeiture of the required 
payment of 25 percent of any bonus bid for the use and benefit of the 
Indian mineral owner.
    (6) If no satisfactory bid is received, or if the accepted bidder 
fails to complete all requirements necessary for approval of the lease, 
or if the Secretary determines that it is not in the best interest of 
the Indian mineral owner to accept any of the bids the Secretary may re-
advertise the tract for sale, or subject to the consent of

[[Page 672]]

the Indian mineral owner, a lease may be let through private 
negotiations.
    (c) The Secretary shall advise the Indian mineral owner of the 
results of the bidding, and shall not approve the lease until the 
consent of the Indian mineral owner has been obtained. The requirements 
under Sec. 212.21 are applicable to the approval of a mineral lease.


<R05>
Sec. 212.21  Execution of leases.

    (a) The Secretary shall not execute a mineral lease on behalf of an 
Indian mineral owner, except when such owner is deceased and the heirs 
to or devisee of the estate have not been determined, or if determined, 
some or all of them cannot be located. Leases involving such interests 
may be executed by the Secretary, provided that the mineral interest 
shall have been offered for sale under the provisions of section 
212.20(b) (1) through (6).
    (b) The Secretary may execute leases on behalf of minors and persons 
who are incompetent by reason of mental incapacity; Provided, that there 
is no parent, guardian, conservator, or other person who has lawful 
authority to execute a lease on behalf of the minor or person with 
mental incapacity.
    (c) If an owner is a life tenant, the procedures set forth in 25 CFR 
part 179 (Life Estates and Future Interests), shall apply.

Sec. 212.28  Unitization and communitization agreements, and well spacing.

    (a) For the purpose of promoting conservation and efficient 
utilization of minerals, the Secretary may approve a cooperative unit, 
drilling or other development plan on any leased area upon a 
determination that approval is advisable and in the best interest of the 
Indian mineral owner. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative 
unit, drilling or other development plan means an agreement for the 
development or operation of a specifically designated area as a single 
unit without regard to separate ownership of the land included in the 
agreement. Such cooperative agreements include, but are not limited to, 
unit agreements, communitization agreements and other types of 
agreements that allocate costs and benefits.
    (b) The consent of the Indian mineral owner to such unit or 
cooperative agreement shall not be required unless such consent is 
specifically required in the lease.
    (c) Requests for approval of cooperative agreements which comply 
with the requirements of all applicable rules and regulations shall be 
filed with the superintendent or area director.
    (d) All Indian mineral owners of any right, title or interest in the 
mineral resources to be included in a cooperative agreement must be 
notified by the lessee at the time the agreement is submitted to the 
superintendent or area director. An affidavit from the lessee stating 
that a notice was mailed to each mineral owner of record for whom the 
superintendent or area director has an address will satisfy this notice 
requirement.
    (e) A request for approval of a proposed cooperative agreement, and 
all documents incident to such agreement, must be filed with the 
superintendent or area director at least ninety (90) days prior to the 
first expiration date of any of the Indian leases in the area

[[Page 673]]

proposed to be covered by the cooperative agreement.
    (f) Unless otherwise provided in the cooperative agreement, approval 
of the agreement commits each lease to the unit in the area covered by 
the agreement on the date approved by the Secretary or the date of first 
production, whichever is earlier, as long as the agreement is approved 
before the lease expiration date.
    (g) Any lease committed in part to any such cooperative agreement 
shall be segregated into a separate lease or leases as to the lands 
committed and lands not committed to the agreement. Segregation shall be 
effective on the date the agreement is effective.
    (h) Wells shall be drilled in conformity with a well spacing program 
approved by the authorized officer.


<R05>
Sec. 212.29  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 212.30  Removal of restrictions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any mineral lease to the 
contrary, the removal of all restrictions against alienation shall 
operate to divest the Secretary of all supervisory authority and 
responsibility with respect to the lease. Thereafter, all payments 
required to be made under the lease shall be made directly to the 
owner(s).
    (b) In the event restrictions are removed from a part of the land 
included in any lease approved by the Secretary, the entire lease shall 
continue to be subject to the supervision of the Secretary until such 
times as the holder of the lease and the unrestricted Indian owner 
submits to the Secretary satisfactory evidence that adequate 
arrangements have been made to account for the mineral resources of the 
restricted land separately from those of the unrestricted. Thereafter, 
the unrestricted portion shall be relieved from the supervision of the 
Secretary, the lease, the regulations of this part, and all other 
applicable laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 212.31-212.32  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 212.33  Terms applying after relinquishment.

    All leases for individual Indian lands approved by the Secretary 
under this part shall contain provisions for the relinquishment of 
supervision and provide for operations of the lease after such 
relinquishment. These leases shall contain provisions that address the 
following issues:
    (a) Provisions of relinquishment. If the Secretary relinquishes 
supervision at any time during the life of the lease instrument as to 
all or part of the acreage subject to the lease, the Secretary shall 
give the Indian mineral owner and the lessee thirty (30) days written 
notice prior to the termination of supervision. After notice of 
relinquishment has been given to the lessee, the lease shall be subject 
to the following conditions:
    (1) All rentals and royalties thereafter accruing shall be paid 
directly to the lessor or the lessor's successors in title, or to a 
trustee appointed under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) If, at the time supervision is relinquished by the Secretary, 
the lessee has made all payments then due and has fully performed all 
obligations on the lessee's part to be performed up to the time of such 
relinquishment, the bond given to secure the performance of the lease, 
on file in the appropriate agency or area office, shall be of no further 
force or effect.
    (3) Should relinquishment affect only part of the lease, then the 
lessee may continue to conduct operations on the land covered by the 
lease as an entirety; Provided, that the lessee shall pay, in the manner 
prescribed by the lease and regulations for the benefit of lessor, the 
same proportion of all rentals and royalties due under the provisions of 
this part as the acreage retained under the supervision of the Secretary 
bears to the entire acreage of the lessee, and shall pay the remainder 
of the rentals and royalties directly to the remaining lessors or 
successors in title or said trustee as the case may be, as provided in 
paragraph (a) (1) of this section.
    (b) Division of fee. If, after the execution of the lease and after 
the Secretary relinquishes supervision thereof, the fee of the leased 
land is divided into separate parcels held by different

[[Page 674]]

owners, or if the rental or royalty interest is divided in ownership, 
the obligations of the lessee shall not be modified in any manner except 
as specifically provided by the provisions of the lease. Notwithstanding 
such separate ownership, the lessee may continue to conduct operations 
on said premises as an entirety. Each separate owner shall receive such 
proportion of all rental and royalties accruing after the vesting of its 
title as the acreage of the fee, or rental or royalty interest, bears to 
the entire acreage covered by the lease; or to the entire rental or 
royalty interest as the case may be. If at any time after departmental 
supervision of the lease is relinquished, in whole or in part, to 
rentals and royalties, whether said parties are so entitled by virtue of 
undivided interest or by virtue of ownership of separate parcels of the 
land covered, the lessee may elect to withhold the payment of further 
rentals or royalties (except as the portion due the Indian lessor while 
under restriction), until all of said parties shall agree upon and

of the Indian owner under the following conditions:
    (1) The permit must describe the area to be explored, the duration 
and the consideration to be paid the Indian owner;
    (2) The permit may not grant the permittee any option or preference 
rights to a lease or other development contract, authorize the 
production of, or removal of oil and gas, or geothermal resources, or 
other minerals except samples for assay and experimental purposes, 
unless specifically so stated in the permit; and
    (3) Copies of all data collected pursuant to operations conducted 
under the permit shall be forwarded to the Secretary and made available 
to the Indian mineral owner, unless otherwise provided in the permit. 
Data collected under a permit shall be held by the Secretary as 
privileged and proprietary information for the time prescribed in the 
permit. Where no time period is prescribed in the permit, the Secretary 
may, in the discretion of the Secretary, release such information after 
six (6) years.

    (1) The minerals are owned by more than one person, and the owners 
of a majority of the interest therein consent to the permit;
    (2) The whereabouts of one or more owners of the minerals or an 
interest therein is unknown, and all the remaining owners of the 
interests consent to the permit;
    (3) The heirs or devisee of a deceased owner of the land or an 
interest therein have not been determined, and the Secretary finds that 
the permit activity will cause no substantial injury to the land or any 
owner thereof; or
    (4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the 
Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain their consent, and 
also finds that the permit activity will cause no substantial injury to 
the land or any owner thereof.
    (c) A lessee does not need a permit to conduct geological and 
geophysical operations on Indian lands, if provided for

[[Page 676]]

in the lessee's mineral lease, where the Indian mineral owner is also 
the surface land owner. In instances where the Indian mineral owner is

Sec. 213.1  Definitions.

    Area Director. The term ``Area Director'' in this part refers to the 
officer in charge of the Five Civilized Tribes Indian Agency.
    Supervisor. The term ``supervisor'' in this part refers to a 
representative of

[[Page 677]]

the Secretary of the Interior under direction of the Director of the 
U.S. Geological Survey, authorized and empowered to supervise and direct 
operations under oil and gas or other mining leases, to furnish 
scientific and technical information and advice, to ascertain and record 
the amount and value of production, and to determine and record rentals 
and royalties due and paid.

                          How To Acquire Leases


<R05>
Sec. 213.2  Applications for leases.

    Applications for leases should be made to the Area Director.


<R05>
Sec. 213.3  No Government employee shall acquire leases.

    No lease, assignment thereof, or interest therein will be approved 
to any employee or employees of the U.S. Government, whether connected 
with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or otherwise, and no employee of the 
Department of the Interior shall be permitted to acquire any interest in 
such leases covering restricted Indian lands by ownership of stock in 
corporations having leases or in any other manner.

(R.S. 2078; 25 U.S.C. 68)


<R05>
Sec. 213.4  Sale of oil and gas leases.

    (a) At such times and in such manner as he may deem appropriate, the 
Area Director shall publish notices at least thirty days prior to the 
sale, unless a shorter period is authorized by the Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs, that oil and gas leases on specific tracts, each of 
which shall be in a reasonably compact body, will be offered to the 
highest responsible bidder for a bonus consideration, in addition to 
stipulated rentals and royalties. Each bid must be accompanied by a 
cashier's check, certified check, or postal money order, payable to the 
payee designated in the invitation to bid, in an amount not less than 25 
percent of the bonus bid. Within 30 days after notification of being the 
successful bidder, said bidder must remit the balance of the bonus, the 
first year's rental, and his share of the advertising costs, and shall 
file with the Area Director the lease in completed form. The Area 
Director may, for good and sufficient reasons, extend the time for the 
completion and submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be 
granted for remitting the balance of monies due. If the successful 
bidder fails to pay the full consideration within said period, or fails 
to file the completed lease within said period or extension thereof, or 
if the lease is disapproved through no fault of the lessor or the 
Department of the Interior, 25 percent of the bonus bid will be 
forfeited for the use and benefit of the Indian lessor.
    (b) In cases where any part of the bonus bid for a lease is paid 
directly to the Indian lessor, upon his signing the lease, the lessee 
must procure and file with the lease an affidavit of the lessor, sworn 
to before a U.S. Commissioner, Postmaster, Area Director, local 
representative of the Area Director, county or district judge, Federal 
judge or clerk of a Federal court, showing the amount of bonus so paid, 
and the balance thereof must be paid into the office of the Area 
Director upon filing the lease. Where possible lessees are requested to 
take the lessor to the nearest United States field clerk who will render 
all proper assistance in the execution of leases, and before whom the 
bonus affidavit may be executed in cases where any part of bonus 
consideration is paid directly to the lessor. Where leases are executed 
by guardians, under order of court, the affidavit of lessor may be 
executed before a notary public.
    (c) All notices or advertisements of sales of oil and gas leases 
shall reserve to the Secretary of the Interior the right to reject all 
bids when in his judgment the interests of the Indians will be best 
served by so doing, and that if no satisfactory bid is received, or if 
the accepted bidder fails to complete the lease or if the Secretary of 
the Interior shall determine that it is unwise in the interests of the 
Indians to accept the highest bid, the Secretary may readvertise such 
lease for sale, or if deemed advisable, with the consent of the Indian 
owners, a lease may be made by private negotiations. The successful 
bidder or bidders will be required to pay his or their share of the 
advertising costs. Amounts received from unsuccessful bidders will be 
returned; but when no bid is accepted on

[[Page 678]]

a tract, the costs of advertising will be assessed against the applicant 
who requested that said tract be advertised.

<R05>
Sec. 213.5  Term of oil and gas leases.

    Oil and gas mining leases which require the approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior may be made for periods of 10 years from the 
date of approval of lease by the Secretary of the Interior and as much 
longer thereafter as oil and/or gas is produced in paying quantities.


<R05>
Sec. 213.6  Leases for minerals other than oil and gas.

    Uncontested mining leases for minerals other than oil and gas shall 
be made on forms \1\ prescribed by the Department, for a period of 15 
years with the right of renewal on such terms as the superintendent may 
prescribe, and shall be subject only to approval by the Area Director. 
See provisions of the act of February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 408). Any 
persons aggrieved by any decision or order of the Area Director 
approving, rejecting, or disapproving any such lease may appeal from the 
same to the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days from the date of 
such decision or order.

(such as field clerk, postmaster, U.S. Commissioner, etc.).


<R05>
Sec. 213.11  Minor lessors.

    Where the lessor is a minor, certified copies of letters of 
guardianship and court orders approving leases must be filed.


<R05>
Sec. 213.12  Leases executed by guardians of minors.

    Leases executed by guardians of minors under order of court for a 
period extending beyond the minority of the minor will be approved 
unless it appears that such action would be prejudicial to the interests 
of the minor: Provided, That in the event the minor becomes of age 
within 1 year from the date of execution of lease the consent of the 
minor to the execution of the lease should be obtained and submitted 
with the lease for consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 213.13  Inherited lands.

    Except to prevent loss or waste, leases on undivided inherited lands 
will not be approved until the heirship determination has been approved. 
If the heirs to undivided inherited lands are undetermined or cannot be 
located, or if the heirs owning less than one-half interest in the lands 
refuse to sign a lease and it appears necessary to lease the lands to 
prevent loss or waste, the Area Director will report the facts to the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs and ask for instructions. Minor heirs can 
lease or joint adult heirs in leasing only through guardians under order 
of court. Proof of heirship shall be given upon Form F prescribed. If 
probate or other court proceedings have established the heirship in any 
case, or the land has been partitioned, certified copy of final order, 
judgment, or decree of the court will be accepted in lieu of Form F.

[[Page 679]]


<R05>
Sec. 213.14  Corporations and corporate information.

    If the applicant for a lease is a corporation, it shall file 
evidence of authority of its officers to execute papers; and with its 
first application it shall also file a certified copy of its articles of 
incorporation, and, if foreign to the State in which the lands are 
located, evidence showing compliance with the corporation laws thereof. 
Statements of changes in officers and stockholders shall be furnished by 
a corporation lessee to the Area Director January 1 of each year, and at 
such other times as may be requested.
    Whenever deemed advisable in any case the Area Director may require 
a corporation applicant or lessee to file:

post office addresses and numbers of shares held by each.
    (b) A sworn statement of the proper officer showing:
    (1) The total number of shares of the capital stock actually issued 
and the amount of cash paid into the treasury on each share sold; or, if 
paid in property, the kind of quantity and value of the same paid per 
share.
    (2) Of the stock sold, how much remains unpaid and subject to 
assessment.
    (3) The amount of cash the company has in its treasury and 
elsewhere.

or under common control with the applicant has filed any registration 
statement, application for registration, prospectus or offering sheet 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities 
Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or said Commission's

said acts or rules and regulations; and what disposition of any such 
statement, application, prospectus or offering sheet has been made.
    (c) Affidavits of individual stockholders, setting forth in what 
corporations, or with what persons, firms, or associations such 
individual stockholders are interested in mining leases on restricted

Commission, see 17 CFR chapter II.


<R05>
Sec. 213.15  Bonds.

    (a) Lessee shall furnish with each mining lease a bond (Form 5-
154b), and an assignee of a lease shall furnish with each assignment a 
bond (Form 5-154m), with an acceptable company authorized to act as sole 
surety, or with two or more personal sureties and a deposit as 
collateral security of any public-debt obligations of the United States 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, equal to 
the full amount of such bonds, or other collateral satisfactory to the 
Secretary of the Interior, or show ownership of unencumbered real estate 
of the value equal to twice the amount of the bonds. Lessee may file a 
bond on Form 5-154a without sureties and a deposit as collateral 
security of Government bonds equal in value to the full amount of the 
bond. Lease bonds, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
shall not be less than the following amounts:

For less than 80 acres............................................$l,000
For 80 acres and less than 120 acres...............................1,500
For 120 acres and not more than 160 acres..........................2,000
For each additional 40 acres, or part thereof, above 160 acres.......500

    Provided, That for leases for minerals other than oil and gas the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative with the 
consent of the Indian landowner may authorize a bond for a lesser amount 
if, in his opinion, the circumstances warrant and the interests of the 
Indian landowners are fully protected: Provided further, That a lessee 
may file a bond (Form 5-154f), in the sum of $15,000 for all leases of 
minerals up to 10,240 acres under the jurisdiction of the officer in 
charge of the Five Civilized Tribe Agency.
    (b) In lieu of the bonds required under paragraph (a) of this 
section, a lessee may furnish a bond (Form 5-156) in the sum of $75,000 
for full nationwide coverage with an acceptable company

[[Page 680]]

authorized to act as sole surety to cover all oil and gas leases and oil 
and gas prospecting permits without geographic or acreage limitation to 
which the lessee or permittee is or may become a party.
    (c) The right is specifically reserved to increase the amount of 
bonds and the collateral security prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section in any particular case when the officer in charge deems it 
proper to do so. The nationwide bond may be increased at any time in the 
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.

<R05>
Sec. 213.16  Additional information may be requested by Area Director.

    The Area Director, or other Government officer having the matter in

approval of a lease, call for any additional information desired to 
carry out the purpose of the regulations in this part, and such 
information shall be furnished within the time specified in the request 
therefor. If the lessee fails to furnish the information requested, the 
lease will be subject to disapproval or cancellation, whichever is 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 213.17  Government reserves right to purchase minerals produced.

    In time of war or other public emergency any of the executive 
departments of the U.S. Government shall have the option to purchase at 
the prevailing market price on the date of sale all or any part of the 
minerals produced under any lease.

                           Rents and Royalties


<R05>
Sec. 213.18  Manner of payment of rents and royalties.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all rents, 
royalties and other payments due under leases which have been or may be 
approved in accordance with this part shall be paid by check or bank 
draft to the order of the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to 
the Area Director for deposit to the credit of the various lessors. When 
lessees and purchasers are instructed, in writing, by the Area Director, 
which instructions shall be complete as to lessors for each lease, 
separate remittances for each payment due each lessor shall be mailed to 
the Area Director. Any payments under this paragraph, covering lands or 
interests therein from which restrictions have been removed by death or 
otherwise, may continue to be made in the manner provided by this 
paragraph until ten days after notice of relinquishment of supervision 
has been mailed to the lessee.
    (b) The Area Director may, in his discretion, whenever it appears to 
be in the best interest of any lessor, authorize and direct the lessee 
to pay directly to the lessor, or to the legal guardian of any lessor 
under guardianship, the rents, royalties and other payments (other than 
bonuses and advance payments for the first year) due under leases which 
have been or may be approved in accordance with the regulations in this 
part. Any such authority for direct payment shall be in writing, 
addressed to the owner or owners of the lease, and shall expressly 
provide for its revocation or modification at any time, in writing, by 
the Area Director. Written authorization for direct payment and written 
revocations or modifications thereof shall become a part of the lease 
and shall be distributed as in the case of original leases. All such 
revocations or modifications shall have a 5-day grace period after date 
of receipt. Rents, royalties, and other payments paid in accordance 
therewith shall constitute full compliance with the requirements of the 
lease pertaining to such payments.
    (c) Rents and royalties paid pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section on producing leases shall be supported by statements, 
acceptable to the Secretary or his duly authorized representative, to be 
transmitted to the Supervisor, in duplicate, covering each lease, 
identified by contract number and lease number. Such statements shall 
show the specific items of rents or royalties for which remittances are 
made, and shall identify each remittance by the remittance number, date, 
amount, and name of each payee.
    (d) Rents paid on nonproducing leases pursuant to paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of

[[Page 681]]

this section shall be supported by a statement, acceptable to the Area 
Director, to be transmitted to the Area Director covering each lease, 
identified by contract number and lease number. Each remittance shall be 
identified by the remittance number, date, amount, name of each payee, 
and dates of mailing of remittances. Date of mailing, or, if remittance 
is sent by registered mail, the date of registration receipts covering 
remittances mailed, shall be considered as date of payment.
    (e) For leases other than oil and gas, all advance rentals and 
royalties for the first year shall be paid to the Area Director at the 
time of filing the lease, and the advance royalty and 20 percent of the 
first year's rental so paid shall be and become the property of the 
lessor, if the lease be disapproved because of the lessee's failure to 
meet the requirements of the law or of the regulations in this part or 
because of any other fault or defect chargeable to the lessee.


<R05>
Sec. 213.19  Crediting advance annual payments.

    In the event of discovery of minerals, all advance rents and advance 
royalties shall be allowed as credit on stipulated royalties for the 
year for which such advance payments have been made. No refund of such 
advance payments made under any lease will be allowed in the event the 
royalty on production is not sufficient to equal such advance payment; 
nor will any part of the moneys so paid be refunded to the lessee 
because of any subsequent surrender or cancellation of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 213.20  [Reserved]


<R05>

year, 75 cents per acre for the second year, and $1 per acre for the 
third and each succeeding year of the term of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 213.22  Expenditures under lease other than oil and gas.

    (a) On all leases for deposits of minerals other than oil and gas, 
there shall be expended for each calendar year the lease is in force, 
and for each fraction of a calendar year greater than 6 months, in 
actual mining operations, development, or improvements upon the lands 
leased, or for the benefit thereof, a sum which, with the annual rental, 
shall amount to not less than $5 per acre.
    (b) The expenditures for development required by this section upon 
application may be waived in writing by the Area Director or other 
officer in charge of the Five Civilized Tribes Agency either before or 
after the approval of a lease, such waiver to be subject to termination 
at any time upon 10 days' written notice to the holder of the lease by 
the said Area Director or other officer in charge.
    (c) Each lessee, except oil and gas lessees, shall file with the 
Area Director an itemized statement in duplicate, within 20 days after 
the close of each calendar year, of the amount and character of said 
expenditures during such years the statement to be certified under oath 
by the lessee or his agent having personal knowledge of the facts 
contained therein.


<R05>
Sec. 213.23  Royalty rates for minerals other than oil and gas.

    Unless otherwise authorized by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
the minimum rates for minerals other than oil and gas shall be as 
follows:
    (a) For substances other than gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, 
tungsten, coal, asphaltum and allied substances, oil, and gas, the 
lessee shall pay quarterly or as otherwise provided in the lease, a 
royalty of not less than 10 percent of the value, at the nearest 
shipping point, of all ores, metals, or minerals marketed.
    (b) For gold and silver the lessee shall pay quarterly or as 
otherwise provided in the lease, a royalty of not less than 10 percent 
to be computed on the value of bullion as shown by mint returns after 
deducting forwarding charges to the point of sale; and for copper, lead,

[[Page 682]]

computed on the value of ores and concentrates as shown by reduction 
returns after deducting freight charges to the point of sale. Duplicate 
returns shall be filed by the lessee with the Area Director within 10 
days after the ending of the quarter or other period specified in the 
lease within which such returns are made: Provided, however, That the 
lessee shall pay a royalty of not less than 10 percent of the value of 
the ore or concentrates sold at the mine unless otherwise provided in 
the lease.
    (c) For coal the lessee shall pay quarterly or as otherwise provided 
in the lease, a royalty of not less than 10 cents per ton of 2,000 
pounds of mine run, or coal as taken from the mine, including what is 
commonly called ``slack.''
    (d) For asphaltum and allied substances the lessee shall pay 
quarterly or as otherwise provided in the lease, a royalty of not less 
than 10 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds on crude material or not less than 
60 cents per ton on refined substances.


<R05>
Sec. 213.24  Rate of rents and royalties on oil and gas leases.

    The lessee shall pay, beginning with the date of approval of oil and 
gas leases by the Secretary of the Interior, a rental of $1.25 per acre 
per annum in advance during the continuance thereof, together with a 
royalty of 12\1/2\ percent of the value or amount of all oil, gas and/or 
natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and 
saved from the land leased, save and except oil and/or gas used by the 
lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease, which oil or 
gas shall be royalty free. A higher rate of royalty may be fixed by the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, prior to the 
advertisement of land for oil and gas leases. During the period of 
supervision, ``value'' for the purposes of the lease may, in the 
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior be calculated on the basis 
of the highest price paid or offered (whether calculated on the basis of 
short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion 
of the oil of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or 
all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold from the field where 
the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable 
product less the content of foreign substances as determined by the 
supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the sale of 
said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, 
be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of such value. When 
paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly at such 
time as the lease provides; when royalty on oil produced is paid in 
kind, such royalty oil shall be delivered in tanks provided by the 
lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless 
otherwise agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be 
required by the lessor. The lessee shall not be required to hold such 
royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar 
month in which said oil is produced. The lessee shall be in no manner 
responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil in 
storage by causes beyond his control.


<R05>
Sec. 213.25  Free use of gas by lessor.

    If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's 
requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then 
the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for all stoves and 
inside lights in the principal dwelling house on said premises, by 
making his own connections to a regulator, connected to the well and 
maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay 
royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's 
risk at all times.


<R05>
Sec. 213.26  Rate of royalty on casing-head gas.

    (a) On casing-head gas used or sold for the manufacture of casing-
head gasoline the minimum rate of royalty shall be 12\1/2\ percent of 
the value of the casing-head gas, which value shall be determined and 
computed on the basis and in the manner provided in the applicable 
operating regulations of the Department.
    (b) In cases where gas produced and sold has a value for drip 
gasoline, casing-head gasoline content, and as dry

[[Page 683]]

gas from which the casing-head gasoline has been extracted, then the 
royalties above provided shall be paid on all such values.


<R05>
Sec. 213.27  Rate of rental for nonutilized gas wells.

    If the gas from a gas producing well is not marketed or utilized, 
other than for operation of the lease, then for each such well the 
lessee shall pay such rental as may be determined by the supervisor and 
approved by the Secretary of the Interior, calculated from the date of 
the completion of the well. Payment of annual gas rentals shall be made 
within 30 days from the date such payment becomes due.


<R05>
Sec. 213.28  Royalty payments and production reports.

    (a) Royalty payments on all oil and gas or other producing leases 
shall be made at the rates, and at such time, and in the manner 
prescribed by the terms of the lease.
    (b) Quarterly reports shall be made by each lessee on nonproducing 
leases other than oil and gas within 25 days after December 31, March 
31, June 30, and September 30, of each year, upon forms provided, 
showing manner of operations and total production during such quarter. A 
lessee may include within one sworn statement all leases upon which 
there is no production or upon which dry holes have been drilled. 
Reports of oil and gas leases where royalty accounting is done in the 
field office of the supervisor will be made as required in the operating 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 213.29  Division orders.

    (a) Lessees may make arrangements with the purchasers of oil and gas 
for the payment of the royalties as provided for in the lease and the 
regulations but such arrangement, if made, shall not operate to relieve 
a lessee from responsibility should the purchaser fail or refuse to pay 
royalties when due. Where lessees avail themselves of this privilege, 
division orders should be executed by the lessee and forwarded to the 
supervisor for approval. Purchasers may be authorized by the supervisor 
to reimburse lessees out of royalties for advance rents and advance 
royalties. Copies of written instructions, notices, modifications, 
revocations, and authorizations, as provided for in Sec. 213.18 (a) and 
(b), shall be furnished to purchasers. The right is reserved for the 
supervisor to cancel a division order at any time or require the 
purchaser to discontinue to run the oil of any lessee who fails to 
operate the lease properly or otherwise violates the provisions of the 
lease, of the regulations in this part, or of the operating regulations.
    (b) When oil is taken by authority of a division order, the lessee 
or his representatives shall be actually present when the oil is gauged 
and records are made of the temperature, gravity, and impurities. The 
lessee will be held responsible for the correctness and the correct 
recording and reporting of all the foregoing measurements, which, except 
lowest gauge, shall be made at the time the oil is turned into the 
pipeline. Failure of the lessee to perform properly these duties will 
subject the division order to revocation.

                               Operations


<R05>
Sec. 213.30  Permission to start operations.

    No operations will be permitted on any lease before it is approved. 
Written permission must be secured from the supervisor before any 
operations are started under any oil and gas lease. Operations must be 
in accordance with the operating regulations promulgated by the 
Secretary of the Interior. Copies of these regulations may be secured 
from either the supervisor or the Area Director and no operations should 
be attempted without a study of the operating regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 213.31  Restrictions on operations.

    (a) Oil and gas leases issued under the provisions of this part 
shall be subject to imposition by the Secretary of the Interior of such 
restrictions as to time or times for the drilling of wells and as to the 
production from any well or wells as in his judgment may be necessary or 
proper for the protection of the natural resources of the leased land 
and in the interest of the lessor. In the exercise of his judgment the 
Secretary of the Interior may take into consideration, among other 
things, the Federal

[[Page 684]]

laws, State laws, regulations by competent Federal or State authorities, 
lawful agreements among operators regulating either drilling or 
production, or both.
    (b) All such leases shall be subject to any cooperative or unit plan 
of development affecting the leased lands that may be required by the 
Secretary of the Interior, but no lease shall be included in any 
cooperative or unit plan without prior approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior. If said plan effects a change in the lease terms, the consent 
of the lessor or lessors must be obtained before the plan is effective.


<R05>
Sec. 213.32  Wells.

    The lessee shall agree (a) to drill and produce all wells necessary 
to offset or protect the leased land from drainage by wells on adjoining 
lands not the property of the lessor, or in lieu thereof, compensate the 
lessor in full each month for the estimated loss of royalty through 
drainage: Provided, That during the period of supervision by the 
Secretary of the Interior, the necessity for offset wells shall be 
determined by the supervisor and payment in lieu of drilling and 
producing shall be with the consent of, and in an amount determined by 
the Secretary of the Interior; (b) at the election of the lessee to 
drill and produce other wells: Provided, That the right to drill and 
produce such other wells shall be subject to any system of well spacing 
or production allotments authorized and approved under applicable law or 
regulations, approved by the Secretary of the Interior and affecting the 
field or area in which the leased lands are situated; and (c) if the 
lessee elects not to drill and produce such other wells for any period 
the Secretary of the Interior may, within 10 days after due notice in 
writing, either require the drilling and production of such wells to the 
number necessary, in his opinion, to insure reasonable diligence in the 
development and operation of the property, or may in lieu of such 
additional diligent drilling and production require the payment on and 
after the first anniversary date of the lease of not to exceed $1 per 
acre per annum, which sum shalI be in addition to any rental or royalty 
herein specified.


<R05>
Sec. 213.33  Diligence and prevention of waste.

    The lessee shall exercise diligence in drilling and operating wells 
for oil and gas on the leased lands while such products can be secured 
in paying quantities; carry on all operations in a good and workmanlike 
manner in accordance with approved methods and practice, having due 
regard for the prevention of waste of oil or gas developed on the land, 
or the entrance of water through wells drilled by the lessee to the 
productive sands or oil or gas-bearing strata to the destruction or 
injury of the oil or gas deposits, the preservation and conservation of 
the property for future productive operations, and to the health and 
safety of workmen and employees; plug securely all wells before 
abandoning the same and to shut off effectually all water from the oil 
or gas-bearing strata; not drill any well within 200 feet of any house 
or barn on the premises without the lessor's written consent approved by 
the Area Director; carry out at his expense all reasonable orders and 
requirements of the supervisor relative to prevention of waste, and 
preservation of the property and the health and safety of workmen; bury 
all pipelines crossing tillable lands below plow depth unless other 
arrangements therefor are made with the Area Director; pay the lessor 
all damages to crops, buildings, and other improvements of the lessor 
occasioned by the lessee's operations: Provided, That the lessee shall 
not be held responsible for delays or casualties occasioned by causes 
beyond his control.


<R05>
Sec. 213.34  Inspection of premises; books and accounts.

    Lessees shall agree to allow the lessors and their agents or any 
authorized representative of the Interior Department to enter, from time 
to time, upon and into all parts of the leased premises for the purpose 
of inspection, and shall further agree to keep a full and correct 
account of all operations and make reports thereof, as required by the 
applicable regulations of the Department; and their books and records, 
showing manner of operations and persons interested, shall be open at 
all times for examination by such officers

[[Page 685]]

of the Department as shall be instructed in writing by the Secretary of 
the Interior or authorized by regulations to make such examination.


<R05>
Sec. 213.35  Mines to be timbered properly.

    In mining operations the lessee shall keep the mine well and 
sufficiently timbered at all points where necessary, in accordance with 
good mining practice, and in such manner as may be necessary to the 
proper preservation of the property leased and safety of workmen.


<R05>
Sec. 213.36  Surrender of leased premises in good condition.

    On expiration of the term of a lease, or when a lease is 
surrendered, the lessee shall deliver to the Government the leased 
ground, with the mine workings in case of leases other than oil and gas, 
in good order and condition, and the bondsmen will be held for such 
delivery in good order and condition, unless relieved by the Secretary 
of the Interior for cause. It shall, however, be stipulated that the 
machinery necessary to operate any mine is the property of the lessee, 
but that it may be removed by him only after the condition of the 
property has been ascertained by inspection by the Secretary of the 
Interior or his authorized agents, to be in satisfactory condition.


<R05>
Sec. 213.37  Penalties.

    Failure of the lessee to comply with any provisions of the lease, of 
the operating regulations, of the regulations in this part, orders of 
the Area Director or his representative, or of the orders of the 
supervisor or his representative, shall subject the lease to 
cancellation by the Secretary of the Interior or the lessee to a penalty 
of not more than $500 per day for each day the terms of the lease, the 
regulations, or such orders are violated, or to both such penalty and 
cancellation: Provided, That the lessee shall be entitled to notice and 
hearing, within 30 days after such notice, with respect to the terms of 
the lease, regulations, or orders violated, which hearing shall be held 
by the supervisor, whose findings shall be conclusive unless an appeal 
be taken to the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days after notice of 
the supervisor's decision, and the decision of the Secretary of the 
Interior upon appeal shall be conclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 213.38  Assignments and overriding royalties.

    (a) Leases or any interest therein, may be assigned or transferred 
only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and to procure 
such approval the assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under

for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof. No 
lease or any interest therein, or the use of such lease, shall be 
assigned, sublet, or transferred, directly or indirectly, by working or 
drilling contract, or otherwise, without the consent of the Secretary of 
the Interior. Assignments of leases shall be filed with the Area 
Director within 20 days after the date of execution.
    (b) An agreement creating overriding royalties or payments out of 
production on oil and gas leases under this part shall be subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 211.26(d) of this subchapter, or as hereafter 
amended.

Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 213.39  Stipulations.

regulations currently in use. Stipulations shall be filed with the Area 
Director within 20 days after the date of execution.


<R05>
Sec. 213.40  Cancellations.

    (a) When, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior, the 
lessee has violated any of the terms and conditions of a lease or of the 
applicable regulations, or if mining operations are conducted wastefully 
and without regard to good mining practice, the Secretary of the 
Interior shall have the right at any time after 30 days' notice to the 
lessee specifying the terms and

[[Page 686]]

conditions violated, and after a hearing, if the lessee shall so request

                         Removal of Restrictions


<R05>
Sec. 213.41  Leases executed but not approved before restrictions removed from land.

    Leases executed before the removal of restrictions against 
alienation on land from all of which restrictions against alienation 
shall be removed after such execution, if such leases contain specific 
provisions for approval by the Secretary of the Interior, whether now 
filed with the Department or presented for consideration hereafter, will 
be considered and acted upon by this Department as heretofore but only 
for the purpose of approving or disapproving the instrument.


<R05>
Sec. 213.42  Operations after removal of restrictions from leased lands.

    (a) Oil and gas leases heretofore approved and leases for other 
minerals now or hereafter in force on land from all of which 
restrictions against alienation have been or shall be removed, even if 
such leases contain provision authorizing supervision by this 
Department, shall after such removal of restrictions against alienation, 
be operated entirely free from such supervision, and the authority and 
power delegated to the Secretary of the Interior in said leases shall 
cease and all payments required to be made to the Area Director shall 
thereafter be made to the lessor or the then owner of the land, and 
changes in regulations thereafter made by the Secretary of the Interior 
shall not apply to such leased

[[Page 687]]

land from which said restrictions are removed.
    (b) In the event restrictions are removed from a part of the land 
included in any lease to which this section applies the entire lease 
shall continue subject to the supervision of the Secretary of the 
Interior, and all royalties thereunder shall be paid to the Area 
Director until such time as the lessor and lessee shall furnish the 
Secretary of the Interior satisfactory information that adequate 
arrangements have been made to account for the oil, gas or mineral upon 
the restricted land separately from that upon the unrestricted. 
Thereafter the restricted land only shall be subject to the supervision 
of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That the unrestricted 
portion shall be relieved from such supervision as in the lease or 
regulations provided.


<R05>
Sec. 213.43  Relinquishment of Government supervision.

    All oil and gas leases hereafter executed shall contain the 
following relinquishment of supervision clause and terms operative after 
such relinquishment, or other provisions similar in substance:

    Relinquishment of supervision by the Secretary of the Interior.--
Should the Secretary of the Interior, at any time during the life of 
this instrument, relinquish supervision as to all or part of the acreage 
covered hereby, such relinquishment shall not bind lessee until said 
Secretary shall have given 30 days' written notice. Until said 
requirements are fulfilled, lessee shall continue to make all payments 
due hereunder as heretofore in section 3(c). After notice of 
relinquishment has been received by lessee, as herein provided this 
lease shall be subject to the following further conditions:
    (a) All rentals and royalties thereafter accruing shall be paid in 
the following manner: Rentals and royalties shall be paid to lessor or 
his successors in title, or to a trustee appointed under the provision 
of section 9 hereof. Rentals and royalties shall be paid directly to 
lessor, his successors in title, or to said trustee as the case may be.
    (b) If, at the time supervision is relinquished by the Secretary of 
the Interior, lessee shall have made all payments then due hereunder, 
and shall have fully performed all obligations on its part to be 
performed up to the time of such relinquishment, then the bond given to 
secure the performance hereof, on file in the Indian Office, shall be of 
no further force or effect.
    (c) Should such relinquishment affect only part of the acreage, then 
lessee may continue to drill and operate the land covered hereby as an 
entirety: Provided, That lessee shall pay in the manner prescribed by 
section 3(c), for the benefit of lessor such proportion of all rentals 
and royalties due hereunder as the acreage retained under the 
supervision of the Secretary of the Interior bears to the entire acreage 
of the lease, the remainder of such rentals and royalties to be paid 
directly to lessor or his successors in title or said trustee as the 
case may be, as provided in subdivision (a) of this section.
    Division of fee. It is covenanted and agreed that should the fee of 
said land be divided into separate parcels, held by different owners, or 
should the rental or royalty interests hereunder be so divided in 
ownership, after the execution of this lease and after the Secretary of 
the Interior relinquishes supervision hereof, the obligations of lessee 
hereunder shall not be added to or changed in any manner whatsoever save 
as specifically provided by the terms of this lease. Notwithstanding 
such separate ownership, lessee may continue to drill and operate said 
premises as an entirety: Provided, That each separate owner shall 
receive such proportion of all rentals and royalties accruing after the 
vesting of his title as the acreage of the fee, or rental or royalty 
interest, bears to the entire acreage covered by the lease; or to the 
entire rental and royalty interest as the case may be: Provided further, 
That, if, at any time after departmental supervision hereof is 
relinquished, in whole or in part, there shall be four or more parties 
entitled to rentals or royalties hereunder, whether said parties are so 
entitled by virtue of undivided interests or by virtue of ownership of 
separate parcels of the land covered hereby, lessee at his election may 
withhold the payment of further rentals or royalties (except as to the 
portion due the Indian lessor while under restriction), until all of 
said parties shall agree upon and designate in writing and in a 
recordable instrument a trustee to receive all payments due hereunder on 
behalf of said parties and their respective successors in title. 
Payments to said trustee shall constitute lawful payments hereunder, and 
the sole risk of an improper or unlawful distribution of said funds by 
said trustee shall rest upon the parties naming said trustee and their 
respective successors in title. (The above provisions are copied from 
oil and gas mining lease Form 5-154h, \1\ revised April 24, 1935.)

<R05>
Sec. 213.44  Division of royalty to separate fee owners.

    Should the removal of restrictions affect only part of the acreage 
covered by a lease containing provisions to the effect that the 
royalties accruing under the lease, where the fee is divided into 
separate parcels, shall be paid to each owner in the proportion which 
his acreage bears to the entire acreage covered by the lease, the lessee 
or assignee of such unrestricted portion will be required to make the 
reports required by the regulations in this part and the operating 
regulations with respect to the beginning of drilling operations, 
completion of wells, and production the same as if the restrictions had 
not been removed. In the event the unrestricted portion of the leased 
premises is producing, the owner of the lease thereon will be required 
to pay the portion of the royalties due the Indian lessor at the time 
and in the manner specified by the regulations in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 213.45  Restrictions especially continued as to certain lands.

    Restricted lands allotted as either homestead or surplus allotments, 
designated as tax exempt under section 4 of the act of May 10, 1928, as 
amended May 24, 1928 (45 Stat. 495, 733), the entire interest in which 
was acquired by inheritance, gift, devise, or purchase with restricted 
funds, by persons of one-half or more Indian blood, after the passage of 
the act of January 27, 1933 (47 Stat. 777), continue to be restricted 
under the provisions of the last mentioned act and oil and gas leases 
thereof are subject to the regulations in this part and all such leases 
to be valid must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Lands 
inherited by or devised to full blood Indians prior to the act of 
January 27, 1933, are not affected as to restrictions by the provisions 
of said act and may continue to be leased with the approval of the 
county court having jurisdiction of the estate of the deceased allottee 
and without approval of the Secretary of the Interior (54 L.D. 382; 10 
F. (2d), 487). Lands acquired prior to the passage of the act of January 
27, 1933 by Indians of less than full blood, whether such lands were 
restricted and tax exempt or restricted and taxable, passed to such 
persons free of all restrictions. Inherited homesteads restricted prior 
to April 26, 1931, by section 9, \2\ of the act of May 27, 1908 (35 
Stat. 312), for the benefit of heirs of one-half or more Indian blood 
but less than full bloods, born after March 4, 1906, became unrestricted 
April 26, 1931, or upon the death prior thereto of the heir born 
subsequent to March 4, 1906, and oil and gas leases thereof are not 
subject to the regulations in this part nor under the jurisdiction of 
the Secretary of the Interior.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Repealed restrictions on inherited homesteads, by sec. 2 of the 
act of May 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 495).

Sec. 213.46  Field clerks.

    Local representatives known officially as ``field clerks'' are 
located in the various districts comprising that part of the State of 
Oklahoma occupied by the Five Civilized Tribes. Such field clerks shall 
report to and act under the direction of the Area Director. Any and all 
counsel and advice desired by allottees concerning deeds, leases, or 
other instruments or matters relating to lands allotted to them shall be 
furnished by such field clerks free of charge. Field clerks shall not, 
during their term of employment, have any personal interest, directly or 
indirectly, in any transaction concerning leases covering lands of 
allottees or in the purchase or sale of any such lands regardless of 
whether the restrictions have or have not been removed. This 
prohibition, however, shall not apply to lands which such field clerks 
have legally acquired before their employment in the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs. Field clerks shall report to the Area Director at the end of 
each month the work performed during such period and special reports 
shall be made immediately of any apparently illegal transaction 
involving the estates or allotments of allottees.

former regulations governing the leasing of individually owned lands of 
the Five Civilized Tribes for mining purposes are superseded by the 
regulations in this part.

Sec. 214.1  Definition.

    The term ``officer in charge'' shall refer to the superintendent of 
the Osage Indian Agency and school or other representative of the 
Government who may, for the time, be in charge of the Osage Agency and

<R05>
Sec. 214.2  Sale of leases.

    Leases of minerals other than oil and gas may be negotiated with the

the officer in charge within 30 days from the date of execution by the 
lessee and the principal chief of the Osage Tribe. The lease will be 
forwarded to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for consideration by him 
and the Secretary of the Interior and will become effective only after 
approval by the Secretary of the Interior. If any lease should be 
disapproved through no fault of the lessee, all amounts deposited by him 
will be promptly refunded.


<R05>
Sec. 214.3  Corporate information.

    A corporation shall file with its first lease a certified copy of 
articles of incorporation, and, if a foreign corporation, evidence 
showing compliance with local corporation laws in duplicate; a list of 
all stockholders, with their post office addresses, and showing the 
number of shares of capital stock held by each; together with a sworn 
statement of its proper officer showing:
    (a) The total number of shares of the capital stock actually issued, 
the number of shares actually sold and the amount of cash paid into the 
treasury

[[Page 690]]

out of the stock sold, or, if paid in property, kind, quantity, and 
value of the same.
    (b) Of the stock sold, how much per share remains unpaid and subject

For 120 acres and not more than 160 acres..........................2,000
For each additional 40 acres, or part thereof above 160 acres........500

    Provided, That for leases for minerals other than oil and gas the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representatives with the 
consent of the Indian landowner may authorize a bond for a lesser amount 
if, in his opinion, the circumstances warrant and the interests of the 
Indian landowners are fully protected: Provided further, That the lessee 
shall be allowed to file bond, Form S \1\ covering all leases to which 
he or they are or may become parties instead of a separate bond in each 
case, such bond to be in the penal sum of $15,000. The right is reserved 
to change the amount of the bond in any particular case, or to require a 
new bond in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.

[26 FR 164, Jan. 10, 1961. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 214.5  Additional information.

    The officer in charge may, at any time, either before or after 
approval of a lease call for any additional information necessary to 
carry out the purpose and intent of the regulations in this part, and 
such information shall be furnished within the time specified in the 
request therefor.


<R05>
Sec. 214.6  Failure of lessee to complete lease.

    Should a lessee fail to furnish, within the time specified after his 
bid is accepted, the papers necessary to put his lease and bond in 
proper form for consideration, the officer in charge shall recommend 
that the sale be disapproved and money paid forfeited to the Osage 
Tribe.


<R05>
Sec. 214.7  Operation not permitted until lease approved; 160 acres maximum for single lease.

    No mining or work of any nature will be permitted upon any tract of 
land until a lease covering such tract shall have been approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior and delivered to the lessee. All leases shall 
be made for such period as the title to the minerals remain in the Osage 
Tribe, which time will expire April 8, 1931, unless otherwise provided 
by Congress and shall be subject to cancellation or termination as 
specified in this part. Leases made by corporations shall be accompanied 
by an affidavit by the secretary or president of the company showing the 
authority of its officers to execute leases, bonds, and other papers. No 
lease shall be made covering more than 160 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 214.8  Acreage limitation.

    No person, firm, or corporation shall hold under lease at any one 
time without special permission from the Secretary of the Interior in 
excess of the following areas:
    (a) For deposits of the nature of lodes, or veins containing ores of 
gold, silver, copper, or other useful metals, 640 acres.
    (b) For beds of placer gold, gypsum, asphaltum, phosphate, iron 
ores, and other useful minerals, other than coal, lead, and zinc, 960 
acres.
    (c) For coal, 4,800 acres.
    (d) For lead and zinc, 1,280 acres.


<R05>
Sec. 214.9  Advance rental.

    (a) Lessees shall pay, in addition to other considerations, annual 
advance rentals as follows: 15 cents per acre for

[[Page 691]]

the first year; 30 cents per acre for the second year; 50 cents per acre 
for the third year; and $1 per acre per annum for the fourth and each 
succeeding year during the life of any lease: Provided, That all such 
payments of advance rentals shall be credits on royalties on production 
during the year for which payment of advance rental is made.
    (b) The payment of annual advance rental shall not release the 
lessee from the obligation to conduct mining operations, as required by 
the terms of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 214.10  Royalty rates.

    Royalties will be required as follows, subject to the approval of 
the President, in accordance with the act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 
543):
    (a) For gold, silver, or copper lessee shall pay quarterly a royalty 
of 10 percent to be computed on the gross value of the ores as shown by 
reduction returns after deducting freight and treatment charges. 
Duplicate reduction returns shall be filed by the lessee with the 
officer in charge within 20 days after the reduction of the ores.
    (b) For coal the lessee shall pay a royalty of 10 cents per ton of 
2,000 pounds on mine run or coal as taken from the mines, including what 
is commonly called ``slack.''
    (c) For asphaltum and allied substances, the lessee shall pay 
quarterly a royalty of 10 cents per ton of 2,000 pounds on crude 
material, and 60 cents per ton on refined substances.
    (d) For substances other than gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, 
coal, and asphaltum the lessee shall pay quarterly a royalty of 10 
percent of the value at the nearest shipping point of all ores, metals, 
or minerals marketed.
    (e) The royalties to be paid for lead and zinc shall be computed for 
each mineral at the same rate that the amount of the concentrates of 
such mineral bears to the total amount of dirt or rock actually mined, 
except as stipulated in this section. The royalty so determined shall be 
increased by adding 1 percent for each increase of $10 in the selling 
price per ton thereof over and above the following, which shall be the 
agreed base or standard:

For zinc--$50
For lead--$65


but in no case shall the rate of royalty be less than 5 percent or more 
than 20 percent. The percentage of recovery shall be computed as nearly 
as practicable upon the ore included in each sale, but where it is 
impracticable so to do the officer in charge and the lessee shall agree 
upon some other method of computation which will produce substantially 
the same result: Provided, That in case of their disagreement the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall prescribe a rule of computation to 
be followed in such cases.

    Note: The royalty would always be determined under this rule by 
ascertaining the percentage of recovery were it not for two things: (1) 
the flat rates which are fixed as the minimum and the maximum rates of 
royalty and (2) variations in the selling price of the ores. Concrete 
examples coming under the rule are set forth in the following table:

                                  Zinc
               [Where the base or standard is $50 per ton]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Percentage of recovery       Selling price          Royalty (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
           7                      $48                        7
          14                       49                       14
          12                       50                       12
          15                       60                       16
          30                       60                       20
           9                       70                       11
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A similar table might be constructed for royalties on lead, but in so 
doing it would be necessary to bear in mind that the base or standard 
selling price for the lead is to be $65 instead of $50.


<R05>
Sec. 214.11  Payment of rents and royalties.

    All rentals, royalties, damages, or other amounts which may become 
due under leases approved in accordance with the regulations in this 
part shall be paid to the disbursing agent at Pawhuska, Okla. The 
remittances shall be in St. Louis exchange, except that where such 
exchanges cannot be procured post office or express money orders will be 
accepted. All royalties or other payments or claims of the Osage Tribe 
arising under such leases shall be a lien upon the mining plant 
machinery, and all minerals mined on the property leased or in which the 
lessee still retains any right, claim, or interest.

[[Page 692]]


<R05>
Sec. 214.12  Time of payment of royalties.

    Royalties on all minerals produced in any quarter (January-March, 
April-June, July-September, October-December) shall be paid on or before 
the 25th day of the month next succeeding, and the remittance shaIl be 
accompanied by sworn reports covering all operations, whether there has 
been production or not. Annual advance rentals shall be paid within 10 
days after the beginning of the lease year.


<R05>
Sec. 214.13  Diligence; annual expenditures; mining records.

    (a) Lessees shall exercise diligence in the conduct of prospecting 
and mining operations, and on all leases referred to in Sec. 214.8(a) 
shall expend annually in development work a sum which with the annual 
rental shall make an amount of not less than $5 per acre. On all leases 
referred to in Sec. 214.8 (b) and (c) there shall be expended annually 
in development work a sum which inclusive of the annual rental shall 
make an amount of not less than $1 for each acre or fraction thereof 
included in the lease. The lands covered by each lease referred to in 
Sec. 214.8 (d) shall be prospected for lead and zinc ores by drilling 
within 1 year test holes aggregating 2,000 feet unless a sufficient ore 
body is discovered to justify the sinking of a shaft to the ore body and 
the erecting of a mill when such tract may be released from further 
prospecting by the written consent of the superintendent: Provided, That 
within 90 days after an ore body of sufficient quantity is discovered, 
and shown by the logs or records of the drill holes, to justify the 
expenditure, the sinking of a shaft to the ore body, and the erection of 
a mill shall be commenced and continued to completion without cessation 
of work thereon, barring unavoidable accidents or causes beyond the 
control of the lessee.
    (b) Lessee shall keep upon the leased premises accurate records of 
the drilling, redrilling, or deepening of all holes showing the 
formations, and upon the completion of such holes, copies of such 
records shall be transmitted to the superintendent by the lessee after 
the first completion and of any further drilling thereafter, and a 
failure to so furnish report within the time prescribed shall be 
considered a violation of the regulations. Lessee shall, before 
commencing operations, file with the superintendent a plat and 
preliminary statement of how the openings are to be made and the 
property developed.


<R05>
Sec. 214.14  Use of surface lands.

    (a) Lessees may use so much of the surface of the leased land as 
shall be reasonably necessary for the prospecting and mining operations 
and buildings required by the lease, and shall also have the right-of-
way over and across such land to any point of prospecting or mining 
operations, but such use of the surface shall be permissible only under 
condition of least injury and inconvenience to the allottee or owner of 
the land. Lessees before commencing and during such operations shall pay 
all reasonable damages for the use of the surface land and to any 
growing crops thereon, or to improvements on said land, or any damage 
that during the life of the lease may be occasioned in any manner 
whatsoever by the use of the surface, to the allottee or his successor 
in interest or assignee, or to a lessee of the surface of said land or 
to an oil and gas lessee, damages to be apportioned among the parties 
interested in the surface, whether as owner, lessee, or otherwise, as 
the parties in interest may mutually agree or as their interests may 
appear. If the parties are unable to agree concerning damages the same 
shall be determined by arbitration.
    (b) All agreements (or authenticated copies thereof) providing for 
the settlement of damages shall be filed in the Osage Agency if the 
surface owner is a restricted Indian, and all such amounts which may be 
due and payable to any such Indian shall be paid to the superintendent 
and by him immediately remitted to the Indian entitled thereto. All sums 
due as royalty or damages shall be a lien on all equipment on leased 
premises.


<R05>
Sec. 214.15  Homesteads.

    Lessees and those acting under them shall not conduct prospecting or 
mining operations within or upon any homestead selection without written

[[Page 693]]

consent of the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 214.16  Settlement of damages.

    Any person, other than a lessee or an allottee or the heirs of a 
deceased allottee, claiming an interest in any leased tract or in 
damages thereto must furnish to the officer in charge a statment in 
writing showing his interest, and failure to furnish such statement 
shall constitute a waiver of notice and estop said person from claiming 
any part of such damages after the same shall have been disbursed.


<R05>
Sec. 214.17  Use of timber from restricted lands.

    Lessees will not be permitted to use any timber from any Osage lands 
not relieved of restrictions upon alienation except under written 
agreement with the owner approved by the officer in charge.


<R05>
Sec. 214.18  Assignments.

    Approved leases or any interest therein may be transferred or 
assigned with the consent and approval of the Secretary of the Interior 
and not otherwise. Transfers or assignments, when so approved, shall be 
subject to the terms and conditions of the original leases and 
regulations under which such leases were approved as well as to such 
additional requirements as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe. 
The transferee or assignee shall furnish with his transfer or assignment 
a satisfactory bond as prescribed in Sec. 214.4 in connection with 
leases. Any attempt to transfer or assign an approved lease or any 
interest therein without the consent and approval of the Secretary of 
the Interior shall be absolutely void and shall subject the original 
lease to cancellation in the discretion of the secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 214.19  Cancellation.

    When a lessee makes application for the cancellation of a lease in 
whole or in part, all royalties or rentals due up to and including the 
date of the application for cancellation must be paid, and that part of 
the lease delivered to the lessee shall be surrendered before such 
application will be considered. In the event a lease is surrendered for 
cancellation in whole or in part, after a new lease year has been 
entered upon, the lessee and his surety shall be liable for the advance 
rentals required to be paid under the lease for that year, and no part 
of such rentals which may have been paid shall be refunded.


<R05>
Sec. 214.20  Annual reports by corporate lessees.

    Lessees and assignees must submit to the officer in charge on 
January 1, of each year and at such other times as may be required by 
the Secretary of the Interior, a statement containing the information 
called for in Sec. 214.3(a) and (f) and also showing any changes in 
officers or changes in or additions to stockholders. At any time 
individual stockholders may be required to show to the satisfaction of 
the Secretary of the Interior in what companies or with what persons or 
firms they are interested in mining leases on the Osage Reservation and 
whether they hold such stock or interest for themselves or in trust.


<R05>
Sec. 214.21  Inspection of lessees' books and records.

    Lessees shall allow the agents and representatives of the lessor, or 
any authorized representative of the Interior Department, to enter, from

purpose of inspection, and their books and records showing manner of 
operations and persons interested, shall be open at all times for the 
examination of such officers of the department as shall be instructed by 
the Secretary of the Interior to make such examinations.


<R05>
Sec. 214.22  Serving of notices.

    Wherever notice is provided for in this part it shall be sufficient 
if notice has been mailed to the last known place of address of the

mailing or from the date of delivery of personal notice; but where the 
party is outside the State of Oklahoma the officer in charge may, in his 
discretion, increase the time allowed.

[[Page 694]]


<R05>

regulation or any obligation in the lease or assignment, the Secretary 
of the Interior may cancel and annul such lease without resorting to the 
courts and without any further proceeding: Provided, That the party or 
parties charged with such violation shall be first given not less than 
30 days' notice to show cause why such lease should not be canceled and 
annulled or other order made with reference thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 214.26  Fine; notice and hearing.

    Violation of any of the terms or conditions of any lease or of the 
regulations pertaining thereto shall subject the lease to cancellation 
by the Secretary of the Interior, or the lessee to a fine of not 
exceeding $500 per day for each and every day the terms of the lease or 
of the regulations are violated, or the orders of the superintendent in 
reference thereto are not complied with, or to both such fine and 
cancellation in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior: 
Provided, That the lessee shall be entitled to notice and hearing with 
respect to the terms of the lease or of the regulations violated, which 
hearing shall be held by the superintendent, whose findings shall be 
conclusive unless an appeal be taken to the Secretary of the Interior 
within 30 days after notice of the superintendent's decision, and the 
decision of the Secretary of the Interior upon appeal shall be 
conclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 214.27  Changes in regulations.

    The regulations in this part are subject to change or alteration at 
any time by the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 214.28  Location of sites for mines and buildings.

    In event of disagreement between two or more mineral lessees 
regarding sites for the location of wells, mines, buildings, plants, 
etc., the same shall be determined by the superintendent after 
investigation and after due consideration of prior right of any lessee 
by reason of date of approval of lease.


<R05>
Sec. 214.29  Prospecting; abandonment of mines.

    All prospecting or mining operations or the abandonment of a well or 
mine shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, and any 
disagreement between lessees of mineral leases regarding operations 
likely to result in injury to either lessee shall be determined by the 
superintendent, whose decision shall be final, unless an appeal is filed 
with the Secretary of the Interior within 30 days after notice of such 
decision.


<R05>
Sec. 214.30  Lessees must appoint local representative.

    Before actual drilling or development operations are commenced on 
leased lands, the lessee or assignee shall appoint a local or resident 
representative within the State, on whom the superintendent or other

Sec. 215.0  Definitions.

    The following expressions, wherever used in the regulations in this 
part or leases thereunder, shall have the meaning designated in this 
section:
    (a) Superintendent. The term ``superintendent'' shall mean any 
person in charge of the Quapaw Indian Agency, or having supervision 
under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior of the Indian

as an heir or devisee.
    (c) Incompetent Indian. The term ``incompetent Indian'' or 
``incompetent'' shall mean any Indian who has been declared by the 
Secretary of the Interior to be incompetent to improve or manage his 
restricted or trust lands properly or with benefit to himself. The term 
shall also include any Indian who is a minor and any Indian who is a 
legal incompetent under the laws of the State. The term shall also apply 
to any Indian who is in fact incompetent, and the question of whether an 
Indian is competent or incompetent at the time of making a lease of his 
restricted or trust Indian lands is one for the Secretary of the 
Interior to determine.
    (d) Lessee. The term ``lessee,'' except where otherwise modified or 
limited in the regulations in this part, shall mean any person, firm, or 
corporation, their legal representatives, heirs, or assigns, to whom a 
lead and zinc mining lease has been made by or on behalf of Indians 
under the provisions of the regulations in this part.
    (e) Lessor. The term ``lessor,'' except where otherwise modified or 
limited in the regulations in this part, shall mean any Indian owning or 
having any interest in restricted or trust allotted any inherited lands 
under the supervision of the Quapaw Indian Agency, by or for whom a

or ``leased tract'' shall mean any leased restricted or trust lands 
within and under jurisdiction of the Quapaw Indian Agency allotted to or 
inherited by an Indian.
    (g) Mining operations. The term ``mining operation'' or 
``operations,'' except where otherwise modified or limited in the 
regulations in this part or in leases thereunder shall mean actual 
drilling, mining, or construction on the leased lands.


<R05>
Sec. 215.1  No operations until lease approved.

    No operations under any lease executed under the regulations in this 
part shall be permitted upon any restricted or trust lands allotted to 
or inherited by an Indian until such lease covering such tract shall be 
approved by the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 215.2  Local representative of lessee.

    Before actual drilling or development operations are commenced on 
the leased lands the lessee shall appoint a local or resident 
representative within Ottawa County, Oklahoma, on whom the 
superintendent may serve notice or

[[Page 696]]

otherwise communicate with in securing compliance with the regulations, 
and shall notify the superintendent of the name and post office address 
of the representative so appointed. In the event of the incapacity or 
absence from the county of Ottawa of such designated local or resident 
representative, the lessee shall appoint some person to serve in his 
stead, and in the absence of such representative or of notice of the 
appointment of a substitute any employee of the lessee upon the leased 
premises, or the contractor, or other person in charge of mining 
operations thereon shall be considered the representative of the lessee 
for the purpose of service of orders or notices as provided in this 
part, and service upon any employee, contractor, or other person shall 
be deemed service on the lessee. Wherever a notice is provided for in 
the regulations in this part or in the lease from it shall be deemed 
sufficient if notice has been mailed to the last known address of the 
lessee or his local or resident representatives, and time shall begin to 
run with the day next ensuing after the mailing, or from date of 
delivery of personal notice.


<R05>
Sec. 215.3  Manner and time of royalty payments.

    All royalties belonging to the lessor shall be paid to the 
superintendent of the Quapaw Agency at Miami, Okla., or such other 
official as the Secretary of the Interior may designate, for the benefit 
of the lessor, not later than 15 days from the 1st of each month for ore 
and concentrates sold during the preceding month.


<R05>
Sec. 215.4  Leases to be sold at public auction.

    Except as otherwise provided in the regulations in this part, no 
lead and zinc mining lease under this part of restricted or trust 
allotted and inherited Indian lands within and under the Quapaw Indian 
Agency shall be made except to the highest responsible bidder at public 
auction.


<R05>
Sec. 215.5  Royalty rates.

    (a) In leases offered for sale at public auction under the 
regulations in this part the royalty to be paid by the lessee shall be 
stipulated at a fixed percent of the gross proceeds of all lead and zinc 
ores and concentrates extracted from the leased premises, the royalty to 
be computed and based upon each sale of ore or concentrates separately, 
the rate of royalty to be determined and fixed by the Secretary of the 
Interior in the case of each lease prior to the offering of such lease 
for sale. Subject to the right of the Secretary of the Interior to 
reject any and all bids, leases offered for sale at public auction shall 
be awarded in each case to the responsible bidder submitting the highest 
bonus offer.
    (b) In leases not offered for sale at public auction but otherwise 
made and entered into under the provisions of the regulations in this 
part the royalty stipulated and fixed therein shall be such as may be 
determined by the Secretary of the Interior or as may be agreed upon in 
each case, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
    (c) It shall be further provided, however, that said sale-price 
basis for the determination of the rates and amount of royalty shall not 
be less than the highest and best obtainable market price of the lead 
and zinc ores and concentrates at the usual and customary place of 
disposing of such ores and concentrates at the time of sale: Provided, 
however, That the right is reserved to the Secretary of the Interior to 
determine and declare such market price if it is deemed necessary for 
him to do so for the protection of the interests of the Indian lessor: 
And provided further, That the right is reserved to the Secretary of the 
Interior on behalf of the Indian lessors to reserve at any time it shall 
be deemed to be to the best interests of the Indian lessors and upon due 
notice to the lessee, the royalty share of the gross production of the 
ore and concentrates and upon such notice that the royalty share of such 
production shall be stored and not sold, the lessee shall be required to 
store, free of charge to the Indian lessors in the ore bins of said 
lessee, said royalty shares of the gross production of ore and 
concentrates, provided that the lessee may not be required to store ore 
or concentrates for the lessor in amounts

[[Page 697]]

greater than one-third of his bin capacity or for a period longer than 6 
months.


<R05>
Sec. 215.6  Applications for leases; consent of Indian owners.

    (a) Applications or requests by the Indian owners of restricted or 
trust land, or by others, that such land be leased or offered for lease 
for lead and zinc mining purposes should be addressed to the Secretary 
of the Interior and submitted through the superintendent of the Quapaw 
Indian Agency. Upon receipt of such applications or requests, the 
superintendent shall give consideration thereto and forward the same to 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with his report and recommendation.
    (b) In no instance will a new lease be executed and delivered (or 
advertised for sale to the highest bidder) unless the Indian owner 
thereof, if an adult who has not been specifically found by the 
Secretary of the Interior to be personally incompetent to transact 
ordinary business affairs, has agreed to the terms of said lease or the 
terms under which said lease is advertised for lease, except in cases 
where the land is owned by several co-tenants, and, in such cases, no 
such lease shall be given or advertised for sale unless the co-owners or 
a majority in interest, if adults, and not specifically declared 
incompetent, have first consented thereto: Provided, That in the event 
the majority in interest is owned by minors, or adults specifically 
found to be incompetent, then and in that event, the Secretary of the 
Interior reserves the right to lease the entire tract if, in his 
opinion, such leasing will inure to the best interest of the restricted 
Indian owners.


<R05>
Sec. 215.7  Advertisement of sale of leases.

    Upon authority being granted by the Secretary of the Interior to the 
superintendent to offer for sale at public auction a lead and zinc 
mining lease of any tract or tracts of restricted or trust allotted and 
inherited Indian lands, the superintendent shall cause a notice to be 
published once a week for at least 4 weeks in some designated newspaper 
of general circulation in the county in which the land is located, 
setting forth that upon a certain day, which shall be not less than 30 
days from the first publication of such notice and at a place to be 
named in the notice, the superintendent or other duly authorized 
representatives of the Secretary of the Interior will offer for sale at 
public auction a lead and zinc mining lease of such lands to the highest 
and best bidder, subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of the Interior, notice to be in such form as may be 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 215.8  Submission of bids.

    At the time of public auction bidders may submit their bids in 
person or by authorized agents, but in the latter case the bids must be 
accompanied by power of attorney duly executed by the real party or 
person in interest. Sealed bids may be submitted by mail or otherwise to 
the superintendent at his office at Miami, Okla., or delivered to him at 
the place set for the sale at any time prior to the hour fixed for 
offering the lease for sale. At the time and place of the public auction 
and before receiving the public bids the officer in charge shall 
announce the amounts and terms of all sealed bids received by him and 
the names of the bidders. The persons present, including those, if any, 
who may have theretofore submitted sealed bids, shall then be allowed to 
offer public bids. Bids must contain the offer of the stipulated and 
fixed royalty (see Sec. 215.5 as to royalty) and, in addition thereto, 
the offer of a bonus payable as follows: 25 percent at time of sale and 
the balance before or at time of execution of the lease contract. 
Bidders shall be required to submit with their bids a draft or certified 
check payable to the order of the superintendent covering the advance 
rental for the first year on the proposed leasehold and 25 percent of 
the amount of the bonus offered. The superintendent shall, in each case, 
determine the highest and best bid, said determination, however, to be 
subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Upon approval 
by the Secretary of the Interior of the award, the successful bidder 
shall, within 30 days from notice thereof, enter into and execute the 
lease contract in accordance with said bid and the regulations in this 
part. The

[[Page 698]]

lease so executed shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of 
the Interior and may be accepted or rejected by him when submitted for 
his approval. The right is reserved to the Secretary of the Interior, in 
the event of the rejection of such lease, to authorize and instruct the 
superintendent to accept the offer of some competitive bidder or to 
readvertise the land for lease. The report of the superintendent to the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs relative to the auction sale shall 
contain full information as to all bids received for the lease rights on 
the land. If any person or party fails or refuses to execute a lease 
after being declared the highest bidder or after being awarded such 
lease, the amount tendered with his bid shall be forfeited to the 
superintendent for the benefit of the owner of the land.


<R05>
Sec. 215.9  Execution of leases.

    Whenever a lease award to a proposed lessee has been approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior, as provided in Sec. Sec. 215.7 and 215.8, 
the lease contract shall be executed by the Indian owner of the land, if 
he be an adult and not incompetent as defined in Sec. 215.0(c). Before 
any lease is entered into by the Indian owners or is approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior, all the adult and competent owners or co-
owners of the tract of land which it is proposed to lease, shall be 
furnished by the Bureau such geological reports as may be available or 
that can be secured from the representative of the Geological Survey 
showing the estimated mineral reserves on said property, the estimated 
reasonable value of such property for mining purposes, and such other 
data as might reasonably be necessary to fully advise the owners of said 
property of the then present status and mining value of their lands. If 
the Quapaw or other Indian owner of the land is a minor, or is otherwise 
an incompetent as defined in the regulations in this part, the lease 
contract shall be executed by the superintendent for and on behalf of 
such minor or such incompetent. The leases executed, either by the 
Indian owner of the land or by the superintendent in his behalf, shall 
be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall be 
effective only upon such approval.

<R05>
Sec. 215.10  Renewal of leases on developed lands.

    (a) In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased, and lead 
and zinc ores have been discovered hereon, and it shall appear to the 
Secretary of the Interior to be advisable and to the best interests of 
the Indian owners of the lands that the terms of the existing lease or 
leases be extended or that a new lease or leases for an additional 
period of time, or that a new lease or leases to take effect upon the 
expiration of present valid leases, should, upon application therefor, 
be granted to either the present lessees or to parties holding under 
assignments, subleases, or mining contracts, from such present lessees, 
or to parties who have expended capital in lead and zinc mining 
operation and development of the land under such leases, assignments, 
subleases, or mining contracts, a new lease or leases or contract of 
extension or existing lease or leases as may be authorized by the 
Secretary of the Interior may be entered into with the proper party or 
parties as may be determined by said Secretary of the Interior, and such 
new lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases 
shall be executed subject to the regulations in this part by and between 
the Indian owner of the land, if an adult and not incompetent as defined 
in Sec. 215.0 (c), and said proper party or parties. If the Quapaw or 
other Indian owner of the land is a minor or an otherwise incompetent as 
defined in Sec. 215.0 (c), the superintendent shall execute the new 
lease or leases or contract of extension of existing lease or leases for 
and on behalf of said Indian minor or incompetent. Said new leases or 
contracts of extension of old leases, whether executed by the Indian 
owner of the land or by the superintendent for and in his behalf, shall 
be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and shall 
become effective only upon such approval. No offering for sale at public 
auction or advertisement of sale

[[Page 699]]

will be necessary in reference to contracts of extension of leases, or 
to leases entered into under this section, as above provided, but such 
lease or contract shall be upon such terms as to bonus and royalty as 
may be determined and fixed in each case by the Secretary of the 
Interior under the provisions of Sec. 215.5. The approval by the 
Secretary of the Interior of new leases or of the contracts of extension 
of old leases shall be conclusive as to the validity of said leases, or 
contracts of extension of leases, the manner and method of negotiating 
the same, and the execution thereof. If, however, in any case where 
lands have heretofore been leased and lead and zinc ores have been 
discovered thereon, it shall appear to the Secretary of the Interior 
that the extension of the existing lease or leases or the granting of 
new leases to the present lessees, or to the persons or parties holding 
under said lessees by assignment, sublease, or mining contract, would 
not be to the best interests of the Indian owners of the land, the 
Secretary of the Interior may, at the expiration, cancellation, or 
forfeiture of the existing lease, cause the mining lease rights on said 
land to be offered for sale at public auction to the highest bidder. If 
the lead and zinc mining lease on said land be offered for sale at 
public auction, the same procedure shall be followed as provided in 
Sec. Sec. 215.7 through 215.9.
    (b) Applications under the provision of this section for a lease or 
extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of 
lease will not be received or considered prior to the period of 1 year 
next preceding the date of the expiration of such valid existing lease 
or leases as may be on the land covered by such application.
    (c) Applications under the provisions of this section for a lease or 
extension of lease or for the approval of such lease or extension of 
lease shall be filed with the superintendent of the Quapaw Agency at any 
time within the period of 1 year next preceding the date of the 
expiration of such valid existing lease or leases as may be on the land 
covered by such application, and if the records of or papers in the 
office of said superintendent or the records of the county court of 
Ottawa County, Okla., indicate that there are any prior existing leases, 
subleases, assignments of leases or mining contracts covering any of the 
land applied for, the superintendent shall notify all persons having or 
claiming any rights or interest in or under said prior existing leases, 
subleases, assignments of leases, or mining contract concerning said 
application for lease or extension of lease, and that they will be 
allowed 10 days in which to file with the superintendent any objection 
they may have to the allowance of the application or to the approval of 
the new lease or extension of existing lease. If objection or protest is 
made by any owner of the land or by any person claiming rights or 
interests in or under existing lease, sublease, assignment of lease, or 
mining contract, a reasonable time, not exceeding 20 days, shall be 
allowed them in which to file their statement or brief in support of 
their protest or objection, and a reasonable further time not exceeding 
10 days shall be allowed the applicant for new lease or for extension of 
existing lease to reply in support of the application. In case of 
contest, hearings may be had if deemed necessary by the Secretary of the 
Interior or his representative. The application and papers in each case 
shall be forwarded by the superintendent of the Quapaw Indian Agency to 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with his report and recommendation in 
regard thereto.


<R05>
Sec. 215.11  New leases where prior leases have been forfeited or abandoned.

    In cases where the lands have heretofore been leased and lead and 
zinc ores have been discovered but the mines and mining operations have 
been abandoned and the leases have been canceled or forfeited or have 
expired, special arrangements in the matter of the leasing and mining of 
said lands may be made provided the consent thereto of the Secretary of 
the Interior be first obtained. Applications containing special offers 
as to the terms and conditions may be considered by the Secretary of the 
Interior and the leasing of said lands may be made upon such special 
terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may in each case 
deem to be for the best interests of the Indian owners of the land.

[[Page 700]]

If, however, in any case, it shall appear to the Secretary of the 
Interior that the granting of such lease would not be to the best 
interest of the Indian owners of the land, the Secretary of the Interior 
may cause the mining lease rights on said land to be offered for sale at 
public auction to the highest bidder. If the lead and zinc mining lease 
on said land be offered for sale at public auction, the same procedure 
shall be followed as provided in Sec. Sec. 215.7 through 215.9.


<R05>
Sec. 215.12  Advertising costs.

    All advertising costs, publication fees, expenses incurred for 
abstracts of lease title, and other expenses incurred in connection with 
the advertising and sale of leases and in connection with the execution 
of lease contracts shall be borne by the lessee. In the event a lease of 
the land is offered to the highest bidder and he fails or refuses to 
execute such lease when duly notified and as required by or under the 
regulations in this part, and no other bid is accepted, such costs, 
fees, and expenses shall be paid from such money as he may have paid 
with his bid. If no bid is tendered after a tract is advertised, or if 
all bids are refused, said items of expenses shall be charged to the 
Indian owner of the land and be paid by him or be paid by the 
superintendent from any funds held by such superintendent to the credit 
of such Indian owner of the land.


<R05>
Sec. 215.13  Bond.

    Every mineral lease made and entered into under the regulations in 
this part, by an Indian or by the superintendent as his representative 
or in his behalf, must be accompanied by a surety bond, executed by the 
lessee and by a responsible surety company or two or more satisfactory 
sureties, guaranteeing the payment of all deferred installments of bonus 
and the payment of all specified royalties and rentals and the 
performance of all covenants and agreements undertaken by the lessee. 
Such bonds, unless authorized by the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative, with the consent of the Indian landowner, 
shall be not less than the following amounts:

For less than 80 acres--$2,500
For 80 acres and less than 120 acres--3,500
For 120 acres or more--5,000

    Provided, however, That the lessee may, in lieu of such surety bond 
and upon execution of a proper penal bond to the United States in the 
sum prescribed and a proper power of attorney to the Secretary of the 
Interior, submit therewith United States bonds or notes in the aggregate 
sum prescribed as security for the carrying out of the terms, 
conditions, and provisions of the lease: Provided further, That a lessee 
may file in lieu of such individual lease bonds, one bond in a sum to be 
fixed by the Secretary of the Interior covering all leases to which he 
is or may become a party. The right is specifically reserved to the 
Secretary of the Interior to require an increase of the amount of any 
bond above the sum named in any particular case where he deems it 
necessary to require such increased bond.

Sec. 215.14  Payments to be made to superintendent.

    No bonus, rents, royalties, nor other payments accruing under any 
mineral lease executed in accordance with or subject to the regulations 
in this part and approved by the Secretary of the Interior shall be paid 
direct to the Indian lessor; but all such bonus, rents, royalties, and 
other payments accruing under any such lease shall be paid to the 
superintendent for the benefit of the Indian lessors, to be deposited by 
that officer to the credit of the superintendent in some bank designated 
for the deposit of individual Indian moneys.


<R05>
Sec. 215.15  Leases to be accompanied by Form D.

<R05>
Sec. 216.1  Purpose.

    It is the policy of this Department to encourage the development of 
the mineral resources underlying Indian lands where mining is 
authorized. However, interest of the Indian owners and the public at 
large requires that, with respect to the exploration for, and the

[[Page 704]]

surface mining of, such minerals, adequate measures be taken to avoid, 
minimize, or correct damage to the environment--land, water, and air--
and to avoid, minimize, or correct hazards to the public health and 
safety. The regulations in this part prescribe procedures to that end.


<R05>
Sec. 216.2  Scope.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
regulations in this part provide for the protection and conservation of 
nonmineral resources during operations for the discovery, development, 
surface mining, and onsite processing of minerals under permits or 
leases issued pursuant to statutes pertaining to Indian lands including 
but not limited to the following statutes or amendments thereto:

The Act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539);

    The Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1967);
    The Act of May 11, 1939 (52 Stat. 347, 25 U.S.C. 396a-f, and 5 
U.S.C. 301).
    (b) The regulations in this part do not cover the exploration for 
oil and gas or the issuance of leases, or operations thereunder, nor 
minerals underlying lands, the surface of which is not owned by the 
owner of the minerals.
    (c) The regulations in this part shall apply only to permits or 
leases issued subsequent to the date on which these regulations become 
effective and which are subject to the approval of the Secretary of the 
Interior or his designated representative.


<R05>
Sec. 216.3  Definitions.

    As used in the regulations in the part:
    (a) Superintendent means the superintendent or other officer of the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs having jurisdiction under delegated authority, 
over the lands involved.
    (b) Mining supervisor means the Regional Mining Supervisor, or his 
authorized representative, of the Geological Survey authorized as 
provided in 30 CFR 211.3 and 231.2 to supervise operations on the land 
covered by a permit or lease.
    (c) Overburden means all the earth and other materials which lie 
above a natural deposit of minerals and such earth and other materials 
after removal from their natural state in the process of mining.
    (d) Area of land to be affected or area of land affected means the 
area of land from which overburden is to be or has been removed and upon 
which the overburden or waste is to be or has been deposited, and 
includes all lands affected by the construction of new roads or the 
improvement or use of existing roads to gain access to an operation and 
for haulage.
    (e) Operation means all of the premises, facilities, roads, and 
equipment used in the process of determining the location, composition 
or quality of a mineral deposit, or in developing, extracting, or onsite 
processing of a mineral deposit in a designated area.
    (f) Method of operation means the method or manner by which a cut or 
open pit is made, the overburden is placed or handled, water is 
controlled or affected and other acts performed by the operator in the 
process of exploring or uncovering and removing or onsite processing of 
a mineral deposit.
    (g) Holder or operator means the permittee or lessee designated in a 
permit or lease.
    (h) Reclamation means measures undertaken to bring about the 
necessary reconditioning or restoration of land or water that has been 
affected by exploration or mineral development, mining or onsite 
processing operations, and waste disposal, in ways which will prevent or 
control onsite and offsite damage to the environment.


<R05>
Sec. 216.4  Technical examination of prospective surface exploration and mining operations.

    (a)(1) In connection with an application for a permit or lease, the 
superintendent shall make, or cause to be made, a technical examination 
of the prospective effects of the proposed exploration or surface mining 
operations upon the environment. The technical examination shall take 
into consideration the need for the preservation and protection of other 
resources, including cultural, recreational, scenic, historic, and 
ecological values; and control of

[[Page 705]]

erosion, flooding, and pollution of water; the isolation of toxic 
materials; the prevention of air pollution; the reclamation by 
revegetation, replacement of soil or by other means, of lands affected 
by the exploration or mining operations; the prevention of slides; the 
protection of fish and wildlife and their habitat; and the prevention of 
hazards to public health and safety.
    (2) A technical examination of an area should be made with the 
recognition that actual potential mining sites and mining operations 
vary widely with respect to topography, climate, surrounding land uses, 
proximity to densely used areas, and other environmental influences and 
that mining and reclamation requirements should provide sufficient 
flexibility to permit adjustment to local conditions.
    (b) Based upon the technical examination, the superintendent shall 
formulate the general requirements which the applicant must meet for the 
protection of nonmineral resources during the conduct of exploration or 
mining operations and for the reclamation of lands or waters affected by 
exploration or mining operations. The general requirements shall be made 
known in writing to the applicant before the issuance of a permit or 
lease and upon acceptance thereof by the applicant, shall be 
incorporated in the permit or lease.
    (c) In each instance in which an application is made the mining 
supervisor shall participate in the technical examination and in the 
formulation of the general requirements.
    (d) The superintendent may prohibit or otherwise restrict operations 
on any part of an area whenever it is determined that such part of the 
area described in an application for a permit or lease is such that 
previous experience under similar conditions has shown that operations 
cannot feasibly be conducted by any known methods or measures to avoid--
    (1) Rock or landslides which would be a hazard to human lives or 
endanger or destroy private or public property; or
    (2) Substantial deposition of sediment and silt into streams, lakes, 
reservoirs; or
    (3) A lowering of water quality below standards established by the 
appropriate State water pollution control agency, or by the Secretary of 
the Interior, or his authorized representative; or
    (4) A lowering of the quality of waters whose quality exceeds that 
required by the established standards--unless and until it has been 
affirmatively demonstrated to the Secretary of the Interior, or his 
authorized representative, that such lowering of quality is necessary to 
economic and social development and will not preclude any assigned uses 
made of such waters; or
    (5) The destruction of key wildlife habitat or important scenic, 
historical, or other natural or cultural features.
    (e) If, on the basis of a technical examination, the superintendent 
determines that there is a likelihood that there will be a lowering of 
water quality as described in paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section 
caused by the operation, no lease or permit shall be issued until after 
consultation with the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration and 
a finding by the Administration that the proposed operation would not be 
in violation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 
U.S.C. 466 et seq.), or of Executive Order No. 11288 (31 FR 9261). Where 
a permit or lease is involved the Superintendent's determination shall 
be made in consultation with the mining supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 216.5  Basis for denial of a permit or lease.

    An application for a permit or lease to conduct exploratory or 
mining operations may be denied any applicant who has forfeited a 
required bond because of failure to comply with a mining plan. However, 
a permit or lease may not be denied an applicant because of the 
forfeiture of a bond if the lands disturbed under his previous permit or 
lease have subsequently been reclaimed without cost to the lessor or the 
United States.


<R05>
Sec. 216.6  Approval of exploration plan.

    (a) Before commencing any surface disturbing operations to explore, 
test or prospect for minerals, the operator shall file with the mining 
supervisor a plan for the proposed exploration operations. The mining 
supervisor shall

[[Page 706]]

consult with the superintendent with respect to the surface protection 
and reclamation aspects before approving said plan.
    (b) Depending upon the size and nature of the operation and the 
requirements established pursuant to Sec. 216.4 the mining supervisor 
may require that the exploration plan submitted by the operator include 
any or all of the following:

trenching, etc., and the location of primary support roads and 
facilities;
    (4) A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control 
fire, soil erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, damage to 
fish and wildlife or other natural resources, and hazards to public 
health and safety both during and upon abandonment of exploration 
activities.
    (c) The mining supervisor shall promptly review the exploration plan 
submitted to him by the operator and shall indicate to the operator any 
changes, additions, or amendments necessary to meet the requirements 
formulated pursuant to Sec. 216.4, the provisions of these regulations, 
and the terms of the permit.
    (d) The operator shall comply with the provisions of an approved 
exploration plan. The mining supervisor may, with respect to such a 
plan, exercise the authority provided by paragraphs (f) and (g) of Sec. 
216.7 respecting a mining plan.


<R05>
Sec. 216.7  Approval of mining plan.

    (a) Before surface mining operations may commence under any permit 
or lease, the operator must file a mining plan with the mining 
supervisor and obtain his approval of the plan. The mining supervisor 
shall consult with the superintendent with respect to the surface 
protection and reclamation aspects before approving said plan.
    (b) Depending on the size and nature of the operation and the 
requirements established pursuant to Sec. 216.4 the mining supervisor

that are expected to enter any receiving waters;
    (5) A design for the necessary impoundment, treatment or control of 
all runoff water and drainage from workings so as to reduce soil erosion 
and sedimentation and to prevent the pollution of receiving waters;
    (6) A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control 
fire, soil erosion, pollution of surface and ground water, damage to 
fish and wildlife, and hazards to public health and safety; and
    (7) A statement of the proposed manner and time of performance of 
work to reclaim areas disturbed by the holder's operation.
    (c) In those instances in which the permit or lease requires the 
revegetation of an area of land to be affected, the mining plan shall 
show:
    (1) Proposed methods of preparation and fertilizing the soil prior 
to replanting;
    (2) Types and mixtures of shrubs, trees, or tree seedlings, grasses 
or legumes to be planted; and
    (3) Types and methods of planting, including the amount of grasses 
or legumes per acre, or the number and spacing of trees, or tree 
seedlings, or combinations of grasses and trees.
    (d) In those instances in which the permit or lease requires

methods and the timing of grading and backfilling of areas of land to be 
affected by the operation.

[[Page 707]]

    (e) The mining supervisor shall review the mining plan submitted to 
him by the operator and shall promptly indicate to the operator any 
changes, additions, or amendments necessary to meet the requirements 
formulated pursuant to Sec. 216.4, the provisions of these regulations 
and the terms of the permit or lease. The operator shall comply with the 
provisions of an approved mining plan.
    (f) A mining plan may be changed by mutual consent of the mining 
supervisor and the operator at any time to adjust to changed conditions 
or to correct any oversight. To obtain approval of a change or 
supplemental plan, the operator shall submit a written statement of the 
proposed changes or supplement and the justification for the changes 
proposed. The mining supervisor shall promptly notify the operator that 
he consents to the proposed changes or supplement, or in the event he 
does not consent, he shall specify the modifications thereto under which 
the proposed changes or supplement would be acceptable. After mutual 
acceptance of a change of a plan, the operator shall not depart 
therefrom without further approval.
    (g) If circumstances warrant or if development of a mining plan for 
the entire operation is dependent upon unknown factors which cannot or 
will not be determined except during the progress of the operations, a 
partial plan may be approved and supplemented from time to time. The 
operator shall not, however, perform any operation except under an 
approved plan.


<R05>
Sec. 216.8  Performance bond.

    (a) Upon approval of an exploration plan or mining plan, the 
operator shall be required to file a suitable performance bond of not 
less than $2,000 with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary of 
the Interior, and the bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful 
compliance with applicable regulations, the terms and conditions of the 
permit, lease, or contract, and the exploration or mining plan as 
approved, amended or supplemented. The bond shall be in an amount 
sufficient to satisfy the reclamation requirements established pursuant 
to an approved exploration or mining plan, or an approved partial or 
supplemental plan. In determining the amount of the bond consideration 
shall be given to the character and nature of the reclamation 
requirements and the estimated costs of reclamation in the event that 
the operator forfeits his performance bond. In lieu of a surety bond an 
operator may elect to deposit cash or negotiable bonds of the U.S. 
government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities 
shall be equal at least to the required sum of the bond.
    (b) In a particular instance where the circumstances are such as to 
warrant an exception, the amount of the bond for a particular operation 
may be reduced to less than the required minimum of $2,000.
    (c) The superintendent shall set the amount of a bond and take the 
necessary action for an increase or for a complete or partial release of 
a bond. He shall take action with respect to bonds for leases or permits 
only after consultation with the mining supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 216.9  Reports.

    (a) Within 30 days after the end of each calendar year, or if 
operations cease before the end of a calendar year, within 30 days after 
the cessation of operations, the operator shall submit an operations 
report to the mining supervisor containing the following information:
    (1) An identification of the permit or lease and the location of the 
operation.
    (2) A description of the operations performed during the period of 
time for which the report is filed.
    (3) An identification of the area of land affected by the operations 
and a description of the manner in which the land has been affected.
    (4) A statement as to the number of acres disturbed by the 
operations and the number of acres which were reclaimed during the 
period of time.
    (5) A description of the method utilized for reclamation and the 
results thereof.
    (6) A statement and description of reclamation work remaining to be 
done.
    (b) Upon completion of such grading and backfilling as may be 
required by

[[Page 708]]

an approved exploration or mining plan, the operator shall make a report 
thereon to the mining supervisor and request inspection for approval. 
Whenever it is determined by such inspection that backfilling and 
grading have been carried out in accordance with the established 
requirements and approved exploration or mining plan, the superintendent 
shall issue a release of an appropriate amount of the performance bond 
for the area graded and backfilled. Appropriate amounts of the bond 
shall be retained to assure that satisfactory planting, if required, is 
carried out.
    (c)(1) Whenever planting is required by an approved exploration or 
mining plan, the operator shall file a report with the superintendent 
whenever such planting is completed. The report shall--
    (i) Identify the permit or lease;
    (ii) Show the type of planting or seeding, including mixtures and

of directors. These regulations set out the procedures for exercising 
such joint management.


<R05>
Sec. 217.3  Referral of questions by superintendent.

    The superintendent shall refer all questions and problems related to 
the management of the assets as they come to his attention, together 
with his analysis of alternative solutions to each question or problem, 
to the business committee and to the board of directors for resolution.

managers at such addresses as they furnish to the superintendent and to 
each other from time to time.


<R05>
Sec. 217.4  Referral of questions by the joint managers.

    The business committee and the board of directors must refer to each 
other for resolution any questions or problems related to joint 
management of the assets which they from time to time determine need to 
be resolved together with the submitting party's proposal, if any, for 
solution. Such referrals shall be in writing, addressed to the other 
joint manager at the address furnished in accordance with Sec. 217.3 of 
this part. Copies of all such referrals shall also be furnished to the 
superintendent. Either of the parties may request an analysis of

votes cast will decide an issue.


<R05>
Sec. 217.6  Method of casting votes.

    Within 30 days after an issue and any analysis provided for in 
Sec. Sec. 217.4 and 217.5 have been submitted to the joint managers for 
resolution, they shall each notify the superintendent in writing of the 
number of votes cast for and against the proposed or alternative 
solutions. If either of the joint managers fails or refuses to cast his 
votes and to notify the superintendent thereof within the time 
specified, the superintendent may conclude that such joint managers' 
votes have been cast against the proposed solution or solutions; or, if 
no solutions have been proposed, for the maintenance of the status quo. 
At the time they notify the superintendent of the votes cast on an 
issue, each joint manager shall furnish to the superintendent a 
certified copy of a resolution of the business committee or the board of 
directors, as the case may be, authorizing such vote.


<R05>
Sec. 217.7  Implementation of decision.

    The Secretary shall issue such documents as are necessary or 
expendient to implement the decisions of the joint managers, insofar as 
such issuance is authorized by law, and he shall execute and/or approve 
such documents for and on behalf of the joint managers, or either of 
them, and on behalf of the United States, as necessary. If it becomes 
necessary for the Secretary to execute an instrument on behalf of one or 
both of the joint managers and to approve the same instrument as 
trustee, two different officials having delegated authority from the 
Secretary shall serve as executing and approving officers, respectively.

under this part subject to disclosure to third parties?

    The requirements of this section implement the requirements of the 
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA) and 43 CFR part 2:
    (a) Information a tribe submits to the Department throughout the 
TERA process under this part may be subject to disclosure to third 
parties under FOIA unless a FOIA exemption or exception applies or other 
provisions of law protect the information.
    (b) A tribe may, but is not required to, designate information it

tribe, as submitter, with written notice of the FOIA request if:

[[Page 718]]

    (1) The tribe has designated the information as confidential 
commercial or financial information; or
    (2) The Department has reason to believe that the information 
requested may be protected under FOIA Exemption 4 (trade secrets and 
commercial or financial information which is obtained from a person and 
is privileged or confidential).
    (d) The notice to the tribe will:
    (1) Include a copy of the FOIA request;

information and a requestor asks for the objections under FOIA, the same 
notification procedures as above will apply;
    (6) Advise the tribe that it is the Department, rather than the 
tribe, that is responsible for deciding whether the information will be 
released or withheld;
    (7) If the tribe designated the information as commercial or 
financial information 10 or more years before the FOIA request, the 
Department will request the tribe's views on whether the tribe still 
considers the information to be confidential;

the tribe must submit a detailed written statement to the Department 
including the following:

under any exemption of FOIA, and if the applicable exemption is 
Exemption 4, the tribe must submit a specific and detailed discussion 
of:
    (i) Whether the Federal government required the information to be 
submitted, and, if so, how substantial competitive harm or other 
business harm would likely result from release of the information; or
    (ii) Whether the tribe provided the information voluntarily and, if 
so, how the information fits into a category of information that the 
tribe customarily does not release to the public;
    (2) A certification that the information is confidential, has not 
been disclosed to the public by the tribe, and is essentially non-public 
because it is not routinely available to the public from other sources;
    (3) If not already provided, a tribal contact telephone and fax 
number so that the Department can communicate with the tribe about the 
FOIA request;
    (f) The Department will review and consider all objections to

to the tribe, and if the tribe does not respond within the time limits 
specified in the notice, the Department will presume that the tribe has 
no objection to release of the information;
    (g) If the Department decides to release the information over the 
objection of the tribe, it will notify the tribe in writing by certified 
mail, return receipt requested, and will include copies of the records 
the Department intends to release and the reasons for deciding to 
release them. The notice will also inform the tribe that it intends to 
release the records within 10 working days after the tribe's receipt of 
the notice.

<R05>
Sec. 224.64  How may a tribe assume management of development of different 

types of energy resources?

    In order for a tribe to assume authority for approving leases, 
business agreements, and rights-of-way for development of another energy 
resource that is not included in the TERA, a tribe must apply for a new 
TERA covering the authority for the development of another energy 
resource it wishes to assume. The Secretary's consideration of a new 
TERA will include a determination of the tribe's capacity to develop 
that type of energy resource and will trigger the public notice and 
opportunity for comment consistent with Sec. 224.67.


<R05>
Sec. 224.65  How may a tribe assume additional activities under a TERA?

    A tribe may assume additional activities related to the development 
of the same type of energy resource included in a TERA by negotiating 
with the Secretary an amendment to the existing TERA to include the 
additional activities. The Secretary will determine in each case whether 
the tribe has sufficient capacity to carry out additional activities the 
tribe may wish to assume under an approved TERA.


<R05>
Sec. 224.66  How may a tribe reduce the scope of the TERA?

    A tribe may reduce the scope of the TERA by negotiating with the 
Secretary an amendment to the existing TERA to eliminate an activity 
assumed under the TERA or a type of energy resource development managed 
under the TERA. Any such reduction in scope must include the return of 
all relevant Departmental resources transferred under the TERA and any

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 225.1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The regulations in this part, administered by the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, 
govern minerals agreements for the development of Indian-owned minerals 
entered into pursuant to the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982, 25 
U.S.C. 2101-2108 (IMDA). These regulations are applicable to the lands 
or interests in lands of any Indian tribe, individual Indian or Alaska 
native the title to which is held in trust by the United States or is 
subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United 
States. These regulations are intended to ensure that Indian mineral 
owners are permitted to enter into minerals agreements that will allow 
the Indian mineral owners to have more responsibility in overseeing and 
greater flexibility in disposing of their mineral resources, and to 
allow development in the manner which the Indian mineral owners believe 
will maximize their best economic interest and minimize any adverse 
environmental or cultural impact resulting from such development. 
Pursuant to section 4 of the IMDA (25 U.S.C. 2103(e)), as part of this 
greater flexibility, where the Secretary has approved a minerals 
agreement in compliance with the provisions of 25 U.S.C. chap. 23 and 
any other applicable provision of law, the United States shall not

[[Page 737]]

be liable for losses sustained by a tribe or individual Indian under 
such minerals agreement. However, as further stated in the IMDA, the 
Secretary continues to have a trust obligation to ensure that the rights 
of a tribe or individual Indian are protected in the event of a 
violation of the terms of any minerals agreement, and to uphold the 
duties of the United States as derived from the trust relationship and 
from any treaties, executive orders, or agreements between the United 
States and any Indian tribe.
    (b) The regulations in this part shall become effective and in full 
force on April 29, 1994, and shall be subject to amendment at any time 
by the Secretary; Provided, that no such regulation that becomes 
effective after the date of approval of any minerals agreement shall 
operate to affect the duration of the minerals agreement, the rate of 
royalty or financial consideration, rental, or acreage unless agreed to 
by all parties to the minerals agreement.
    (c) The regulations of the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of 
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the Minerals Management 
Service that are referenced in Sec. Sec. 225.4, 225.5, and 225.6 are 
supplemental to these regulations, and apply to minerals agreements for 
development of Indian mineral resources unless specifically stated 
otherwise in this part or in other Federal regulations. To the extent 
the parties to a minerals agreement are able to provide reasonable 
provisions satisfactorily addressing the issues of valuation, method of 
payment, accounting, and auditing, governed by the Minerals Management 
Service regulations, the Secretary may approve alternate provisions in a 
minerals agreement.
    (d) Nothing in these regulations is intended to prevent Indian 
tribes from exercising their lawful governmental authority to regulate 
the conduct of persons, businesses, or minerals operations within their 
territorial jurisdiction.

Sec. 225.31  Manner of payments.

    Unless specified otherwise in the minerals agreement, after 
production has been established, all payments due for royalties, 
bonuses, rentals and other payments under a minerals agreement shall be 
made to the Secretary or such other party as may be designated, and 
shall be made at such time as provided in 30 CFR chapter II, subchapters 
A and C. Prior to production, all bonus and rental payments, shall be 
made to the Superintendent or Area Director.


<R05>
Sec. 225.32  Permission to start operations.

    (a) No exploration, drilling, or mining operations are permitted on 
any Indian lands before the Secretary has granted written approval of 
the minerals agreement pursuant to the regulations. After a minerals 
agreement is approved, written permission to start operations must be 
secured by applying for the permits referred to in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Applicable permits in accordance with rules and regulations in 
30 CFR part 750, 43 CFR parts 3160, 3260, 3480, 3590, and Orders or 
Notices to Lessees (NTL) issued thereunder shall be required before 
actual operations are conducted on the minerals agreement acreage.


<R05>
Sec. 225.33  Assignment of minerals agreements.

    An assignment of a minerals agreement, or any interest therein, 
shall not be valid without the approval of the Secretary and, if 
required in the minerals agreement, the Indian mineral owner. The 
assignee must be qualified to hold the minerals agreement and shall 
furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned on the faithful performance of 
the covenants and conditions thereof as stipulated in the minerals 
agreement. A fully executed copy of the assignment shall be filed with 
the Secretary within five (5) working days after execution by all 
parties. The Secretary may permit the release of any bonds executed by 
the assignor upon submission of satisfactory bonds to the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs by the assignee, and a determination that the assignor 
has satisfied all accrued obligations.


<R05>
Sec. 225.34  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 225.35  Inspection of premises; books and accounts.

    (a) Operators shall allow Indian mineral owners, their authorized 
representatives, or any authorized representatives of the Secretary to 
enter all parts of the minerals agreement area for the purpose of 
inspection. Operators shall keep a full and correct account of all 
operations and submit all related reports required by the minerals 
agreement and applicable regulations. Books and records shall be 
available for inspection during regular business hours.
    (b) Operators shall provide records to the Minerals Management 
Service (MMS) in accordance with MMS regulations and guidelines. All 
records pertaining to a minerals agreement shall be maintained by an 
operator in accordance with 30 CFR part 212.
    (c) Operators shall provide records to the Authorized Officer in 
accordance with BLM regulations and guidelines.
    (d) Operators shall provide records to the Director's Representative 
in accordance with OSMRE regulations and guidelines.


<R05>
Sec. 225.36  Minerals agreement cancellation; Bureau of Indian Affairs 

notice of noncompliance.

    (a) If the Secretary determines that an operator has failed to 
comply with the regulations in this part; other applicable laws or 
regulations; the terms of the minerals agreement; the requirements of an 
approved exploration, drilling or mining plan; Secretarial orders; or 
the orders of the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or 
the MMS Official, the Secretary may:
    (1) Serve a notice of noncompliance; or
    (2) Serve a notice of proposed cancellation.
    (b) The notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect the 
operator has failed to comply with the requirements referenced in 
paragraph (a), and shall specify what actions, if any, must be taken to 
correct the noncompliance.

[[Page 745]]

    (c) The notice of proposed cancellation shall set forth the reasons 
why cancellation is proposed.
    (d) The notice of proposed cancellation or noncompliance shall be 
served upon the operator by delivery in person or by certified mail to 
the operator at the operator's last known address. When certified mail 
is used, the date of service shall be deemed to be when received or five 
(5) working days after the date it is mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (e) The operator shall have thirty (30) days (or such longer time as 
specified in the notice) from the date that the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
notice of proposed cancellation or noncompliance is served to respond, 
in writing, to the Superintendent or Area Director actually issuing the 
notice.
    (f) If an operator fails to take any action that may be prescribed 
in the notice of proposed cancellation, fails to file a timely written 
response to the notice, or files a written response that does not, in 
the discretion of the Secretary, adequately justify the operator's 
failure to comply, then the Secretary may cancel the minerals agreement, 
specifying the basis for the cancellation. Cancellation of a minerals 
agreement shall not relieve the operator of any continuing obligation 
under the minerals agreement.
    (g) If an operator fails to take corrective action or to file a 
timely written response adequately justifying the operator's actions 
pursuant to a notice of noncompliance, the Secretary may issue an order 
of cessation. If the operator fails to comply with the order of 
cessation, or fails to timely file an appeal of the order of cessation 
pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section, the Secretary may issue an 
order of minerals agreement cancellation.
    (h) This section does not limit any other remedies of the Indian 
mineral owner as set forth in the minerals agreement.
    (i) Nothing in this section is intended to limit the authority of 
the Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS 
Official to take any enforcement action authorized pursuant to statute 
or regulation.
    (j) The Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, the MMS 
Official, and the Superintendent or Area Director should consult with 
one another before taking any enforcement actions.
    (k) If orders of cessation or minerals agreement cancellation issued 
pursuant to this section are issued by a designee of the Secretary other 
than the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, the orders may be 
appealed under 25 CFR part 2. If the orders are issued by the Secretary 
or the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, and not one of their 
delegates or subordinates, the orders are the final orders of the 
Department.


<R05>
Sec. 225.37  Penalties.

    (a) In addition to or in lieu of cancellation under Sec. 225.36, 
violations of the terms and conditions of any minerals agreement, the 
regulations in this part, other applicable laws or regulations, or 
failure to comply with a notice of noncompliance or a cessation order 
issued by the Secretary may subject an operator to a penalty of not more 
than $1,000 per day for each day that such a violation or noncompliance 
continues beyond the time limits prescribed for corrective action.
    (b) A notice of a proposed penalty shall be served on the operator 
either personally or by certified mail to the operator at the operator's 
last known address. The date of service by certified mail shall be 
deemed to be the date received or five (5) working days after the date 
mailed, whichever is earlier.
    (c) The notice shall specify the nature of the violation and the 
proposed penalty, and shall specifically advise the operator of the 
operator's right to either request a hearing within thirty (30) days of 
receipt of the notice or pay the proposed penalty. Hearings shall be 
held before the Superintendent or Area Director whose findings shall be 
conclusive, unless an appeal is taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2. If 
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of proposed penalty the 
operator has not requested a hearing or paid the amount of the proposed 
penalty, a final notice of penalty shall be served.
    (d) If the person served with a notice of proposed penalty requests 
a hearing, penalties shall accrue each day the violations or 
noncompliance set forth in

[[Page 746]]

the notice continue beyond the time limits presented for corrective 
action. The Secretary may issue a written suspension of the requirement 
to correct the violations pending completion of the hearings provided by 
this section only upon a determination, at the discretion of the 
Secretary, that such a suspension will not be detrimental to the Indian 
mineral owner and upon submission and acceptance of a bond deemed 
adequate to indemnify the Indian mineral owner from loss or damage. The 
amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover the cost of correcting 
the violations set forth in the notice or any disputed amounts plus 
accrued penalties and interest.
    (e) Payment of penalties in full more than ten (10) days after a 
final decision imposing a penalty shall subject the operator to late 
payment charges. Late payment charges shall be calculated on the basis 
of a percentage assessment rate of the amount unpaid per month for each 
month or fraction thereof until payment is received by the Secretary. In 
the absence of a specific minerals agreement provision prescribing a 
different rate, the interest rate on late payments and underpayments 
shall be a rate applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954. Interest shall be charged only on the amount of 
payment not received and only for the number of days the payment is 
late.
    (f) None of the provisions of this section shall be interpreted as:
    (1) Replacing or superseding the independent authority of the 
Authorized Officer, the Director's Representative, or the MMS Official 
to impose penalties under applicable statutory or regulatory 
authorities;
    (2) Replacing, superseding, or replicating any penalty provision in 
the terms and conditions of a minerals agreement approved by the 
Secretary pursuant to this part; or
    (3) Authorizing the imposition of a penalty for violations of 
minerals agreement provisions for which the Authorized Officer, 
Director's Representative, or MMS Official has either statutory or 
regulatory authority to assess a penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 225.38  Appeals.

    Appeals from decisions of Officials of the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
under this part may be taken pursuant to 25 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 225.39  Fees.

    (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, each minerals 
agreement or assignment thereof, shall be accompanied by a filing fee of 
$75.00 at the time of filing.
    (b) An Indian mineral owner shall not be required to pay a filing 
fee if the Indian mineral owner, pursuant to a provision in the existing 
minerals agreement, acquires an additional interest in that minerals 
agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 225.40  Government employees cannot acquire minerals agreements.

    U.S. Government employees are prevented from acquiring any 
interest(s) in minerals agreements by the provisions of 25 CFR part 140 
and 43 CFR part 20 pertaining to conflicts of interest and ownership of 
an interest in trust land.

sale. The Superintendent may approve oil leases, gas leases, and oil and 
gas leases made by the Osage Tribal Council in conformity with the 
notice of sale, regulations in this part, bonds, and other instruments

lease, or portion being surrendered, is owned in undivided interests by 
more than one party, then all parties shall join in the application for 
cancellation: Provided, That if this lease has been recorded, Lessee 
shall execute a release and record the same in the proper office. Such 
surrender shall not entitle Lessee to a refund of the unused portion of 
rental paid in lieu of development, nor shall it relieve Lessee and his 
sureties of any obligation and liability incurred prior to such 
surrender: Provided further, That when there is a partial surrender of

than $50,000 may be filed on Form G covering all oil, gas and 
combination oil and gas leases not in excess of 10,240 acres to which 
Lessee is or may become a party.
    (b) In lieu of the bonds required under paragraph (a) of this 
section, a bond in the penal sum of $150,000 may be filed on Form 5-5438 
for full nationwide coverage of all leases, without geographic or 
acreage limitation, to which the Lessee is or may become a party.
    (c) A bond on Form H shall be filed in an amount of not less than 
$5,000 covering a lease acquired through assignment where the assignee 
does not have a collective bond on form G or nationwide bond, or the 
corporate surety does not execute its consent to remain bound under the 
original bond given to secure the faithful performance of the terms and 
conditions of the lease.
    (d) The right is specifically reserved to increase the amount of 
bonds prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section in any 
particular case when the Superintendent deems it proper. The nationwide 
bond may be increased at any time in the discretion of the Secretary.

Sec. 226.9  Rental and drilling obligations.

    (a) Oil leases, gas leases, and combination oil and gas leases. 
Unless Lessee shall complete and place on production a well producing 
and selling oil and/or gas in paying quantities on the land embraced 
within the lease within 12 months from the date of approval of the 
lease, or as otherwise provided in the lease terms, or 12 months from 
the date the Superintendent consents to drilling on any restricted 
homestead selection, the lease shall terminate unless rental at the rate 
of not less than $1 per acre for an oil or gas lease, or not less than 
$2.00 per acre for a combination oil and gas lease, shall be paid before 
the end of the first year of the lease. The lease may also be held for 
the remainder of its primary term without drilling upon payment of the 
specified rental annually in advance, commencing with the second lease 
year. The lease shall terminate as of the due date of the rental unless 
such rental shall be received by the Superintendent, or shall have been 
mailed as indicated by postmark on or before said date. The completion 
of a well producing in paying quantities shall, for so long as such 
production continues, relieve Lessee from any further payment of rental, 
except that should such production cease during the primary term the 
lease may be continued only during the remaining primary term of the 
lease by payment of advance rental which shall commence on the next 
anniversary date of the lease. Rental shall be paid on the basis of a 
full year and no refund will be made of advance rental paid in 
compliance with the regulations in this part: Provided, That the 
Superintendent in his discretion may order further development of any 
leased acreage or separate horizon if, in his opinion, a prudent 
operator would conduct further development. If Lessee refuses to comply, 
the refusal will be considered a violation of the lease terms and said 
lease shall be subject to cancellation as to the acreage or horizon the 
further development of which was ordered: Provided further, That the 
Superintendent may impose restrictions as to time of drilling and rate 
of production from any well or wells when in his judgment, such action 
may be necessary or proper for the protection of the natural resources 
of the leased land and the interests of the Osage Tribe. The 
superintendent may consider, among other things, Federal and Oklahoma 
laws regulating either drilling or production. If a lessee holds both an 
oil lease and a gas lease covering the same acreage, such lessee is 
subject to the provisions of this section as to both the oil lease and 
the gas lease.
    (b) The Superintendent may, with the consent of and under terms 
approved by the Osage Tribal Council, grant an extension of the primary 
term of a lease on which the actual drilling of a well shall have 
commenced within the term thereof or for the purpose of enabling Lessee 
to obtain a market for his oil and/or gas production.

Sec. 226.11  Royalty payments.

    (a) Royalty on oil--(1) Royalty rate. Lessee shall pay or cause to 
be paid to the Superintendent, as royalty, the sum of not less than 
16\2/3\ percent of the gross proceeds from sales after deducting the oil 
used by Lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease: 
Provided, That when the quantity of oil taken from all the producing 
wells on any quarter-section or fraction thereof, according to the 
public survey, during any calendar month is sufficient to average one 
hundred or more barrels per active producing well per day the royalty on 
such oil shall be not less than 20 percent. The Osage

[[Page 751]]

Tribal Council may, upon presentation of justifiable economic evidence 
by Lessee, agree to a revised royalty rate subject to approval by the 
Superintendent, applicable to additional oil produced from a lease or 
leases by enhanced recovery methods, which rate shall not be less than 
12\1/2\ percent of the gross proceeds from sale of oil produced by 
enhanced recovery processes, other than gas injection, after deducting 
the oil used by Lessee for development and operating purposes on the 
lease or leases.
    (2) Unless the Osage Tribal Council, with approval of the Secretary, 
shall elect to take the royalty in kind, payment is owing at the time of 
sale or removal of the oil, except where payments are made on division 
orders, and settlement shall be based on the actual selling price, but 
at not less than the highest posted price by a major purchaser (as 
defined in Sec. 226.1(h)) in Osage County, Oklahoma, who purchases 
production from Osage oil leases.
    (3) Royalty in kind. Should Lessor, with approval of the Secretary, 
elect to take the royalty in kind, Lessee shall furnish free storage for 
royalty oil for a period not to exceed 60 days from date of production 
after notice of such election.
    (b) Royalty on gas--(1) Oil lease. All casinghead gas shall belong 
to the oil Lessee subject to any rights under existing gas leases. All 
casinghead gas removed from the lease from which it is produced shall be 
metered unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent and be subject 
to a royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ percent of the market value of the 
gas and all products extracted therefrom, less a reasonable allowance 
for manufacture or processing. If an oil Lessee supplies casinghead gas 
produced from one lease for operation and/or development of other 
leases, either his/hers or others, a royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ 
percent shall be paid on the market value of all casinghead gas so used. 
All casinghead gas not utilized by the oil Lessee may, with the approval 
of the Superintendent, be utilized or sold by the gas Lessee, subject to 
the prescribed royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ percent of the market 
value.
    (2) Gas lease. Lessee shall pay a royalty of not less than 16\2/3\ 
percent of the market value value of all natural gas and products 
extracted therefrom produced and sold from his lease. Natural gas used 
in the reasonable and prudent operation and development of said lease 
shall be exempted from royalty payment.
    (3) Combination oil and gas lease. Lessee shall pay royalty as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (c) Minimum royalty. In no event shall the royalty paid from 
producing leases during any year be less than an amount equal to the 
annual rental specified for the lease. Any underpayment of minimum 
royalty shall be due and payable within 45 days following the end of the 
lease year. After the primary term, Lessee shall submit with his payment 
evidence that the lease is producing in paying quantities. The 
Superintendent is authorized to determine whether the lease is actually 
producing in paying quantities or has terminated for lack of such 
production. Payment for any underpayment not made within the time 
specified shall be subject to a late charge at the rate of not less than 
1\1/2\ percent per month for each month or fraction thereof until paid.

lease at not less than the highest posted price as defined in Sec. 
226.11.


<R05>
Sec. 226.13  Time of royalty payments and reports.

    (a) Royalty payments due may be paid by either purchaser or Lessee. 
Unless otherwise provided by the Osage Tribal Council and approved by 
the Superintendent, all payments shall be due by the 25th day of each 
month and shall cover the sales of the preceding month. Failure to make 
such payments shall subject Lessee or purchaser, whoever is responsible 
for royalty payment, to a late charge at the rate of not less than 1\1/
2\ percent for each

[[Page 752]]

month or fraction thereof until paid. The Osage Tribal Council, subject 
to the approval of the Superintendent, may waive the late charges.
    (b) Lessee shall furnish certified monthly reports by the 25th of 
each following month covering all operations, whether there has been 
production or not, indicating therein the total amount of oil, natural 
gas, casinghead gas, and other products subject to royalty payment.
    (c) Failure to remit payments or reports shall subject Lessee to 
further penalties as provided in Sec. Sec. 226.42 and 226.43 and shall 
subject the division order to cancellation.

<R05>
Sec. 226.14  Contracts and division orders.

    (a) Lessee may enter into division orders or contracts with the 
purchasers of oil, gas, or derivatives therefrom which will provide for 
the purchaser to make payment of royalty in accordance with his lease: 
Provided, That such division orders or contracts shall not relieve 
Lessee from responsibility for the payment of the royalty should the 
purchaser fail to pay. No production shall be removed from the leased 
premises until a division order and/or contract and its terms are 
approved by the Superintendent: Provided further, That the 
Superintendent may grant temporary permission to run oil or gas from a 
lease pending the approval of a division order or contract. Lessee shall 
file a certified monthly report and pay royalty on the value of all oil 
and gas used off the premises for development and operating purposes. 
Lessee shall be responsible for the correct measurement and reporting of 
all oil and/or gas taken from the leased premises.
    (b) Lessee shall require the purchaser of oil and/or gas from his/
her lease or leases to furnish the Superintendent, no later than the 
25th day of each month, a statement reporting the gross barrels of oil 
and/or gross Mcf of gas sold during the preceding month. The 
Superintendent may authorize an extension of time, not to exceed 10 
days, for furnishing this statement.

<R05>
Sec. 226.15  Unit leases, assignments and related instruments.

    (a) Unitization of leases. The Osage Tribal Council and Lessee or 
Lessees, may, with the approval of the Superintendent, unitize or merge, 
two or more oil or oil and gas leases into a unit or cooperative 
operating plan to promote the greatest ultimate recovery of oil and gas 
from a common source of supply or portion thereof embracing the lands 
covered by such lease or leases. The cooperative or unit agreement shall 
be subject to the regulations in this part and applicable laws governing 
the leasing of the Osage Mineral Estate. Any agreement between the 
parties in interest to terminate a unit or cooperative agreement as to 
all or any portion of the lands included shall be submitted to the 
Superintendent for his approval. Upon approval the leases included 
thereunder shall be restored to their original terms: Provided, That for 
the purpose of preventing waste and to promote the greatest ultimate 
recovery of oil and gas from a common source of supply or portion 
thereof, all oil leases, oil and gas leases, and gas leases issued 
heretofore and hereafter under the provisions of the regulations in this 
part shall be subject to any unit development plan affecting the leased 
lands that may be required by the Superintendent with the consent of the 
Osage Tribal Council, and which plan shall adequately protect the rights 
of all parties in interest including the Osage Mineral Estate.
    (b) Assignments. Approved leases or any interest therein may be 
assigned or transferred only with the approval of the Superintendent. 
The assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under existing rules 
and regulations and shall furnish a satisfactory bond conditioned for 
the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof. Lessee 
must assign either his entire interest in a lease or legal subdivision 
thereof, or an undivided interest in the whole lease: Provided, That

[[Page 753]]

when an assignment covers only a portion of a lease or covers interests 
in separate horizons such assignment shall be subject to both the 
consent of the Osage Tribal Council and approval of the Superintendent. 
If a lease is divided by the assignment of an entire interest in any 
part, each part shall be considered a separate lease and the assignee 
shall be bound to comply with all the terms and conditions of the 
original lease. A fully executed copy of the assignment shall be filed 
with the Superintendent within 30 days after the date of execution by 
all parties. If requested within the 30-day period, the Superintendent 
may grant an extension of 15 days. A filing fee of $10 shall accompany 
each assignment.
    (c) Overriding royalty. Agreements creating overriding royalties or 
payments out of production shall not be considered as an interest in a 
lease as such term is used in paragraph (b) of this section. Agreements 
creating overriding royalties or payments out of production are hereby 
authorized and the approval of the Department of the Interior or any 
agency thereof shall not be required with respect thereto, but such 
agreements shall be subject to the condition that nothing in any such 
agreement shall be construed as modifying any of the obligations of 
Lessee under his lease and the regulations in this part. All such 
obligations are to remain in full force and effect, the same as if free 
of any such royalties or payments. The existence of agreements creating 
overriding royalties or payments out of production, whether or not 
acutally paid, shall not be considered in justifying the shutdown or 
abandonment of any well. Agreements creating overriding royalties or 
payments out of production need not be filed with the Superintendent 
unless incorporated in assignments or instruments required to be filed 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. An agreement creating 
overriding royalties or payment out of production shall be suspended 
when the working interest income per active producing well is equal to 
or less than the operational cost of the well, as determined by the 
Superintendent.
    (d) Drilling contracts. The Superintendent is authorized to approve 
drilling contracts with a stipulation that such approval does not in any 
way bind the Department to approve subsequent assignments that may be 
provided for in said contracts. Approval merely authorizes entry on the 
lease for the purpose of development work.
    (e) Combining leases. The lessee owning both an oil lease and gas 
lease covering the same acreage is authorized to convert such leases to 
a combination oil and gas lease.

                               Operations


<R05>
Sec. 226.16  Commencement of operations.

    (a) No operations shall be permitted upon any tract of land until a 
lease covering such tract shall have been approved by the 
Superintendent: Provided, That the Superintendent may grant authority to 
any party under such rules, consistent with the regulations in this part 
that he deems proper, to conduct geophysical and geological exploration 
work.
    (b) Lessee shall submit applications on forms to be furnished by the 
Superintendent and secure his approval before:
    (1) Well drilling, treating, or workover operations are started on 
the leased premises.
    (2) Removing casing from any well.
    (c) Lessee shall notify the Superintendent a reasonable time in 
advance of starting work, of intention to drill, redrill, deepen, plug, 
or abandon a well.


<R05>
Sec. 226.17  How to acquire permission to begin operations on a restricted homestead allotment.

    (a) Lessee may conduct operations within or upon a restricted 
homestead selection only with the written consent of the Superintendent.
    (b) If the allottee is unwilling to permit operations on his 
homestead, the Superintendent will cause an examination of the premises 
to be made with the allottee and lessee or his representative. Upon 
finding that the interests of the Osage Tribe require that the tract be 
developed, the Superintendent will endeavor to have the parties agree

[[Page 754]]

upon the terms under which operations on the homestead may be conducted.
    (c) In the event the allottee and lessee cannot reach an agreement, 
the matter shall be presented by all parties before the Osage Tribal 
Council, and the Council shall make its recommendations. Such 
recommendations shall be considered as final and binding upon the 
allottee and lessee. A guardian may represent the allottee. Where no one 
is authorized or where no person is deemed by the Superintendent to be a 
proper party to speak for a person of unsound mind or feeble 
understanding, the Principal Chief of the Osage Tribe shall represent 
him.
    (d) If the allottee or his representative does not appear before the 
Osage Tribal Council when notified by the Superintendent, or if the 
Council fails to act within 10 days after the matter is referred to it, 
the Superintendent may authorize lessee to proceed with operations in 
conformity with the provisions of his lease and the regulations in this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 226.18  Information to be given surface owners prior to commencement of drilling operations.

    Except for the surveying and staking of a well, no operations of any 
kind shall commence until the lessee or his/her authorized 
representative shall meet with the surface owner or his/her 
representative, if a resident of and present in Osage County, Oklahoma. 
Unless waived by the Superintendent or otherwise agreed to between the 
lessee and surface owner, such meeting shall be held at least 10 days 
prior to the commencement or any operations, except for the surveying 
and staking of the well. At such meeting lessee or his/her authorized 
representative shall comply with the following requirements:
    (a) Indicate the location of the well or wells to be drilled.
    (b) Arrange for route of ingress and egress. Upon failure to agree 
on route ingress and egress, said route shall be set by the 
Superintendent.
    (c) Impart to said surface owners the name and address of the party 
or representative upon whom the surface owner shall serve any claim for 
damages which he may sustain from mineral development or operations, and 
as to the procedure for settlement thereof as provided in Sec. 226.21
    (d) Where the drilling is to be on restricted land, lessee or his 
authorized representative in the manner provided above shall meet with 
the Superintendent.
    (e) When the surface owner or his/her representative is not a 
resident of, or is not physically present in, Osage County, Oklahoma, or 
cannot be contacted at the last known address, the Superintendent may 
authorize lessee to proceed with operations.

[39 FR 22254, June 21, 1974, as amended at 41 FR 50648, Nov. 17, 1976; 
43 FR 8136, Feb. 28, 1978. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982, 
as amended at 55 FR 33115, Aug. 14, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 226.19  Use of surface of land.

    (a) Lessee or his/her authorized representative shall have the right 
to use so much of the surface of the land within the Osage Mineral 
Estate as may be reasonable for operations and marketing. This includes 
but is not limited to the right to lay and maintain pipelines, electric 
lines, pull rods, other appliances necessary for operations and 
marketing, and the right-of-way for ingress and egress to any point of 
operations. If Lessee and surface owner are unable to agree as to the 
routing of pipelines, electric lines, etc., said routing shall be set by 
the Superintendent. The right to use water for lease operations is 
established by Sec. 226.24. Lessee shall conduct his/her operations in 
a workmanlike manner, commit no waste and allow none to be committed 
upon the land, nor permit any unavoidable nuisance to be maintained on 
the premises under his/her control.
    (b) Before commencing a drilling operation, Lessee shall pay or 
tender to the surface owner commencement money in the amount of $25 per 
seismic shot hole and commencement money in the amount of $300 for each 
well, after which Lessee shall be entitled to immediate possession of 
the drilling site. Commencement money will not be required for the 
redrilling of a well which was originally drilled under the currently 
lease. A drilling site shall be held to the minimum area essential for 
operations and shall not exceed one

[[Page 755]]

and one-half acres in area unless authorized by the Superintendent. 
Commencement money shall be a credit toward the settlement of the total 
damages. Acceptance of commencement money by the surface owner does not 
affect his/her right to compensation for damages as described in Sec. 
226.20, occasioned by the drilling and completion of the well for which 
it was paid. Since actual damage to the surface from operations cannot 
necessarily be ascertained prior to the completion of a well as a 
serviceable well or dry hole, a damage settlement covering the drilling 
operation need not be made until after completion of drilling 
operations.
    (c) Where the surface is restricted land, commencement money shall 
be paid to the Superintendent for the landowner. All other surface 
owners shall be paid or tendered such commencement money direct. Where 
such surface owners are not residents of Osage County nor have a 
representative located therein, such payment shall be made or tendered 
to the last known address of the surface owner at least 5 days before 
commencing drilling operation on any well: Provided, That should lessee 
be unable to reach the owner of the surface of the land for the purpose 
of tendering the commencement money or if the owner of the surface of 
the land shall refuse to accept the same, lessee shall deposit such 
amount with the Superintendent by check payable to the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs. The superintendent shall thereupon advise the owner of the 
surface of the land by mail at his last known address that the 
commencement money is being held for payment to him upon his written 
request.
    (d) Lessee shall also pay fees for tank sites not exceeding 50 feet 
square at the rate of $100 per tank site or other vessel: Provided, That 
no payment shall be due for a tank temporarily set on a well location 
site for drilling, completing, or testing. The sum to be paid for a tank 
occupying more than 50 feet square shall be agreed upon between the 
surface owner and lessee or, on failure to agree, the same shall be 
determined by arbitration as provided by Sec. 226.21.

[39 FR 22254, June 22, 1974, as amended at 43 FR 8136, Feb. 28, 1978; 43

amended at 55 FR 33115, Aug. 14, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 226.20  Settlement of damages claimed.

    (a) Lessee or his authorized representative or geophysical permittee 
shall pay for all damages to growing crops, any improvements on the 
lands, and all other surface damages as may be occasioned by operations. 
Commencement money shall be a credit toward the settlement of the total 
damages occasioned by the drilling and completion of the well for which 
it was paid. Such damages shall be paid to the owner of the surface and 
by him apportioned among the parties interested in the surface, whether 
as owner, surface lessee, or otherwise, as the parties may mutually 
agree or as their interests may appear. If lessee or his authorized 
representative and surface owner are unable to agree concerning damages, 
the same shall be determined by arbitration. Nothing herein contained 
shall be construed to deny any party the right to file an action in a 
court of competent jurisdiction if he is dissatisfied with the amount of 
the award.
    (b) Surface owners shall notify their lessees or tenants of the 
regulations in this part and of the necessary procedure to follow in all 
cases of alleged damages. If so authorized in writing, surface lessees 
or tenants may represent the surface owners.
    (c) In settlement of damages on restricted land all sums due and 
payable shall be paid to the Superintendent for credit to the account of 
the Indian entitled thereto. The Superintendent will make the 
apportionment between the Indian landowner or owners and surface Lessee 
of record.
    (d) Any person claiming an interest in any leased tract or in 
damages thereto, must furnish to the Superintendent a statement in 
writing showing said claimed interest. Failure to furnish such statement 
shall constitute a waiver of notice and estop said person from claiming 
any part of such

[[Page 756]]

damages after the same shall have been disbursed.

<R05>
Sec. 226.21  Procedure for settlement of damages claimed.

    Where the surface owner or his lessee suffers damage due to the oil 
and gas operations and/or marketing of oil or gas by lessee or his 
authorized representative, the procedure for recovery shall be as 
follows:
    (a) The party or parties aggrieved shall, as soon as possible after 
the discovery of any damages, serve written notice to Lessee or his 
authorized representative as provided by Sec. 226.18. Written notice 
shall contain the nature and location of the alleged damages, the date 
of occurrence, the names of the party or parties causing said damages, 
and the amount of damages. It is not intended by this requirement to 
limit the time within which action may be brought in the courts to less 
than the 90-day period allowed by section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1929 
(45 Stat. 1478, 1479).
    (b) If the alleged damages are not adjusted at the time of such 
notice, Lessee or his authorized representative shall try to adjust the 
claim with the party or parties aggrieved within 20 days from receipt of 
the notice. If the claimant is the owner of restricted property and a 
settlement results, a copy of the settlement agreement shall be filed 
with the Superintendent. If the settlement agreement is approved by the 
Superintendent, payment shall be made to the Superintendent for the 
benefit of said claimant.
    (c) If the parties fail to adjust the claim within the 20 days 
specified, then within 10 days thereafter each of the interested parties 
shall appoint an arbitrator who immediately upon their appointment shall 
agree upon a third arbitrator. If the two arbitrators shall fail to 
agree upon a third arbitrator within 10 days, they shall immediately 
notify the parties in interest. If said parties cannot agree upon a 
third arbitrator within 5 days after receipt of such notice, the 
Superintendent shall appoint the third arbitrator.
    (d) As soon as the third arbitrator is appointed, the arbitrators 
shall meet; hear the evidence and arguments of the parties; and examine 
the lands, crops, improvements, or other property alleged to have been 
injured. Within 10 days they shall render their decision as to the 
amount of the damage due. The arbitrators shall be disinterested 
persons. The fees and expenses of the third arbitrator shall be borne 
equally by the claimant and Lessee or his authorized representative. 
Each Lessee or his authorized representative and claimant shall pay the 
fee and expenses for the arbitrator appointed by him.
    (e) When an act of an oil or gas lessee or his authorized 
representative results in injury to both the surface owner and his 
lessee, the parties aggrieved shall join in the appointment of an 
arbitrator. Where the injury complained of is chargeable to one or more 
oil or gas Lessee, or his authorized representative, such lessee or said 
representative shall join in the appointment of an arbitrator.
    (f) Any two of the arbitrators may make a decision as to the amount 
of damage due. The decision shall be in writing and shall be served 
forthwith upon the parties in interest. Each party shall have 90 days 
from the date the decision is served in which to file an action in a 
court of competent jurisdiction. If no such action is filed within said 
time and the award is against Lessee or his/her authorized 
representative, he/she shall pay the same, together with interest at an 
annual rate established for the Internal Revenue Service from date of 
award, within 10 days after the expiration of said period for filing an 
action.
    (g) Lessee or his authorized representative shall file with the 
Superintendent a report on each settlement agreement, setting out the 
nature and location of the damage, date, and amount of the settlement, 
and any other pertinent information.

Sec. 226.22  Prohibition of pollution.

    (a) All operators, contractors, drillers, service companies, pipe 
pulling and salvaging contractors, or other persons, shall at all times 
conduct their operations and drill, equip, operate, produce, plug and 
abandon all wells drilled for oil or gas, service wells or exploratory 
wells (including seismic, core and stratigraphic holes) in a manner that 
will prevent pollution and the migration of oil, gas, salt water or 
other substance from one stratum into another, including any fresh water 
bearing formation.
    (b) Pits for drilling mud or deleterious substance used in the 
drilling, completion, recompletion, or workover of any well shall be 
constructed and maintained to prevent pollution of surface and 
subsurface fresh water. These pits shall be enclosed with a fence of at 
least four strands of barbed wire, or an approved substitute, stretched 
taut to adequately braced corner posts, unless the surface owner, user, 
or the Superintendent gives consent to the contrary. Immediately after 
completion of operations, pits shall be emptied and leveled unless 
otherwise requested by surface owner or user.
    (c) Drilling pits shall be adequate to contain mud and other 
material extracted from wells and shall have adequate storage to 
maintain a supply of mud for use in emergencies.
    (d) No earthen pit, except those used in the drilling, completion, 
recompletion or workover of a well, shall be constructed, enlarged, 
reconstructed or used without approval of the Superintendent. Unlined 
earthen pits shall not be used for the continued storage of salt water 
or other deleterious substances.
    (e) Deleterious fluids other than fresh water drilling fluids used 
in drilling or workover operations, which are displaced or produced in

<R05>
Sec. 226.24  Lessee's use of water.

    Lessee or his contractor may, with the approval of the 
Superintendent, use water from streams and natural water courses to the 
extent that same does not diminish the supply below the requirements of 
the surface owner from whose land the water is taken. Similarly, Lessee 
or his contractor may use water from reservoirs formed by the 
impoundment of water from such streams and natural water courses, 
provided such use does not exceed the quantity to which they originally 
would have been entitled had the reservoirs not been constructed. Lessee 
or his contractor may install necessary lines and other equipment within 
the Osage Mineral Estate to obtain such water. Any damage resulting from 
such installation shall be settled as provided in Sec. 226.21.


<R05>
Sec. 226.25  Gas well drilled by oil lessees and vice versa.

    Prior to drilling, the oil or gas lessee shall notify the other 
lessees of his/her intent to drill. When an oil lessee in drilling a 
well encounters a formation or zone having indications of possible gas 
production, or the gas lessee in drilling a well encounters a formation

[[Page 758]]

or zone having indication of possible oil production, he/she shall 
immediately notify the other lessee and the Superintendent. Lessee 
drilling the well shall obtain all information which a prudent operator 
utilizes to evaluate the productive capability of such formation or 
zone.
    (a) Gas well to be turned over to gas lessee. If the oil lessee 
drills a gas well, he/she shall, without removing from the well any of 
the casing or other equipment, immediately shut the well in and notify 
the gas lessee and the Superintendent. If the gas lessee does not, 
within 45 days after receiving notice and cost of drilling, elect to 
take over such well and reimburse the oil lessee the cost of drilling, 
including all damages paid and the cost in-place of casing, tubing, and 
other equipment, the oil lessee shall immediately confine the gas to the 
original stratum. The disposition of such well and the production 
therefrom shall then be subject to the approval of the Superintendent. 
In the event the oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of 
the well, such cost shall be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee 
by the Superintendent. If such apportionment is not accepted, the well 
shall be plugged by the oil and gas lessee who drilled the well.
    (b) Oil well to be turned over to oil lessee. If the gas lessee 
drills an oil well, he/she must immediately, without removing from the 
well any of the casing or other equipment, notify the oil lessee and the 
superintendent.
    (1) If the oil lessee does not, within 45 days after receipt of 
notice and cost of drilling, elect to take over the well, he/she must 
immediately notify the gas lessee. From that point, the superintendent 
must approve the disposition of the well, and any gas produced from it.
    (2) If the oil lessee chooses to take over the well, he/she must pay 
to the gas lessee:
    (i) The cost of drilling the well, including all damages paid; and
    (ii) The cost in place of casing and other equipment.
    (3) If the oil lessee and the gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of 
the well, the superintendent will apportion the cost between the oil and 
gas lessees. If the lessees do not accept the apportionment, the oil or 
gas lessee who drilled the well must plug the well.
    (c) Lands not leased. If the gas lessee shall drill an oil well upon 
lands not leased for oil purposes or vice versa, the Superintendent may, 
until such time as said lands are leased, permit the lessee who drilled 
the well to operate and market the production therefrom. When said lands 
are leased, the lessee who drilled and completed the well shall be 
reimbursed by the oil or gas lessee, for the cost of drilling said well, 
including all damages paid and the cost in-place of casing, tubing, and 
other equipment. If the lessee does not elect to take over said well as 
provided above, the disposition of such well and the production 
therefrom shall be determined by the Superintendent. In the event the 
oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, such 
cost shall be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee by the 
Superintendent. If such apportionment is not accepted, the well shall be 
plugged by the oil and gas lessee who drilled the well.

<R05>
Sec. 226.26  Determining cost of well.

    The term ``cost of drilling'' as applied where one lessee takes over 
a well drilled by another, shall include all reasonable, usual, 
necessary, and proper expenditures. A list of expenses mentioned in this 
section shall be presented to proposed purchasing lessee within 10 days 
after the completion of the well. In the event of a disagreement between 
the parties as to the charges assessed against the well that is to be 
taken over, such charges shall be determined by the Superintendent.


<R05>
Sec. 226.27  Gas for operating purposes and tribal use.

    (a) Gas to be furnished oil lessee. Lessee of a producing gas lease 
shall furnish the oil lessee sufficient gas for operating purposes at a 
rate to be agreed upon, or on failure to agree the rate shall be 
determined by the Superintendent: Provided, That the oil lessee

[[Page 759]]

shall at his own expense and risk, furnish and install the necessary 
connections to the gas lessee's well or pipeline. All such connections 
shall be reported in writing to the Superintendent.
    (b) Use of gas by Osage Tribe. (1) Gas from any well or wells shall 
be furnished any Tribal-owned building or enterprise at a rate not to 
exceed the price less royalty being received or offered by a gas 
purchaser: Provided, That such requirement shall be subject to the 
determination by the Superintendent that gas in sufficient quantities is 
available above that needed for lease operation and that no waste would 
result. In the absence of a gas purchaser the rate to be paid by the 
Osage Tribe shall be determined by the Superintendent based on prices 
being paid by purchasers in the Osage Mineral Estate. The Osage Tribe is 
to furnish all necessary material and labor for such connection with 
Lessee's gas system. The use of such gas shall be at the risk of the 
Osage Tribe at all times.
    (2) Any member of the Osage Tribe residing in Osage County and 
outside a corporate city is entitled to the use at his own expense of 
not to exceed 400,000 cubic feet of gas per calendar year for his 
principal residence at a rate not to exceed the amount paid by a gas 
purchaser plus 10 percent: Provided, That such requirement shall be 
subject to the determination by the Superintendent that gas in 
sufficient quantities is available above that needed for lease operation 
and that no waste would result. In the absence of a gas purchaser the 
amount to be paid by the Tribal member shall be determined by the 
Superintendent. Gas to Tribal members is not royalty free. The Tribal 
member is to furnish all necessary material and labor for such 
connection to Lessee's gas system, and shall maintain his own lines. The 
use of such gas shall be at the risk of the Tribal member at all times.
    (3) Gas furnished by Lessee under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this 
section may be terminated only with the approval of the Superintendent. 
Written application for termination must be made to the Superintendent 
showing justification.

                         Cessation of Operations


<R05>
Sec. 226.28  Shutdown, abandonment, and plugging of wells.

    No productive well shall be abandoned until its lack for further 
profitable production of oil and/or gas has been demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Superintendent. Lessee shall not shut down, abandon, 
or otherwise discontinue the operation or use of any well for any 
purpose without the written approval of the Superintendent. All 
applications for such approval shall be submitted to the Superintendent 
on forms furnished by him/her.
    (a) Application for authority to permanently shut down or 
discontinue use or operation of a well shall set forth justification, 
probable duration the means by which the well bore is to be protected, 
and the contemplated eventual disposition of the well. The method of 
conditioning such well shall be subject to the approval of the 
Superintendent.
    (b) Prior to permanent abandonment of any well, the oil lessee or 
the gas lessee, as the case may be, shall offer the well to the other 
for his recompletion or use under such terms as may be mutually agreed 
upon but not in conflict with the regulations. Failure of the Lessee 
receiving the offer to reply within 10 days after receipt thereof shall 
be deemed as rejection of the offer. If, after indicating acceptance, 
the two parties cannot agree on the terms of the offer within 30 days, 
the disposition of such well shall be determined by the Superintendent.
    (c) The Superintendent is authorized to shut in a lease when the 
lessee fails to comply with the terms of the lease, the regulations, 
and/or orders of the Superintendent.

Sec. 226.29  Disposition of casings and other improvements.

    (a) Upon termination of lease, permanent improvements, unless 
otherwise provided by written agreement with the surface owner and filed 
with the Superintendent, shall remain a part of said land and become the 
property of the surface owner upon termination of

[[Page 760]]

the lease, other than by cancellation. Exceptions include personal 
property not limited to tools, tanks, pipelines, pumping and drilling 
equipment, derricks, engines, machinery, tubing, and the casings of all 
wells: Provided, That when any lease terminates, all such personal 
property shall be removed the word ``terminates''; and in the last 
sentence of the paragraph, within 90 days or such reasonable extension 
of time as may be granted by the Superintendent. Otherwise, the 
ownership of all casings shall revert to Lessor and all other personal 
property and permanent improvements to the surface owner. Nothing herein 
shall be construed to relieve lessee of responsibility for removing any 
such personal property or permanent improvements from the premises if 
required by the Superintendent and restoring the premises as nearly as 
practicable to the original state.
    (b) Upon cancellation of lease. When there has been a cancellation 
for cause, Lessor shall be entitled and authorized to take immediate 
possession of the lease premises and all permanent improvements and all 
other equipment necessary for the operation of the lease.
    (c) Wells to be abandoned shall be promptly plugged as prescribed by 
the Superintendent. Applications to plug shall include a statement 
affirming compliance with Sec. 226.28(b) and shall set forth reasons 
for plugging, a detailed statement of the proposed work including kind, 
location, and length of plugs (by depth), plans for mudding and 
cementing, testing, parting and removing casing, and any other pertinent 
information: Provided, That the Superintendent may give oral permission 
and instructions pending receipt of a written application to plug a 
newly drilled hole. Lessee shall remit a fee of $15 with each written 
application for authority to plug a well. This fee will be refunded if 
permission is not granted.
    (d) Lessee shall plug and fill all dry or abandoned wells in a 
manner to confine the fluid in each formation bearing fresh water, oil, 
gas, salt water, and other minerals, and to protect it against invasion 
of fluids from other sources. Mud-laden fluid, cement, and other plugs 
shall be used to fill the hole from bottom to top: Provided, That if a 
satisfactory agreement is reached between Lessee and the surface owner, 
subject to the approval of the Superintendent, Lessee may condition the 
well for use as a fresh water well and shall so indicate on the plugging 
record. The manner in which plugging material shall be introduced and 
the type of material so used shall be subject to the approval of the 
Superintendent. Within 10 days after plugging, Lessee shall file with 
the Superintendent a complete report of the plugging of each well. When 
any well is plugged and abandoned, Lessee shall, within 90 days, clean 
up the premises around such well to the satisfaction of the 
Superintendent.

Sec. 227.2  Applications for leases.

    Applications for leases should be made to the superintendent.


<R05>
Sec. 227.3  Leases to citizens of the United States except Government employees.

    Leases will be made only to persons who are citizens of the United 
States or have declared their intention to become so, or corporations 
which are organized under the laws of the United States or one of the 
States or Territories: Provided, That no lease, assignment thereof, or 
interest therein will be approved to any employee or employees of the 
United States Government, whether connected with the Bureau or 
otherwise, and no employee of the Interior Department shall be permitted 
to acquire any interest in such leases by ownership of stock in 
corporations having leases or in any other manner.

(R.S. 2078; 25 U.S.C. 68)


<R05>
Sec. 227.4  Sale of oil and gas leases.

    (a) At such times and in such manner as he may deem appropriate, 
after being authorized by the Joint Business Council of the Shoshone and 
Arapahoe Tribes or its authorized representative, the superintendent 
shall publish notices at least thirty days prior to the sale, unless a 
shorter period is authorized by the Secretary of the Interior or his 
authorized representative, that oil and gas leases on specific tracts, 
each of which shall be in a reasonably compact body, will be offered to 
the highest responsible bidder for a bonus consideration, in addition to 
stipulated rentals and royalties. Each bid must be accompanied by a 
cashier's check, certified check, or postal money order, payable to the 
payee designated in the invitation to bid, in an amount not less than 25 
percent of the bonus bid. Within 30 days after notification of being the 
successful bidder, said bidder must remit the balance of the bonus, the 
first year's rental, and his share of the advertising costs, and shall 
file with the superintendent the lease in completed form. The 
superintendent may for good and sufficient reasons, extend the time for 
completion and submission of the lease form, but no extension shall be 
granted for remitting the balance of monies due. If the successful 
bidder fails to pay the full consideration within said period, or fails 
to file the completed lease within said period or extension thereof, or 
if the lease is disapproved through no fault of the lessor or the 
Department of the Interior, 25 percent of the bonus bid will be 
forfeited for the use and benefit of the Shoshone and Arapahoe Tribes.
    (b) All notices or advertisements of sales of oil and gas leases 
shall reserve to the Secretary of the Interior the right to reject all 
bids when in his judgment the interests of the Indians will be best 
served by so doing, and that if no satisfactory bid is received, or if 
the accepted bidder fails to complete the lease, or if the Secretary of 
the Interior shall determine that it is

[[Page 765]]

unwise in the interests of the Indians to accept the highest bid, the 
Secretary may readvertise such lease for sale, or if deemed advisable, 
with the consent of the tribal council or other governing tribal 
authorities, a lease may be made by private negotiations. The successful 
bidder or bidders will be required to pay his or their share of the 
advertising costs. Amounts received from unsuccessful bidders will be 
returned; but when no bid is accepted on a tract, the costs of 
advertising will be assessed against the applicant who requested that 
said tract be advertised.

<R05>
Sec. 227.5  Terms of leases, procedure for renewal and execution.

    (a) Leases shall be for a period of twenty years with the 
preferential right in the lessee to renew the same for successive 
periods of ten years each upon such reasonable terms and conditions as 
may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative, unless otherwise provided by law at the expiration of 
any such period. Applications for renewal of leases shall be filed with 
the superintendent within ninety days prior to the date of expiration of 
the lease. One copy of the application for renewal shall be filed by the 
applicant with the Joint Business Council of the Shoshone and Arapahoe 
Tribes and no lease shall be renewed unless the Joint Business Council 
or its authorized representative is afforded an opportunity to present 
the Council's views to the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized 
representative.
    (b) The Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative 
may execute oil and gas leases with the consent of the Joint Business 
Council or its authorized representative, and may execute renewals of 
leases after consultation with the Joint Business Council or its 
authorized representative.

evidence of authority of its officers to execute papers; and with its 
first application it shall also file a certified copy of its articles of 
incorporation, and, if foreign to the state in which the lands are 
located, evidence showing compliance with the corporation laws thereof. 
Statements of changes in officers and stockholders shall be furnished by 
a corporation lessee to the superintendent January 1 of each year, and

assessment.
    (iii) The amount of cash the company has in its treasury and

Exchange Commission, see 17 CFR chapter II.


<R05>
Sec. 227.7  Additional information from applicant.

    The superintendent may, either before or after approval of a lease, 
call for any additional information desired to carry out the regulations 
in this part. If a lessee shall fail to furnish the papers necessary to 
put his lease and bond in proper form for consideration, the 
superintendent shall forward such lease for disapproval.


<R05>

    No person, firm, or corporation will be allowed to lease for oil and 
gas more than 10,240 acres in the aggregate. The land contained in the

executed to cover only adjoining or contiguous subdivisions. In case a 
lessee is a successful bidder for two or more tracts of land which are 
not contiguous, separate leases shall be executed.


<R05>
Sec. 227.10  Minerals other than oil and gas.

    Unreserved, unwithdrawn, and unallotted lands which have not been 
leased for oil and gas under the act of August 21, 1916 (39 Stat. 519) 
and which are not chiefly valuable therefor, are subject to mineral

    Where lands have been leased under authority of said act of August 
21, 1916 (39 Stat. 519), and nonmineral entry is subsequently lawfully

therefor, all such subsequently allowed nonmineral entries shall be with 
the mineral reservation prescribed by the act of July 17, 1914 (38 Stat. 
509).


<R05>
Sec. 227.13  Vested rights to be respected.

    All drilling and other oil and natural gas developments and mining 
operations, work, and improvements, and all other acts and things 
necessary to be done, in connection with the exploration for mining and 
production of oil and natural gas from the leased premises, under the 
terms and conditions of a lease shall be performed with due regard to 
the rights, statutory and otherwise, of others, if any, who may have or 
who may acquire a lawful claim or estate to the leased premises, 
separate and distinct from the oil and gas or other mineral therein 
contained. See act of July 17, 1914 (38 Stat. 509).


<R05>
Sec. 227.14  Government reserves right to purchase oil and gas.

    In time of war or other public emergency any of the executive

                           Rents and Royalties


<R05>
Sec. 227.15  Manner of payment.

    All payments due the lessor shall be made to the superintendent for 
the benefit of the Shoshone Indian Tribe, in accordance with the act of 
August 21, 1916 (39 Stat. 519), and no credit will be given any lessee 
for payments made otherwise. Payments of rentals and royalties except 
the first year's rental, which shall be paid to the superintendent as 
prescribed in Sec. 227.4 shall be transmitted to the superintendent 
through the supervisor. All such payments shall be accompanied by a 
statement, in triplicate, by the lessee, showing the specific items of 
royalty or

[[Page 767]]

rental that the remittance is intended to cover, and payment of 
royalties on production shall be made not later than the last day of the 
calendar month following the production for which such payment is to be 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 227.16  Crediting advance annual payments.

    In the event of discovery of minerals in paying quantities all 
advance rents and advance royalties shall be allowed as credit on 
stipulated royalties as they accrue for the year for which such advance 
payments have been made. No refund of any such advance payment made 
under any lease will be allowed in the event the royalty on production 
for the year is not sufficient to equal such advance payment; nor will 
any part of the moneys so paid be refunded to the lessee because of any 
subsequent surrender or cancellation of the lease.


<R05>
Sec. 227.17  Rates of rents and royalties.

    (a) The lessee shall pay, beginning with the date of execution of 
leases by the Secretary of the Interior, a rental of $1.25 per acre per 
annum in advance during the continuance thereof, together with a royalty 
of 12\1/2\ percent of the value or amount of all oil, gas, and/or 
natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and 
saved from the land leased, save and except oil and/or gas used by the 
lessee for development and operation purposes on the lease, which oil or 
gas shall be royalty free. A higher rate of royalty may be fixed by the 
Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative, prior to the 
advertisement of land for oil and gas leases. During the period of 
supervision, ``value'' for the purposes of the lease may, in the 
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be calculated on the basis 
of the highest price paid or offered (whether calculated on the basis of 
short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion 
of the oil of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or 
all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold from the field where 
the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable 
product less the content of foreign substances as determined by the 
supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the sale of 
said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, 
be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of such value. When 
paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly at such 
time as the lease provides; when royalty on oil produced is paid in 
kind, such royalty oil shall be delivered in tanks provided by the 
lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless 
otherwise agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be 
required by the lessor. The lessee shall not be required to hold such 
royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar 
month in which said oil is produced. The lessee shall be in no manner 
responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil by causes 
beyond his control.
    (b) The proceeds from all leases shall be taken up in the accounts 
of the superintendent for appropriate deposit for the benefit of the 
Indians.


<R05>
Sec. 227.18  Free use of gas by lessor.

    If the leased premises produce gas in excess of the lessee's 
requirements for the development and operation of said premises, then 
the lessor may use sufficient gas, free of charge, for any desired 
school or other buildings belonging to the tribe, by making his own 
connections to a regulator installed, connected to the well and 
maintained by the lessee, and the lessee shall not be required to pay 
royalty on gas so used. The use of such gas shall be at the lessor's 
risk at all times.


<R05>
Sec. 227.19  Division orders.

    (a) Lessees may make arrangements with the purchasers of oil for the 
payment of the royalties on production to the superintendent by such 
purchasers, but such arrangements, if made, shall not operate to relieve 
a lessee from responsibility should the purchaser fail or refuse to pay 
such royalties when due. Where lessees avail themselves of this 
privilege, division orders permitting the pipeline companies or other 
purchasers of the oil to withhold the royalty interest shall be executed 
and forwarded to the supervisor for approval, as pipeline companies are 
not permitted to accept or run oil from

[[Page 768]]

leased Indian lands until after the approval of a division order showing 
that the lessee has a lease regularly approved and in effect. When the 
lessee company runs its own oil, it shall execute an intracompany 
division order and forward it to the supervisor for his consideration. 
The right is reserved for the supervisor to cancel a division order at 
any time or require the pipeline company to discontinue to run the oil 
of any lessee who fails to operate the lease properly or otherwise 
violates the provisions of the lease, of the regulations in this part, 
or of the operating regulations.
    (b) When oil is taken by authority of a division order, the lessee 
or his representatives shall be actually present when the oil is gaged 
and records are made of the temperature, gravity and impurities. The 
lessee will be held responsible for the correctness and the correct 
recording and reporting of all the foregoing measurements, which except 
lowest gage, shall be made at the time the oil is turned into the 
pipeline. Failure of the lessee to perform properly these duties will 
subject the division order to revocation.

    Cross Reference: For oil and gas operating regulations of the 
Geological Survey, see 30 CFR part 221.

<R05>
Sec. 227.20  Permission to start operations.

    (a) No operations will be permitted on any lease before it is 
executed by the Secretary of the Interior.
    (b) Written permission must be secured from the supervisor or his 
representative before any operations are started on the leased premises. 
After such permission is secured the operations must be in accordance 
with the operating regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the 
Interior. Copies of the regulations in this part may be secured from 
either the supervisor or the superintendent, and no operations should be 
attempted without a study of the operating regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 227.21  Restrictions on operations.

    (a) All leases issued under the provisions of the regulations in 
this part shall be subject to imposition by the Secretary of the 
Interior of such restrictions as to time or times for the drilling of 
wells and as to the production from any well or wells as in his judgment 
may be necessary or proper for the protection of the natural resources 
of the leased land and in the interest of the lessor. In the exercise of 
his judgment the Secretary of the Interior may take into consideration, 
among other things, the Federal laws, State laws, regulations by 
competent Federal or State authorities, lawful agreements among 
operators regulating either drilling or production, or both, and any 
regulatory action desired by tribal authorities.
    (b) All leases issued pursuant to the regulations in this part shall 
be subject to a co-operative or unit development plan affecting the 
leased lands if and when required by the Secretary of the Interior, but 
no lease shall participate in any cooperative or unit plan without prior 
approval of the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 227.22  Diligence and prevention of waste.

    The lessee shall exercise diligence in drilling and operating wells 
for oil and gas on the leased lands while such products can be secured 
in paying quantities; carry on all operations in a good and workmanlike 
manner in accordance with approved methods and practice, having due 
regard for the prevention of waste of oil or gas developed on the land, 
or the entrance of water through wells drilled by the lessee to the 
productive sands or oil or gas-bearing strata to the destruction or 
injury of the oil or gas deposits, the preservation and conservation of 
the property for future productive operations, and to the health and 
safety of workmen and employees; plug securely all wells before 
abandoning the same and to shut off effectually all water from the oil 
or gas-bearing strata; not drill any well within 200 feet of any house 
or barn on the premises without the lessor's written consent; carry out 
at his expense all reasonable orders and requirements of the supervisor 
relative to prevention of waste, and preservation of the property and 
the health and safety of workmen; bury all pipelines crossing tillable

Sec. 227.23  Wells.

    The lessee shall agree (a) to drill and produce all wells necessary 
to offset or protect the leased land from drainage by wells on adjoining 
lands not the property of the lessor, or in lieu thereof, compensate the 
lessor in full each month for the estimated loss of royalty through 
drainage: Provided, That during the period of supervision by the 
Secretary of the Interior, the necessity for offset wells shall be 
determined by the supervisor and payment in lieu of drilling and 
producing shall be with the consent of, and in an amount determined by 
the Secretary of the Interior; (b) at the election of the lessee to 
drill and produce other wells: Provided, That the right to drill and 
produce such other wells shall be subject to any system of well spacing 
or production allotments authorized and approved under the applicable 
law or regulations, approved by the Secretary of the Interior and 
affecting the field or area in which the leased lands are situated; and 
(c) if the lessee elects not to drill and produce such other wells for 
any period the Secretary of the Interior may, within 10 days after due 
notice in writing, either require the drilling and production of such 
wells to the number necessary, in his opinion, to insure reasonable 
diligence in the development and operation of the property, or may in 
lieu of such additional diligent drilling and production require the 
payment on and after the first anniversary date of the lease of not to 
exceed $1 per acre per annum, which sum shall be in addition to any 
rental or royalty herein specified.


<R05>
Sec. 227.24  Penalties.

    Failure of the lessee to comply with any provisions of the lease, of 
the operating regulations, of the regulations in this part, orders of 
the superintendent or his representative, or of the orders of the 
supervisor or his representative, shall subject the lessee to a penalty 
of not more than $500 per day for each day the terms of the lease, the 
regulations, or such orders are violated: Provided, That the lessee 
shall be entitled to notice, and hearing within 30 days after such 
notice, with respect to the terms of the lease, regulations, or orders 
violated, which hearing shall be held by the supervisor, whose findings 
shall be conclusive unless an appeal be taken to the Secretary of the 
Interior within 30 days after notice of the supervisor's decision, and 
the decision of the Secretary of the Interior upon appeal shall be 
conclusive.


<R05>
Sec. 227.25  Inspection of premises, books and accounts.

    Lessee shall agree to allow the lessor and his agents or any 
authorized representative of the Interior Department to enter, from time 
to time, upon and into all parts of the leased premises for the purposes 
of inspection and shall further agree to keep a full and correct account 
of all operations and make reports thereof, as required by the 
applicable regulations of the Department; and their books and records, 
showing manner of operations and persons interested, shall be open at 
all times for examination of such officers of the Department as shall be 
instructed in writing by the Secretary of the Interior or authorized by 
regulations, to make such examination.


<R05>
Sec. 227.26  Assignments and overriding royalties.

    (a) Leases, or any interest therein, may be assigned or transferred 
only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and to procure 
such approval the assignee must be qualified to hold such lease under 
existing rules and regulations, and shall furnish a satisfactory bond 
for the faithful performance of the covenants and conditions thereof. No 
lease or any interest therein, or the use of such lease, shall be 
assigned, sublet, or transferred directly or indirectly, by working or 
drilling contract, or otherwise without the consent of the Secretary of 
the Interior. Assignments of leases shall be filed with the 
superintendent within 20 days after the date of execution.

in any part of the following area: from the point at which meridian 
132[deg]17[min]30[sec], thence due east along said parallel to longitude 
130[deg]49[min]15[sec], then due south along said meridian to the point 
at which it intersects with the United States-Canadian boundary, thence

however, that the Secretary or his duly authorized representative may 
upon request by the Metlakatla Indian Community, authorize fishing for

authorized representative may, upon request by the Metlakatla Indian 
Community authorize such other commercial fishing at such times as he 
shall prescribe, which authorization shall be based upon the following 
criteria:
    (1) Number of fish required for spawning escapement and any other 
requirements reasonable and necessary for conservation;
    (2) Fair and equitable sharing of the fishery resource with other 
user groups fishing in State waters under State law and within the State

the Government in the future for purposes of reestablishing a reindeer 
loan program, are held by the United States in trust for Alaska Natives. 
Other Alaskan reindeer are the private property of the Alaska Native 
owners. However, a trust responsibility continues to exist with respect 
to all Alaskan reindeer, insofar as the Government remains responsible 
for carrying out the provisions of the Reindeer Act and these 
regulations, including the provisions requiring approval of transfers to 
non-Natives, and providing for the determination of inheritance.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 249.1  Purpose.

    (a) The purposes of these regulations (part 249) are:
    (1) To assist in protecting the off-reservation nonexclusive fishing 
rights which are secured to certain Indian tribes by their treaties with 
the United States;
    (2) To promote the proper management, conservation and protection of 
fisheries resources which are subject to such treaties of the United 
States;
    (3) To provide for determination of restrictions on the manner of 
exercising nonexclusive fishing privileges under rights secured to 
Indian tribes by such treaties of the United States necessary for 
conservation of the fisheries resources;
    (4) To assist in the orderly administration of Indian Affairs;
    (5) To encourage consultation and cooperation between the states and 
Indian tribes in the management and improvement of fisheries resources 
affected by such treaties;
    (6) To assist the states in enforcing their laws and regulations for 
the management and conservation of fisheries resources in a manner 
compatible with the treaties of the United States which are applicable 
to such resources.
    (b) The conservation regulations of this part 249 are found to be 
necessary to assure that the nonexclusive rights secured to certain 
Indian tribes by treaties of the United States to fish at usual and 
accustomed places outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation shall 
be protected and preserved for the benefit of present and future members 
of such tribes in a manner consistent with the nonexclusive character of 
such rights. Any exercise of an Indian off-reservation treaty fishing 
right shall be in accordance with this part and any applicable area 
regulations issued hereunder.

[32 FR 10434, July 15, 1967. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982; 
48 FR 13414, Mar. 31, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 249.2  Area regulations.

    (a) The Secretary of the Interior may upon request of an Indian 
tribe, request of a State Governor, or upon his own motion, and upon 
finding that Federal regulation of Indian fishing in any waters in which 
Indians have a treaty-secured nonexclusive fishing right is necessary to 
assure the conservation and wise utilization of the fishery resources 
for the present and future use and enjoyment of the Indians and other 
persons entitled thereto, promulgate regulations to govern the exercise 
of such treaty-secured fishing right in such waters for the purpose of 
preventing, in conjunction with appropriate State conservation laws and 
regulations governing fishing by persons not fishing under treaty 
rights, the deterioration of the fishery resources.
    (b) In formulating such regulations the Secretary of the Interior 
may incorporate such State laws or regulations, or such tribal 
regulations as have been approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 
as he finds to be consistent with the Indians' rights under the Treaty 
and the conservation of the fishery resources.
    (c) Before promulgating such regulations the Secretary of the 
Interior will seek the views of the affected Indian tribes, of the fish 
or game management agency or agencies of any affected State, and of 
other interested persons. Except in emergencies where the Secretary 
finds that the exigencies require the promulgation of regulations to be 
effective immediately, a notice of proposed rule making will be 
published in the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 to 
afford an opportunity to submit comments and information, at such times 
and in such manner as may be specified in the notice. In the event of 
the emergency promulgation of regulations, interested persons will be 
afforded, as soon as possible, an opportunity to request amendment or 
revocation thereof.
    (d) Any regulations issued pursuant to this section shall contain 
provisions for invoking emergency closures or restrictions or the 
relaxation thereof at the field level when necessary or appropriate to 
meet conditions not foreseeable at the time the regulations were issued.
    (e) Regulations issued pursuant to this Sec. 249.2 may include such 
requirements for recording and reporting catch statistics as the 
appropriate state fish and game agencies or the

[[Page 785]]

Secretary of the Interior deem necessary for effective fishery 
management.


<R05>
Sec. 249.3  Identification cards.

    (a) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall arrange for the 
issuance of an appropriate identification card to any Indian entitled 
thereto as prima facie evidence that the authorized holder thereof is 
entitled to exercise the fishing rights secured by the treaty designated 
thereon. The Commissioner may cause a federal card to be issued for this 
purpose or may authorize the issuance of cards by proper tribal 
authorities: Provided, That any such tribal cards shall be countersigned 
by an authorized officer of the Bureau of Indian Affairs certifying that 
the person named on the card is a member of the tribe issuing such card 
and that said tribe is recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as 
having fishing rights under the treaty specified on such card. Copies of 
the form of any identification card authorized pursuant to this section 
and a list of the authorized Bureau of Indian Affairs issuing or 
countersigning officials shall be furnished to the fisheries management 
and enforcement agencies of any State in which such fishing rights may 
be exercised.
    (b) No such card shall be issued to any Indian who is not on the 
official membership roll of the tribe which has been approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior. Provided, That until further notice, a 
temporary card may be issued to any member of a tribe not having an 
approved current membership roll who submits evidence of his/her 
entitlement thereto satisfactory to the issuing officer and, in the case 
of a tribally issued card, to the countersigning officer. Any Indian 
claiming to have been wrongfully denied a card may appeal the decision 
in accordance with part 2 of this chapter.
    (c) No person shall be issued an identification card on the basis of 
membership in more than one tribe at any one time.
    (d) Each card shall state the name, address, tribal affiliation and 
enrollment number (if any) of the holder, identify the treaty under 
which the holder is entitled to fishing rights, contain such additional 
personal identification data as is required on fishing licenses issued 
under the law of the State or States within which it is used, and be 
signed by the issuing officer and by the holder.
    (e) No charge or fee of any kind shall be imposed by the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the issuance of an identification 
card hereunder: Provided, That this shall not prevent any Indian tribe 
from imposing any fee or tax which it may otherwise be authorized to 
impose upon the exercise of any tribal fishing right.
    (f) All cards issued by the Commisssioner of Indian Affairs pursuant 
to this part 249 shall be and remain the property of the United States 
and may be retaken by any Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer 
from any unauthorized holder. Any card so retaken shall be immediately 
forwarded to the officer who issued it.
    (g) The failure of any person who claims to be entitled to the 
benefits of a treaty fishing right to have such a card in his immediate 
personal possession while fishing or engaging in other activity in the 
claimed exercise of such right to display it upon request to any 
Federal, State, or tribal enforcement officer shall be prima facie 
evidence that the person is not entitled to exercise an Indian fishing 
right under a treaty of the United States.
    (h) No person shall allow any use of his identification card by any

    (1) If funding is available, you will be provided appropriate 
information concerning the availability of Housing Improvement Program 
services.
    (2) If funding is not available, you will be advised, in writing, 
and provided appropriate information concerning submission for the next 
available program year. At the option of your servicing housing office 
and when extenuating circumstances exist, your application can be 
carried forward, for one year, into the next program year. You will be 
advised that you must provide written confirmation that the information 
in your application is still accurate and that you must provide current 
income documentation for that application to be considered in the next 
program year.

<R05>
Sec. 256.15  How long will I have to wait for repair, renovation,

or replacement of my dwelling?

    The length of time that it takes to accomplish the work to be done 
on your dwelling is dependent on:
    (a) Whether funds are available;
    (b) The type of work to be done;
    (c) The climate and seasonal conditions where your dwelling is 
located;
    (d) The availability of a contractor;
    (e) Your position on the priority list; and
    (f) Other unforeseen factors.


<R05>
Sec. 256.16  Who is responsible for identifying what work 

will be done on my dwelling?

    The servicing housing office is responsible for identifying what 
work is to be done on your dwelling or whether your dwelling will be 
replaced. This includes responsibility to communicate and coordinate, 
through provision of the current Priority List, with the Indian Health 
Service, when it is the organization responsible for verifying the 
availability/feasibility of water and wastewater facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 256.17  What will the servicing housing office do to 

identify what work is to be done on my dwelling?

    (a) First, a trained and qualified representative of your servicing 
housing office must visit your dwelling to identify what repairs or 
renovation are to be done under the Housing Improvement Program. The 
representative must ensure that flood, National Environmental Protection 
Act (NEPA) and earthquake requirements are met.
    (b) Second, based on the list of repairs or renovation to be done, 
the representative must estimate the total

[[Page 794]]

cost of repairs or renovation to your dwelling. Cost estimates must be 
based on locally available services and product costs, or other 
regional-based, industry-recognized cost data, such as that provided by 
the MEANs or MARSHALL SWIFT. If the dwelling is located in Alaska, 
documented, reasonable, substantiated freight costs, in accordance with 
Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR 101-40), not to exceed 100 
percent of the cost of materials, can be added to the cost of the 
project.
    (c) Third, the representative must determine which Housing 
Improvement Program category the improvements to your dwelling meet, 
based on the estimated cost of repairs or renovation. If the estimated 
cost to repair your dwelling is more than $35,000, the representative 
must approve your dwelling for replacement or refer you to another 
source for housing. The other source does not have to be for a 
replacement dwelling; it may be for government-subsidized rental units 
or other sources for standard housing.
    (d) Fourth, the representative must develop a detailed, written 
report, also called ``bid specifications'' that identifies what and how 
the repairs, renovation, or construction work is to be accomplished at 
the dwelling.
    (1) When the work includes new construction, the ``bid 
specifications'' will be supplemented with a set of construction plans. 
The plans must not exceed the occupancy and square footage criteria 
identified in Sec. 256.11. The plans must be sufficiently detailed to 
provide complete instructions to the builder for the purpose of 
construction.
    (2) ``Bid Specifications'' are also used to inform potential bidders 
of what work is to be done.

[63 FR 10134, Mar. 2, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 77922, Dec. 20, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 256.18  How will I be advised of what work is to be done?

    You will receive written notice from the servicing housing office of 
what work is being scheduled under the Housing Improvement Program. You 
will be requested to concur with the scheduled work by signing a copy of 
the notice and returning it to the servicing housing office. No work 
will be started until the signed copy is returned to the servicing 
housing office.


<R05>
Sec. 256.19  Who performs the improvements, repairs, or replacement of my dwelling?

    Independent or tribal repair or construction trades persons, home 
building contractors, or construction companies will perform the 
repairs, renovation, or replacement of your dwelling.

[63 FR 10134, Mar. 2, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 77922, Dec. 20, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 256.20  How are these repairs or construction trades persons, 

home building contractors, or construction companies selected and paid?

    The servicing housing office must follow Federal procurement or 
other Bureau-approved tribal procurement policy. Generally, your 
servicing housing office develops a ``bid specification'' or statement 
of work, which identifies the work to be performed. The appropriate 
contracting office uses the ``bid specification'' to provide information 
and invite bids on the project to interested parties. The contracting 
office selects the winning bidder after technical review of the bids by 
and written recommendation from the servicing housing office, and after 
determination that the bidder is qualified and capable of completing the 
project as advertised.
    (a) Payments to the winning bidder are negotiated in the contract 
and based on specified delivery of services.
    (1) Partial payments will not exceed 80 percent of the value of the 
completed work.
    (2) Final payment will be made after final inspection and after all 
provisions of the contract have been met, including punch list items.


<R05>
Sec. 256.21  Will I have to vacate my dwelling while repair work

or replacement of my dwelling is being done?

    (a) You will be notified by the servicing housing office that you 
must vacate your dwelling only if:
    (1) It is scheduled for major repairs requiring that all occupants 
vacate the dwelling for safety reasons; or
    (2) It is scheduled for replacement which requires the demolition of 
your current dwelling.

[[Page 795]]

    (b) If you are required to vacate the premises for the duration of 
the construction, you are responsible for:
    (1) Locating other lodging;
    (2) Paying all costs associated with vacating and living away from 
the dwelling; and
    (3) Removing all your belongings and furnishings before the 
scheduled beginning work date.


<R05>
Sec. 256.22  How can I be sure that the work that is being 

done on my dwelling meets minimum construction standards?

    (a) At various stages of construction, a trained and qualified 
servicing housing office representative or building inspector will 
review the construction to ensure that it meets applicable minimum 
construction standards and building codes. Upon completion of each 
stage, further construction is prohibited until the inspection occurs 
and approval is granted.
    (b) Inspections are, at a minimum, made at the following stages of 
construction:
    (1) Footings;
    (2) Closed in, rough wiring and rough plumbing; and
    (3) At final completion.


<R05>
Sec. 256.23  How will I be advised that the repair, renovation

or replacement of my dwelling has been completed?

    The servicing housing office will advise you, in writing, that the 
work has been completed in compliance with the project contract. Also, 
you will have a final walk-through of the dwelling with your servicing 
housing office representative. You will be requested to verify that you 
received the notice of completion of the work by signing a copy of the 
notice and returning it to the servicing housing office representative.


<R05>
Sec. 256.24  Will I need flood insurance?

    You will need flood insurance if your dwelling is located in an area 
identified as having special flood hazards under the Flood Disaster 
Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, 87 Stat. 977). Your servicing 
housing office will advise you.

[63 FR 10134, Mar. 2, 1998. Redesignated at 67 FR 77922, Dec. 20, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 256.25  Is my Federal government-assisted dwelling eligible 

for services under the Housing Improvement Program?

    Yes. You may receive services under the Housing Improvement Program 
if your home was purchased through a Federal government sponsored home 
program that does not include provision for housing assistance.

[63 FR 10134, Mar. 2, 1998. Redesignated at 67 FR 77922, Dec. 20, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 256.26  Can I receive Housing Improvement Program services if

I am living in a mobile home?

    Yes. If you meet the eligibility criteria in Sec. 256.6 and there 
is sufficient funding available, you can receive any of the Housing 
Improvement Program services identified in Sec. 256.7. If you require 
Category B services and your mobile home has exterior walls of less than 
three inches, you must be provided Category C services.

[63 FR 10134, Mar. 2, 1998. Redesignated at 67 FR 77922, Dec. 20, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 256.27  Can Housing Improvement Program resources be

supplemented with other available resources?

    Yes. Housing Improvement Program resources may be supplemented 
through other available resources to increase the number of Housing 
Improvement Program recipients.

[63 FR 10134, Mar. 2, 1998. Redesignated at 67 FR 77922, Dec. 20, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 256.28  What can I do if I disagree with actions taken under 

the Housing Improvement Program?

    You may appeal action or inaction by an official of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs, in accordance with 25 CFR part 2. You may appeal action 
or inaction by tribal officials through the appeal process established 
by the servicing tribe.

having jurisdiction over the resources in question and the law of that 
tribe regulates the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on 
its lands.
    (2) Tribal employees need not submit permit applications to the BIA 
if:
    (i) The proposed excavation or removal of archaeological resources 
is within the normal scope of their duties or otherwise carried out by 
direction of the tribal government;
    (ii) The work is on Indian lands of the tribe or on which the law of 
that tribe regulates the excavation or removal of archaeological 
resources;
    (iii) The tribe ensures that the provisions for permit issuance in 
this part and at 43 CFR part 7 have been met by other documented means; 
and
    (iv) Before beginning the work, the tribe notifies the Area Director 
about the nature and location of the proposed work and allows 10 working 
days after mailing a notification or 5 working days after an oral 
notification (provided this is documented) for the Area Director to 
respond. The Area Director need only respond when action is required 
under Sec. 262.7 of this part, and may do so either in writing or, if 
documented, orally.
    (3) Consultants, advisors, and others serving by contractual 
agreement as agents for Indian tribes may use the provisions in Sec. 
262.5(f) of this part to expedite the process of obtaining a permit.
    (4) Persons serving as agents for Indian tribes as employees or by 
contractual agreement may abbreviate the consultation required in Sec. 
262.3(b) of this part by disregarding the requirement to consult first 
with the tribe and, provided the communication is documented, by 
consulting with the Area Director orally. In these cases, the Area 
Director need only respond when a permit is deemed necessary and

[[Page 798]]

may do so either orally or in writing. If a response is not received 
within 3 working days after an oral description of the proposed work is 
made or within 7 working days after a written description is mailed to 
the Area Director, the work may proceed.


<R05>
Sec. 262.5  Application for permits.

    (a) Permits from the BIA shall be issued when an applicant meets the 
requirements set out in 43 CFR 7.8, and may be conditioned, modified, 
suspended, or revoked by the Area Director. Area Directors may delegate 
this authority to Agency Superintendents, but only on a permit-by-permit 
basis and only to those who have adequate professional support 
available.
    (b) Prospective applicants may obtain details on how to apply for a 
permit by contacting the Area Director, at BIA Area Offices in: 
Aberdeen, SD; Albuquerque, NM; Anadarko, OK; Arlington, VA; Billings, 
MT; Gallup, NM; Juneau, AK; Minneapolis, MN; Muskogee, OK; Phoenix, AZ; 
Portland, OR; or Sacramento, CA; or by writing to the Deputy 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, Washington, 
DC 20240.
    (c) Permit applications proposing the excavation or removal of 
archaeological resources on Indian lands shall include the following 
consent documents:
    (1) Written permission from the Indian landowner and from the tribe, 
if any, having jurisdiction over those lands. This must contain such 
terms and conditions as the landowner or tribe may request be included 
in the permit. Where the permission is from a tribe, it should either 
state that no religious or cultural site will be harmed or destroyed by 
the proposed work or specify terms and conditions that the permit must 
include in order to safeguard against such harm or destruction.
    (i) For lands of Indian tribes, permission must be granted by the 
tribe.
    (ii) For lands of Indian individuals not under tribal jurisdiction, 
permission must be granted by the owner(s), except as provided in Sec. 
262.6.
    (iii) For lands of Indian individuals under tribal jurisdiction, 
permission must be granted by both the owner(s), except as provided in 
Sec. 262.6, and the tribe having such jurisdiction. Where an applicant 
is the owner, consent must still be obtained from the tribe.
    (iv) Where the ownership of lands of Indian individuals is multiple, 
permission must be granted by the owners of a majority of interests, 
except as provided in Sec. 262.6. The same shall apply where the 
applicant is one of the owners.
    (v) Where the terms and conditions a tribe or landowner requests be 
included in a permit are in conflict with the provisions of this or any 
other Act, with Federal regulations, or with each other, the Area 
Director may negotiate with the requestor to eliminate the conflict. If 
the conflict remains, the permit may not be issued.
    (2) Copies of any permits required by tribal law for archaeological 
work on lands under tribal jurisdiction. This may serve as written 
consent from the tribe for the purposes of Sec. 262.5(c)(1).
    (3) Written agreement by the Indian landowner(s) to release 
archaeological resources for curation or study, as specified in Sec. 
262.8(b).
    (d) Permits issued by the BIA shall include the following or similar 
condition: ``Human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects, 
and objects of cultural patrimony may not be excavated or removed unless 
the permittee has obtained the written consent of the Area Director. In 
order to obtain consent, the permittee shall present to the Area 
Director written evidence of prior consultation with the appropriate 
Indian tribe. If the lands containing the remains or objects are tribal 
lands, the permittee shall first obtain the written consent of the tribe 
having jurisdiction over the lands.'' Determination as to which tribe is 
the appropriate tribe shall be made in accordance with Sec. 262.8(a). 
Area Director consent shall be based on the scientific appropriateness 
of the research objectives and provisions for recovery, recording, and 
analysis and may, if documented, be oral. This condition may be omitted 
from the permit when such excavation or removal is proposed, and the 
requirements of the condition are met, in the permit application.
    (e) Information and assistance in contacting Indian tribes and 
individual

[[Page 799]]

Indian landowners for the purpose of requesting the consent documents 
listed under paragraph (c) of this section or of seeking the 
consultation and consent required under paragraph (d) of this section 
may be obtained from the BIA office to which the permit application is 
submitted.
    (f) Contractual agreements with the BIA or Indian tribes and permits 
issued by Indian tribes may be accepted as support documents for permit 
applications. They may also double as permit documents, if they 
demonstrate that the provisions for permit issuance in this part and at 
43 CFR part 7 have been met and they are attached to a Department of the 
Interior permit form. This form must be signed by the Area Director, but 
need only contain the following or similar statement: ``This permit is 
issued to the person(s) named, and in accordance with the terms and 
conditions in the attached (contractual agreement/tribal permit).''
    (g) Area Directors shall respond to permit applications within 15 
working days of receipt.


<R05>
Sec. 262.6  Landowner consent by the Secretary.

    The Secretary of the Interior, or delegate thereof, may, on behalf 
of the owner(s) of lands of Indian individuals, grant consent for the 
purposes in Sec. 262.5(c)(1) and (3) when the Secretary or his or her 
delegate finds that such consent will not result in any injury to the 
land or owner(s) and when one or more of the following conditions exist:
    (a) The owner is a minor or a person non compos mentis;
    (b) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner have not been 
determined;
    (c) The whereabouts of the owner are unknown;
    (d) Multiple owners are so numerous that the Secretary or his or her 
delegate finds, after documenting his or her efforts to do so, that it 
would be impractical to obtain their consent, as prescribed in Sec. 
262.5(c)(1)(iv) and provided the Secretary or his or her delegate also 
notifies, in writing, the tribe, if any, having jurisdiction over the 
land and allows 15 working days from the date of mailing date for 
response; or
    (e) The owner has given the Secretary or his or her delegate written 
authority to grant such consent on his or her behalf.


<R05>
Sec. 262.7  Notice to Indian tribes of possible harm to cultural or religious sites.

    When consent by an Indian tribe to proposed excavation or removal of 
archaeological resources from Indian lands it owns or over which it has 
jurisdiction contains all of the information written as prescribed and 
advised in Sec. 262.5(c)(1), it may be taken to mean that subject to 
such terms and conditions as the tribe might specify, issuance of a 
permit for the proposed work will not result in harm to, or destruction 
of, any site of religious or cultural importance. No further 
notification is necessary, unless the Area Director has reason to 
believe that the proposed work might harm or destroy a site of religious 
or cultural importance to another tribe or Native American group. He or 
she shall then follow the notification procedures at 43 CFR 7.7. Those 
procedures must also be followed when proposed work might affect lands 
of Indian individuals over which there is no tribal jurisdiction or 
public lands owned or administered by the BIA.


<R05>
Sec. 262.8  Custody of archaeological resources.

    (a) Archaeological resources excavated or removed from Indian lands, 
except for human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred objects 
and objects of cultural patrimony, remain the property of the Indian 
tribe or individual(s) having rights of ownership over such lands. 
Ownership and right of control over the disposition of the excepted 
items shall be in accordance with the order of priority provided in the 
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (Pub. L. 101-
601), adapted for the purpose of this rule as follows:
    (1) In the case of human remains of Indians and funerary objects, in 
the lineal descendants of the Indian; or
    (2) In any case in which such lineal descendants cannot be 
ascertained, and in the case of sacred objects and objects of cultural 
patrimony:

[[Page 800]]

    (i) In the Indian tribe on whose tribal lands, or on the individual 
Indian lands of whose members, such remains or objects are discovered;
    (ii) In the Indian tribe recognized as aboriginally occupying the 
public lands owned or administered by the BIA on which such remains or 
objects are discovered, if upon notice, that tribe states a claim for 
those remains or objects; or
    (iii) Where it can be so demonstrated by a preponderance of 
evidence, in the tribe other than that in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of 
this section having the strongest cultural relationship with such 
remains or objects, if, upon notice, that tribe states a claim for those 
remains or objects.
    (iv) The Area Director shall provide the required notice to any 
Indian tribe identified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this 
section, in writing, within 5 working days after such identification has 
been documented and confirmed, and shall at the same time submit a copy 
of the notice for publication in the Federal Register. This notice shall 
include a description of the remains or objects; of where, how, and why 
they were excavated or removed; and of the evidence used to identify the 
tribe being notified. The remains or objects in question shall be 
considered the property of the pertinent tribe under paragraph (a)(2)(i) 
of this section or, in the case of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, 
held and administered by the BIA until or unless a claim is stated.
    (b) No permit for the excavation or removal of archaeological 
resources on Indian lands may be issued without the written consent of 
the Indian landowner(s) either to grant custody of the resources 
recovered (other than human remains of Indians, funerary objects, sacred 
objects or objects of cultural patrimony) to a curatorial facility that 
meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79 or to allow the permittee a 
reasonable period of time to hold or have ready access to them at an 
appropriate location for study. The excepted remains and objects are 
covered under Sec. 262.5(d) of this part which, in general, permits 
their excavation or removal only when the research objectives and 
provisions for recovery, recording, and analysis are scientifically 
appropriate. Written consent to custody by a curatorial facility may 
include terms and conditions regarding curation (e.g., cleaning, 
viewing, loaning, studying, etc.), provided these are consistent with 36 
CFR part 79.
    (1) On lands of Indian tribes, consent must be obtained from the 
tribe.
    (2) On lands of Indian individuals, consent must be obtained from 
the owner of the land or the owners of a majority of interests therein, 
except as provided in Sec. 262.6.
    (3) Where consent is by the owners of a majority of interests, it 
must, if the archaeological resources are to be retained by or returned 
after study to the interest holders, designate a representative to 
receive those resources. Whether and how these are subsequently 
distributed among themselves is a matter for the interest holders to 
decide.
    (c) The Area Director may, after notifying the tribe (if any) having 
jurisdiction over such lands and allowing 15 working days for response, 
decline to issue a permit for lands of Indian individuals if he or she 
has any verifiable reason to believe that archaeological resources 
retained by the landowner(s) after being studied will be sold or 
exchanged other than to the tribe having jurisdiction or to a curatorial 
facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. The basis for 
decline shall be that excavation or removal of resources under such 
circumstances would not be in the public interest and would thus be 
contrary to the purposes of the Act.
    (d) The landowner(s) alone may grant custody of archaeological 
resources (except for human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects 
and objects of cultural patrimony, which are subject to the provisions 
of paragraph (a) of this section) excavated or removed from lands of 
Indian individuals that are under tribal jurisdiction to a curatorial 
facility that meets the requirements of 36 CFR part 79. When, however, 
such consignment constitutes the ultimate disposition of these 
resources, the tribe having jurisdiction must also grant its consent. 
Any subsequent exchange or disposition by the facility

[[Page 801]]

must have the consent of both the landowner(s) and the tribe.

<R05>
Sec. 265.3  Roads prohibited.

    (a) Within the boundaries of this officially designated roadless 
area it will be the policy of the Interior Department to refuse consent 
to the construction or establishment of any routes passable to motor 
transportation, including in this restriction highways, roads, truck 
trails, work roads, and all other types of ways constructed to make 
possible the passage of motor vehicles either for transportation of 
people or for the hauling of supplies and equipment, unless the 
requirements of fire protection, commercial use for the Indians' benefit 
or actual needs of the Indians clearly demand otherwise.
    (b) Foot trails and horse trails are not barred. The Superintendent 
of the Wind River Reservation on which this roadless area has been 
established will be held strictly accountable for seeing that the area 
is maintained in a roadless condition. Elimination of this area or any 
part thereof from the restriction of this order will be made only upon a 
written showing of an actual and controlling need.

Sec. 273.4  Policy of maximum Indian participation.

    The meaningful participation in all aspects of educational program 
development and implementation by those affected by such programs is an 
essential requisite for success. Such participation not only enhances 
program responsiveness to the needs of those served, but also provides 
them with the opportunity to determine and affect the desired level of 
educational achievement and satisfaction which education can and should 
provide. Consistent with this concept, maximum Indian participation in 
the development, approval and implementation of all programs contracted 
under this part shall be required.

means the recognized governing body of an Indian tribe.
    (r) Tribal organization means the recognized governing body of any 
Indian tribe or any legally established organization of Indians which is 
controlled, sanctioned, or chartered by such governing body or bodies of 
which is democratically elected by the adult members of the Indian 
community to be served by such organization and which includes the 
maximum participation of Indians in all phases of its activities.

Sec. 276.3  Cash depositories.

    (a) Except for situations described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section, the Bureau will not:
    (1) Require physical segregation of cash depositories for Bureau 
grant funds provided to a grantee.
    (2) Establish any eligibility requirements for cash depositories in 
which Bureau grant funds are deposited by grantees or their subgrantees.
    (b) A separate bank account shall be used when payments under letter 
of credit are made on a ``check-paid'' basis in accordance with 
agreements entered into by a grantee, the Bureau, and the banking 
institutions involved. A check-paid basis letter of credit is one under 
which funds are not drawn from the Treasury until the grantee's checks 
have been presented to its bank for payment.
    (c) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities 
for minority business enterprises, grantees are encouraged to use 
minority banks.


<R05>
Sec. 276.4  Bondings and insurance.

    In administering Bureau grants, grantees shall observe their regular 
requirements and practices with respect to bonding and insurance. The 
Bureau will not impose additional bonding and insurance requirements, 
including fidelity bonds, except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section.
    (a) The recipient of a Bureau grant which requires contracting for 
construction or facility improvement (including any Bureau grant which 
provides for alterations or renovations of real property) shall follow 
its own requirements and practices relating to

[[Page 820]]

bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds except for 
contracts exceeding $100,000. For contracts exceeding $100,000, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The bid guarantee shall consist of a firm commitment such 
as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A performance bond is one executed in connection 
with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under the contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 per cent of 
the contract price. A payment bond is one executed in connection with a 
contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying 
labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the 
contract.
    (b) Where, in connection with a Bureau grant, the Bureau also 
guarantees the payment of money borrowed by the grantee, the Bureau may 
at its discretion require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding 
and insurance requirements of the grantee are not deemed to be 
sufficient to protect adequately the interests of the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 276.5  Recordkeeping.

    (a) The Bureau shall not impose record retention requirements over 
and above those established by the grantee except that financial 
records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other 
records pertinent to a Bureau grant, or to any subgrant (or negotiated 
contract exceeding $2500) under a grant, shall be retained for a period 
of three years, with the following qualifications:
    (1) The records shall be retained beyond the three-year period if 
audit findings have not been resolved.
    (2) Records for nonexpendable property which was acquired with 
Bureau grant funds shall be retained for three years after its final 
disposition.
    (3) When grant records are transferred to or maintained by the 
Bureau, the three-year retention requirement is not applicable to the 
grantee.
    (b) The retention period starts from the date of submission of the 
final expenditure report or, for grants which are renewed annually, from 
the date of the submission of the annual expenditure report.
    (c) Grantees are authorized, if they desire, to substitute microfilm 
copies in lieu of original records.
    (d) The Bureau shall request transfer of certain records to its 
custody from grantees when it determines that the records possess long-
term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping 
the Bureau may make arrangements with the grantee for the grantee to 
retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use.
    (e) The Secretary of the Interior and the Comptroller General of the 
United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives shall 
have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the grantees 
and their subgrantees which are pertinent to a specific grant program 
for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, transcripts and 
copies at government expense.
    (f) Unless otherwise required by law, the Bureau shall not place 
restrictions on grantees which will limit public access to the grantee's 
records created as part of the grant except when records must remain 
confidential. Following are some of the reasons for withholding records:
    (1) Prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (2) Specifically required by statute or Executive Order to be kept 
secret;
    (3) Commercial or financial information obtained from a person or 
firm on a privileged or confidential basis.


<R05>
Sec. 276.6  Program income.

    (a) No grantee receiving a grant shall be held accountable for 
interest earned on grant funds, pending their disbursement for program 
purposes.
    (b) Proceeds from the sale of real or personal property, either 
provided by

[[Page 821]]

the Federal Government or purchased in whole or in part with Federal 
funds, shall be handled in accordance with Sec. 276.11.
    (c) Royalties received from copyrights and patents produced under 
the grant during the grant period shall be retained by the grantee and, 
in accordance with the grant agreement, be either added to the funds 
already committed to the program or deducted from total allowable 
project costs for the purpose of determining the net costs on which the 
Bureau share of costs will be based. After termination or completion of 
the grant, the Bureau share of royalties in excess of $200 received 
annually shall be returned to the Bureau in the absence of other 
specific agreements between the Bureau and the grantee. The Bureau share 
of royalties shall be computed on the same ratio basis as the Bureau 
share of the total project cost.
    (d) All other program income earned during the grant period shall be 
retained by the grantee and, in accordance with the grant agreement, 
shall be either:
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Bureau and the 
grantee and be used to further eligible program objectives, or
    (2) Deducted from the total project costs for the purpose of 
determining the net costs on which the Bureau share of costs will be 
based.
    (e) Grantees shall record the receipt and expenditures of revenues 
(such as taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, etc.) as a part of 
grant project transactions when such revenues are specifically earmarked 
for a grant project in accordance with grant agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 276.7  Standards for grantee financial management systems.

    (a) Grantee financial management systems for grants and subgrantee 
financial management systems for subgrants shall provide for:
    (1) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial 
results of each grant program in accordance with Federal reporting 
requirements and for each subgrant in accordance with the grantees' 
requirements. Except when specifically required by law, the Bureau wll 
not require financial reporting on the accrual basis from tribal 
organizations whose records are not maintained on that basis. However, 
when accrual reporting is required by law, tribal organizations whose 
records are not maintained on that basis will not be required to convert 
their accounting systems to the accrual basis; they may develop the 
accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on hand or 
on the basis of best estimates.
    (2) Records which identify adequately the source and application of 
funds for grant--or subgrant--supported activities. These records shall 
contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and 
authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, 
outlays, and income.
    (3) Effective control over and accountability for all grant or 
subgrant funds, and real and personal property acquired with grant or 
subgrant funds. Grantees and subgrantees shall adequately safeguard all 
such property and shall assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Comparison of actual with budgeted amounts for each grant or 
subgrant, and, when specifically required by the performance reporting 
requirements of the grant or subgrant, relation of financial information 
with performance or productivity data, including the production of unit 
cost information.
    (5) Procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of 
funds from the U.S. Treasury and the disbursement by the grantee, 
whenever funds are advanced by the Federal Government. When advances are 
made by a letter-of-credit method, the grantees shall make drawdowns 
from the U.S. Treasury as close as possible to the time of making the 
disbursements. Subgrantees shall institute similar procedures when funds 
are advanced by the grantee.
    (6) Procedures for determining the allowability and allocability of 
costs shall be in accordance with the applicable cost principles 
prescribed in appendix A of this part.
    (7) Accounting records which are supported by source documentation.

[[Page 822]]

    (8) A systematic method to assure timely and appropriate resolution 
of audit findings and recommendations.
    (b) Grantees shall require subgrantees (recipients of grants which 
are passed through by the grantee) to adopt all of the standards in 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 276.8  Financial reporting requirements.

    Requirements for grantees to report financial information to the 
Bureau, and to request advances and reimbursment when a letter of credit 
method is not used, are prescribed in appendix B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 276.9  Monitoring and reporting program performances.

    (a) Grantees shall constantly monitor the performance under grant-
supported activities to assure that adequate progress is being made 
toward achieving the goals of the grant. This review shall be made for 
each program, function, or activity of each grant as set forth in the 
approved grant application.
    (b) Grantees shall submit a performance report for each grant which 
briefly presents the following for each program, function, or activity 
involved:
    (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the goals established 
for the period. Where the output of grant programs can be readily 
quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for 
computation of unit costs.
    (2) Reasons for slippage in those cases were established goals were 
not met.
    (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (c) Grantees shall submit the performance reports to the Bureau with 
the Financial Status Reports (prescribed in appendix B of this part) in 
the frequency established by appendix B. The Bureau shall prescribe the 
frequency with which the performance reports will be submitted with the 
Request for Advance or Reimbursement (prescribed in appendix B) when 
that form is used in lieu of the Financial Status Report. In no case 
shall the performance reports be required more frequently than quarterly 
or less frequently than annually.
    (d) Between the required performance reporting dates, events may 
occur which have significant impact upon the project or program. In such 
cases, the grantee shall inform the Bureau as soon as the following 
types of conditions become known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
affect the ability to attain program objectives, prevent the meeting of 
time schedules and goals, or preclude the attainment of project work 
units by established time periods. This disclosure shall be accomplished 
by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any Bureau 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments or events which enable meeting time 
schedules and goals sooner than anticipated or producing more work units 
than originally projected.
    (e) If any performance review conducted by the grantee discloses the 
need for change in the budget estimates in accordance with the criteria 
established in Sec. 276.14, the grantee shall submit a request for 
budget revision.
    (f) The bureau shall make site visits as frequently as practicable 
to:
    (1) Review program accomplishments and management control systems.
    (2) Provide such technical assistance as may be required, or 
requested.


<R05>
Sec. 276.10  Grant payment requirements.

    (a) Except for construction grants for which the letter-of-credit 
method is optional, the letter-of-credit funding method shall be used by 
the Bureau where all of the following conditions exist:
    (1) When there is or will be a continuing relationship between a 
grantee and the Bureau for at least a 12-month period and the total 
amount of advances to be received within that period from the Bureau is 
$120,000, or more, as prescribed by Treasury Circular No. 1075.
    (2) When the grantee has established or demonstrated to the Bureau 
the willingness and ability to establish procedures that will minimize 
the time

[[Page 823]]

elapsing between the transfer of funds and their disbursement by the 
grantee.
    (3) When the grantee's financial management system meets the 
standards for fund control and accountability prescribed in Sec. 276.7.
    (b) The method of advancing funds by Treasury check shall be used, 
in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Circular No. 1075, when 
the grantee meets all of the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) 
and (3) of this section.
    (c) The reimbursement by Treasury check method shall be the 
preferred method when the grantee does not meet the requirements 
specified in either paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3), or both. This method may 
also be used when the major portion of the program is accomplished 
through private market financing or Federal loans, and when the Bureau 
grant assistance constitutes a minor portion of the program.
    (d) Unless otherwise required by law, the Bureau shall not withhold 
payments for proper charges made by grantees at any time during the 
grant period unless:
    (1) A grantee has failed to comply with the program objectives, 
grant award conditions, or Bureau reporting requirements; or
    (2) The grantee is indebted to the United States and collection of 
the indebtedness will not impair accomplishment of the objectives of any 
grant program sponsored by the United States. Under such conditions, the 
Bureau may, upon reasonable notice, inform the grantee that payments 
will not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until 
the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal 
Government is liquidated.
    (e) Appendix B of this part provides the procedures for requesting 
advances or reimbursements.

<R05>
Sec. 276.11  Property management standards.

    (a) Grantees may follow their own property management policies and 
procedures if they observe the requirements of this section. With 
respect to property covered by this section, the Bureau may not impose 
on grantees any requirements (including property reporting 
requirements)--not authorized by this part unless specifically required 
by Federal law.
    (b) Title to real property to be acquired in whole or in part from a 
Bureau grant under part 900 of this chapter shall vest in one of the 
following manners:
    (1) Title may be taken by the United States in trust for the Indian 
tribe upon the request of the tribe and when the real property to be 
acquired is within the reservation boundaries or adjoins on at least two 
sides other trust or restricted lands as prescribed in part 900 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Fee title to the acquired real property shall vest in the Indian 
tribe whenever the acquisition does not meet the criteria in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, unless for other reasons a tribe requests title 
to be taken in the name of the United States. In the absence of 
applicable statutory authority governing the disposition of real 
property acquired by a tribe, the tribe shall use the real property for 
the authorized purposes and in accordance with any other requirements 
imposed by the terms and conditions of the original grant. Changes in 
use compatible to other tribal programs may be authorized by the Bureau. 
When no longer needed for the authorized purposes, the real property 
shall be used in accordance with the standards set forth in Sec. 
276.11(d)(1) for non-expendable personal property. Accordingly, the 
following priority order for use of such property shall be:
    (i) Other grants from the Bureau.
    (ii) Grants from other Federal agencies.
    (iii) Tribal purposes consistent with those authorized for support 
by Bureau grants.
    (iv) Tribal official activities.
    (3) In those instances where the Indian tribe requests, title may be 
acquired by the United States. Use of these acquired real property 
interests will be subject to the authorized purposes and in accordance 
with the provisions of the original grant. Upon a determination that the 
real property is no longer needed for the authorized purposes, 
disposition may be made by

[[Page 824]]

declaring it excess under provisions of the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 
Stat. 1954) and title transferred to the Secretary to be held by the 
United States in trust for the tribe. Where real property does not meet 
the requirements under the Act of January 2, 1975 (88 Stat. 1954), the 
tribe may elect to acquire title under applicable enabling statutory 
authorities, or in the absence of statutory authority, request 
withholding disposition in aid of legislation, or authorize disposal 
under the General Services Administration procedures.
    (c) The provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section 
shall also apply when real property is acquired in whole or in part by a 
Bureau grant other than that provided under part 900 of this chapter. 
However, when such property is acquired by a grantee other than an 
Indian tribe, or a tribal governing body, fee simple title to the 
property shall vest in the grantee upon acquisition. In the absence of 
applicable statutory provisions governing the use or disposition of such 
property, it shall be subject to the following requirments, in addition 
to any other requirements imposed by the terms and conditions of the 
grant:
    (1) The grantee shall use the real property for the authorized 
purpose of the original grant as long as needed.
    (2) The grantee shall obtain approval by the Bureau for the use of 
the real property in other projects when the grantee determines that the 
property is no longer needed for the original grant purposes. Use in 
other projects shall be limited to those under other Federal grant 
programs, or programs that have purposes consistent with those 
authorized for support by the grantor.
    (3) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the grantee shall return all 
real property furnished or purchased wholly with Bureau grant funds to 
the control of the Bureau. In the case of property purchased in part 
with Bureau grant funds, the grantee may be permitted to take title to 
the Federal interest therein upon compensating the Federal Government 
for its fair share of the property. The Federal share of the property 
shall be the amount computed by applying the percentage of the Federal 
participation in the total cost of the grant program for which the 
property was acquired to the current fair market value of the property.
    (d) Standards and procedures governing ownership, use, and 
disposition of nonexpendable personal property furnished by the Bureau 
or acquired with Bureau funds are set forth below:
    (1) Nonexpendable personal property acquired with Bureau funds. When 
nonexpendable personal property is acquired by a grantee wholly or in 
part with Bureau funds, title will not be taken by the Bureau except as 
provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section but shall be vested in 
the grantee subject to the following restrictions on use and disposition 
of the property:
    (i) The grantee shall retain the property acquired with Bureau funds 
in the grant program as long as there is a need for the property to 
accomplish the purpose of the grant program whether or not the program 
continues to be supported by Bureau funds. When there is no longer a 
need for the property to accomplish the purpose of the grant program, 
the grantee shall use the property in connection with the other Federal 
grants it has received in the following order of priority:
    (A) Other grants from the Bureau needing the property.
    (B) Grants of other Federal agencies needing the property.
    (ii) When the grantee no longer has need for the property in any of 
its Federal grant programs, or programs that have purposes consistent 
with those authorized for support by the grantor, the property may be 
used for its own official activities in accordance with the following 
standards:
    (A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of less than 
$500 and used four years or more. The grantee may use the property for 
its own official activities without reimbursement to the Federal 
government or sell the property and retain the proceeds.
    (B) All other nonexpendable property. The grantee may retain the 
property for its own use if a fair compensation is made to the Bureau 
for the latter's share of the property. The amount of compensation shall 
be computed by applying the percentage of

[[Page 825]]

Bureau participation in the grant program to the current fair market 
value of the property.
    (iii) If the grantee has no need for the property, disposition of 
the property shall be made as follows:
    (A) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or 
less. Except for that property which meets the criteria of paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the grantee shall sell the property and 
reimburse the Bureau an amount which is computed in accordance with 
paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (B) Nonexpendable property with an acquisition cost of over $1,000. 
The grantee shall request disposition instructions from the Bureau. The 
Bureau shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the 
Bureau's requirement. If no requirement exists within the Bureau, the 
availability of the property shall be reported to the General Services 
Administration (GSA) by the Bureau to determine whether a requirement 
for the property exists in other Federal agencies. The Bureau shall 
issue instructions to the grantee within 120 days and the following 
procedures shall govern:
    (1) If the grantee is instructed to ship the property elsewhere, the 
grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an 
amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee's 
participation in the grant program to the current fair market value of 
the property, plus any shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
    (2) If the grantee is instructed to otherwise dispose of the 
property, he shall be reimbursed by the Bureau of such costs incurred in 
its disposition.
    (3) If disposition instructions are not issued within 120 days after 
reporting, the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse the Bureau 
and amount which is computed by applying the percentage of Bureau 
participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. Further, the 
grantee shall be permitted to retain $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, 
whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling expenses.
    (iv) Where the Bureau determines that property with an acquisition 
cost of $1,000 or more and financed solely with Bureau funds is unique, 
different, or costly to replace, it may reserve title to such property, 
subject to the following provisions:
    (A) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant 
agreement or otherwise made known to the grantee.
    (B) The Bureau shall issue disposition instructions within 120 days 
after the completion of the need for the property under the grant for 
which it was acquired. If the Bureau fails to issue disposition 
instructions within 120 days, the grantee shall apply the standards of 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii)(B), and (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (2) Federally owned nonexpendable personal property. Unless 
statutory authority to transfer title has been granted to an agency, 
title to Federally owned property (property to which the Federal 
Government retains title including excess property made available by the 
Bureau to grantees) remains vested by law in the Federal Government. 
Upon termination of the grant or need for the property, such property 
shall be reported to the Bureau for further Bureau use or, if 
appropriate, for reporting to the General Services Administration for 
other Federal agency use. Appropriate disposition instructions will be 
issued to the grantee after completion of Bureau review.
    (e) The grantee's property management standards for nonexpendable 
personal property shall also include the following procedural 
requirements:
    (1) Property records shall be maintained accurately and provide for 
a description of the property; manufacturer's serial number or other 
identification number; acquisition date and cost; source of the 
property; percentage of Federal funds used in the purchase of property; 
location, use, and condition of the property; and ultimate disposition 
data including sales price or the method used to determine current fair 
market value if the grantee reimburses the bureau for its share.
    (2) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results 
reconciled with the property records at least once every two years to 
verify the

[[Page 826]]

existence, current use, and continued need for the property.
    (3) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft to the property. Any loss, 
damage, or theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and 
fully documented.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) Proper sales procedures shall be established for unneeded 
property which would provide for competition to the extent practicable 
and result in the highest possible return.
    (f) When the total inventory value of any unused expendable personal 
property exceeds $500 at the expiration of need for any grant purposes, 
the grantee may retain the property or sell the property as long as he 
compensates the Bureau for its share in the cost. The amount of 
compensation shall be computed in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (g) Specific standards for control of intangible property are 
provided as follows:
    (1) If any program produces patentable items, patent rights, 
processes, or inventions, in the course of work aided by a Bureau grant, 
such fact shall be promptly and fully reported to the Bureau. Unless 
there is prior agreement between the grantee and Bureau on disposition 
of such items, the Bureau shall determine whether protection on such 
invention or discovery shall be sought and how the rights in the 
invention or discovery--including rights under any patent issued on it--
shall be allocated and administered in order to protect the public 
interest consistent with ``Government Patent Policy'' (President's 
memorandum for heads of executive departments and agencies), dated 
August 23, 1971, and Statement of Government Patent Policy as printed in 
36 FR 16889.
    (2) Where the grant results in a book or other copyrightable 
material, the author or grantee is eligible to copyright the work if it 
is found that (i) the retention of the copyright is not precluded by 
statute and (ii) equity or the public interest is best served by doing 
so, by reason of special circumstances. If it is found that the public 
interest is best served by limiting the term of any copyright to be 
obtained, such limits shall be set forth in the grant agreement. 
``Developmental'' copyrights may be requested during the development, 
testing, or evaluation of copyrightable materials in order to prevent 
them from prematurely falling into the public domain. The copyright will 
be in accordance with copyright laws. However, the Government shall 
receive a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to 
reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use the 
work for Government purposes. A copy of any copyright obtained by a 
grantee shall be provided to the Bureau. Program income received as 
royalties from copyrights on materials produced under grants is retained 
by the grantee during the grant period and is to be used according to 
the provisions of Sec. 276.6(c). Specific agreements between the Bureau 
and the grantee shall be entered into before the grant is awarded to 
determine the uses of the royalty income after the grant is completed or 
terminated.
    (h) The use of Bureau-owned facilities under the jurisdiction of the 
Commissioner by a grantee for purposes of carrying out a grant may be 
authorized when the facilities are not needed for Bureau purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 276.12  Procurement standards.

    (a) The standards contained in this section do not relieve the 
grantee of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contracts. 
The grantee is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Bureau 
regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and 
administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into, in 
support of a grant. This includes but is not limited to: disputes, 
claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a 
contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of law are to be 
referred to the tribal, Federal or other authority which has proper 
jurisdiction.
    (b) Grantees may use their own procurement regulations provided that 
procurements made with Bureau grant

[[Page 827]]

funds adhere to the standards set forth as follows:
    (1) The grantee shall maintain a code or standards of conduct which 
shall govern the performance of its officers, employees, or agents in 
contracting with and expending Bureau grant funds. Grantee's officers, 
employees or agents, shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, 
favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or potential 
contractors. To the extent permissible by law, rules or regulations, 
such standards shall provide for penalties, sanctions, or other 
disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by 
either the grantee officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or 
their agents.
    (2) All procurement transactions regardless of whether negotiated or 
advertised and without regard to dollar value shall be conducted in a 
manner so as to provide maximum open and free competition. The grantee 
should be alert to organizational conflicts of interest or non-
competitive practices among contractors which may restrict or eliminate 
competition or otherwise restrain trade. However, this provision will 
apply only after the Indian preference requirements prescribed in Sec. 
276.13 have been met.
    (3) The grantee shall establish procurement procedures which provide 
for, as a minimum, the following procedural requirements:
    (i) Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by grantee 
official to avoid purchasing unnecessary or duplicative items. Where 
appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase 
alternatives to determine which would be the most economical, practical 
procurement.
    (ii) Invitations for bids or requests for proposals shall be based 
upon a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for 
the material, product, or service to be procured. In competitive 
procurements, such description shall not contain features which unduly 
restrict competition. ``Brand name or equal'' description may be used as 
a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a 
procurement. When so used, the specific features of the named brand 
which must be met by offerors should be clearly specified.
    (iii) Positive efforts shall be made by the grantees to use small 
business and minority-owned business sources of supplies and services. 
Such efforts should allow these sources the maximum feasible opportunity 
to compete for contracts to be performed using Bureau grant funds. 
However, this provision will apply only after the Indian preference 
requirements prescribed in Sec. 276.13 have been met.
    (iv) The type of procuring instruments used (i.e., fixed price 
contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, etc.) shall be appropriate for 
the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the 
grant program involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' method of 
contracting shall not be used.
    (v) Formal advertising, with adequate purchase description, sealed 
bids, and public openings shall be the required method of procurement 
unless negotiation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section is 
necessary to accomplish sound procurement. However, procurement of 
$10,000 or less need not be so advertised. Where such advertised bids 
are obtained the awards shall be made to the responsible bidder whose 
bid is responsive to the invitation and is most advantageous to the 
grantee, price and other factors considered. (Factors such as discounts, 
transportation costs, taxes may be considered in determining the lowest 
bid.) Invitations for bids shall clearly set forth all requirements 
which the bidder must fulfill in order for his bid to be evaluated by 
the grantee. Any or all bids may be rejected when it is in the grantee's 
interest to do so.
    (vi) Procurements may be negotiated if it is impractical and 
unfeasible to use formal advertising. Generally, procurements may be 
negotiated by the grantee if:
    (A) The public exigency will not permit the delay incident to 
advertising;
    (B) The material or service to be procured is available from only 
one person or firm; (all contemplated sole source procurements where the 
aggregate expenditure is expected to exceed $5,000 shall be referred to 
the Bureau for prior approval).

[[Page 828]]

    (C) The total amount involved does not exceed $10,000;
    (D) The contract is for personal or professional services, or for 
any service to be rendered by a university, college, or other 
educational institutions;
    (E) No acceptable bids have been received after formal advertising;
    (F) The purchases are for highly perishable materials or medical 
supplies; for material or services where the prices are established by 
law; for technical items or equipment requiring standardization and 
interchangeability of parts with existing equipment; for experimental, 
developmental or research work; for supplies purchased for authorized 
resale; and for technical or specialized supplies requiring substantial 
initial investment for manufacture;
    (G) Otherwise authorized by law, rules or regulations. 
Notwithstanding the existence of circumstances justifying negotiation, 
competition shall be obtained to the maximum extent practicable.
    (vii) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who 
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms 
and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given 
to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, 
financial and technical resources, or accessibility to other necessary 
resources.
    (viii) Procurement records or files for purchases in amounts over 
$10,000 shall provide at least the following pertinent information: 
Justification for the use of negotiation in lieu of advertising, 
contractor selection, and the basis for the cost or price negotiation.
    (ix) A system for contract administration shall be maintained to 
assure contractor conformance with terms, conditions, and specifications 
of the contract or order, and to assure adequate and timely followup of 
all purchases.
    (c) In addition to provisions to define a sound and complete 
agreement, the grantee shall include the following provisions in all 
contracts and subgrants:
    (1) Contracts shall contain such contractual provisions or 
conditions which will allow for administrative, contractual, or legal 
remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract 
terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be 
appropriate.
    (2) All contracts, amounts for which are over $10,000 shall contain 
suitable provisions for termination by the grantee including the manner 
by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, 
such contracts shall describe conditions where the contract may be 
terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be 
terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the 
contractor.
    (3) In all contracts for construction or facility improvement 
awarded over $100,000, grantees shall observe the bonding requirements 
provided in Sec. 276.4.
    (4) All construction contracts awarded by recipients and their 
contractors or subgrantees having a value of more than $10,000, shall 
contain a provision requiring compliance with Executive Order 11246, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Labor 
Regulations (41 CFR part 87). However, this Equal Employment Opportunity 
provision will apply only after the Indian preference requirements 
prescribed in Sec. 276.13 have been met.
    (5) All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair shall 
include a provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kick Back'' 
Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations 
(29 CFR part 3). This Act provides that each contractor or subgrantee 
shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in 
the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any 
part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The grantee 
shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Bureau.
    (6) When required by the Federal grant program legislation, all 
construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees over $2,000 
shall include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 
U.S.C. 276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor 
regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under this Act, contractors shall be 
required to pay wages to laborers and

[[Page 829]]

mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage 
determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors 
shall be required to pay wages not less often than once a week. The 
grantee shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination 
issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of 
a contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage 
determination. The grantee shall report all suspected or reported 
violations to the Bureau.
    (7) Where applicable, all contracts awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees over $2,000 for construction contracts and over $2,500 for 
other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers 
shall include a provision for compliance with sections 103 and 107 of 
the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as 
supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under 
section 103 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the 
wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work day 
of 8 hours and a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the 
standard workday or workweek is permissible if the worker is compensated 
at a rate of not less than 1\1/2\ times the basic rate of pay for all 
hours worked over 8 hours in any calendar day or 40 hours in the work 
week. Section 107 of the Act applies to construction work and provides 
that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or 
under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous 
to his health and safety as determined under construction, safety, and 
health standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. These 
requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or 
articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for 
transportation or transmission of intelligence.
    (8) Contracts or agreements, the principal purpose of which is to 
create, develop, or improve products, processes or methods; or for 
exploration into fields which directly concern public health, safety, or 
welfare; or constraints in the field of science or technology in which 
there has been little significant experience outside of work funded by 
Federal assistance, shall contain a notice to the effect that matters 
regarding rights to inventions, and materials generated under the 
contract or agreement are subject to the regulations issued by the 
Bureau. The contractor shall be advised as to the source of additional 
information regarding these matters.
    (9) All negotiated contracts (except those of $10,000 or less) 
awarded by grantees shall include a provision to the effect that the 
grantee, the Bureau, the Comptroller General of the United States, or 
any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any 
books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are 
directly pertinent to a specific grant program for the purpose of making 
audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.
    (10) Contracts and subgrants of amounts over $100,000 shall contain 
a provision which requires the recipient to agree to comply with all 
applicable standards, orders, or regulations issued pursuant to the 
Clean Air Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) as amended. Violations 
shall be reported to the Bureau and the Regional Office of the 
Environmental Protection Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 276.13  Indian preference in grant administration.

    Any grant or subgrant shall require that to the greatest extent 
feasible:
    (a) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment in 
connection with the administration of such a grant or subgrant shall be 
given to Indians.
    (b) Preference in the award of a subgrant, contract or subcontract 
in connection with administration of a grant shall be given to Indian 
organizations and economic enterprises.
    (c) A tribal governing body may develop its own Indian preference 
requirements to the extent that such requirements are not inconsistent 
with the purpose and intent of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
for grants executed under this part.

[[Page 830]]


<R05>
Sec. 276.14  Budget revision.

    Criteria and procedures to be followed by grantees in reporting 
deviations from grant budgets and requesting approval for budget 
revisions are as follows:
    (a) For nonconstruction grants, grantees shall request prior 
approvals promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the grant-supported program.
    (2) The revision indicates the need for additional Bureau funding.
    (3) The grant budget is over $100,000 and the cumulative amount of 
transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or is 
expected to exceed $10,000, or five percent of the grant budget, 
whichever is greater. The same criteria apply to cumulative amount of 
transfers among programs, functions, and activities when budgeted 
separately for a grant, except that the Bureau shall permit no transfer 
which would cause any Federal appropriation, or part thereof, to be used 
for purposes other than those intended.
    (4) The grant budget is $100,000, or less, and the cumulative amount 
of transfers among direct cost object class budget categories exceeds or 
is expected to exceed five percent of the grant budget. The same 
criteria apply to the cumulative amount of transfers among programs, 
functions, and activities when budgeted separately for a grant, except 
that the Bureau shall permit no transfer which would cause any Federal 
appropriation, or part thereof, to be used for purposes other than those 
intended.
    (5) The revisions involve the transfer of amounts budgeted for 
indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs.
    (6) The revisions pertain to the addition of items requiring 
approval in accordance with the provisions of appendix A of this part.
    (b) All other changes to nonconstruction grant budgets, except for 
the changes described in paragraph (d) of this section do not require 
approval. These changes include:
    (1) The use of grantee funds in furtherance of program objectives 
over and above the grantee minimum share included in the approved grant 
budget and
    (2) The transfer of amounts budgeted for direct costs to absorb 
authorized increases in indirect costs.
    (c) For construction grants, grantees shall request prior approval 
promptly from the Bureau for budget revisions whenever:
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the grant-supported programs.
    (2) The revision increases the budgeted amounts of Bureau funds 
needed to complete the project.
    (d) When the Bureau awards a grant which provides support for both 
construction and nonconstruction work, the Bureau may require, in the 
grant agreement, the grantee to request prior approval before making any 
fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.
    (e) For both construction and nonconstruction grants, the Bureau 
shall require tribal grantees to notify the Bureau promptly whenever the 
amount of Bureau authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the 
grantee by more than $5,000 or 5 percent of the Bureau grant, whichever 
is greater. This notification will not be required when applications for 
additional funding are submitted for continuing grants.
    (f) When requesting approval for budget revisions, grantees shall 
use the budget forms which were used in the grant application. However, 
grantees may request by letter the approvals required by the provisions 
of appendix A of this part.
    (g) Within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request for 
budget revisions, the Bureau shall review the request and notify the 
grantee whether or not the budget revisions have been approved. If the 
Bureau does not reach a decision prior to the end of the 30-day period 
or should the grantee not be notified of the Bureau's decision by the 
end of the 30-day period the grantee may appeal directly to the 
Commissioner.


<R05>
Sec. 276.15  Grant closeout.

    (a) In closing out Bureau grants, the following shall be observed:
    (1) Upon request, the Bureau shall make prompt payments to a grantee

[[Page 831]]

for allowable reimbursable costs under the grant being closed out.
    (2) The grantee shall immediately refund to the Bureau any 
unencumbered balance of cash advanced to the grantee.
    (3) The Bureau shall obtain from the grantee within 90 days after 
the date of completion of the grant all financial, peformance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. The Bureau may grant 
extensions when requested by the grantee.
    (4) The Bureau shall make a settlement for any upward or downward 
adjustments to the Federal share of costs after these reports are 
received.
    (5) The grantee shall account for any property acquired with grant 
funds, or received from the Government in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 276.11.
    (6) If a final audit has not been performed before the closeout of 
the grant, the Bureau shall retain the right to recover an appropriate 
amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs 
resulting from the final audit.
    (b) Suspension. When a grantee has materially failed to comply with 
the terms and conditions of a grant, the Bureau may after reasonable 
notice to the grantee, suspend the grant. The notice preceding 
suspension shall include the effective date of the suspension, the 
reasons for the suspension, the corrective measures necessary for 
reinstatement of the grant, and, if there is no immediate threat to 
safety, a reasonable time frame for corrective action prior to actual 
suspension. No obligations incurred by the grantee during the period of 
suspension shall be allowable under the suspended grant, except that the 
Bureau may at its discretion allow necessary and proper costs which the 
grantee could not reasonably avoid during the period of suspensions if 
such costs would otherwise be allowable under the applicable cost 
principles specified in appendix A of this part. Appropriate adjustments 
to the payments under the suspended grant will be made, either by 
withholding the payments or by not allowing the grantee credit for 
disbursements which he may make in liquidation of unauthorized 
obligations he incurs during the period of suspension. Suspensions shall 
remain in effect until the grantee has taken corrective action to the 
satisfaction of the Bureau or given assurances satisfactory to the 
Bureau that corrective action will be taken, or until the Bureau cancels 
the grant.
    (c)(1) Cancellation for cause. The Bureau may cancel any grant in 
whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever 
it is determined that the grantee has:
    (i) Materially failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
grant;
    (ii) Violated the rights or endangered the health, safety, or 
welfare of any persons;
    (iii) Been grossly negligent in or has mismanaged the handling or 
use of funds provided under the grant.
    (2) When it appears that cancellation of a grant shall become 
necessary, the Bureau shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of 
this possibility. This written notice shall advise the grantee of the 
reason for the possible cancellation and the corrective action necessary 
to avoid cancellation. The Bureau shall also offer, and provide if 
requested by the grantee, any technical assistance which may be required 
to effect the corrective action. The grantee shall have 60 days in which 
to effect this corrective action before the Bureau provides notice of 
intent to cancel the grant as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Upon deciding to cancel for cause, the Bureau shall promptly 
notify the grantee in writing of that decision, the reasons for the 
cancellation, and the effective date. The Bureau shall also provide a 
hearing for the grantee before cancellation, as provided in Sec. 
272.51. However, the Bureau may immediately cancel the grant, upon 
notice to the grantee, if the Bureau determines that continuance of the 
grant poses an immediate threat to safety. In this event, the Bureau 
shall provide a hearing for the grantee within ten (10) days of 
cancellation.
    (4) Payments made to grantees or recoveries by the Bureau under 
grants cancelled for cause shall be in accordance with the legal rights 
and obligations of the parties.
    (d)(1) Cancellation on other grounds. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c) of

[[Page 832]]

this section, grants may be cancelled in whole or in part only as 
follows:
    (i) By the Bureau with the consent of the grantee, in which case the 
two parties shall agree upon the cancellation conditions, including the 
effective date, and in the case of partial cancellation, the portion to 
be cancelled; or
    (ii) By the grantee, upon written notice to the Bureau, setting 
forth the reasons for the cancellation, the effective date, and, in the 
case of partial cancellation, the portion to be cancelled.
    (2) When a grant is cancelled in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section, the grantee shall not incur new obligations for the 
cancelled portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many 
outstanding obligations as possible. The Bureau shall allow full credit 
to the grantee for the Bureau share of the noncancellable obligations 
properly incurred by the grantee before cancellation.

Sec. 276.16  Subgrants and subcontracts to non-profit organizations.

    The uniform administrative requirements in this part, including the 
cost principles in appendix A, to this part, are applicable to all 
subgrants or subcontracts made by a grantee in accordance with the 
provisions of this chapter. However, these requirements and cost 
principles are applicable as minimum standards for subgrants or 
subcontracts made to nonprofit organizations. Accordingly, the grantee 
may prescribe additional or more stringent requirements with regard to 
subgrants or subcontracts made to non-profit organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 276.17  Printing.

    As permitted by paragraph 36-2(c) in the Government Printing and 
Binding Regulations (October 1974, No. 23), published by the Joint 
Committee on Printing (JCP), printing required by a grantee in 
performing work under a grant is considered ``incidental printing'' 
(e.g., material which the grantee needs to use to respond to the terms 
of the grant). Whenever the incidental printing is likely to exceed the 
exclusions in paragraphs 36-3 and 36-4 of the Joint Committee on 
Printing (JCP) Printing and Binding Regulations, specific provisions on 
printing as may be required shall be included in the grant agreement. 
Grantees shall be given the option of using sources other than the 
Government Printing Office for incidental printing.

<R05>
Sec. Appendix A to Part 276--Principles for Determining Costs Applicable 
                                to Grants

                             part i--general

    A. Purpose and scope. 1. Objectives. This attachment sets forth 
principles for determining the allowable costs of programs administered 
by grantees under grants from the Bureau. The principles are for the 
purpose of cost determination and are not intended to identify the 
circumstances or dictate the extent of Bureau and tribal participation 
in the financing of a particular grant. They are designed to provide 
that Bureau assisted programs bear their fair share of costs recognized 
under these principles, except where restricted or prohibited by law. No 
provision for profit or other increment above cost is intended.
    2. Policy guides. The application of these principles is based on 
the fundamental premises that:
    a. Grantees are responsible for the efficient and effective 
administration of grant programs through the application of sound 
management practices.
    b. The grantee assumes the responsibility for seeing that Bureau 
assisted program funds have been expended and accounted for consistent 
with underlying agreements and program objectives.
    c. Each grantee organization, in recognition of its own unique 
combination of staff facilities and experience, will have the primary 
responsibility for employing whatever form of organization and 
management techniques may be necessary to assure proper and efficient 
administration.
    3. Application. These principles will be applied by the Bureau in 
determining costs incurred by grantees under Bureau grants (including 
subgrants, contracts by grantees and subcontracts).
    B. Definitions. 1. Approval or authorization of the Bureau means 
documentation evidencing consent prior to incurring specific cost.
    2. Cost allocation plan means the documentation identifying, 
accumulating, and distrtibuting allowable costs under grants and 
contracts together with the allocation methods used.

[[Page 833]]

    3. Cost, as used herein, means cost as determined on a cash, 
accrual, or other basis acceptable to the Bureau as a discharge of the 
grantee's accountability for Bureau funds.
    4. Cost objective means a pool, center, or area established for the 
accumulation of cost. Such areas include organizational units, 
functions, objects or items of expense as well as ultimate cost 
objectives including specific grants, projects, contracts, and other 
activities.
    5. Federal agency means any department, agency, commission, or 
instrumentality in the executive branch of the Federal Government which 
makes grants to grantees.
    6. Grant means an agreement between the Bureau and a grantee whereby 
the Bureau provides funds or aid in kind to carry out specified 
programs, services, or activities. The principles and policies stated in 
this appendix as applicable to grants in general also apply to any 
Federally sponsored cost reimbursement type of agreement performed by a 
grantee, including contracts, subcontracts and subgrants.
    7. Grant program means those activities and operations of the 
grantee which are necessary to carry out the purposes of the grant, 
including any portion of the program financed by the grantee.
    8. Grantee means the entity which is responsible for administration 
of the grant.
    9. Services, as used herein, means goods and facilities, as well as 
services.
    10. Supporting services means auxiliary functions necessary to 
sustain the direct effort involved in administering a grant program or 
an activity providing service to the grant program. These services may 
be centralized in the grantee department or in some other agency, and 
include procurement, payroll, personnel functions, maintenance and 
operation of space, data processing, accounting, budgeting, auditing, 
mail and messenger service, and the like.
    C. Basic guidelines. 1. Factors affecting allowability of costs. To 
be allowable under a grant program, costs must meet the following 
general criteria:
    a. Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
administration of the grant program, be allocable thereto under these 
principles, and, except as specifically provided herein, not be a 
general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of a 
grantee.
    b. Be authorized or not prohibited under applicable laws or 
regulations.
    c. Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these 
principles, Federal laws, or other governing limitations as to types or 
amounts of cost items.
    d. Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that 
apply uniformly to both Federally assisted and other activities of which 
the grantee is a part.
    e. Be accorded consistent treatment through application of generally 
accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances.
    f. Not be allocable to or included as a cost of any other Federally 
financed program in either the current or a prior period.
    g. Be net of all applicable credits.
    2. Allocable costs. a. A cost is allocable to a particular cost 
objective to the extent of benefits received by such objective.
    b. Any cost allocable to a particular grant or cost objective under 
the principles provided for in this appendix may not be shifted to other 
Federal grant programs to overcome funds deficiencies, avoid 
restrictions imposed by law or grant agreements, or for other reasons.
    c. Where an allocation of joint cost will ultimately result in 
charges to a grant program, an allocation plan will be required as 
prescribed in section I.
    3. Applicable credits. a. Applicable credits refer to those receipts 
or reduction of expenditure-type transactions which offset or reduce 
expense items allocable to grants as direct or indirect costs. Examples 
of such transactions are: purchase discounts; rebates or allowances; 
recoveries or indemnities on losses; sale of publications, equipment, 
and scrap; income from personal or incidental services; and adjustments 
of overpayments or erroneous charges.
    b. Applicable credits may also arise when Bureau funds are received 
or are available from sources other than the grant program involved to 
finance operations or capital items of the grantee. This includes costs 
arising from the use of depreciation of items donated or financed by the 
Bureau to fulfill matching requirements under another grant program. 
These types of credits should likewise be used to reduce related 
expenditures in determining the rates or amounts applicable to a given 
grant.
    D. Composition of cost. 1. Total cost. The total cost of a grant 
program is comprised of allowable direct cost incident to its 
performance, plus its allocable portion of allowable indirect costs, 
less applicable credits.
    2. Classification of costs. There is no universal rule for 
classifying certain costs as either direct or indirect under every 
accounting system. A cost may be direct with respect to some specific 
service or function, but indirect with respect to the grant or other 
ultimate cost objective. It is essential, therefore, that each item of 
cost be treated consistently either as a direct or an indirect cost. 
Specific guides for determining direct and indirect costs allocable 
under grant programs are provided in the sections which follow.
    E. Direct costs. 1. General. Direct costs are those that can be 
identified specifically with a particular cost objective. These costs 
may be charged directly to grants, contracts, or

[[Page 834]]

to other programs against which costs are finally lodged. Direct costs 
may also be charged to cost objectives used for the other ultimate cost 
objective.
    2. Application. Typical direct costs chargeable to grant programs 
are:
    a. Compensation of employees for the time and effort devoted 
specifically to the execution of grant programs.
    b. Cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically 
for the purpose of the grant.
    c. Equipment and other approved capital expenditures.
    d. Other items of expense incurred specifically to carry out the 
grant agreement.
    e. Services furnished specifically for the grant program by other 
agencies, provided such charges are consistent with criteria outlined in 
section G of these principles.
    F. Indirect costs. 1. General. Indirect costs are those (a) incurred 
for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective, 
and (b) not readily assignable to the cost objectives specifically 
benefited, without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. The 
term ``indirect costs,'' as used herein, applies to costs of this type 
originating in the grantee department, as well as those incurred by 
other departments in supplying goods, services, and facilities, to the 
grantee department. To facilitate equitable distribution of indirect 
expenses to the cost objectives served, it may be necessary to establish 
a number of pools of indirect cost within a grantee department or in 
other agencies providing services to a grantee department. Indirect cost 
pools should be distributed to benefiting cost objectives on bases which 
will produce an equitable result in consideration or relative benefits 
derived.
    2. Grantee departmental indirect costs. All grantee departmental 
indirect costs, including the various levels of supervision, are 
eligible for allocation to grant programs provided they meet the 
conditions set forth in this part. In lieu of determining the actual 
amount of grantee departmental indirect cost allocable to a grant 
program, the following methods may be used:
    a. Predetermined fixed rates for indirect costs. A predetermined 
fixed rate for computing indirect costs applicable to a grant may be 
negotiated annually in situations where the cost experience and other 
pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the 
contracting parties to reach an informed judgment (1) as to the probable 
level of indirect costs in the grantee department during the period to 
be covered by the negotiated rate, and (2) that the amount allowable 
under the predetermined rate would not exceed actual indirect cost.
    b. Negotiated lump sum for overhead. A negotiated fixed amount in 
lieu of indirect costs may be appropriate under circumstances where the 
benefits derived from a grantee department's indirect services cannot be 
readily determined as in the case of small, self-contained or isolated 
activity. When this method is used, a determination should be made that 
the amount negotiated will be approximately the same as the actual 
indirect cost that may be incurred. Such amounts negotiated in lieu of 
indirect costs will be treated as an offset to total indirect expenses 
of the grantee department before allocation to remaining activities. The 
base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be 
appropriately adjusted.
    3. Limitation on indirect costs. a. Bureau grants may be subject to 
laws that limit the amount of indirect costs that may be allowed. In 
this event, the Bureau will establish procedures which will assure that 
the amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such grant 
does not exceed the maximum allowable under the statutory limitation or 
the amount otherwise allowable under this appendix, whichever is the 
smaller.
    b. When the amount allowable under a statutory limitation is less 
than the amount otherwise allocable as indirect costs under this 
appendix the amount not recoverable as indirect costs under a grant may 
not be shifted to another Federally sponsored grant program or contract.
    G. Cost incurred by organizations other than the grantee. 1. 
General. The cost of service provided by other organizations may only 
include allowable direct costs of the service plus a prorata share of 
allowable supporting costs and supervision directly required in 
performing the service, but not supervision of a general nature such as 
that provided by the head of an organization and his staff assistants 
not directly involved in operations. However, supervision by the head of 
an organization whose sole function is providing the service furnished 
would be an eligible cost. Supporting costs include those furnished by 
other units of the supplying organizations.
    2. Alternative methods of determining indirect cost. In lieu of 
determining actual indirect cost related to a particular service 
furnished by another organization, either of the following alternative 
methods may be used provided only one method is used for a specific 
service during the fiscal year involved.
    a. Standard indirect rate. An amount equal to ten percent of direct 
labor cost in providing the service performed by another organization 
(excluding overtime, shift, or holiday premiums and fringe benefits) may 
be allowed in lieu of actual allowable indirect cost for that service.
    b. Predetermined fixed rate. A predetermined fixed rate for indirect 
cost of the unit or activity providing service may be negotiated as set 
forth in section F.2.a.
    H. Cost incurred by grantee for others. 1. General. The principles 
provided in section G will

[[Page 835]]

also be used in determining the cost of services provided by the grantee 
to another agency.
    I. Cost allocation plan. 1. General. A plan for allocation of costs 
will be required to support the distribution of any joint costs related 
to the grant program. All costs included in the plan will be supported 
by formal accounting records which will substantiate the propriety of 
eventual charges.
    2. Requirements. The allocation plan of the grantee should cover all 
joint costs of the grantees as well as costs to be allocated under plans 
of other agencies or organizational units which are to be included in 
the costs of federally sponsored programs. The cost allocation plans of 
all the agencies rendering services to the grantee, to the extent 
feasible, should be presented in a single document. The allocation plan 
should contain, but not neessarily be limited to, the following:
    a. The nature and extent of services provided and their relevance to 
the federally sponsored programs.
    b. The items of expense to be included.
    c. The methods to be used in distributing cost.
    3. Instructions for preparation of cost allocation plans. The 
Bureau, in consultation with the other Federal agencies concerned, will 
be responsible for developing and issuing the instructions for use by 
grantees in preparation of cost allocation plans.
    4. Submission of indirect cost proposal and negotiation of indirect 
cost rates.
    a. A grantee should submit its indirect cost proposal to the Federal 
agency which provides the largest dollar volume of contracts and grants. 
However, once a Federal agency has handled an indirect cost proposal, 
that same Federal agency should continue to act upon the proposal even 
though the preponderance of financial interest may have shifted to 
another Federal agency, and grantee shall not resubmit its indirect cost 
proposal to a second Federal agency.
    b. Where the grantee submits its proposal to the Department of 
Interior, the proposal should be sent by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to 
the cognizant Regional Office of the Department's Office of Audit and 
Investigation. The Office of Audit and Investigation is responsible for 
the audit and review of the proposals and negotiation of the indirect 
cost rates.
    c. Grant administrators officers will usually, but are not required 
to, accept indirect cost rates negotiated by other Federal agencies.
    d. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will provide technical assistance in 
developing indirect cost proposals, if needed.

              Part II--Standards for Selected Items of Cost

    A. Purpose and applicability. 1. Objective. This attachment provides 
standards for determining the allowability of selected items of cost.
    2. Application. These standards will apply irrespective of whether a 
particular item of cost is treated as direct or indirect cost. Failure 
to mention a particular item of cost in the standards is not intended to 
imply that it is either allowable or unallowable, rather determination 
of allowability in each case should be based on the treatment of 
standards provided for similar or related items of cost. The 
allowability of the selected items of cost is subject to the general 
policies and principles stated in part I of this appendix.
    B. Allowable costs. 1. Accounting. The cost of establishing and 
maintaining accounting and other information systems required for the 
management of grant programs is allowable. This includes cost incurred 
by central service agencies for these purposes. The cost of maintaining 
central accounting records required for overall tribal government 
purposes, such as appropriation and fund accounts by the Treasurer, 
Comptroller, or similar officials, is considered to be a general expense 
of government and is not allowable.
    2. Advertising. Advertising media includes newspapers, magazines, 
radio and television programs, direct mail, trade papers, and the like. 
The advertising costs allowable are those which are solely for:
    a. Recruitment of personnel required for the grant program.
    b. Solicitation of bids for the procurement of goods and services 
required.
    c. Disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the 
performance of the grant agreement.
    d. Other purposes specifically provided for in the grant agreement.
    3. Advisory councils. Costs incurred by grantee advisory councils or 
committees established pursuant to Bureau requirements to carry out 
grant programs are allowable. The cost of like organizations is 
allowable when provided for in the grant agreement.
    4. Audit service. The cost of audits necessary for the 
administration and management of functions related to grant programs is 
allowable.
    5. Bonding. Costs of premiums on bonds covering employees who handle 
grantee funds are allowable.
    6. Budgeting. Costs incurred for the development, preparation, 
presentation, and execution of budgets are allowable. Costs for services 
of a central budget office are generally not allowable since these are 
costs of general government. However, where employees of the central 
budget office activity

[[Page 836]]

participate in the grantee budget process, the cost of identifiable 
services is allowable.
    7. Building lease management. The administrative cost for lease 
management which includes review of lease proposals, maintenance of a 
list of available property for lease, and related activities is 
allowable.
    8. Central stores. The cost of maintaining and operating a central 
store's organization for supplies, equipment, and materials used either 
directly or indirectly for grant programs is allowable.
    9. Communications. Communication costs incurred for telephone calls 
or service, telegraph, teletype service, wide area telephone service 
(WATS), centrex, telpak (tie lines), postage, messenger service and 
similar expenses are allowable.
    10. Compensation for personal services. a. General. Compensation for 
personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, 
for services rendered during the period of performance under the grant 
agreement, including but not necessarily limited to wages, salaries, and 
supplementary compensation and benefits. The costs of such compensation 
are allowable to the extent that total compensation for individual 
employees: (1) Is responsible for the services rendered, (2) follows an 
appointment made in accordance with tribal government ordinances and 
rules and which meets Federal merit system or other requirements, where 
applicable; and (3) is determined and supported as provided in b., 
below. Compensation for employees engaged in federally assisted 
actvities will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is 
consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the 
tribal government. In cases where the kinds of employees required for 
the federally assisted activities are not found in the other activities 
of the tribal government, compensation will be considered reasonable to 
the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the 
labor market in which the employing government competes for the kind of 
employees involved. Compensation surveys providing data representative 
of the labor market involved will be an acceptable basis for evaluating 
reasonableness.
    b. Payroll and distribution of time. Amounts charged to grant 
programs for personal services, regardless of whether treated as direct 
or indirect costs, will be based on payrolls documented and approved in 
accordance with generally accepted practice of the tribal government. 
Payrolls must be supported by time and attendance or equivalent records 
for individual employees. Salaries and wages of employees chargeable to 
more than one grant program or other cost objective will be supported by 
appropriate time distribution records. The method used should produce an 
equitable distribution of time and effort.
    11. Depreciation and use allowance. a. Grantees may be compensated 
for the use of their own buildings, capital improvements, and equipment 
through use allowances or depreciation. Use allowances are the means of 
providing compensation in lieu of depreciation or other equivalent 
costs. However, a combination of the two methods may not be used in 
connection with a single class of fixed assets.
    b. The computation of depreciation or use allowance will be based on 
acquisition cost. Where actual cost records have not been maintained, a 
reasonable estimate of the original acquisition cost may be used in the 
computation. The computation will exclude the cost or any portion of the 
cost of buildings and equipment donated or borne directly or indirectly 
by the Federal Government through charges to Federal grant programs or 
otherwise, irrespective of whether title was originally vested or where 
it presently resides. In addition, the computation will also exclude the 
cost of land. Depreciation or a use allowance on idle or excess 
facilities is not allowable, except when specifically authorized by the 
grantor Federal agency.
    c. Where the depreciation method is followed, adequate property 
records must be maintained, and any generally accepted method of 
computing depreciation must be consistently applied for any specific 
asset or class of assets for all affected Federally sponsored programs 
and must result in equitable charges considering the extent of the use 
of the assets for benefit of such programs.
    d. In lieu of depreciation, a use allowance for buildings and 
improvements may be computed at an annual rate not exceeding two percent 
of acquisition cost. The use allowance for equipment (excluding items 
properly capitalized as building cost) will be computed at an annual 
rate not exceeding six and two-thirds percent of acquisition cost of 
usable equipment.
    e. No depreciation or use charge may be allowed on any assets that 
would be considered as fully depreciated, provided, however, that 
reasonable use charges may be negotitated for any such assets if 
warranted after taking into consideration the cost of the facility or 
item involved, the estimated useful life remaining at time of 
negotiation, the effect of any increased maintenance charges or 
decreased efficiency due to age, and any other factors pertinent to 
utilization of the facility or item for the purpose contemplated.
    12. Disbursing service. The cost of disbursing grant program funds 
by the Treasurer or other designated officer is allowable. Disbursing 
services cover the processing of checks or warrants, from preparation to 
redemption, including the necessary records of accountability and 
reconciliation of such records with related cash accounts.

[[Page 837]]

    13. Employee fringe benefits. Costs identified under a. and b. below 
are allowable to the extent that total compensation for employees is 
reasonable as defined in section B.10.
    a. Employee benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to 
employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as 
for annual leave, sick leave, court leave, military leave, and the like, 
if they are: (1) Provided pursuant to an approved leave system, and (2) 
the cost thereof is equitably allocated to all related activities, 
including grant programs.
    b. Employee benefits in the form of employers' contribution or 
expenses for social security, employees' life and health insurance 
plans, unemployment insurance coverage, workmen's compensation 
insurance, pension plans, severance pay, and the like, provided such 
benefits are granted under approved plans and are distributed equitably 
to grant programs and in other activities.
    14. Employee morale, health and welfare costs. The costs of health 
or first-aid clinics and/or infirmaries, recreational facilities, 
employees' counseling services, employee information publications, and 
any related expenses incurred, are allowable. Income generated from any 
of these activities will be offset against expenses.
    15. Exhibits. Costs of exhibits relating specifically to the grant 
programs are allowable.
    16. Legal expenses. The cost of legal expenses required in the 
administration of grant programs is allowable. Legal services furnished 
by the chief legal officer of a tribal government or his staff solely 
for the purpose of discharging his general responsibilities as legal 
officer are unallowable. Legal expenses for the prosecution of claims 
against the Federal Government are unallowable.
    17. Maintenance and repair. Costs incurred for necessary 
maintenance, repair, or upkeep of property which neither add to the 
permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended 
life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable.
    18. Materials and supplies. The cost of materials and supplies 
necessary to carry out the grant programs is allowable. Purchases made 
specifically for the grant program should be charged thereto at their 
actual prices after deducting all cash discounts, trade discounts, 
rebates, and allowances received by the grantee. Withdrawals from 
general stores or stockrooms should be charged at cost under any 
recognized method of pricing consistently applied. Incoming 
transportation charges are a proper part of material cost.
    19. Memberships, subscriptions and professional activities. a. 
Memberships. The cost of membership in civic, business, technical and 
professional organizations is allowable provided: (1) The benefit from 
the membership is related to the grant program, (2) the expenditure is 
for agency membership, (3) the cost of the membership is reasonably 
related to the value of the services or benefits received, and (4) the 
expenditure is not for membership in an organization which devotes a 
substantial part of its activities to influencing legislation.
    b. Reference material. The cost of books, and subscriptions to 
civic, business, professional, and technical periodicals is allowable 
when related to the grant program.
    c. Meetings and conferences. Costs are allowable when the purpose of 
the meeting is the dissemination of technical information relating to 
the grant program and they are consistent with regular practices 
followed for other activities of the grantee.
    20. Motor pools. The costs of a service organization which provides 
automobiles to grantees at a mileage or fixed rate and/or provides 
vehicle maintenance, inspection and repair services are allowable.
    21. Payroll preparation. The cost of preparing payrolls and 
maintaining necessary related wage records is allowable.
    22. Personnel administration. Costs for the recruitment, 
examination, certification, classification, training, establishment of 
pay standards, and related activities for grant programs, are allowable.
    23. Printing and reproduction. Cost for printing and reproduction 
services necessary for grant administration, including but not limited 
to forms, reports, manuals, and informational literature, are allowable. 
Publication costs of reports or other media relating to grant program 
accomplishments or results are allowable when provided for in the grant 
agreement.
    24. Procurement service. The cost of procurement service, including 
solicitation of bids, preparation and award of contracts, and all phases 
of contract administration in providing goods, facilities and services 
for grant programs, is allowable.
    25. Taxes. In general, taxes or payments in lieu of taxes which the 
grantee is legally required to pay are allowable.
    26. Training and education. The cost of in-service training, 
customarily provided for employee development which directly or 
indirectly benefits grant programs is allowable. Out-of-service training 
involving extended periods of time is allowable only when specifically 
authorized by the Bureau.
    27. Transportation. Costs incurred for freight, cartage, express, 
postage and other transportation costs relating either to goods 
purchased, delivered, or moved from one location to another are 
allowable.
    28. Travel. Travel costs are allowable for expenses for 
transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by 
employees who are in travel status on official business incident to a 
grant program. Such costs may be charged on an actual basis, on a per 
diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual costs

[[Page 838]]

incurred, or on a combination of the two, provided the method used is 
applied to an entire trip, and results in charges consistent with those 
normally allowed in like circumstances in non-Federally sponsored 
activities. The difference in cost between first-class air 
accommodations and less-than-first-class air accommodations is 
unallowable except when less-than-first-class air accommodations are not 
reasonably available.
    C. Costs allowable with approval of the Bureau. 1. Automatic data 
processing. The cost of data processing services to grant programs is 
allowable. This cost may include rental of equipment or depreciation on 
grantee-owned equipment. The acquisition of equipment, whether by 
outright purchase, rental-purchase agreement or other method of 
purchase, is allowable only upon specific prior approval of the Bureau 
as provided under the selected item for capital expenditures. The Bureau 
must obtain required Departmental clearances before such approval can be 
given.
    2. Building space and related facilities. The cost of space in 
privately or publicly owned buildings used for the benefit of the grant 
program is allowable subject to the conditions stated below. The total 
cost of space, whether in a privately or publicly owned building, may 
not exceed the rental cost of comparable space and facilities in a 
privately owned building in the same locality. The cost of space 
procured for grant program usage may not be charged to the program for 
periods of nonoccupancy, without authorization of the Bureau.
    a. Rental cost. The rental cost of space in a privately owned 
building is allowable.
    b. Maintenance and operation. The cost of utilities, insurance, 
security, janitorial services, elevator service, upkeep of grounds, 
normal repairs and alterations and the like, are allowable to the extent 
they are not otherwise included in rental or other charges for space.
    c. Rearrangements and alterations. Cost incurred for rearrangement 
and alteration of facilities required specifically for the grant program 
or those that materially increase the value or useful life of the 
facilities (section C.3.) are allowable when specifically approved by 
the Bureau.
    d. Depreciation and use allowances on publicly owned buildings. 
These costs are allowable as provided in section B.11.
    e. Occupancy of space under rental-purchase or a lease with option-
to-purchase agreement. The cost of space procured under such 
arrangements is allowable when specifically approved by the Bureau.
    3. Capital expenditures. The cost of facilities, equipment, other 
capital assets, and repairs which materially increase the value or 
useful life of capital assets is allowable when such procurement is 
specifically approved by the Bureau. When assets acquired with Bureau 
grant funds are (a) sold, (b) no longer available for use in a Federally 
sponsored program or (c) used for purposes not authorized by the Bureau, 
the Bureau's equity in the asset will be refunded in the same proportion 
as Bureau participation in its cost. In case any assets are traded on 
new items, only the net cost of the newly acquired assets is allowable.
    4. Insurance and indemnification. a. Costs of insurance required, or 
approved and maintained pursuant to the grant agreement, is allowable.
    b. Costs of other insurance in connection with the general conduct 
of activities is allowable subject to the following limitations:
    (1) Types and extent and cost of coverage will be in accordance with 
sound business practice.
    (2) Costs of insurance or of contributions to any reserve covering 
the risk of loss of, or damage to, Federal Government property is 
unallowable except to the extent that the Bureau has specifically 
required or approved such costs.
    c. Contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program approved 
by the Bureau are allowable to the extent that the type of coverage, 
extent of coverage, and the rates and premiums would have been allowed 
had insurance been purchased to cover the risks.
    d. Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible 
insurance (through an approved self-insurance program or otherwise) are 
unallowable unless expressly provided for in the grant agreement. 
However, costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal 
deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management 
practice, and minor losses not covered by insurance, such as spoilage, 
breakage and disappearance of small hand tools which occur in the 
ordinary course of operations, are available.
    e. Indemnification includes securing the grantee against liabilities 
to third persons and other losses not compensated by insurance or 
otherwise. The Bureau is obligated to indemnify the grantee only to the 
extent expressly provided for in the grant agreement, except as provided 
in d. above.
    5. Management studies. The cost of management studies to improve the 
effectiveness and efficiency of grant management for ongoing programs is 
allowable except that the cost of studies performed by agencies other 
than the grantee or outside consultants is allowable only when 
authorized by the Bureau.
    6. Preagreement costs. Costs incurred prior to the effective date of 
the grant, whether or not they would have been allowable thereunder if 
incurred after such date, are allowable when specifically provided for 
in the grant agreement.
    7. Professional services. Cost of professional services rendered by 
individuals or organizations not a part of the grantee is allowable

[[Page 839]]

subject to such prior authorization as may be required by the Bureau.
    8. Proposal costs. Costs of preparing proposals on potential Federal 
Government grant agreements are allowable when specifically provided for 
in the grant agreement.
    9. Tribal government officer salaries and expenses. Identifiable 
salary and expense costs incurred as a direct result of a tribal 
government officer's service to a grant program provided under this 
chapter are allowable subject to advance agreement with an approval by 
the Bureau. A general limitation in this regard is prescribed in section 
D.6.
    D. Unallowable costs. 1. Bad debts. Any losses arising from 
uncollectible accounts and other claims, and related costs, are 
unallowable.
    2. Contingencies. Contributions to a contingency reserve or any 
similar provision for unforeseen events are unallowable.
    3. Contributions and donations. Unallowable.
    4. Entertainments. Costs of amusements, social activities, and 
incidental costs relating thereto, such as meals, beverages, lodgings, 
rentals, transportation, and gratuities, are unallowable.
    5. Fines and penalties. Costs resulting from violations of, or 
failure to comply with Federal, State and local laws and regulations are 
unallowable.
    6. Tribal officer salaries and expenses. The salaries and expenses 
of tribal government officers are considered a cost of general tribal 
government and are unallowable except as prescribed in section C.9.
    7. Interest and other financial costs. Interest on borrowing 
(however requested), bond discounts, cost of financing and refinancing 
operations, and legal and professional fees paid in connection 
therewith, are unallowable except when authorized by Federal 
legislation.
    8. Underrecovery of costs under grant agreements. Any excess of cost 
over the Federal contribution under one grant agreement is unallowable 
under other grant agreements.


<R05>
      Sec. Appendix B to Part 276--Financial Reporting Requirements

    A. Purpose and scope. This appendix prescribes requirements for 
grantee to report financial information to the Bureau and to request 
advances and reimbursement when a letter-of-credit method is not used.
    B. Definitions. 1. Accrued expenditures. Accrued expenditures are 
the charges incurred by the grantee during a given period requiring the 
provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other tangible property received; 
(2) services performed by employes, contractors, subgrantees, and other 
payees; and (3) amounts becoming owed under programs for which no 
current services or performed are required.
    2. Accrued income. Accrued income is the earnings during a given 
period which is a source of funds resulting from: (1) Services performed 
by the grantee; (2) goods and other tangible property delivered to 
purchasers; and (3) amounts becoming owed to the grantee for which no 
current services or performance are required by the grantee.
    3. Disbursements. Disbursements are payments in cash or by check.
    4. Bureau funds authorized. Funds authorized represent the total 
amount of the Bureau funds authorized for obligations and establish the 
ceilings for obligation of Bureau funds. This amount may include any 
authorized carryover of unobligated funds from prior fiscal years.
    5. Obligations. Obligations are the amounts of orders placed, 
contracts and grants awarded, services received, and similar 
transactions during a given period, which will require payment during 
the same or a future period.
    6. Outlays. Outlays represent charges made to the grant project or 
program. Outlays can be reported on a cash or accrued expenditure basis.
    7. Program income. Program income represents earnings by the grantee 
realized from the grant-supported activities. Such earnings exclude 
interest income and may include, but will not be limited to, income from 
service fees, sale of commodities, usage or rental fees, sale of assets 
purchased with grant funds, and royalties on patents and copy-rights. 
Program income can be reported on a cash or accrued income basis.
    8. Unobligated balance. The unobligated balance is the portion of 
the funds authorized by the Bureau which has not been obligated by the 
grantee and is determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from 
the funds authorized.
    9. Unpaid obligations. Unpaid obligations represent the amout of 
obligations incurred by the grantee which have not been paid.
    C. Standard forms. 1. Only the following forms will be authorized 
for obtaining financial information from grantees for grant programs:
    a. Financial Status Report. (1) The Bureau shall require grantees to 
use a standard Financial Status Report to report the status of funds for 
all nonconstruction grant programs. The Bureau may, however, have the 
option of not requiring a Federal Status Report when a request for 
advance or reimbursement (paragraph 2a) is determined to provide 
adequate information to meet their needs, except that a final Financial 
Status Report shall be required at the completion of the grant when the 
Request for Advance or Reimbursement form is used only for advances.
    (2) The Bureau shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash 
or accrual basis. If the Bureau requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accouting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, 
the grantee should develop such information through an

[[Page 840]]

analysis of the documentation on hand or on the basis of best estimates.
    (3) The grant agreement shall determine the frequency of the 
Financial Status Report for each grant program considering the size and 
complexity of the particular program. However, the report shall not be 
required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than 
annually. Also, a final report shall be required at the completion of 
the grant.
    (4) The original and two copies of the Financial Status Report shall 
be submitted 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period. 
In addition, final reports shall be submitted 90 days after the end of 
the grant period or the completion of the project or program. Extensions 
to reporting due dates may be approved when requested by the grantee.
    b. Report of federal cash transactions. (1) When funds are advanced 
to grantees through letters of credit or with Treasury checks, each 
grantee shall submit a report of Federal Cash Transactions. The Bureau 
shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain 
disbursement or outlay information for each grant or project from the 
grantees.
    (2) The grant agreement may require forecasts of Federal cash 
requirement in the Remarks section of the report.
    (3) When practical and deemed necessary, the Bureau may require 
grantees to report in the Remarks section the amount of cash in excess 
of three days' requirements in the hands of subgrantees or other 
secondary recipients and to provide short narrative explanations of 
actions taken by the grantees to reduce the excess balances.
    (4) The Bureau shall accept the identical information from the 
grantees in a machine-usable format in lieu of the Report of Federal 
Cash Transactions.
    (5) Grantees shall submit the original and two copies of the Report 
of Federal Cash Transactions no later than 15 working days following the 
end of each quarter. For those grantees receiving annual grants 
totalling one million dollars or more, the Bureau shall require a 
monthly report.
    (6) The Bureau shall waive the requirement for submission of a 
Report of Federal Cash Transactions when monthly advances do not exceed 
$10,000 per grantee provided that such advances are monitored through 
other forms contained in this appendix or the grantee's accounting 
controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances.
    2. Except as noted below, only the following forms will be 
authorized for the grantees in requesting advances and reimbursements.
    a. Request for advance or reimbursement. (1) The ``Request for 
Advance or Reimbursement'' form is the standard form for all 
nonconstruction grant programs when letters of credit or predetermined 
automatic advance methods are not used. The Bureau, however, has the 
option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of an 
``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction 
Programs'' (paragraph 2b) and shall specify in the grant agreement.
    (2) Grantees shall be authorized to submit requests for advances or 
reimbursement at least monthly when letters of credit are not used. 
Grantees shall submit the original and two copies of a Request for 
Advance or Reimbursement.
    b. Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction 
Program. (1) The ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs'' form is the standard format to be used for 
requesting reimbursement for construction programs. The Bureau may, 
however, have the option of substituting a ``Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement'' form (paragraph 2a) in lieu of this form when the Bureau 
determines that the former provides adequate information to meet its 
needs as stated in the grant agreement.
    (2) Grantees shall be authorized to submit requests for 
reimbursement at least monthly when letters of credit are not used. 
Grantees shall submit the original and two copies of an ``Outlay Report 
and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs'' form.
    3. When the Bureau needs additional information in using these

Sec. 286.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part 286 is to prescribe the regulations and 
procedures under which non-reimbursable grants may be made to eligible 
applicants to stimulate and increase Indian entrepreneurship and 
employment through establishment, acquisition or expansion of profit-
making Indian-owned economic enterprises which will contribute to the 
economy of a reservation.


<R05>
Sec. 286.3  Eligible applicants.

    Applications for grants may be accepted only from individual 
Indians, Indian tribes, Indian partnerships, corporations or cooperative 
associations authorized to do business under State, Federal, or Tribal 
law. These applicants must have a form of organization acceptable to the 
Assistant Secretary and unable to meet their total financing needs from 
their own resources and by loans from other sources such as banks, 
Farmers Home Administration, Small Business Administration, Production 
Credit Associations, and Federal Land Banks. Associations, corporations 
or partnerships shall be at least fifty-one percent owned by eligible 
Indians or an eligible Indian tribe. This Indian ownership must actively 
participate in the management and operation of the economic enterprise 
by representation on the board of directors of a corporation or 
cooperative association proportionate to the Indian ownership which will 
enable the Indian owner(s) to control management decisions. The legal 
organization documents will provide for the number of Indians which are 
to be on the board of directors, how they along with other directors 
will be elected or appointed and qualifications required as a condition 
for becoming a member of the board of directors. The legal organization

and control from decreasing below fifty-one percent. Evidence of Indian 
ownership in a cooperative association or corporation will be evidenced 
by stock ownership, if stock is or has been issued, or by other evidence 
satisfactory to the Assistant Secretary. Partnerships will be evidenced 
by written partnership agreements which show the percentage of Indian 
ownership, role and authority in making management decisions in 
controlling the operation of the economic enterprise.


<R05>
Sec. 286.4  Eligible economic enterprises.

    An economic enterprise as defined in Sec. 286.1(k) is eligible to 
receive equity capital through non-reimbursable grants if it is or will 
be self-sustaining and profit-oriented and will create employment for 
Indians. In the case of Indian-owned cooperative associations, they must 
distribute or allocate profits for later distribution, to members who 
are patrons, unless prohibited from doing so by law.


<R05>
Sec. 286.5  Information collection.

    (a) The collections of information contained in Sec. Sec. 286.12 
and 286.22 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget 
under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1076-0093.

required to obtain a benefit in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1521.
    (b) Public reporting for this information is estimated to average 45 
minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data 
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send 
comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the

grant may be made only when in the opinion of the Assistant Secretary 
the applicant is unable to obtain adequate financing from other sources. 
Prior to making any grant, the Assistant Secretary shall assure that, to 
the extent practical, the applicant's own resources have been invested 
in the proposed project. The applicant shall not be required to invest 
own resources to the extent that they are already committed to endeavors 
deemed by the Assistant Secretary to be essential to the welfare of the 
applicant. If the information in an application, which must include 
personal financial statements, indicates that it may be possible for the 
applicant to obtain financing without a grant, the Assistant Secretary 
will require the applicant to furnish letters from two customary lenders 
in the area, if available, who are making loans for similar purpose, 
showing whether or not they will make a loan to the applicant for the 
total financing needed without a grant.
    (b) A grant may be made only to an applicant who is able to obtain 
at least 75 percent of the necessary financing from other sources.
    (c) No grant in excess of $250,000 may be made to an Indian tribe or 
in excess of $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, 
or cooperative association.
    (d) Revolving loan funds as prescribed in title I of the Indian 
Financing Act of 1974 and guaranteed or insured loans as prescribed in 
title II of said Act may not be used as the sources of the loan portion 
of the total financing requirement if financing from other governmental 
or institutional lenders is available on reasonable terms and 
conditions. If a loan is not available from other sources, guaranteed or 
insured loans under the provisions of title II of said Act may then be 
considered. If a guaranteed or insured loan is not available loans under 
the provisions of title I of said Act may then be considered. Applicants 
for a loan from either source must meet the eligibility requirements for 
such loans.
    (e) A grant will not be approved unless there is assurance the 
applicant can and will be provided with needed competent technical and 
management assistance commensurate with the nature of the enterprise to 
be funded and the knowledge and management skills of the applicant.
    (f) Grant funds may not be used for refinancing or debt 
consolidation unless approval is justified and required

advantage of the grant applicant.

Nevertheless, in certain circumstances a second grant may be made to 
applicants for a new project or expansion of the original project. An 
additional grant will not be approved for an economic enterprise 
previously funded under the provisions of title IV of the Indian 
Financing Act of 1974 except for expanding a successful enterprise, 
provided the total of grants made shall not exceed $250,000 to an Indian 
tribe and $100,000 to an Indian individual, partnership, corporation, or 
cooperative association.

applicant:
    (1) Has not complied with the reporting requirements in connection 
with the first grant, or
    (2) Has not followed the plan of operation, if any, developed for 
the management and operation of the economic enterprise, or
    (3) Did not follow and use the management and technical assistance 
furnished, or
    (4) Is in violation of one or more provisions of the loan agreement 
entered into between the applicant and the lender who furnished the loan 
portion of the financing in connection with the first grant.
    (i) An applicant for an expansion grant must meet the same 
eligibility requirements as an original applicant.
    (j) A grantee will be required to return all or a portion of the 
grant if the business or enterprise for which the grant was utilized is 
sold within three years of the date on which the grant was disbursed to 
the grantee, unless the proceeds from the sale are re-invested in a new 
business or business expansion which will benefit the Indian reservation 
economy. Such sale and re-investment must have the prior approval of the 
local agency superintendent. The grantee shall refund the lessor of the 
grant amount or a pro rata portion of sales proceeds. The pro rata 
portion of sales proceeds shall be based on the ratio of grant amount to 
its corresponding matching financing. The new business or business 
expansion utilizing such sale proceeds must meet the same criteria for 
eligibility as an original grant.

deposited in a joint account in a bank and disbursed as needed by the 
grantee. The terms of a lender's loan agreement may require the lender's

amount of the loan financing needed.

started, equipment purchased or other, within the time stated in the 
grant agreement. The Assistant Secretary may, if warranted by 
circumstances beyond the control of the grantee, extend the time to 
allow for initiation of the enterprise, provided there is assurance the 
enterprise will be initiated forthwith within the extended time period. 
The Assistant Secretary will notify the lender in writing

does not require financial statements, the grantee must prepare and 
furnish copies of comparative balance sheets and profit and loss 
statements to the Assistant Secretary.

systems which will appropriately show the status of the Indian Business 
Development Program at all times.

          allocation plan?

Sec. 290.12  What information must the tribal revenue allocation plan contain?

    (a) You must prepare a tribal revenue allocation plan that includes 
a percentage breakdown of the uses for which you will allocate net 
gaming revenues. The percentage breakdown must total 100 percent.

    (2) It must contain detailed information to allow the ABO to 
determine that it complies with this section and IGRA particularly 
regarding funding for tribal governmental operations or programs and for 
promoting tribal economic development.
    (3) It must protect and preserve the interests of minors and other 
legally incompetent persons who are entitled to receive per capita 
payments by:
    (i) Ensuring that tribes make per capita payments for eligible 
minors or incompetents to the parents or legal guardians of these minors 
or incompetents at times and in such amounts as necessary for the 
health, education, or welfare of the minor or incompetent;
    (ii) Establishing criteria for withdrawal of the funds, acceptable 
proof and/or receipts for accountability of the expenditure of the funds

of members. You must make sure that:

members ineligible to receive payments is reasonable and not arbitrary;
    (2) The distinction does not discriminate or otherwise violate the

                  SUBCHAPTER O_MISCELLANEOUS [RESERVED]

<R05>
Sec. Appendix to Chapter I--Extension of the Trust or Restricted Status 
                         of Certain Indian Lands

    This appendix contains citations of Executive orders and acts of 
Congress continuing the trust or restricted period of Indian land, which 
would have expired otherwise, within the several Indian reservations in 
the States named. The asterisk to the left of the name of a reservation 
indicates that the reservation is subject to the benefits of the Indian 
Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 461-479), 
as amended, and as therein provided the trust or restricted period of 
the land is extended indefinitely. Where the name of a reservation is 
not preceded by an asterisk, such reservation is not subject to the 
Reorganization Act and is not subject to the benefits of such indefinite 
trust or restricted period extension, but such reservation is dependent 
upon acts of Congress or Executive orders for extension of the trust or 
restricted period of the land.
    For the purpose of insuring the continuation of the trust or 
restricted status of Indian allotments within Indian reservations not 
subject to the Reorganization Act, Congress by the act of June 15, 1935 
(49 Stat. 378) reimposed such restrictions as may have been expired 
between the dates of June 18, 1934, and December 31, 1936.
